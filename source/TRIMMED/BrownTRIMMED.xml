<P>This course explores the history, legacy, and material presence of U.S.highways from the mid-twentieth to the present. Bridging diverse fields andways of knowing, from cultural history to road ecology, it endeavors to de-familiarize a ubiquitous feature of life and landscape in the contemporaryUnited States, the federal highway system, and invites students to criticallyre-encounter the same.
<P/>
We will practice seeing, hearing, and feeling the lively traces of humanand multi-species habitation in our midst. And we will consider the effectsof interstate roads across time and space; on societies, ecologies, andlandscapes.</P>

<P>AMST 1700X. Global Macho: Race, Gender, and Action Movies.</P>

<P>Carefully sifting through an oft-overlooked but globally popular genre - themuscle-bound action - this class asks: what sort of racial work does anaction movie do? What is the role of women in this genre? How shouldwe scrutinize these supposedly empty trifles of the global popular? Howshould we think critically about movies that feature - often without apology- a deep, dangerous obsession with masculinity, patriarchy, war, andlawlessness, with violence outside of civil society. In short, from Hollywoodto Hong Kong to Rio to Paris to Mexico City, what makes the action moviegenre tick?</P>

<P>AMST 1905O. Reading and Righting Histories of Violence.</P>

<P>This seminar proposes “histories of violence” as a useful framework tointerrogate the varied forms of violence that constitute Western liberalmodernity. These forms include systems of state power and imperialpractices; subjective violence through raced, gendered, and sexualizedhierarchies; and narrative violence that prevents histories and voices fromemerging through the erasure of archives and narrative silencing. Coursereadings consider ongoing local and transnational struggles to reckonwith the violent histories of slavery, empire, colonialism, nationalism,and democracy. They offer interdisciplinary models for researching andnarrating these histories. Class discussions with consider avenues forreckoning with histories of violence.</P>

In this course wewill look for skill captured in embodied knowledge, in the words, images,and videos of instruction manuals, and in the material culture of work. Wewill consider the context of skills: changing ideas about skill throughoutAmerican history and the ways in which race, gender, and ethnicity haveshaped the definition of skill and the nature of skilled work. Researchbased in primary sources, including students’ own skills, will lead tohistorical or ethnographic essays.</P>

<P>AMST 2220I. Skin Deep: Reading Race, Reading Form.</P>

<P>There is a movement away from symptomatic/paranoid readings ofliterature. In 2009, Stephen Best/Sharon Marcus pitched this in theircall for surface readings, which deals with what is manifest/present intexts, rather than the latent/concealed. I hope to get beyond politically-instrumental readings of literature/to thinking in a sustained fashion aboutlanguage/form/aesthetics of race. The seminar will divide between readinghistories/theories of race (obsession with physical variation as race andtechnologies of seeing that we use to read race)/working through a rangeof post-nationalist works of literature/sharpening our understanding ofreading as a mean-making event.

We will also bring in CRT“offshoots” such as TribalCrit, LatCrit, AsianCrit, and DisCrit. CRT positsthat racism is endemic to society, but that we must also remain committedto social justice and praxis. How do we navigate these tensions, use CRTto provide a toolkit for navigating scholarship, and work toward socialchange in the realms of race and racism?</P>

<P>AMST 2220R. Popular Music Studies.</P>

<P>This graduate seminar offers a critical exploration of interdisciplinaryscholarship on popular music and related cultural formations. Classreadings emphasize ethnographic approaches grounded in AmericanStudies, media studies, and ethnomusicology, alongside relevant bodiesof critical theory. We will consider production, circulation, and receptionpractices, and the ongoing erosion of the barriers separating thesedomains. Case studies foreground popular music scenes in the Americasand the UK—especially Afro-diasporic and Latinx genres and practices—but seminar discussions and student projects will range beyond theseareas. Major topics include musical subcultures; transnational circulation;club/dance music; listening practices; and genre-oriented units on hip-hopand norteño/Tejano.</P>

<P>Ethics, with its roots in classical imperial thought and premodern Europeanphilosophy, emphasized the aspirations to a “good life.” But recent ethicalresponses to racism, genocide, and dispossession are frequently spokenin terms of responsibility, radical difference, vulnerability, and hospitality.This course will introduce students to how these latter ideas might inform“ethical praxis” in Public Humanities, offering three case studies - amuseum to victims of political mass murder in Ethiopia, a destroyedJewish cemetery in Vienna, and two current projects in Providence - asexamples of ethically-informed public-facing work.</P>

<P>This course will decenter experiences and cultural expectations attendantto whiteness, cis-maleness, able-bodiedness, heterosexuality, andmiddle/upper-classness in the public humanities,and thereby explore thecontemporary problems and possibilities of intersectional approachesin the field. What do contemporary paradigms of “diversity,” “publicengagement,” and “cultural organizing” have to teach us about effectiveand ethical public humanities approaches? Do different, multiplymarginalized communities of affinity practice entirely different publichumanities?

However, contemporaryIndigenous communities have managed to reclaim and reshape educationfor Native youth, utilizing innovative methods and technologies, as wellas drawing upon generations of traditional and indigenous knowledgesto create environments that promote academic achievement alongsideculture. In this course we will focus on the ways Native communitiesare asserting their educational sovereignty, through culturally-relevant/responsive curriculums, language immersion schools, indigenous charterschools, traditional ecological and scientific knowledges, and more.</P>

One hundred and fiftyyears later, Asian Americans, now stereotyped as the “model minority,”are rendered invisible in current struggles for social justice. Yet as railroadworkers, laundrymen, farmworkers, draft resistors, sewing women andnurses, Asian Americans have left us a rich legacy of legal, social andpolitical activism.

<P>Mapping Violence is a research project that aims to expose interconnectedhistories of violence, the legacies of colonization, slavery, and genocidethat intersect in Texas in the early twentieth century. Although oftensegregated in academic studies, these histories coalesced geographicallyand temporally. Students in this course will learn interdisciplinary methodscombining ethnic studies, history, public humanities and the digitalhumanities to rethink the limits of archival research, historical narrative,and methods for presenting findings to public audiences. This researchintensive seminar will allow students to develop historical research skillsand to contribute original research to the Mapping Violence project.</P>

<P>In many Native American communities the push to &quot;eat local&quot; is oftenbased on reviving a traditional food culture as well as a way of promotingbetter health. This class explores the disparate health conditions facedby Native communities, and the efforts by many groups to address thesehealth problems through increasing community access to traditional foods,whether by gardening projects or a revival of hunting and fishing traditions.We will examine the ways in which Native food movements haveconverged and diverged from general American local food movements,and the struggles they often face in reviving treaty-guaranteed food ways.</P>

<P>Examines the role of the past in the present. Using examples from theU.S. and other parts of the world, we will look at how archaeologicalevidence is implicated in contemporary cultural and political issues.Students will learn that the past is not just the focus of archaeologists’interest and scientific inquiries, but is also a subject romanticized byantiquarians, mobilized in nation-building, marketed for profit, re-enactedas entertainment, consumed by tourists, and glorified in commemoration.Understanding these different and competing valuations, claims, and usesof the archaeological past will provide an introduction to why the pastmatters in the present and to the future. Enrollment limited to 19 first yearstudents.</P>

In addition to seeking to makearchaeology more inclusive of and responsible to Indigenous peoples,they seek to contribute a more accurate understanding of archaeologicalrecord. They thus do not reject science, but attempt to broaden it througha consideration of Indigenous epistemologies. This course covers topicsas the history of anthropological archaeology, Indigenous knowledgeand science, decolonizing methodologies, representational practices andNAGPRA.</P>

<P>ANTH 1750. Bioarchaeology and Forensic Anthropology.</P>

<P>Bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology have common methodologicalroots (human osteology) but are oriented to answer very differentquestions. Both are grounded in the anthropological sub-disciplines ofbiological anthropology and archaeology. The focus in bioarchaeologyis advancing our understanding of the human experience in the past.Bioarchaeologists study a range of topics including health, violence,migration, and embodiment. Forensic anthropology is a form of appliedanthropology that is employed to document and interpret human remainsin medico-legal contexts. The course will survey both fields whileinstructing in the methodologies and approaches of each. The coursecomplements The Human Skeleton (ANTH 1720).</P>

<P>This Senior Seminar capstone course is a critical look at the past, present,future of anthropology. The class proceeds from the premise that wemust know the history of our field in order to build a stronger discipline.It examines the contributions and missteps of past anthropologists.Among the key questions to address: What are the discipline’s aims andcontributions in the 21st century? Has the field successfully integrateddiverse voices and perspectives? Are their central theories and methodsthat have (and continue to) define the field? What does it mean to be ananthropologist?</P>

We then consider areas of active contemporaryresearch, including cognition and linguistic relativity, meaning andsemantics, pronouns and deixis, deference and register, speech actsand performativity, interaction, verbal art and poetics, reported speech,performance, and linguistic ideology.</P>

<P>APMA 0360. Applied Partial Differential Equations I.</P>

<P>This course builds on APMA 0350 which covers ordinary differentialequations and systems involving a single independent variable. We willlook at processes with two or more independent variables formulatedas partial differential equations (PDE) using concepts from multivariablecalculus. We will see how problems are described quantitatively as PDEs,how seemingly unrelated contexts can result in similar equations; anddevelop methods for solution using analytical, numerical or qualitativemethods. Contexts include first order equations; the second order waveequation and problems involving diffusion processes; steady statebalances for systems in two or three dimensions; together with insightsfrom theory.</P>

How has climate change affected the development of humansociety? How have people adapted to their environments in the past?What does &quot;sustainability&quot; mean over the long term? Environmentalarchaeology is the study of these questions through the use of scientifictechniques to analyze soils, plants, artifacts, and human and animalremains from ancient archaeological contexts. These methods will beintroduced with an eye toward how they allow us to interpret human-environmental interactions in the past, as well as the present and future.</P>

<P>Infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide,and this burden is disproportionately borne by children living in low- andmiddle-income countries. Thus management of infectious disease remainsa critical intellectual challenge in the 21st century. This course will developand apply ecological and evolutionary theory to infectious microbes (andtheir hosts) via the detailed examination of a number of case studies.This will be accomplished by a combination of lectures, discussions,and readings drawn mainly from the primary literature. Assessment willbe based on biweekly problem sets, two midterms and one final exam.Expected: BIOL 0200 or equivalent.</P>

<P>BIOL 1865. Toxicology.</P>

<P>Toxicology is the science that describes the adverse biological effectsof exogenous chemical and physical stressors, including environmental,industrial, and agricultural chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This coursewill introduce the principal biological processes that determine anorganism’s response to a toxicant, including absorption, distributionthrough a biological system, metabolism, elimination, and effects at thesite(s) of action. We will discuss modern challenges in toxicology, suchas assessing toxicity of mixtures and testing some of the thousands ofuntested chemicals in commerce. The material will be presented in lectureand student-led discussions, with readings from the toxicology literature.Suggested prerequisites include BIOL 0280 (biochemistry), CHEM 0350(organic chemistry), and BIOL 800 (principles of physiology); or BIOL1820 (Environmental Health and Disease) or BIOL 2860 (MolecularMechanisms of Disease); or instructor approval.</P>

<P>BIOL 2350. The Biology of Aging.</P>

<P>Studying the mechanisms underlying the process of aging promises tobe one of the next frontiers in biomedical science. Understanding thebiology of aging is important for the long-term possibility of increasing lifespan, and for the immediate benefits it will have on age-related diseases.As demographics of industrialized countries have changed, age-relateddiseases such as cancer/cardiovascular/stroke, osteoporosis/arthritis/Alzheimer's have assumed epidemic proportions. Understanding theaging process is a pre-requisite for designing interventions for treatment.Focus is on examining the biology of aging through the examinationof a molecular/cellular/genetic and demographic nature. Suggestedprerequisites: BIOL 0200, 0280, 0470, 0800. Enrollment limited to 20.Advanced undergraduates with permission of instructor.</P>

<P>NEUR 1040. Introduction to Neurogenetics.</P>

<P>Recent advances in molecular biology and molecular genetics haveallowed researchers to test specific hypotheses concerning the geneticcontrol of behavior and neurological disease. This course will familiarizeyou with the relatively new and exciting field of neurogenetics. We willcover basic topics, new ideas, and unsolved problems in neurogeneticsprimarily through the two assigned texts. However, neurogenetics isessentially a “frontier” area in neuroscience, and the best way to approachthis topic is by scientific literature, which will be covered in some lectures.</P>

<P>The CHEM 0332 tutorial program offers students the opportunity to masterthe concepts taught in the fall semester CHEM 0330: Equilibrium, Rateand Structure course by focusing on active problem solving. Studentswho struggle in the fall CHEM 0330 course may be invited to join thetutorial program. Students accepted into the tutorial program begin byreviewing compound and reaction stoichiometry at the beginning of thespring semester. Tutorial students enroll in CHEM 0332 during the springsemester to complete their studies of equilibrium, acid-base equilibria,thermodynamics, atomic and molecular structure and kinetics. Studentsin the CHEM 0332 tutorial program complete weekly problem sets duringthe spring semester and participate in two mandatory, regularly scheduledproblem sessions during each week of the spring semester.
<P/>
To qualify for consideration, the student must be struggling in the midtermexams and on track to pass the laboratory. Accepted students receivea grade of incomplete for the Fall CHEM 0330 course. Upon successfulcompletion of the CHEM 0332 tutorial program in the spring semester,the incomplete in Fall CHEM 0330 is replaced by the student’s tutorialprogram grade.

Still Greek. Math? Technology?Gym? You guessed it. Since we cannot escape the Greeks, in this classwe will be on the lookout for them, reading the first classics of Westernliterature and discussing the great ideas behind them.

<P>Ever since Pausanias the Periegete wrote his &quot;Description of Greece&quot;in the 2nd century CE, travelers have been inspired both to see thesights of Greece and to narrate their travels. The subject of this courseis travel narratives about Greece, and our own journey will lead us tosites throughout the country. Yet we will also be using these narratives aslaunchpads for exploring the imaginary and imagined power of the Greeklandscape: from its ancient status as seat of the gods to its modern appealas a land of anonymity, relaxation and freedom for the wearied 'westerner'.</P>

<P>CLAS 0750. Gender and Sexuality in Classical Antiquity.</P>

<P>This course will analyze women in classical Greek and Roman societyand literature. Using gender as a critical tool, we will examine Greekand Roman women in various sources, from Homeric epics and publicinscriptions to scathing Roman satire. These sources show how theGreeks and Romans defined normative gender categories and how theyused these categories as a vehicle for social and political criticism. Wewill cover both social history and gender discourse, focusing especially onthe body and sexuality as a site for power. The limitations imposed by thesource materials, both literary and non-literary, will be a topic of discussionthroughout, as well as the relation of these ideas to contemporaryconstructions of gender.</P>

<P>What do video vixens and Foxy Brown have in common with &quot;WitchyWoman&quot;? These modern metaphors continue a long history of equatingfemale sexual allure with dangers found in/or capable of subvertingNature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make senseof similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how dothe Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class,and/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categorieshelp distinguish what is &quot;natural&quot; from &quot;unnatural&quot;? To what end doesthis discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or otheraspects of &quot;civilization&quot;?</P>

<P>Traces the evolution of social conflict and political factions at Rome fromthe foundation to the dissolution of the Republic (C5-C1 BCE). Romanarmies secured a vast empire of territory, raw materials, and manpowergoverned by the senate and the people of Rome itself. The influx ofresources, however, destabilized Rome’s constitution and upset politicalpower balances at the city of Rome. How did the Romans—elites andmasses—compete amongst themselves for the bounty of empire abroadand confront their own internal conflicts at home? Was concord possible,or were the developments of empire inconsistent with the constitution ofthe Republic?</P>

<P>CLAS 1120U. The American Presidents and the Western Tradition.</P>

<P>We are accustomed to engaging the American presidency as a publicoffice best approached through the prism of government or politicalscience, but this course studies the ways in which the presidents inthought and action are part of a larger continuum of humanistic expressionin the western tradition. It is organized around five categories: memory,language, consolation, farewell, and self-reflection. Our work involvesreading and viewing/listening to various materials, including videos andoriginal documents. The words we study, both by and about presidents,will be compared to various masterworks of Greco-Roman antiquity andthe western Middle Ages.</P>

<P>Once thought of as the &quot;Dark Ages,&quot; this period of western Europeanhistory should instead be seen as a fascinating time in which late Romanculture fused with that of the Germanic tribes, a mixture tempered by anew religion, Christianity. Issues of particular concern include the symbolicconstruction of political authority, the role of religion, the nature of socialloyalties, and gender roles.</P>

<P>From the end of the Bronze Age to the end of the Persian Wars is a periodof considerable change in the Mediterranean and beyond. The Greek polischallenges the powers of the ancient Near East. Over seven centuries wemeet Greek writing, Homeric epic, and the first historian (Herodotus). Butthe Greek world lay on the edges of the Ancient Near East and this coursetries to offer a more balanced approach than the typically Hellenocentricperspective of the standard textbooks. CLAS 1210 addresses political,social and economic history. Literary, epigraphical and archaeologicalcultures provide the evidence.</P>

<P>(1) We examine theater and its relation to society, particularly, its reflectionof legal culture (detections of murderers, adulterers, and young lovers);we also examine law’s ‘theatricality’ (‘productions’ of trials). (2) We alsoexplore more broadly how dramas were performed, using as comparandaJapanese Noh and Kabuki (in each, for example, we find all-male casting).(3) Attention is also directed toward twentieth century receptions of theseplays; we focus largely on Japanese productions, particularly of YukioNinagawa, mastermind of Japanese theater who directed numerous Greektragedies and Shakespearean plays in different venues, absorbing andsubverting phenomena of traditional Japanese theater.</P>

<P>The figure of the dying god (like Adonis, Osiris, or Attis), embodyingboth beauty and tragedy, has exerted a fascination from ancient times tothe present day. His worship was sometimes central to the community,sometimes marginal, yet compelling in its &quot;outsider&quot; status. His mythsinvited meditations on love and death in various modes from comedy toepic. This course, through the great mythological texts of Greece andRome as well as modern literature and art, will explore the figure in all itsvariety, along with Christian adaptations and recent interpretations.

<P>GREK 1111F. The Greek Chorus.</P>

<P>One of the most striking features of Greek drama is the presence of achorus whose members dance, sing, and contribute to the dramatic actionin ways that puzzle modern audiences. Besides the drama, chorusesare also found in other genres: in victory odes for champions of athleticcompetitions, in hymns to gods and goddesses, and in other forms suchas the dithyramb. In this class, we will read a representative selection ofchoral lyric, from Alcman to Aristophanes, including major figures such asPindar, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.</P>

<P>This course reflects on the concept of virtue, which was one of the mainconcerns of philosophy and education for a long time, but seems to havepractically disappeared from today's public discourse. We'll read in Greekselections from two essays: Philo of Alexandria's On the Virtues andPlutarch's On the Virtue of Women. Philo (c. 20 a.C.- c. 46 d.C.) is acrucial figure in the tradition of Biblical exegesis and Plutarch (c. 46 d.C.-c. 120 d.C.) was regarded as a major authority down to the nineteenthcentury. Both writers are now the focus of intense scholarly attention.</P>

<P>Why do the material remnants of classical antiquity still attract publicattention and exercise symbolic power? Why have such monumentsbeen &quot;used&quot; by authorities and diverse social groups in the service ofoften totalitarian agendas? What are the cases where these monumentsoperate as weapons for resistance? How has colonial, racial, and nationalmodernity shaped the way we understand and experience the materialityof the classical?

<P>CLPS 1370. Pragmatics.</P>

<P>Any time we utter a sentence in conversation, the perceived meaningof that sentence interacts with the discourse context in a rich variety ofways. On the one hand, aspects of a sentence's meaning are ``filled in''or enriched by the prior conversation as well as non-linguistic context. Onthe other hand, utterances shape the future of the conversation in variousways too. This course is an introduction to the scientific study of suchphenomena. Specific topics include: presupposition, implicature, speechacts, deixis, anaphora, (in)definiteness, and information structure.</P>

<P>CLPS 1660. Learning Compositional Language.</P>

<P>Babies come into the world not knowing a word. Within three years, theyknow enough of their first language to understand the difference between,&quot;your doll is a toy&quot; and &quot;the stove is not a toy&quot;. By age five, they can’t yetbe trusted to look both ways before crossing the road, but their language isclose to native adult speakers. How is this possible?
<P/>
This course looks at how children learn how language expresses meaning;how they go from understanding individual words to putting words togetherto compose and express complex, meaningful ideas – the development ofsyntax, semantics, and pragmatics.</P>

<P>The goal of this course is to explore emerging themes at the intersection ofpsychological science, business, and behavioral economics. Psychologistsare primarily interested in detecting limits to human rationality, whereaseconomics tends to proceed within the rational-actor model. In business,questions arise of how theoretical models and empirical findings relatedto the practice of managerial decision-making. Investigations of powerand the psychological impact of money are relatively recent additions tothe suite of research topics. New methodologies, such as neuro-imaginghave led to advances not represented in the traditional framework oforganizational psychology. Enrollment limited to 20 junior and seniorPsychology and Behavioral Decision Making concentrators.</P>

<P>Every city is a palimpsest in space and time. Calvino’s “Invisible Cities”of reputation and imagination and Miéville’s double-awareness in “TheCity and the City” provide points of entry to visualizations and narrationsof real and imagined urban centers. This course considers cities asvaried as Rome, Seville, Mexico City, and the City of God in literature,political and architectural treatises, maps, images, and archaeologicaland historical records. This multidisciplinary archive forms a basis forcollaborations in recovering and reconstructing built environments fromdifferent perspectives in text, image, and digital media, working withoriginal materials in special collections.</P>

<P>HMAN 2400W. The Visual Frequency of Black Life.</P>

<P>How does one represent black life? Historical and contemporary blackphoto books offer densely layered accounts of blackness and blacksociality that, far from restricted to the visual, are haptic and sonicengagements and improvisations. Placing these works in conversationwith sonic scripts, embodied performances, and moving images inspiredby and in dialogue with them, we will unpack multiple visual frequenciesof black life with an eye toward understanding practices of black refusaland futurity that structure their varied creative practices. This collaborativeseminar is taught in parallel by Tina Campt at Brown University andSaidiya Hartman at Columbia University.</P>

<P>HMAN 2400X. Premodern Art-Science, or the Work of Knowing inEurope before 1800.</P>

<P>This collaborative seminar examines premodern ways of knowing throughentangled histories of art, craft, science, and medicine in Europe before1800. Whether through the visual representations of naturalists or themanipulation of matter by artists/artisans to render nature meaningful,useful, or both, premoderns made knowledge in ways that defy moderndisciplinary divisions. In studying premodern knowledge work through itsown disciplinary understandings, we explore the research methodology ofreconstruction, i.e., the argument that we must reconnect material objectswith texts, and both with laboratory research practices, to fully understandpremodern knowledge work. Taught in parallel at the University ofMinnesota.</P>

<P>COLT 1431C. Poets, Poetry, and Politics.</P>

<P>The award of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature to Bob Dylan ignited alively debate about who is, and who is not, a poet. Historically, who weredeemed poets, what was their function? What do their poems do andhow do they work? Do they foment revolution or “make nothing happen,”as Auden once wrote? How does the poet aspire to a unique, individualvoice even as he or she may (be seen to) best represent a constituency?This course relates the poetic act to political action and interrogates thecommonly aired contention that politics makes for bad poetry.</P>

<P>COLT 1610V. The Promise of Being: Heidegger for Beginners.</P>

<P>“The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is,”Martin Heidegger writes, “that we are still not thinking.” Our undergraduateseminar will study, slowly and carefully, some of Heidegger’s mostfascinating and challenging paths of thinking, especially as they relateto questions of Being and our being-in-the-world. We will encounterhis unique engagements with art and literature, his critique of moderntechnology, his reflections on what it means to “dwell” somewhere, hisviews on finitude and death, and his notion of being “on the way” towardlanguage. No previous familiarity with Heidegger is assumed; curiousstudents from diverse fields welcome.</P>

<P>COLT 1814U. Politics of Reading.</P>

<P>What do we do when we read? And do we even do something, or, asBlanchot suggests, do we rather let be? While being true to Michel deCerteau’s plea for a “politics of reading” and an “autonomy of the reader”,we will question its binary logic (active vs. passive): 1. by looking closelyat the (de)construction of a “sovereign reader” in Hobbes’ Leviathan; 2.by analyzing the reading imperative—“Read!”—as it is staged in Plato’sand, above all, in Sade’s erotics; 3. by taking seriously Walter Benjamin’sparadoxical intuition that one should “read what was never written”.</P>

<P>COLT 2822A. War.</P>

<P>A century ago, the mass scale of modern industrial warfare seemed tomark a break in Western philosophy and literature. Innovative theoreticalanalyses and a new, self-conscious genre of “war poetry” emerged toengage with the consequences of the mass slaughter, concerned withsuch topics as nihilism, the limits of empathy, and the discontinuity ofexperience. These issues only intensified after the Second World Warand have remained pressing. We will read representative texts from theFirst World War to the present, exploring such issues as the linguisticrepresentation of war, the problem of visibility, and the civilian-militarydivide.</P>

Students taking thiscourse must first be selected as an undergraduate TA for a ComputerScience course, a course the student has taken and done well in. Studentswill work with the course's instructor on a variety of course-related topics,including preparation of material and development of assignments.Whether CSCI 0082 or its full-credit version (CSCI 0081) is taken is up tothe professor of the course being TA'd. Instructor permission required.</P>

<P>CSCI 0100. Data Fluency for All.</P>

<P>This course is intended to introduce Brown students to computationaltechniques that data scientists use to tell stories. Data fluencyencompasses both data literacy, the basics of statistics and machinelearning, and data communication, which relies heavily on principles ofdesign. Students will gain hands on experience using statistical toolssuch as 'R' to analyze real world data sets, and 'ggplot' to visualize them.Sample application domains include just about every field, since the onlyrequirement is data, which there almost always are (e.g., the completeworks of Shakespeare is a sample data set).</P>

<P>CSCI 0111. Computing Foundations: Data.</P>

<P>An introduction to computing and programming that focuses onunderstanding and manipulating data. Students will learn to writeprograms to process both tabular and structured data, to assess programsboth experimentally and theoretically, to apply basic data scienceconcepts, and to discuss big ideas around the communication and use ofdigital information.
<P/>
Designed for both concentrators and non-concentrators, this is the first inan eventual three-course introductory sequence leading into advancedCS courses. Programming assignments will be smaller scale than in CSCI0150/0170, thus allowing students time to practice programming anddiscuss computational ideas in a broader context.</P>

<P>CSCI 0170. Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction.</P>

<P>CSCI0170/0180 is an introductory sequence that helps students beginto develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to solve computationalproblems elegantly, correctly, efficiently, and with ease. The sequenceis unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programmingparadigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170;the second through Java in CSCI0180. The sequence requires noprevious programming experience. Indeed, few high school students areexposed to functional programming; hence even students with previousprogramming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part oftheir education.
<P/>

<P/>
Although students are taught to use programming languages as tools,the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. Onthe contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science ismuch more than programming! All of the following fundamental computerscience techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms,data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, andcollaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareasof computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic,natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180,from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/serverarchitectures.</P>

Deep leaning,plus the specialized techniques that it has inspired (e.g. convolutionalfeatures and word embeddings) have lead to rapid improvements in manyapplications such as computer vision, machine translation, and computerGo. This course intends to give students a practical understanding ofdeep learning as applied in these and other areas. It also teaches theTensorflow programming language for the expression of deep leaningalgorithms. (The primary API for Tensorflow is from Python.) This coursewill not accept override requests through C@B. Rather, we will be usingour own waitlist-management system.

<P>CSCI 2470. Deep Learning.</P>

<P>Deep learning is the name for a particular version of neural networks--a version that emphasizes multiple layers of networks. Deep leaning,plus the specialized techniques that it has inspired (e.g. convolutionalfeatures and word embeddings) have lead to rapid improvements in manyapplications such as computer vision, machine translation, and computerGo. This course intends to give students a practical understanding ofdeep learning as applied in these and other areas. It also teaches theTensorflow programming language for the expression of deep leaningalgorithms. A final project will implement an advanced piece of work in oneof these areas. Pre Requisites: A basic programming course: (CSCI 0150,0170 or 0190) A linear algebra course: (CSCI 0530, MATH 0520 or 0540)A stats / probability course: (CSCI 0220, 1450, 0450, MATH 1610, APMA1650 or 1655) This course will not accept override requests through C@B.Rather, we will be using our own waitlist-management system.

<P>Infrastructure! It’s the hardware and software that undergirdstransportation, energy, water, and health systems. This course askswhat we can learn about infrastructure when we approach it not as aneutral set of technologies but as a context-dependent social and politicalforce. Taking a critical approach to (among others) natural resources,global health, and development, the course will trace how infrastructureshave both served and obstructed colonial and contemporary projects forsocial change. The course will also take up the question of the future ofinfrastructure, including “green,” modular, and “off the grid” technologies.</P>

<P>This course teaches the mathematical skills useful for upper levelEconomics classes. Emphasis is on acquisition of tools, problem solving,intuition, and applications rather than proofs.
<P/>

<P/>
This course satisfies the mathematics requirement for the Economicsconcentration, but does not serve as a prerequisite for upper level coursesin Math, Applied Math, or other departments. Students planning furthercourses in those areas should take MATH 0100 or MATH 0170 (which alsosatisfy the Economics concentration requirement) instead. Ideally, ECON0170 should be taken before ECON 1110, or at least simultaneously.</P>

<P>ECON 1170. Welfare Economics and Social Choice Theory.</P>

<P>This is an advanced microeconomic theory class for undergraduates.Building on the intermediate microeconomics course, the approach ismore formal and mathematically more rigorous, presenting arguments andexpecting students to carefully develop techniques in order to understandand produce logical proofs. Topics include the efficiency and coalitionalstability properties of markets, as well as other mechanisms to allocateresources. Market failures are discussed, including advanced treatmentsof externalities, public goods, and asymmetric information. The secondpart of the course will discuss a number of topics in social choice theory,including different normative criteria of compensation, life and deathchoices, majority voting, Arrow’s impossibility theorem.</P>

<P>ECON 1200. History of Economic Thought.</P>

<P>This course covers the history of modern (20th century) economics andeconomic thinking from the marginal revolution through the first half of the20th century. The aim will be to develop an understanding of the originand evolution of central concepts in economic theory, including subjectiveutility, marginal analysis, competitive markets, examine methodologicaldisputes over positivism and formalism, and the development of generalcompetitive equilibrium. We will consider the emergence of certainsubfields in modern economics, and end with a discussion of therelevance of these ideas for economics in the 21st century.

First, we reviewwhen and why the markets fail, competing policy solutions (e.g., cap-and-trade), and cost-benefit analysis. Second, we survey methods toquantify the benefits of environmental regulations, including revealed andstated preference methods, a primer on climate-economy modeling, anda real-world application in a class research project. Third, we study thecosts of environmental regulations. We conclude with advanced policyconsiderations (e.g., trans-boundary pollutants), private market solutions/corporate social responsibility, and select special topics (e.g., resourcesand economic development).</P>

<P>ECON 1486. The Economic Analysis of Political Behavior.</P>

<P>Slow economic growth, controversial policy, and over a decade ofcontinuous war have led many to question the extent to which governmentis a force for the common good. Blame is often assigned to specificpoliticians or ideological perspectives. Public choice economics insteadanalyzes the incentive structure within which political decisions take place,seeking to uncover the forces guiding the behavior of voters, legislators,judges, and other political agents. This course will examine the insightsand limitations of the public choice perspective in the context of electoralpolitics, legislation, bureaucracy and regulation, and constitutional rules.</P>

<P>ECON 1820. Theory of Behavioral Economics.</P>

<P>This course provides a formal introduction to behavioral economics,focusing mostly on individual decision making. For different choicedomains, we start by analyzing the behavior implied by benchmark modelsused by economists (e.g. rational choice, expected utility, exponentialdiscounting). Experimental and empirical evidence is then used to highlightsome limitations of these models, and to motivate new models thathave been introduced to account for these violations. We will cover, forinstance, models of limited attention, non-expected utility, and hyperbolicdiscounting.</P>

<P>ASYR 2430. Akkadian Historical Texts.</P>

<P>This course offers focused study of the most significant Akkadian historicaland chronographic texts from the second and first millennia BCE.Readings in cuneiform will come for the major genres of Mesopotamianhistory-writing found at sites throughout the ancient Near East, includingcommemorative inscriptions, annals, chronicles, literary historical texts,and historical miscellanea. We will contend with the disjunctions betweenancient and modern modes of historical thinking and work to contextualizethe ancient texts. Knowledge of Akkadian cuneiform required. Readingknowledge of German and French will be useful but is not required.Intended primarily for graduate students.</P>

<P>EGYT 1495. The Science and the Medicine of the Ancient Egyptians.</P>

<P>This course presents a survey of the science and medicine of theancient Egyptians in light of the primary sources. Only fields of learningrepresented in some systematic way in the primary sources are deemedworthy of study, mainly four: mathematics, medicine, astronomy, andtime-reckoning. Zoology, botany, chemistry, architecture, etc., are notdiscussed. The Egyptians probably had some notion of the kinds ofknowledge on which these subjects focus. But no systematic treatment ofany survives in the extant sources and none probably ever existed. Thereare no prerequisites for this class.</P>

<P>Five decades of human activity in space has provided the worldcommunity with benefits including instant global communications andpositioning, human and robotic exploration of the moon, planets and sun,and a perspective of earth which continues to inform and influence ourrelationship with our environment.
<P/>

<P/>
Unlike other technical revolutions of the 20th century space has nottransitioned to a commercial, consumer market commodity. Rather itsusers and applications remain primarily large and institutional.
<P/>

<P/>
To experience the challenges of engineering design and of changing anindustrial paradigm, we will work in one or several groups to identify ause of space, and a plan for its implementation, that could help transitionspace from its status as a niche technology. Through the process ofdesign, we will confront the technical, economic, societal and politicalbarriers to obtaining increased benefits from technologies in general,and space in particular, and to making new technologies beneficial to awider range of users.

<P>We will examine the assertion that most of the changes that haveimproved people's lives are essentially technological and then we will lookat the difficulties in creating sustainable and beneficial change. Topics ofinterest include unintended consequences, failure to consider local culture,and engineering ethics. Many, but not all, of the examples will have a thirdworld context.

Sales skills are essential.Entrepreneurs sell an intangible and must make it feel immensely tangible.Until company/product become tangible, sales responsibility never stops.Entrepreneurs are key sales figures and face of the company.</P>

<P>To improve human health, engineering and scientific discoveries must beexplored in the context of application and translated into human/societalvalue. Translational research is creating a fundamental change in theway basic science and engineering research has operated for decades,breaking down the literal and figurative walls that separate basic scientists/engineers and clinical researchers. Such discoveries typically begin at &quot;thebench&quot; with basic research--and in the case of medicine--then progress tothe clinical level, or the patient's &quot;bedside.&quot; This seminar course will utilizecase studies to demonstrate to students how the translational researchunfolds. Lectures will be delivered by clinicians, medical researchers,engineers, and entrepreneurs, with case studies focused on topics rangingfrom value creation, IRB, HIPAA, FDA approval, etc.</P>

We will beconcerned with literary writings that foreground the global struggle ofblack subjects to assert political agency in relation to Western imperialismand transatlantic slavery. Equally crucial will be a reconsideration of anestablished body of theoretical writings that conceive of diasporic modesof solidarity and cultural expression as alternatives to the black nationalistintellectual tradition.

<P>ENGL 2761J. Identity and Agency.</P>

<P>Any consideration of identity is bound to run up against the conceptof agency. Considering identity and agency as mutually constitutive,this course looks at identity's formation and reformation as a narrativeexperience and effect, examining its emergence on historical andaffective terrains. Approaching identity from a range of vantages(psychoanalysis, gender, history, law), we trace the ways that identitiesmight be consolidated into (or, alternatively, unravel) cultural, political,national, or social arrangements. Works by Woolf, Selvon, James WeldonJohnson, Christopher Isherwood, Proust, Fanon, Arendt, Freud, Winnicott,Butler. Enrollment limited to 15.</P>

It examines in what sense environmental and climate factorsmight be causally related to human movement. We will seek to understandthe fears of a future “climate refugee crisis,” and how states and securityregimes are already preparing for climate displacement. Furthermore,we will ask how migrant justice groups are challenging the closed-borderpolicies of many states in ‘the Global North’ as well as the global structuralinequalities that create the vulnerabilities that drive movement andmigration.</P>

<P>ENVS 0705. Equity and the Environment: Movements, Scholarship,Solutions.</P>

<P>The environmental justice movement emerged in the U.S. South from theobservation that African-Americans were more exposed to toxics thanwhites. It spurred decades of academic and activist efforts to understandand address the relationship between inequality and environment. Theissue has expanded around the world, and beyond unequal exposures to“bads”, to unequal access to “goods,” along lines of equity by race, class,gender, ethnicity, indigenous identity, and position in the global economy.Issues of assigning responsibility and applying theories of justice with legalinstruments have made environmental justice policy difficult.

<P>ENVS 1557. Birding Communities.</P>

<P>This seminar explores and builds communities around a charismaticand conspicuous class of animals: birds. The irony is that birds aremarvelously diverse and abundant, but birding is associated with a narrowand privileged sector of society. Course readings address the politicsof knowledge and modes of inclusion and exclusion in birding practice.While studying these hierarchies worldwide and historically, we create ourown community of knowledge and practice through a “birding buddies”program in a local urban school. Students will learn from interdisciplinaryscholarship, school children, and not least, the birds. History matters. Bewoke. Think globally. Bird locally.</P>

<P>The diminishing quantity and quality of the resources of the Earth carriesprofound implications for the fulfillment of human rights and aspirations.But even as we understand better the intrinsic interdependencies betweenhumans and the environment, policy gridlock persists. Indeed, thefindings of fundamental environmental science are regularly contestedon political grounds. The purpose of this course is to learn how to applyknowledge to map the relevant policy context in environmental issues, andto develop the tools and approaches to address any problem of decisionin the environmental arena more creatively, effectively, and responsibly.Enrollment limited to 10.</P>

<P>FREN 0820B. Qu’est-ce que l’identité?.</P>

<P>From the 17th century to modernity the question of identity has beenposed in various terms: philosophical (Descartes: &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;),political (Louis XIV: &quot;I am the state&quot;), and poetic (Rimbaud: &quot;I is another&quot;),before being determined in the contemporary context as a means of ethnicor gender identification. We will examine a series of historic (Descartes,Rimbaud) and more recent texts (Glissant, Duras, Daoud, Darrieussecq) inwhich the self is called critically into question, in order to better understandhow identity always stages a play of same and other.

<P>FREN 1140A. French Theory.</P>

<P>Something called both “French” and “theory” came ashore in the Anglo-American academic scene of the 1970s. Supposedly both impenetrableand hegemonic, it was seen to reconstitute what was discussed inprograms in literature and the social sciences, and how it was discussed.Today the shoreline of study in the humanities has been transformed, butFrench theory’s moment is presumed to have past. This course will tracethat history through key French texts (read in translation) written betweenthe 1960s and 1990s. Taught in English.</P>

<P>GNSS 1720. Technologies of/and the Body: Mediated Visions.</P>

<P>The relationship between body and machinery, technology and biologyis often thought in terms of the mechanical doll, the animated robot andother hybrid figures. Science fiction films for example offer double visionsof the gendered body: women are masters/slaves of the technology andstill symbolic bodies of biological surviving of the human species. Wewill explore mediated visions in films and other media of different kindsspanning a bridge between SciFi-films and performance art. We will alsostudy theoretical texts (Donna Haraway et al.) on the problem of themerging of technology and body.</P>

<P>GNSS 2000. Method, Evidence, Critique: Gender and SexualityStudies across the Disciplines.</P>

<P>Gender and Sexuality Studies is by its very nature transdisciplinary. Canwe speak of a single methodology that ties GNSS together? How mightscholars work on gender and/or sexuality while respecting disciplinaryboundaries and training? We will start with the premise that studiesin gender and sexuality are tied together by critique that questionsfoundational assumptions and takes account of its own position within agiven field of knowledge. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongsidedisciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, wewill investigate how critique operates and how standards of evidence aremarshaled in particular disciplines.</P>

<P>GNSS 2010M. The Question of Critique.</P>

<P>This course will explore the spaces and times of the work of critique. Areturn to the question is timely, for over the past two decades and in abroad range of disciplines we have witnessed what may be described asa sense of exhaustion or fatigue with “theory” and other forms of criticalwork. The course will ask what it means to speak of “limits” of critique:can critique be limited, and if so: how and why? It will also ask about thepolitical impact and stakes of critique in our contemporary moment.</P>

<P>The diminishing quantity and quality of the resources of the Earth carriesprofound implications for the fulfillment of human rights and aspirations.But even as we understand better the intrinsic interdependencies betweenhumans and the environment, policy gridlock persists. Indeed, the findingsof fundamental environmental science are regularly contested on politicalgrounds. The purpose of this course is to learn how to apply knowledge tomap the relevant policy context in environmental issues, and to developthe tools and approaches to address any problem of decision in theenvironmental arena more creatively, effectively, and responsibly.</P>

This seminar will follow traces of seductionin Esopian fables; in Ulysses’ encounter with the sirens (Homer, Kafka);in Orpheus’ songs (Vergil, Rilke); in Sheherazade; in excerpts fromCasanova’s Story of My Life; in Kierkegaard’s Diary of a Seducer; andin the (seductive) suggestion from a song by Bob Dylan: “Don’t followleaders, watch the parkin’ meters”.

<P>GRMN 1340W. Writing Revolution.</P>

<P>How is revolution articulated, recorded, and scripted? The word &quot;re-volution&quot; implies a turning-again. Revolution, however, is also marked,from the French Revolution to the revolutionary movements of thetwentieth century, by a rhetoric of cutting, interrupting, and disjoining.Turning to the tropes of the turn and the cut for orientation, among others,this seminar will examine the modes by which revolutionary history iswritten from the eighteenth through the twentieth century. Readingsinclude works by Rousseau, Kant, von Arnim, Hölderlin, Büchner, Marx,and Luxemburg. In English.</P>

<P>Has literature ever really been monolingual? Has it not always spoken witha split tongue and a fractured voice, enabling it to move in the intersticesbetween languages, cultures, and identities? In this seminar, we examinesome authors from the twentieth century for whom speaking is alwaysspeaking otherwise: speaking about the other, speaking as other, assomething other than merely speaking. Our goal is to think beyond the‘monolingual paradigm’ and come up with ways to describe the richness oflinguistic multiplicity beyond the easy binaries of native vs foreign, self vsother.

<P>GRMN 1440S. Grimms' Fairy Tales.</P>

<P>&quot;One doesn't know the sorts of things one has in one's house,&quot; says theservant girl in Kafka's &quot;A Country Doctor,&quot; as a stranger, who will soonact violently towards her, emerges on all fours from an unused sty. Theprecarious moment of finding more than one seeks in one's midst isamong the key motifs of Grimms' &quot;Household Tales&quot; that we will trace,following the way they move writers of literature, psychoanalysis, andcritical theory. Reading the Grimms among others, we will find: whatwas &quot;once upon a time&quot; is not finished, nor can these uncanny tales bedomesticated.</P>

<P>GRMN 1441G. Städtebilder.</P>

<P>Cities mark sites of humans gathering and dwelling as political animals,bound to language. But while cities confirm this Aristotelian definition ofhuman beings, they also expose its vulnerability. Cities have to be foundedand surrounded by walls. They are in need of protection and driven bythe desire to expand. What’s in a city? The seminar follows this questionthrough the evocation of various cities and sites in texts by Hölderlin,Hebel, Heine, Stifter, Brecht and Benjamin; in photographs (of Paris) byEugène Atget; in films by Walter Ruttmann (on Berlin), and Wim Wenders(Paris, Texas).

<P>Scholars of literature, media, and aesthetics have weighed in from variousviewpoints on the question “What is a medium?” This seminar takes ahistorical approach by examining how the medium and mediality wereimagined prior to the 20th century. We will look at the history of thequestion itself: What was the “medium” for classical antiquity and the18th-century (two historical moments on which we will focus)? How didit emerge from discussions about moderation, mediocrity, or mediation?Discussions and readings in English; students also welcome to work withtexts in the originals.</P>

<P>GRMN 2661U. Passive Voices.</P>

<P>At the latest since Aristotle’s Peri hermeneias, there has been talk of thepathos of language: “There are symbols in the voice of the affections(pathémata) in the soul.” Those affections should be, Aristotle says, thesame for all humans, however divergent their voices. But upon thesepremises, the question would nonetheless arise: how might any passionbe addressed or ascertained in this way, if each affect would always differfrom any word that may be given of it? This course is devoted to thequestion of passion in language, with readings from Descartes, Spinoza,Büchner, and Musil, among others.</P>

It could blurdifferences even as it supposedly marked them.

<P>A specter haunts Latin America. The constitution of the nation-state inthe region after the Wars of Independence (1810-1830) entailed creatingfictions to include (and, naturally, exclude) those who belonged to thecommunity of the nation. Usually the left-outs were the ones who did notcomply with the profile of the desired citizen:lettered, male, white andurban. This course will focus on narrations about those ‘left-outs’ after theconstitution of the Nation-States in the region. We will read fictions aboutmad monster women, spectral slaves, bloodthirsty bandits, priests-turned-sorcerers, dwarfs, animal rebellions, and many other “exceptions to thenorm.” In Spanish.</P>

<P>HISP 1330X. The Nature of Conquest: Scientific Literatures of theAmericas.</P>

<P>Throughout history, conquest and colonization have implied different kindsof appropriations: control over new lands, new bodies, new languages.With the appropriation of new languages came the confrontation betweendifferent ways of organizing the world and, in particular, alternative waysof understanding humankind's relationship to nature. This course exploresthe scientific literatures that emerged in the wake of Spanish conquestand colonization of the Americas (1500-1800). These hybrid scientificliteratures, written in Spanish but also in Nahuatl, Maya, Quechua andgraphic forms, illustrate the lasting cross-pollination between Old and NewWorld notions about American nature.</P>

<P>HISP 1330Z. Tropical Fictions: Geography and Literature in LatinAmerican Culture.</P>

<P>Tropical nature in Latin America has been represented in conflicting ways:a place of leisure and sensuality, but also of depravity and sloth; a placeof infinite riches but also a space where disease and racial degenerationthrive. Tracing the variations and endurances of these tropes in 18th- to21st-century Western consciousness, this course aims to re-think thetropics in literature, film and the arts from a vantage point different to thatof temperate-climate European civilization. Readings include canonicalfictions such as La vorágine (1924), 19th-century European traveloguesfrom the region, as well as contemporary indigenous art.</P>

<P>HISP 1331E. Visions and Voices of Indigenous Mexico.</P>

<P>“In Mexico we are all mixed” goes a popular dictum, placing mestizajeat the core of what it means to be Mexican. One fifth of the population,however, self identifies as indigenous (pueblos originarios), and keepsexperiencing various forms of discrimination for not abiding by thedominant national discourse. HISP 1331E explores three pilars ofindigenous identity –land’s gifts, material culture and language– to inquirehow indigeneity has been deployed and reclaimed by indigenous groupsthrough time. Materials include pre-Hispanic and Colonial codices, muralsand objects, and present day literary works, music and cinema, with onehour of Nahuatl basics per week.</P>

We will explore poetry inspiredby artworks and by museums; stories that take place in museums; filmsthat show us the behind-the-scenes of institutions; theory that asks whatwe look at when we look at a collection.

<P>HISP 1371E. Cómo ser modernxs en América Latina.</P>

<P>This course zooms in on three moments when Latin American poetryexplicitly posed the question of how to be modern. We begin with a studyof modernismo, the turn-of-the-century movement which inscribed LatinAmerican poetry in the world while declaring literary independence.We next move to continent-wide avant-garde currents of the 1920swhich installed poetry at the heart of discussions about modernity andmodernism, in and across the arts. Finally, we explore experiments fromthe 1960s and 1970s which connected poetry to broader questions ofpolitics and society, without abandoning experiments in lyric form.</P>

<P>Capitalism didn't just spring from the brain of Adam Smith. Its logic is notencoded on human DNA, and its practices are not the inevitable outcomeof supply and demand. So how did capitalism become the dominanteconomic system of the modern world? History can provide an answer byexploring the interaction of culture and politics, technology and enterprise,and opportunity and exploitation from the era of the Atlantic Slave Tradeto the 2008 Financial Crisis.

In many times and places,changing what you eat is thought to be healing, while in other timesand places drugs – either remedial or recreational – are thought to bedistinct and more immediately restorative. Few human interactions withthe larger world are more important or interesting than how comestiblesand medicines have been discovered, mixed, transformed, distributed, andhow those processes have changed us.</P>

But it is also aproduct of settler colonialism, imperial expansion, and massive waves ofpopulation displacement that reorganized human societies along racializedand capitalist modes of inclusion and exclusion. This course seeks tounderstand the making of our current world from the conquest of the“Americas&quot; and the slave trade to industrialization and climate change.

<P>Colonial Latin America, from Columbus's voyage in 1492 to Independencein the nineteenth century, was the creation of three peoples: Europeans,Native Americans, and Africans. Spanish and Portuguese conquerorsbrought with them the world of the Crusades, the Inquisition, and theRenaissance. Native Americans lived there already, in rich empires andhunter-gatherer bands. Africans came as slaves from Senegal, Nigeria,Congo and Angola, bringing old traditions and creating new ones. Thesediverse peoples blended together to form a new people. This was a placeof violence, slavery and oppression -- but also of art, faith, new societies,new ideas. P</P>

<P>In 334 BCE, the 22-year-old Alexander crossed over to Asia and NorthAfrica perhaps already in his own mind to conquer the known world, thuschanging the history of the West forever. The values of a small, if intenselyintrospective, people (the Greeks) became the cultural veneer for much ofWest, as the period became known as the Hellenistic (“Greekish”) Age. Itled to the spread of a monotheistic idea, a profound belief in individualism,alienation from central power, and yet, conversely, the creation of naturallaw and human rights, along with a deep desire for universalism.

<P>Before the Spanish invaded in the 1530s, western South America was thescene of the largest state the New World had ever known, Tawantinsuyu,the Inca empire. During almost 300 years of colonial rule, the Andeanprovinces were shared by the &quot;Republic of Spaniards&quot; and the &quot;Republicof Indians&quot; - two separate societies, one dominating and exploiting theother. Today the region remains in many ways colonial, as Quechua- andAymara-speaking villagers face a Spanish-speaking state, as well as anever-more-integrated world market, the pressures of neoliberal reformfrom international banks, and the melting of the Andean glaciers.</P>

<P>This course will introduce students to the intellectual productions andtheoretical traditions of African American women. Focused on thecanonical texts of African American women, this class gestures towarddiaspora as well. Moving chronologically from the history of slavery tothe present will require that we simultaneously confront the question ofwhat counts as “intellectual” history. Thus even as we will read the writtenwords of black feminists across time, we will also call into question whatBarbara Christian calls “the race for theory,” turning also to resistancepractices, material culture, and bodily performance as sites of blackfeminist theorization.</P>

<P>HIST 1952A. World of Walden Pond: Transcendentalism as a Socialand Intellectual Movement.</P>

<P>This course examines the 19th century phenomenon ofTranscendentalism: this country’s most romanticized religious,philosophical, and literary movement. Focusing especially on Emerson,Thoreau, and Fuller, we’ll examine the ideas of the Transcendentalistsin the age of reform and evaluate the application of their principles toabolition, feminism, and nature. The central problem which they wrestledwith will be the focus, too, of our investigations: the tension betweenindividualism and conformity.</P>

<P>HIST 1961C. Knowledge and Power: China's Examination Hell.</P>

<P>For centuries a rigorous series of examinations requiring deep knowledgeof the Confucian Classics was the primary tool for the selection ofgovernment officials in imperial China. This system has been variouslycelebrated as a tool of meritocracy and excoriated as the intellectual“straightjacket” that impeded China’s entry into the modern world. Thisseminar examines the system and the profound impact it had, for betteror worse, on Chinese society and government in the early modern period,and the role that its successor “examination hell”—the gaokao or universityentrance examination—plays in society today.</P>

<P>In late imperial China, religion formed an intrinsic part of public life,from the cosmological ritual of the state to the constitution of family andcommunities of various kinds. This arrangement was challenged in thetwentieth century by the fall of the dynastic system and the introductionof new definitions of religion, modernity, sovereignty, and secularism. Wewill explore the ramifications of this change in greater China and its borderareas during the past hundred years, looking at how people have soughtto create a good public and the public good.

<P>This course explores alternatives to the common view that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a struggle between two nationalist movements over thesame land. Moving away from state-centric political discourse, it engagesthe questions of imperialism, settler-colonialism, and displacement froma bottom-up perspective of everyday life of Palestinian communities inhistoric Palestine and the Diaspora. How do these internally divided andspatially fragmented communities negotiate the present and imaginethe future? Ultimately, the course asks: What does it mean to be aPalestinian?

<P>HIST 1972G. Lesbian Memoir.</P>

<P>This course will introduce students to the intellectual productions andtheoretical traditions of African American women. Focused on thecanonical texts of African American women, this class gestures towarddiaspora as well. Moving chronologically from the history of slavery tothe present will require that we simultaneously confront the question ofwhat counts as “intellectual” history. Thus even as we will read the writtenwords of black feminists across time, we will also call into question whatBarbara Christian calls “the race for theory,” turning also to resistancepractices, material culture, and bodily performance as sites of blackfeminist theorization.</P>

<P>HIST 1974P. Modernity's Crisis: Jewish History from the FrenchRevolution to the Election of Donald Trump.</P>

<P>As the modern world developed and grew, the question of the Jews’place within it became increasingly important for the majority societiesand the Jews themselves to deal with. The solutions found have rangedfrom inclusion on equal terms through exclusion not only from society butfrom humanity altogether. In many ways, the debates around this issuehave touched on the very meaning of modernity itself. In this advancedundergraduate seminar, we will examine the ongoing polemics on theplace of the Jews from the perspectives of both the proponents of thedifferent solutions and the Jews themselves.</P>

<P>HIST 2971K. Slavery's New Materialisms.</P>

<P>This interdisciplinary seminar explores an emerging dynamic in SlaveryStudies: a move away from an older materialist history that foregroundedmodes of production, class struggle, and capitalist transformation; andtoward a new(er) materialism organized around human/non-humanentanglements and drawing on recent theoretical work on things,networks, and assemblages. Scholars are only beginning to weigh theimplications of this move for Atlantic Slavery, weighing the implicationsof non-human agency in a field predicated on the experiences andsubjectivities of black historical actors. This seminar will include graduatestudents at the coursework stage, as well as doctoral candidates,postdoctoral researchers, and faculty.</P>

<P>An overview of canonical and recent scholarship on the Middle East,beginning with neo-Orientalist and Modernization-theory writings that ruleduntil the early 1960s, then a consideration of two turns often in productivetension with each other: materialist approaches that lead to social historyand political economy, and discursive approaches that lead to culturaland post-colonial studies. We then consider works on the environmentand techno-politics, gender and sexuality, and law and society, amongothers. Throughout, we consider how theoretical trends in other disciplinesshaped the writing of history. Requirements include weekly essays, oralpresentations, and a literature review.</P>

<P>HIST 2981Q. Histories of Empire and Decolonization.</P>

<P>For most of history humans have not lived within neatly bound nation-states. Rather, empires often organized the political, economic andsocial lives of diverse peoples. But the age of empire came to a dramaticend by the middle of the twentieth century. How and why did this rapidtransformation occur and how have the legacies of colonialism continuedto shape former colonies and metropoles? This course, which examinestheories and case studies of empire and decolonization throughout thenineteenth and twentieth centuries, seeks to address these questions,through key concepts including racial difference, citizenship, self-determination, settler colonialism, nationalism, and decolonization.</P>

<P>The modern engagement with the many ways that we construct identityhas been matched by a similar wave of studies about identity constructionin the ancient world. In this course we will discuss the rise of “Judaism”and “Jewish identity” in the ancient period (looking at roughly 400BCE-200 CE), and compare it with the movement of the followers of Jesusas a negotiation of a new identity within Judaism (roughly 30 CE-200 CE).We will conclude with the question of the “Parting of the Ways” of thesetwo groups.</P>

<P>Traditional Jewish society was patriarchal, though the forms this powertook changed over time. It was also limited, even subverted, by variousroles played by women. Since Jewish family life was very much underthe control of Jewish women, the family was another place where womenwere able to wield power. Examining the history of gender and familyallows us to examine the limits of patriarchal control and construct a new,often surprising picture of how Jewish society actually functioned. It alsosheds new light on how the various forms of modern Jewish family werecognize today grew and developed.</P>

<P>LITR 1151N. Zoologic: Wild Animals in the Surveillance State.</P>

<P>This interdisciplinary course asks students to research and deeply engagewith the current status of wild animals in various states of surveillance(either through conservation and preservation, or for entertainment),trafficked for the pet trade, or living essentially as &quot;refugees&quot; in the humanworld. Original critical research will result in creative and collaborativeprojects. Site visits to animal sanctuaries, and lectures from peopleworking with animals in a number of disciplines will be featured. Selectionwill prioritize seniority and relevant experience (any discipline.)</P>

<P>LITR 1151O. Ideas of Narration Before Don Quixote.</P>

<P>We shall read fictional narratives (and some narrative poetry) from the firstmoments of preserved literature up to Don Quixote, for clues about howearlier writers thought about form and narration. Of what was narrativefashioned before “omniscience” was a relevant term? Before there wasa science of psychology that could speak to the protagonists? What canwe say about the diversity and unpredictability of early narrative writing,and how does that contrast with the more consistent look and feel of thenineteenth century? How can these “ancient fictions” inform an interest innarrative innovation and formal ingenuity today?</P>

<P>LITR 1151Q. Great Adventure.</P>

<P>This hybrid seminar/prose workshop will take you to Antarctica, Japan,France, Cambodia, outer space—and to other places too. But much ofyour writing will be about yourself. Your cross-genre wandering throughnovels, essays, and indefinable hybrid works by a fascinating list ofthinkers and stylists, will lead to questions about your own sense ofplace, belonging, contextual otherness, and the pleasures, powers andimplications of your gaze. You'll search for answers through the medium ofyour own creative work—lyric essays, fictional vignettes, pictures.</P>

<P>LITR 1151S. Fan_Fic.</P>

<P>Fan fiction is a thing, right? And, let's be honest, we all secretly love thiskinda thing! O, to relive those Microsoft '95 nights spent reading semi-romantic Legend of Zelda fan fiction... What compels us to reinvent thestories we're already attached to? The texts we might consider fan fictionexist on a spectrum somewhere between high literary and kitsch, betweenMilton and My Immortal. If not a proper genre, let's imagine that fan fictionis a particular (perhaps ancient) practice of literary mimesis. The questionis whether it's possible to create a wholly original derivative.</P>

This project-centeredworkshop is a cross-genre exploration of that filter, where participantsworking in differing genres will be asked to engage a wide range ofmaterials to “translate” into their art-making process. Please be preparedto write, dance, sing, mix, draw, ask, reach, and fail, in and out of yourcomfort zone. Individual and collaborative work expected.

<P>LITR 1152A. Survey of the Historic Avant-Garde.</P>

<P>The avant-garde is a famously slippery category; the definition we'll beworking from, more or less, is the series of movements and individualsfrom 1900 to 1940, based mostly in Europe, that led culture and the artsin directions that talked back to power, pushed aesthetic limits outward,and explored ways to give the arts social and political weight. While largelyfocused on writers, we'll also spend a lot of time with visual artists andother media and will address questions such the line between Modernismand the Avant-Garde and the roles of women in these movements.</P>

<P>LITR 1152B. Ekphrasis in Action.</P>

<P>Ekphrasis, according to its most basic definition, is simply poetry thataddresses art; we'll be stretching that definition, making it into a way ofinteracting with art and even into a way of looking at things in the worldthat makes them into art. We'll be visiting art in action, from paintingstudios to dance rehearsals to a natural history museum, using these visitsas premises for writing that we will then share in a workshop format, givingcopious feedback. The whole will be supported by readings of theoreticaland creative works that address ekphrasis.</P>

Colonialismis prefaced on construction of an “other.” Aimé Césaire refers to thisas “thingification,” whereby colonial subjects are dehumanized and thecolonizer “decivilized”. Totalizing dehumanizing forms are resisted bypraxes and epistemologies which challenge the prevailing symbolicorder and assert the humanity of those regarded as subhuman. We willexamine how epistemological and political contestations of the humaninform discourses on freedom and sovereignty and interrogate howvarious categories of identity refract and re-frame conceptions of humanity,freedom, and sovereignty.</P>

<P>This introductory course will explore its three key terms &quot;modern,&quot;&quot;culture,&quot; and &quot;media&quot; through a variety of theories, historical narratives,and media objects. We will ask how different media—including print,photography, cinema, television, digital art, online video, archival practices,and social media—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling,structure the ways we act and engage with the common world, andcommunicate and collaborate. We will read semiotic theory, criticalrace studies, feminist, post-colonial, queer and political theory, andexamine concepts such as textuality, visuality, and networks.

<P>MCM 0250. Visuality and Visual Theories.</P>

<P>How do we see the world? Not only through our own eyes but through theeyes of others and with the mediation of technologies, perspectives, andpoints of view, giving us an embedded language to interpret what we see.In the last centuries, this construction of our visual field has been heavilyindebted to imperial and racial capitalist modes of production. We willexamine these constructions through a variety of technological devices:the camera obscura, panorama, photography, and cinema, and their usein processes of colonization and decolonization, drawing on the case ofAlgeria and other cases as well.</P>

<P>MCM 0700B. Mediating the Live: Making and DocumentingPerformance Art.</P>

<P>This course focuses on performance art and how artists use recordingtechnologies to document their acts. We will look at key examples ofperformance art from the past five decades to understand how artistshave explored gesture, movement, conduct, speech, embodiment.Documentation is especially important to performance because of theephemeral nature of the art form. While the performance document isnot the same as the performance, it is central to our understanding ofthe medium and often intrinsic to the works themselves. Students willexperiment with various presentation platforms and recording technologiesto understand their relationship to performance art.</P>

<P>MCM 0902M. The end of politics as we know it? New Media &amp; PoliticalImagination.</P>

<P>Technical inventions have always spawned utopian visions of total socialamelioration, followed closely by dystopian fears and moral panics. Digitalinformation technologies are no different. Producing the full range ofreactions—from celebrations of “networked protests” to wild accusations of“fake news”—responses to today’s media environments proclaim the endof politics as we know it. Reading works by political theorists alongsidescholars of the digital, this course will question both triumphant digitalutopianism and fatalist assumptions of ubiquitous manipulation, andinstead engage in more complex readings of the ways media shapes andis shaped by subjects and communities alike.</P>

<P>What is a ‘black gaze’? The title of this course is a provocation that posesthe question of whether we can identify the existence of a black gaze,while asserting the transformative potential such a gaze both promisesand portends. Starting from a close examination of theories of the gaze,we will engage the relationship between contemporary black visuality andwhat constitutes a black gaze in the twenty-first century. Focusing on aselect group of black contemporary artists, we will explore how their workchallenges traditional notions of what constitutes the power/politics of thegaze.</P>

<P>This seminar explores histories of moving image and sound archives inrelation to social movements, technological change, and philosophies ofcultural memory and value that dictate the content of archives and shapeperceptions of their use value. We begin by exploring archives as physicalentities (buildings), structures of information (catalogs, databases, findingaids) and arbiters of meaning (collections). We also consider enterprisesthat increasingly present themselves as archives of our contemporaryselves and collective existence: Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube,Twitter. As well as exploring these issues historically and theoretically, wewill visit local archives and engage in hands on activities.</P>

<P>The films of Hitchcock bind together compelling narratives and meta-cinematic reflections by means of a single, distinctive shape or form.this method of construction has piqued the attention not only of cinematheorists, who look to Hitchcock to tell us about the nature of cinema andspectatorship, but also philosophers, who look to him to tell us about thenature of thinking, promising, doubting, and obsession.Examining the filmsthemselves, alongside the philosophical speculations they have inspired,we will try to define the complex pleasure -- cinematic and cerebral -- theyelicit.</P>

Restitution of discrete,“precious” objects, even of dozens of thousands of them, could not bethe end of processes of repair of worlds ruined by imperial domination butits beginning. In this seminar, we will ask what would it mean to includerepair and reparations in the discourse and practices of decolonisingthe museum.

Each year, the seminar will focus on a selected genre of visualtexts, artistic works, and/or embodied performances and use them todevelop an keen understanding of how black artists/thinkers/writers/practitioners articulate the multi-sensory frequencies of black life.

<P>MCM 1701E. Experimental Narrative.</P>

<P>With film well into its 2nd century, a large body of work has emergedthat plays with, around, and against conventions of classical cinema.Specifically, what we understand to be traditional narrative structures,such as drama, documentary, and action films. In fact, experimentalnarrative now has some of its own genres, which are to be found in bothmainstream and fringe media. The goal of this class is to investigatesome of these forms of experimental narrative. It is predicated on a basicunderstanding of narrative conventions, and designed to encouragestudents to make work that challenges those conventions.</P>

<P>Semiotics has taught us to regard each film as a text. What, then, is therole of written text in film? This advanced production seminar exploresthe interplay of film’s desire to image language and language’s desireto produce images, not to mention the temporal constraints placedon reading when it is no longer a private, self-regulated activity. Wewill consider text as a purely visual character, the impact of subtitles,television’s gluttonous use of text, and film’s appropriation of literary forms.In addition to screenings and readings, students will create their owninstantiations of written language in time-based art.</P>

<P>Inspired by Marilyn Strathern’s concept of ‘worlding,’ this productioncourse, will speculate on technologies of the future as a way to addressthe present. We’ll work in the game designing platform, Unity, AdobePremiere, and Photoshop to fabricate and co-create our worlds. Althoughnot a gaming course, tools, theories, and vernaculars of game design maybe utilized/subverted. Expect readings, discussions, technical workshops,and weekly assignments leading to a final project. “Art in the biological,ecological, and cyborg modes are all aspects of worlding. We cannotdenounce the world in the name of an ideal world” - Donna Haraway</P>

<P>The body - our biological corpus, and its social, environmental, andtechnological extension - grounds our ability to sense and make sense.In ever-changing ways, the sensing and acting body is extensible.Apparatuses, networks, patterns, and affects are central in sculptingconsciousness, addressability, and accountability. In contrast to DataVisualization, in which perspectival representations of data are arrangedand optically received, Data Visceralization foregrounds information viatranslations that are physically experienced. In this course, studentswill focus on climate change and will develop individual and collectivehypotheses, projects, and actions disrupting habitual procession andenabling active engagement.</P>

<P>MCM 2110T. The Contingency of Critique.</P>

<P>Contemporary debates about the nature and status, affects and effects, ofcritique resonate across the disciplines and beyond. They raise questionsof reading and form, ontology and determination, subjectivity and politics.This course takes the notion of surprise as one of the more consistentlycited values of the post-critical turn. On this view, critique is the enemy ofsurprise. Suspicious, dogmatic, grimly predictable: it is incapable of andhostile towards surprise. We will trace the emergence this account andthe work of surprise and its cognates (contingency, indeterminacy, play,discontinuity) in critical and postcritical texts.</P>

Historical and contemporary blackphoto books offer densely layered accounts of blackness and blacksociality that, far from restricted to the visual, are haptic and sonicengagements and improvisations. Placing these works in conversationwith sonic scripts, embodied performances, and moving images inspiredby and in dialogue with them, we will unpack multiple visual frequenciesof black life with an eye toward understanding practices of black refusaland futurity that structure their varied creative practices.

<P>MUSC 0021J. Stephen Sondheim and the American Musical.</P>

<P>This seminar considers the theater shows of Stephen Sondheim inrelation to the history of the American musical. Through close study ofselected scenes and shows, we examine how and why Sondheim andhis collaborators “reinvented” the genre. Special emphasis will be givento Sondheim's critical skepticism concerning the myths, characters, andethos of social optimism that have been central to the Broadway tradition.We examine links between the shows and post-WWII historical contexts,and consider the political implications of the circumscribed social universe—predominantly white, urban, and affluent—within which most of hisshows take place.</P>

<P>MUSC 0900. Haydn and Mozart.</P>

<P>This course explores the music of Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) andWolfgang Amadé Mozart (1756-1791): two remarkable composers, wholed powerfully contrasting but intertwined lives. Our focus will be Mozart’sthree operas that he produced with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte—LeNozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, Haydn’s twelve LondonSymphonies, and his grand oratorio, The Creation. Through these workswe can access a wealth of issues and themes of the late Enlightenmentstyle: questions of voice, affect, register, eighteenth-century listening,comedy, form, dance, naturalness, mimesis, the sublime, orchestral effect,and musical modernity.</P>

This seminar delves intothis diverse literature in order to think critically about the concept of timbreand the struggles to understand it.</P>

<P>We’ll concentrate on some fundamental moral and metaphysical issuesconcerning ourselves as persons: What (if anything) gives us a moralstatus different from that of other animals? Do we have the sort of free willrequired for us to be morally responsible for our actions? What makes youone individual person or self at a particular time? What makes you todaythe same individual person as that obnoxious 5-year old who went by yourname a few years back?</P>

<P>A topic of interest to philosophers has been the existence and nature ofcausal relations. Philosophers have asked what sorts of causal relations,if any, there are in the world and how human beings come to haveknowledge of them. In this course, we examine the main answers to theseand other questions that have been proposed by philosophers throughoutthe history of philosophy to the present. Throughout the course, studentswill be taught the principles of careful textual analysis, some of the basicpresuppositions of analytical philosophy, and how to present philosophicalarguments clearly, both orally and in writing.</P>

<P>This is an introductory course on aesthetics, giving an overview of thehistory of (western) aesthetics and of contemporary debates in analyticaesthetics. Among the historical figures to be read are Plato, Aristotle,Kant, Nietzsche, and Adorno. Some of the contemporary debatesconcern the right theory of art (representationalism, the expression theory,formalism), the definition of art, and the ontology of works of art. We willconsider some general criticisms of western aesthetics. Students will beintroduced to prominent positions in aesthetics, but they will also learnhow to engage in rigorous philosophical argumentation in the face of thosepositions.</P>

<P>Is it unjust that people in some countries have less wealth, worse health,etc., than those in other countries? Does this depend on whether thebetter off countries partly caused the disparity? Does it depend on whetherthe worse off are poor, or is it enough that they are relatively worse off?If there are global injustices, what obligations are there, and on whomdo they fall, to remedy them? We will study (mostly) recent philosophicalwork on such questions, including attention to special contexts such asimmigration, climate change, poverty, colonialism, secession, intervention,and war.</P>

<P/>
Towards the end, we'll also consider more general questions that anymoral theory faces. For instance: Does morality depend on God? Ismorality relative or subjective (whatever that's supposed to mean)? Andwhy should we care about being moral in the first place?</P>

(4) Is rationalbelief completely determined by evidence, or also by values or practicalinterests? (5) Are graded beliefs best seen as coming in precise degrees,or as more &quot;spread-out&quot;? (6) Can I have rational beliefs I know are deniedby others just as intelligent, unbiased, well-informed, etc., as I am?Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.</P>

And what can welearn from thinking about the skeptical position which claims that we’re notjustified in believing even the most ordinary things about the world aroundus?

<P>PHIL 2080L. Idealism in the Twentieth Century.</P>

<P>After attacks on Bradley and Royce at the beginning of the twentiethcentury, &quot;idealism&quot; largely became a dirty word. But while both Berkeleianand Hegelian versions of metaphysical idealism indeed passed out offashion, versions of Kantian epistemological idealism, the view that whatwe know of reality is inescapably formed by our own perceptual andconceptual frameworks, continued to underlie both analytic and continentalphilosophy. This course will pursue this thesis through works by Carnap,Cassirer, Collingwood, Blanshard, Sellars, Davidson, McDowell, andBrandom.</P>

<P>PHIL 2201. Aristotle's Psychology.</P>

<P>An investigation into Aristotle’s account of psychological phenomena inhis De Anima (On the Soul) and Parva Naturalia (especially On Dreams,On Memory, and Sense and Sensibilia). Topics include perception (boththe “special” perceptibles—like colour, sound, and smell—and also morecomplex perceptual experiences), thought, desire, emotion, memory,imagination, and dreaming. Additional questions include how thesephenomena fit into Aristotle’s metaphysical theory and challenges theymight be thought to offer to contemporary approaches in the philosophy ofmind.</P>

<P>PHYS 0100. Flat Earth to Quantum Uncertainty: On the Nature andMeaning of Scientific Explanation.</P>

<P>Physics has had a dramatic impact on our conception of the universe,our ideas concerning the nature of knowledge, and our view of ourselves.Philosophy, sometimes inspired by developments in physics, considersthe impact of such developments on our lives. In this seminar, studentswill explore how classical and modern physical theory have affected ourview of the cosmos, of ourselves as human beings, as well as our viewof the relation of mathematical or physical structures to 'truth' or 'reality.'Through a study of physics as well as selected philosophical readings,we will consider how we can know anything, from seemingly simple factsto whether a machine is conscious. Enrollment limited to 19 first yearstudents. Instructor permission required.</P>

<P>Energy plays fundamental roles in society. Its use underlies improvementsin the living standard; the consequences of its use are having a significantimpact on the Earth’s climate; its scarcity in certain forms is a source ofinsecurity and political conflict. This course will introduce the fundamentallaws that govern energy and its use. Physical concepts to be covered:mechanical energy, thermodynamics, the Carnot cycle, electricity andmagnetism, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics. Technologicalapplications include wind, hydro, and geothermal energy, engines andfuels, electrical energy transmission and storage, solar energy andphotovoltaics, nuclear reactors, and biomass.

<P>PHYS 0150. The Jazz of Modern Physics.</P>

<P>This course, aimed at both students in the humanities and sciences, willexplore the myriad surprising ways that jazz music is connected to modernphysics. No background in physics, mathematics or music is required, asall of these foundational concepts and tools will be introduced.
<P/>
The Jazz of Physics has three interconnected components:
<P/>
(1) Using concepts and analogies from music and acoustics to explorethe key conceptual ideas in modern physics such as quantum mechanics/information, general relativity, particle physics, dark energy and big bangcosmology.
<P/>
(2) Exploring the parallels between jazz and physics through the lens of20th century physics and jazz history, as well as key innovations in bothfields with an eye towards future innovations.
<P/>
(3) Students will learn the tools of signification in physics and developgroup projects with a final product.
<P/>
The course will consist of lectures, related homework sets, weeklydiscussion meetings, and a final study where groups of students will selecta topic of interest.</P>

<P>POLS 0820V. Land and Conflict.</P>

<P>This first-year seminar considers the connection between land and politicalconflict. Disputes over territory have been a primary cause of war forcenturies. Likewise, other types of conflicts over land continue to be amajor factor in political struggles worldwide. Why, how, and when doesterritory become the subject of violent—or non-violent—conflict? Theseminar will begin by thinking broadly about how land has factored intopolitical conflict, both historically and today, and then we will move on toa series of case studies of recent or ongoing conflicts, including Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, the South China Sea, the Arctic, and global farmland.</P>

To that end this course focuses on political movements ofcontemporary Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian). In addition to developinga fuller understanding of Indigenous political thought, this class alsoexplores what it means to move beyond colonial relationships with theState.</P>

For example, while governments are often cajoled and enjoined toproduce economic growth, especially during recessions, do somethingabout economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the lifechances of millions through purposive action, actually delivering thesethings is incredibly hard. These areas constitute ‘“hard problems” for twomain reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue abouthow to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful intereststhat like these areas of policy just as they are, and they work to keep them“hard problems.”</P>

<P>PHP 2445. Minding the Gap: The U.S. Healthcare Safety Net.</P>

<P>The right to access affordable, quality health care in the US is notguaranteed. During our nation’s history, a patchwork quilt of programs,referred to collectively as the safety net, has been crafted to addresshealth care needs for a wide range of people who fall through the cracks.This course examines its structure, function, and effects. We introducekey features of the safety net: access, cost, quality, and outcomes. Wepay particular attention to the nation’s largest program, Medicaid. Wehighlight the unique challenges facing vulnerable groups: legal and illegalimmigrants, homeless populations, veterans, and people with disabilities.</P>

<P>PHP 2730. Including the Excluded: Global Health Ethics.</P>

<P>This course explores the ethics of global public health engagement.Global health implementation is fraught with ethical conundrums. Theseethical conundrums include the process of generating rigorous evidence,championing health as a human right, engaging global partners inmeaningful collaborations, and implementing complex programs in low-resource settings. These ethical challenges are driven by North-Southinequities and by differences in socioeconomic backgrounds, culture,language, and other intersectional identities. This course introducesscholars to global health ethics as a framework for tackling healthdisparities, grappling in a scholarly and practical way with the complexfabric of global health research, policy, and practice.</P>

<P>PLCY 1802. Engaged Research Engaged Publics.</P>

<P>Policy problems are complex. Policy analysis and design is both a scienceand a craft. Increasingly, policymakers have begun to acknowledge thateffective policy research requires not only multiple methods of inquiry,but also interdisciplinary teams of social science researchers, citizens,designers, scientists, artists, consultants, and engineers, among otherexperts. Generating innovative policy solutions, from this approach, is nota straightforward, linear process, but instead a creative, collaborative, andengaged activity that requires not only iterative and dynamic researchmethods, but also storytelling, design, and other creative methods.</P>

<P>Why study food? What can food tell us about religion, politics, andculture? Food in South Asia often shapes identity, social status, ritualpurity, religious belonging, and political activism—the notion that you arewhat you eat has wide currency. Whatever form it takes, food embodieshistories of migration, trade, empire, colonialism, and ethics.

<P>RELS 1105. Kabbalah: An Introduction to Jewish Mysticism.</P>

<P>In the 12th and 13th centuries, new ways of approaching Judaism sprungup in France and Spain that would come to be known as “kabbalah.”These new approaches expressed aspirations for mystical illuminationand elaborated vast mythological narratives about divine and demonicbeings. The kabbalists radically departed from the then-conventionalunderstandings of Judaism, particularly those of philosophers likeMaimonides. However, they also claimed to find their new worldviewsin the tradition’s most ancient texts. This course will introduce studentsto kabbalah’s founding period, focusing on primary texts (in translation),especially the Zohar, the magnum opus of classical kabbalah.</P>

<P>RELS 1380C. Law and Religion.</P>

<P>In our arguably “post-secular” age, conflicts over the relationship betweenreligion and law have again moved to the forefront of internationaldebate. In a multicultural and globalized world, such conflicts oftenprovoke contestation over the very possibility of universal definitionsof either “religion” or “law,” let alone their proper relationship. Ourinterdisciplinary inquiries on these questions will include concrete legaldisputes in domestic and international courts; theoretical debates over theconstruction of “religion” in fields such as anthropology, religious studies,and philosophy; and historiographical controversies about the relationshipbetween “secularization” and sovereignty, particularly in light of the legacyof colonialism.</P>

<P>RELS 2600L. Seminar: Afro-Theism.</P>

<P>This graduate seminar places a theological lens on Black life in NorthAmerica. Its premise is that Afro-Theisms, not the institutional &quot;BlackChurch&quot; or Black prophetic religion, have been seminal to the self-conception of Black people and their way of constituting racial &quot;others&quot;.Different theistic emphasis at different historical moments demonstratesboth the importance and fluidity of Afro-Theisms and sheds unique lighton quest for equity and self-actualization. Starting with the conventionalChristian theologies into which New World Africans under slave conditionswere indoctrinated, this course will explore the role and impact of Afro-Theisms.</P>

We will start with the 1920s and 1930s, when the image of anew Moscow became closely associated with the creation of new socialistways of life, and conclude with the neoliberal facelift of the city in the post-Soviet period, retracing a history of 20th-century Russian culture throughits urban imagination.</P>

<P>SOC 0010. Social Forces: An Introduction to Sociology.</P>

<P>Social forces constrain and empower us, bond us together and pushus apart. Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small:nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. Howdo societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures sohard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why doinequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender?How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise tochallenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues andtopics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout thesocial sciences.</P>

<P>SOC 0250. An Environmental Sociology for a Rapidly Warming World.</P>

<P>Environmental problems are rooted in societies’ complex and changingrelationship with the natural world. Understanding those environmentalproblems, let alone solving them, requires careful investigation of nature-society interactions. Through lectures, readings, discussion, and writtenwork, students will examine the social and historical foundations ofcontemporary environmental problems and societal efforts to address orresolve those problems. Building on these foundations, we will explore thesocial dimensions of three (interrelated) “environmental grand challenges”:curbing climate change, preparing for and responding to environmentaldisasters, and building sustainable cities. Through all of these challenges,questions of environmental inequality and environmental racism loomlarge.</P>

<P>SOC 1010. Classical Sociological Theory.</P>

<P>Why do we follow social rules and conventions? And how is socialchange – that is, the making of new rules and expectations – possible?When we respond to rules, do we act as free-willing individuals or dowe follows social structures we have no control over? These questionshave motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the argumentshave been already developed by the four &quot;forefathers&quot; of sociology: KarlMarx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Georg Simmel. Looking at thetransformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the metropolitan, the decline of religion, andmuch more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understandourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic andsocial transformations around us.</P>

<P>SOC 1311. Micro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior inOrganizations.</P>

<P>Micro-Organizational Theory focuses on the human dynamics oforganizations as natural systems. It examines how individual attitudes,actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processesand outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-levelapproaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as theprimary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from aneconomic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of theorganization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from amacro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization'sroutines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions suchas, &quot;why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how doesthis affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, areindividuals affected by their organizations?&quot;</P>

<P>This course focuses on Providence and Rhode Island to look at theembeddedness of local lives in global social processes. Sociologyoften takes the nation as a bounded unit of analysis. Yet, the historyof the modern world is one of empires, colonialism and transnationalconnections. These global racial and colonial histories are frequentlyignored or silenced. This course seeks to question our sense of place inthe world: If we acknowledge that the world has always been global, howdoes that change our understanding of contemporary issues? How shouldwe rethink sociology to break with its colonial origins?</P>

<P>SOC 2260B. Sociology of Discrimination.</P>

<P>In recent decades, open expressions of prejudice and discriminationhave become less socially acceptable. Inequalities along lines of race,class, and gender, however, persist. We will examine the social scientificliterature on discrimination in its interpersonal and structural forms. Wewill also discuss what is not discrimination given that this term is oftenused (incorrectly) synonymously with disparities to refer to inequalities thatoriginate through other processes. We will investigate causes, definitions,measurement, effects, and possible policy responses to discrimination.This course will draw on both qualitative and quantitative approaches tothe study of discrimination.</P>

<P>TAPS 0200. Playwriting II - Role Play.</P>

<P>In this intermediate course, we will focus on bolstering our writerly voiceswhile defining ongoing artistic practices. In this hybrid workshop andseminar, we will work toward writing one-act plays of our own, whileinvestigating other writer’s worlds. In the plays we will encounter thissemester, characters engage in some form of role play. We end up asking:what does it mean to play? How does a play play? Through this study,we will ask what it means for characters to be active, how to write plotas an offering of contrasts and tensions, and where exactly character iscomposed. S/NC.</P>

<P>All Voice and Speech work has two underlying goals: for the actor to beheard; for the actor to be understood. A daily warmup, rigorous drilling,the learning of IPA, and its application in Standard American dialect willbuild muscle to strengthen your instrument for clarity of speech and trainyour ear to the nuances of speech sounds, invaluable for dialect andcharacter work. The Alexander Technique uses gentle guidance to enablemovement to take place unencumbered by habitual effort.

<P>UNIV 1520. The Shaping of World Views.</P>

<P>To many students, an exclusive emphasis on specialized studiesfragments the &quot;world&quot; in which they live. A widespread feeling of losspervades the minds of students who often come to universities to learnright from wrong, to distinguish what is true from what is false, butwho realize at the end of four years that they have deconstructed theirfreshman beliefs, values, and ideologies, but have created nothing toreplace them. This course examines the diversity of worldviews bothsynchronically and diachronically and surveys various explanations forsuch diversity. Enrollment limited to 30. Conducted in English.</P>
