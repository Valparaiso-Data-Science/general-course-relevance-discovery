<P>An investigation of the developments and wide variety of musical styles and aesthetic approaches found within Western classical music during the twentieth century and the early twenty-first century. A major focus is developing an ability to perceive a musical work’s events and internal relationships by enhancing perceptual skills through listening in a critical manner. This illuminates how classical music changes yet remains the same and how such traditions and innovations fit within the complex sociocultural contexts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Furthermore, this critical listening and engagement creates an awareness of the different compositional styles, procedures, and formal designs of twentieth and twenty-first century Western classical music while expanding an appreciation for and knowledge of contemporary aesthetics. </P>

<P>Traditional Liberal Arts and Science Major </P>

<P>Coordinate Major in Elementary Education: Changes in Massachusetts Department of Education regulations governing elementary teacher preparation became effective October 1, 2001 and affect students graduating after October 1, 2003. The regulations specify that curricula must include upper and lower level arts and sciences coursework, covering composition; American and world literature; United States and world history; geography; economics; child development; science laboratory work; and mathematics and science coursework appropriate for the elementary school teacher. These subjects follow the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks and are covered on the Massachusetts Test for Educator Licensure. Students may choose from among traditional liberal arts and sciences majors. Majors in mathematics, history, English, and geography are appropriate and may be completed within 32 course-credits over a four-year period. While students are not precluded from choosing other traditional majors, such choices may require more than 32 course-credits, and more than four years, to complete. Students are required to complete specified general education courses to satisfy the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks, as well as any specified by the major department. </P>

<P>Coordinate Major in Early Childhood Education: Massachusetts Department of Education regulations do not specify curricular guidelines in subject matter for students seeking licensure in early childhood education. Students in this program may choose the Interdisciplinary Major or traditional majors mentioned above for elementary teacher preparation. Other majors that may be completed in 32 course-credits over four years are Art, World Languages, and Psychology; majors not mentioned may require additional coursework. The general education courses required that satisfy the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks are recommended, but are not required, for Coordinate Majors in Early Childhood Education. </P>

<P>Professional Experiences in Education -Field Study and Student Teaching Practicum </P>

<P>The professional education program at Framingham State University consists of a planned series of developmental experiences, the amount of participation and responsibility increasing as the student progresses through the program. These experiences are designed to provide a transition from theoretical knowledge to professional application, culminating in assignment to student teaching. All students in secondary education will take two consecutive quarters of student teaching practicum and seminar that will include twelve weeks of student teaching for five days each week. All undergraduate Coordinate Majors in Early Childhood Education or Elementary Education are assigned to a student teaching practicum. This is a full-time experience and the student takes no other courses during the period of student teaching practicum. </P>

<P>The University assumes the responsibility for selecting cooperating teachers and schools and for assigning student teachers to those teachers and schools. While every effort is made to place student teachers in conveniently located centers, students must be prepared to assume responsibility for their own transportation. </P>

<P>Students are advised to check prerequisites in order to follow the correct sequence of professional experiences and courses that lead to student teaching. Students who do not follow the sequence may find themselves in difficulty because they have not taken a prerequisite course. </P>

<P>Admission into Teacher Education and the Student Teaching Practicum </P>

<P>The Education Department is proud to continue Framingham State University’s long-established tradition of excellence in teacher preparation. The Department’s commitment has been stated as follows: </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
                                                                   ~180~</Figure>

<P> To encourage students in their continuing adult development toward becoming self-directing, professional persons. </P>

<P> To foster an enthusiasm for scholarly investigation and intellectual pursuit which will be reflected by students in professional field settings. </P>

<P> To assist students in broadening their communication skills in order to enhance both their personal and professional advancement. </P>

<P> Toraisestudents’ social andcultural awareness through a professional program which reflects a philosophy of equal access to educational opportunity for all. </P>

<P> To help students gain an understanding of human behavior, especially that of children and young people, that will aid them in working effectively with a variety of life styles and modes of learning. </P>

<P>These goals are consonant with the Standards established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as requisite for approval of programs to prepare candidates for licensure as teachers in this state and for reciprocal licensure through the Interstate Certification Compact. (See Education Department for the Handbook of Office of Professional Experiences for further information on teacher licensure standards.) </P>

<P>In accordance with the requirements for approval or accreditation established by the Commonwealth, the University’s Professional Standards Committee (PSC) applies specific criteria for the retention of candidates in teacher preparation to determine that they possess academic competencies and personal characteristics appropriate to the requirements of teaching.

<P>DESCRIPTION OF ENGLISH COURSE LEVELS </P>

<P>In addition to being grouped by distribution areas (i.e., British literature, American literature, world literature, and so forth), English Department courses are arranged in tiers that assume different levels of preparation, background, and experience. </P>

<P>100-level courses are foundation courses in literature and composition. They assume little or no previous experience in the subject and include ENGL 110 Expository Writing, a college-wide requirement. 100-level courses are offered each semester. One 100-level literature, if taken during the freshman or sophomore year, may count towards the English major requirements. </P>

<P>200-level courses examine a broad range of material and various literary traditions, periods, and genres. These include historical overviews in British, American, and world literatures; genre studies; writing and journalism courses; women’s studies; language studies; ethnic literature; film studies; and ENGL 204 Literary Study, a required seminar </P>

<P>for English majors that should be taken in the first year or as early in the student’s career </P>

<P>as possible. Literature courses at this level include a research component. Most of these courses are offered each semester or once a year; a few are normally offered every other year. </P>

<P>300-level courses are increasingly specialized courses that provide breadth of coverage with a more detailed and rigorous study of the material. These courses presuppose some background and experience in literature, as well as proficiency in close reading, analytical thinking, and expository writing. Writing assignments include essays that integrate research and close readings of texts. A few of these courses are offered once a year, but most are offered only every other year. </P>

<P>400-level courses are advanced courses primarily intended for juniors and seniors. Most classes are conducted as a workshop or seminar in which students are responsible for oral reports and in-class presentations. Student papers are required to demonstrate mastery in research techniques, familiarity with various critical methodologies, and ability to synthesize disparate materials. Independent studies, practica, and Seminar in Literature are offered each semester; writing courses are offered every year or every other year; language and literature courses vary from once a year to once every three years. </P>

<P>LIBERAL STUDIES MAJOR </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Arts, with a Major in Liberal Studies is intended as an opportunity to enable students, under faculty-advisor guidance, to design a unique program of study not readily available within the existing curricular structure of the University. This major aims at providing alternative avenues for accommodating the individual academic interest of students. A student may either (a) pursue in-depth study in an area or areas not presently offered as majors at Framingham State University or (b) may choose a broad spectrum of course work among a number of disciplines in lieu of the traditional one-discipline course of study. </P>

<P>Students in this major have the opportunity to experience a broad course of study in the traditional liberal arts and sciences which fosters skills such as conceptual analysis, critical thinking, disciplined writing, creative problem-solving, ethical and moral reasoning, and strong leadership. </P>

<P>Prior Learning Assessment Students accepted into the Liberal Studies major may choose to apply for Prior Learning Assessment credit (a maximum of eight (8) course-credits). Such credit is awarded through a portfolio assessment process and may be granted for substantive learning that has occurred outside the classroom following high school graduation of completion of the GED. </P>

<P>Credit may be awarded in the following areas:  Employment   Military Service  Community Service  Noncredit Educational Experiences  Independent Learning  Educational Travel </P>

<P>Students who wish to apply for &quot;Prior Learning Assessment&quot; credit must complete the portfolio process within twelve months of matriculation into the Liberal Studies major. &quot;Prior Learning Assessment&quot; credits are only applicable to the Liberal Studies major at Framingham State University (these credits will be removed from the student’s academic record should the student change their major). </P>

<P>Students seeking certification for certain professional programs (e.g. teacher or dietetic licensure) should consult an advisor, as the Liberal Studies major may not be an appropriate route to those professions. </P>

<P>For additional information regarding the Liberal Studies major, please contact the Liberal Studies coordinator to make an appointment. </P>

<P>Program Requirements for the Major in Liberal Studies:</P>

<P> Eleven (11) General Education course-credits including one laboratory science. </P>

<P> Eleven (11) Open Elective course-credits.  A maximum of eight (8) course-credits may be applied toward open electives from “Prior Learning Assessment” course-credits. </P>

<P>Students majoring in Sociology with a Concentration in General Sociology may elect to follow an area of focus within the major. An area of focus is not the same as a concentration and will not be noted on a student's transcript or audit. A cohesive sequence of courses in a subfield of the discipline enables students to strengthen their knowledge for employment opportunities upon graduation and/or advanced post-graduate training. Students interested in pursuing an area of focus are encouraged to choose their major electives from the courses listed below: </P>

<P>Area of Focus: Anthropology </P>

<P>Anthropology provides an understanding of culture, the various adaptive styles human beings have devised, and the ways in which they have become diversified. It is designed to prepare students for careers involving interaction and cooperation with people from diverse cultural, religious, and ethnic groups. Some examples are government; international development; foundation administration; business enterprises, especially those with overseas interests; non-profit organizations, especially non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) with global interests; human ecology; and environmental consulting. In addition, this area of focus prepares students for graduate study in anthropology, sociology, and international relations. </P>

<P>Area of Focus: Deviance and Social Control </P>

<P>A focus on deviance and social control implies taking a careful look at how forms of social and personal behavior which violate mainstream norms arise, and at how mainstreamers and mainstream social institutions regard and respond to such behavior. </P>

<P>We will be looking at behavioral styles called “crime”, “delinquency”, “immorality”, “non-conformity”, and so forth. How do such modes of behavior arise and how do they become labeled as deviant styles by the society and its mainstream enforcers? How do deviants assess their own behavior and how is it viewed by others? How does it affect their relationships with others? What do “insider-outsider” relations consist of? What does society as a whole define as order? How do various social institutions and groupings (the legal and medical establishments, and the upholders of public morality) respond to what they view to be disorder? How does society punish transgressors and enforce rules and impose sanctions? This subfield is particularly suitable for those interested in the practice of law and law enforcement, politics, public administration, mental health, and social work. </P>
