<P>Academic Standing </P>

<P>The scholastic standing of a student is determined by the quality of work in class and semesterexaminations. ItisexpressedintermsofthescholasticindexalsoknownastheGrade Point Average (GPA). The scholastic index is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted. For example, a student who has earned 30 quality points for 15 semester hours has a scholastic index of 2.0. Only course work taken at Caldwell University or in an approved affiliation program is included in the computation of the GPA. </P>

<P>Quality points are the numerical values assigned to the various grades as shown in the following table. For example, the grade “A” translates into 4 quality points per semester hour. </P>

<P>The cumulative index will determine the academic standing of a student at every point. A student is in good academic standing if the cumulative index is 1.8 at the end of the first semester and 2.0 at the end of every semester thereafter. </P>

<P>Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) </P>

<P>Prior Learning Assessment is a method whereby learning gained through an individual’s life experience is considered as credit toward a college degree program. This learning can come from a variety of sources, including work, hobbies, military service and family responsibilities. While there are a number of types of Prior Learning Assessment, one of the more popular forms is the portfolio method. This method requires the student to document their life experiences and demonstrate their similarity to learning gained through formal college level education. Caldwell University follows The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) guidelines in the award of credit. </P>

<P>A candidate for the PLA program must be an adult student, matriculated with at least 12 earned Caldwell University credits, and attend the PLA workshop given every semester. A Student may earn a maximum of 18 credits towards a degree through the PLA process. Only 6 of these credits may satisfy major requirements. PLA credits may also be used to satisfy electives or core requirements. All PLA credits must be completed prior to the last semester before graduation and the recommendation to award PLA credits must be received by the Registrar prior to the beginning of the last semester before a student’s anticipated graduation. </P>

<P>COMBINED B.A. IN PSYCHOLOGY/ </P>

<P>M.A. IN COUNSELING (ALL OPTIONS) </P>

<P>The combined B.A./M.A. program is available for three different tracks in counseling: specialization inmentalhealthcounseling,specializationinschoolcounseling,andspecialization in art therapy. It is designed to facilitate the ongoing academic accomplishments of students who have established a record of excellence in psychology or in psychology/art therapy at the undergraduate level. Acceptance into the program will allow up to 12 psychology credits to be “double-counted” toward both the B.A. in Psychology and M.A. in Counseling. The student pays undergraduate tuition for graduate courses taken prior to completing the bachelor’s degree, which is awarded upon completion of the bachelor’s requirements. </P>

<P>Note that the 12 double-counted credits will be designated as “applicable to the graduate degree” only after the student receives the bachelor’s degree and matriculates into the master’s program, which designation will be canceled if the student withdraws from graduate study before completing the master’s program.

<P>COMBINED B.A. IN PSYCHOLOGY/ </P>

<P>M.S. IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY </P>

<P>This combined five-year B.A./M.S. option provides Caldwell University psychology majors with the opportunity to take three years of coursework at Caldwell University and then two years at Columbia University. Upon successful completion of all requirements by the student, the final products are a B.A. in Psychology from Caldwell University and an M.S. in Occupational Therapy (OT) from Columbia. </P>

<P>Students are NOT guaranteed admission or a seat in the Columbia OT program by entering into this option at Caldwell University. Rather, students must separately apply for admission to the Columbia OT program when they are eligible to apply. The decision for admission to the Columbia OT program is made solely by the Columbia OT program. </P>

<P>If a Caldwell University student is NOT accepted into the Columbia OT program, however, then the student must complete all requirements for their 4-year degree at Caldwell University to obtain the B.A. in Psychology. This includes taking the coursework at Caldwell University that is required of typical psychology majors along with completing the required number of credits for graduation. </P>

<P>If students are successfully admitted into the OT program at Columbia, then satisfactory completion of the first year courses at Columbia will “double count.” This means that they will fulfill some portion of the requirements for graduation from Caldwell University with the B.A. in Psychology as well as the first year required coursework for the M.S. in OT at Columbia. This will allow students to complete a B.A. in Psychology (from Caldwell University) and an </P>

<P>M.S. in OT (from Columbia) in a shorter time than is typical of separate degree programs. </P>

<P>The Psychology Department at Caldwell University will approve transfer credit for certain psychology courses taken in the first year in Columbia’s M.S. in OT program to count towards theCaldwellUniversitypsychologymajor. Someofthesewillcounttowardselectivepsychology courses while others count towards required psychology courses (see below for identification of these courses). The remaining first year Columbia M.S. in OT program courses will count as elective credit towards completing the balance of the credit requirements (120 credits) for graduation with a bachelor’s degree from Caldwell University. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>A. Coursework taken at Caldwell University for B.A. in Psychology (91 credits) </P>

<P>The 91 credits that are taken at Caldwell University come from three different sources: the core curriculum, specific courses drawn from the psychology major, and additional science courses required for later admission into the Columbia OT program. The breakdown of these courses follows below: </P>

<P>I. Core Curriculum (49 credits) </P>

<P>During their 3 years at Caldwell University, all students must complete the requirements for the Caldwell University liberal arts core curriculum. A total of 49 credits must be taken to fulfill the core requirements.

<P>III. Additional Required Sciences Coursework (12 credits) </P>

<P>During their three years at Caldwell University, all students must complete additional biological and natural science courses that are required for later entry into the Columbia </P>

<P>M.S. in OT program. These courses will count as free elective credit towards partial fulfillment of the 120 credit requirement for graduation from Caldwell University (the remainder of the credit requirements will be fulfilled in the student’s first year in the Columbia M.S. in OT program). The following courses must be taken at Caldwell University: </P>

<P>M.A. IN APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS </P>

<P>Qualified undergraduate psychology majors may take advantage of the opportunity to pursue their M.A. in Applied Behavior Analysis in an accelerated manner through the combined B.A./M.A. program. It is designed to facilitate the ongoing academic accomplishments of students who have established a record of excellence in psychology at the undergraduate level. Acceptance into the program will allow up to 12 psychology credits to be “doublecounted” toward both the B.A. in Psychology and M.A. in Applied Behavior Analysis. The student pays undergraduate tuition for graduate courses taken prior to completing the bachelor’s degree, which is awarded upon completion of the bachelor’s requirements. </P>

<P>Note that the 12 double-counted credits will be designated as “applicable to the graduate degree” only after the student receives the bachelor’s degree and matriculates into the M.A. graduate program, which designation will be canceled if the student withdraws from graduate study before completing the master’s program. In that case, Caldwell University will count the credits only towards the student’s undergraduate degree. Note also that grades below B in required graduate-level courses will necessitate that the student retake that course; grades below B in an elective graduate-level course will necessitate that the student either re-take the course or take another graduate-level course in substitution. Students will only be permitted to take one graduate course per semester while still an undergraduate (under special circumstances, with permission a student may take two). </P>

<P>STATEMENT OF OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT </P>

<P>Two fundamental learning goals of the sociology and criminal justice major are student competence in research methods and theory. The Department meets these goals through our courses in social science research methods, criminology, and sociological theory. Methods of Social Research I and II are required for both sociology and criminal justice majors, while Sociological Theory is required of sociology majors and Criminology is required of criminal justice majors. After completing the required outcomes assessment courses, sociology and criminal justice majors should be able to: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>describe and apply classical and contemporary theories in at least one area of social reality; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>describe and evaluate classical and contemporary theories of crime causation and apply these theories to real world phenomena; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>identify basic methodological approaches and describe the general role of methods in building sociological knowledge; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>design a research study in an area of choice; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>develop proficiency in use of statistics for the comprehensive understanding of professional journals; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>apply statistical skills to conduct data analysis using secondary data. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
194 </Figure>

<P>In each of the required theory and research courses, the instructor of the outcomes assessment course is responsible for awarding student grades; however, outcomes assessment is the shared responsibility of all full-time department faculty. It is at the discretion of the individual instructor whether or not to consider departmental faculty evaluations of student work in their courses when awarding student grades for the course. </P>

<P>For sociology majors, departmental faculty will review and evaluate the research paper submitted inSociological Theoryandthefinal papersubmitted forMethodsofSocial Research </P>

<P>II. For criminal justice majors, departmental faculty will critique and assess the research paper submitted in Criminology and the final paper submitted for Methods of Social Research II. For students majoring in both sociology and criminal justice, three evaluations will be done by departmental faculty: the research paper for Sociological Theory, Criminology, and Methods of Social Research II. </P>

<P>For a student to pass his/her outcomes assessment requirement, a majority of the departmental faculty must agree that the quality of the work done for both courses demonstrates competence. If a student fails to meet the necessary criteria for any of their outcomes assessment paper requirements, the student may: (1) revise the written work, submit a new paper for consideration prior to the end of the semester during which the student is enrolled in the course, and give an oral presentation of the paper before the department faculty reviewers; (2) request an Incomplete (in accordance with the Academic Policies set forth in the CaldwellUniversity Undergraduate Catalog), revise thewritten work,submit a new paper for consideration within the allotted time period, and give an oral presentation of the paper before the department faculty reviewers; or (3) repeat the course (in accordance with the Academic Policies set forth in the Caldwell University Undergraduate Catalog). </P>

<P>It is possible that a student may pass his/her outcomes assessment but receive less than a C grade for the course in which the outcomes assessment work was done. In such a case, the student does not have to go through the outcomes assessment process again; however, the course has to be repeated, since students must achieve at least a C grade in all required courses for the major. </P>

<P>It is also conceivable that a student may fail the outcomes assessment process, yet achieve a C or better in the course in which the outcomes assessment work was required. In such a case, the student does not have to repeat the course, but must follow guidelines outlined above for students who do not pass their outcome assessment requirement. </P>

For the required credits, students must take PH 102 and TH 102. For these students, TH 102 serves as a prerequisite for all theology courses and PH 102 serves as a prerequisite for all other philosophy courses. </P>

<P>Requirements for a Theology Major </P>

<P>DEGREE: Bachelor of Arts </P>

<P>Liberal Arts Core (see page 40)........................................................46 credits </P>

<P>Theology (includes core requirements)................................................39 credits </P>

<P>Open Electives................................................................................35 credits </P>

<P>Total ..............................................................................................120 credits </P>

<P>STUDENTS WHO MAJOR IN THEOLOGY MUST COMPLETE: </P>

<P>TH 102 Introduction to Christian Theology </P>

<P>TH 201 Christian Responsibility OR TH 209 Contemporary Social Teaching </P>

<P>TH 316 History of Christian Thought </P>

<P>TH 318 Old Testament OR TH 319 New Testament </P>

<P>TH 334 Christology </P>

<P>TH 495 Theology Capstone </P>

<P>and seven additional courses after consultation with the department chairperson. It is suggested that students with a major in theology choose a minor in sociology, psychology or philosophy. </P>

<P>STATEMENT OF OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT </P>

<P>In addition to the 39 credits for the theology major, students declaring a theology major during or after summer 2011 are required to take a theology capstone course, TH 495. </P>

<P>Students declaring a major prior to summer 2011 have the option to fulfill their outcomes assessment with either TH 495, or an alternative process to be determined in consultation with the department chairperson. Outcomes assessments are required for all majors. </P>

<P>The TH 495 capstone course reviews material from each of the four major assessment areas (Scripture, Moral Theology, Christology, and Church History). In each area, the student will concentrate on material corresponding to their coursework used to meet their requirement. For example, Moral Theology will focus on either TH 201 or TH 209, while Scripture will focus on TH 318 or TH 319, depending upon the student’s coursework. Students who have had two Scripture courses or Moral Theology courses will be able to choose their area of focus for their capstone. Normally, this is to be taken sometime during the student’s final year of classes, or as shortly thereafter as possible. It is the student’s responsibility to notify his or her advisor, as well as the department chairperson, of his or her intention to begin preparing for assessment. This should be done the semester prior to the time this preparation begins. </P>

<P>Within TH 495, students will be assessed on covering all four areas mentioned above. While the course will be taught by a single instructor, the work by each student may be assessed by full-time professors within the department to determine if the work is of passing quality. The decision about whether or not a student’s performance for a given area is sufficient to pass is to be determined by the instructor and other department faculty who may be involved in the assessment, in consultation with one another. Each student must receive an assessment of “passing” for each of the four areas to pass the course. If by the end of the course the student has failed to pass any of the four areas before the conclusion of the course, he or she will receive a grade of “no pass” for the course. Students failing to pass TH 495 may either take the course again when it is next offered, or be reassessed in the particular area(s) which they failed to pass. Depending upon the timeline of the course, students may be able to redo work inareastheyfailtopassbeforetheconclusionofthecourse,thoughonlyastimeallows. While there is no limit how many times a student may retake an assessment for any of the four areas, students will typically be allowed only one retake per area per semester. </P>
