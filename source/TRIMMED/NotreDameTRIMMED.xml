<H2 id="LinkTarget_7707">EDUCATION </H2>

<P> </P>

<P>TEACHER EDUCATION </P>

<P>Notre Dame College has a long tradition of teacher education. Students may pursue programs leading to Ohio licensure in early childhood, middle childhood, special education, and adolescent/young adult. Those pursuing adolescent/young adult also pursue an academic major. The detailed organization of the teacher education program and its specific directives are outlined in the Teacher Candidate Handbook. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Education Unit Vision </P>

<P>The Division of Professional Education educates teacher candidates for personal, professional, and global responsibility so that in their role as teachers they are willing to take a stand for human rights and social justice. The willingness to take a stand is critical in local communities and in a world where the disparities in access to goods and resources can threaten human relationships. This aligns with the conceptual framework for the Division of Professional Education at Notre Dame College which is driven by the institutional mission statement of educating “a diverse population...for personal, professional and global responsibility” and the College motto, &quot;Changing the world, one student at a time.&quot; Current theory and research, state and national </P>

<P>standards, the standards of specialized professional associations, and the concerns of the division’s P-12 partners have further aided the division in reshaping and redefining its conceptual framework of “changing the classroom, one teacher at a time.”  The major themes articulated by the conceptual framework guide candidate performance outcomes and the system by which the division, its programs, and its candidates are assessed. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>While the Notre Dame College community embraces and lives out of a carefully articulated and well documented values list (Notre Dame College, 2007), four values stand out in the Notre Dame Education tradition for the Division of Professional Education. The dignity of the whole person and that individual’s right to an education are fundamental to the Notre Dame College teacher preparation program. The Division values the range of diversity among our teacher candidates, in our partnership schools, and among the core and adjunct faculty. Collaboration is highly valued in the Division as we recognize the social nature of learning and work, and we acknowledge the importance of student voice in the education process. Fairness, honesty, respect, and ethical behavior are aspects of responsible professional engagement that the Education Faculty seeks to model for and cultivate in the teacher candidates. </P>

<P> </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_7720">Admission to the Division of Professional Education </H3>

<P>Education Program admission is open to students who demonstrate that they have the intellectual ability, emotional stability, and dispositional and professional skills needed to be a professional teacher. Students desiring to apply to the Education Program must first be admitted to the College through the regular Admissions Office application process. Students planning to major in Education will be classified as pre-education until their formal acceptance into the Education program. Formal application should be submitted to the Division during ED 205. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Prerequisites needed for admission to the Division of Professional Education are: </P>

<P>ED 202/203 Introduction to Education/Field Experience </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Candidates may be required to undergo an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) background check before being allowed to participate in field experiences in ED 202/203 and subsequent education courses.  The state of Ohio will require another BCI and FBI background check before applying for licensure.  Candidates are responsible for the cost of the background check, and the outcome may impact the candidate’s ability to remain in the program.  See the following website for more information:  
<Link>http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Licensure/Additional-Information/Background-Check-FAQs#FAQ681</Link>
.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Applicants must achieve a 2.75 GPA in the professional education prerequisite coursework AND in their cumulative coursework/overall GPA. If the GPA is between 2.5 and 2.75, SAT and ACT scores may be used for admission.  A total SAT score of 1080, or a composite ACT score of 18 are acceptable scores for admission to an educator preparation program.  Candidates may also be given an Action Plan that will allow for them to have two semesters to bring up their GPAs to 2.75.  If, at the end of those two semesters, candidates have not increased their GPAs to 2.75, they may be counseled out of the education major, or redirected to a non-licensure major. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Applicants must also display competency in oral and written communication and mathematics through the successful completion with a grade of “B” or better in the appropriate freshman English sequence and mathematics course beyond the developmental level (see course catalog for further information). </P>

<P>Students who have not met this benchmark must work with the Division of Professional Education, The Dwyer Learning Center, the Writing Lab, or The Academic Support Center to strengthen their math and composition skills.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>All teacher candidates must give evidence of the physical, emotional, and dispositional abilities required of teachers that include (but are not limited to) the following: </P>

If they earn a score below 4 (out of a possible 5), they will be directed to the Writing Lab for tutoring on a regular basis before they take the Admission Essay in the ED 205/206 course.  At that time, candidates will receive a letter along with their admission status indicating whether or not they have been admitted with or without writing conditions.  Candidates will have one year to demonstrate progress in writing if they are admitted with conditions.  A third writing sample will be required, and if candidates are still struggling, they may be required to write a plan of professional development in writing and show evidence of following through with the plan before they are allowed to student teach. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_9740">RN to BSN Post-Licensure Track Practice Requirement </H3>

<P>The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) Accreditation Criteria requires RN-BSN programs to include an experiential practice learning requirement (2013).  To assure compliance with this standard, the RN-BSN Post-Licensure program curriculum culminates with NR 464, the Capstone course. The purpose of the Capstone practicum is to provide a student-designed learning experience with integration and application of baccalaureate level nurse competencies through the completion of a clinically focused project.   In this 5 credit hour course, RN-BSN students complete 90 hours of experiential learning in addition to didactic coursework.  The student is supported in this learning experience by an onsite preceptor and course faculty member. Students select the site where the capstone practicum project will be completed. Students need to have completed all required courses (nursing and core curriculum courses) before enrolling in NR 464.  RN-BSN students must show evidence of and maintain a current, valid, unencumbered license as a registered nurse in the state in which the Capstone project will be completed.  </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_10174">PHILOSOPHY </H2>

<P> </P>

<P>Philosophy courses at Notre Dame College challenge students to think critically about our world and the human condition, providing a strong foundation for a liberal arts curriculum. Philosophy is an important part of our liberal arts tradition because it directly fosters a life-long pursuit for truth, beauty and goodness. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Notre Dame College students are required to take two philosophy courses. All students are required to take the ethics course (PH 480) to learn how to analyze critical questions of right and wrong in our time and to identify and apply various philosophical positions in response to these questions. Although the History of Western Philosophy course (PH 180) is recommended at the beginning of one’s college career, a student is free to choose among the various philosophy electives to satisfy the Philosophical Inquiry requirement. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Philosophical thinking can be applied in any life situation because it teaches general problem solving, clear and persuasive communication, and writing that is ordered, coherent and complete. For this reason, one can argue that a philosophy minor is an invaluable compliment to any academic discipline. </P>

<P>Careers that are especially dependent on philosophy and philosophical thinking include law, politics, the sciences, theology, journalism, communication, management and education. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Student Learning Outcomes </P>

<P>Students completing a minor in philosophy will be able to: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody> Identify, comprehend, analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments in oral and written discourse. </LBody>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_10658">HISTORY  </H3>

<P> </P>

<P>Mission Statement: </P>

<P>Through the study of history, students will come to appreciate the diverse and complex nature of humankind. The development of research and critical thinking skills used to form historical interpretations, question assumptions, think imaginatively and develop clear, well-reasoned assessments will be emphasized, along with a commitment to life-long learning.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Program Description </P>

<P>One of the most common questions History students are asked is: “Why are you majoring in History?” On the surface, this seems like a simple question, but once you think about it you may find that it isn’t all that easy to answer. History is different things to different people, and even historians debate the meaning of historical events among themselves. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Ultimately, history is personal. History is a part of everyone’s life, and it affects us in ways we may not always think about. We live in a society that is the result of generations of development. The decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, fears, hopes, and feelings of people who have come before us have brought about the world we live in today. Knowing about the past can help us both appreciate the present and understand how we as a people and a society have come to this point in time. Past experience, if carefully considered, may offer lessons for dealing with present-day situations. Some might even argue that the past may offer clues to the future. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>But what can you do with a degree in History? The simple answer is anything you want to do. People in widely diverse careers attribute their success to studying history as undergraduates. For example, people with undergraduate degrees in History work as attorneys and paralegals, in business, as writers and journalists, government officials, intelligence analysts, researchers, policy analysts, politicians, broadcasters, museum curators and teachers. A list of career opportunities can be found here: 
<Link>http://www.historians.org/pubs/Free/careers/Index.htm</Link>
 </P>

<P> </P>

<P>History majors at Notre Dame College also have the opportunity to work in numerous internships related to these careers. NDC History majors have interned in law offices, courts, libraries and historical societies, banks, fusion centers, think tanks and foreign embassies. And many NDC students who complete their undergraduate degrees in History eventually go on to earn graduate degrees. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Students who complete a minimum of twelve credits in history with a minimum GPA of 3.1 and an overall GPA of 3.0 or better will qualify for induction into Phi Alpha Theta, the national history honor society. </P>
