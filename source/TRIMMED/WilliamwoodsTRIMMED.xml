<P>From both a historic and contemporary perspective, the honor student will research, investigate, and demonstrate an understanding of various art processes with the goal of coming to a greater appreciation for a wide range of aesthetics, forms and media. The bulk of the class will be daily and bi-weekly problems to solve, instructor demonstrations, power point lectures, and critiques. Students will also be required to read and discuss various handouts before each problem. The fundamental approaches to art production and design basics will be explored in 7 art problems throughout the course. Specific limitations will be given for each problem that will both restrict and allow students the freedom to explore creative, unified solutions while gaining a deep understanding of the specific element explored and its relationships to the design principles. Each of the first six problems will focus on one of the 6 art elements. The final problem includes a research assignment and power point presentation of an artist that has inspired the culmination piece that includes all of the elements of design. Throughout the course, students will work in a variety of mediums while exploring different approaches to form. Students will learn how to assess their work and work of others as they gain an understanding of the elements and principles of design, intent and aesthetic. A sketchbook will be kept to explore ideas, record terminology and insights from handouts and presentations, as well as historical figures and styles discovered throughout the semester. A final written assessment reflecting an understanding of process, design and a historical reference will accompany the 7th culmination project for TK20 assessment. </P>

<P>This course is designed to develop proficiency in the understanding and use of non-manual markers in ASL.  Many grammatical structures of ASL are produced as facial expressions, body shifts, and morphemes produced with specific mouth and eye movements.  For non-Deaf people, this is perhaps some of the more difficult aspects of ASL to learn and the most important for comprehension and production.  Students will learn how to accurately inflect specific meaning in ASL using non-manual markers.  The course will also touch on fingerspelling accuracy.    Prerequisite: ASL 205 </P>

<P>Deaf Education is a complex and controversial issue in the Deaf community; Is deafness looked upon as a way of life or a disability? Is sign language seen as a resource or a last resort?  How do deaf people best learn and thrive?  One's education experiences have a profound impact on self actualization and success as an deaf adult.  This population faces unique circumstances regarding their own language and cultural competency, access to equivalent services, and relationships with other people.  Students taking this course will learn about these circumstances in a specific context and examine the various options and perspectives facing deaf students in today's educational environments.  Examining laws and policies pertaining to this field and being able to discuss such things will better prepare them to assist and advocate for clients in various settings.

In managerial economics, profit maximization is studied as a management behavioral objective – and as a goal which may or may not be achieved, despite the attempts of managers. Students will be able to differentiate between a variety of factors that affect a business concern. They will develop informed solutions by analyzing all of the economic factors that affect the production environment.  Prerequisite: ECN251 or ECN252 </P>

<P>What do the “the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,” the quests of medieval knights, Hernán Cortés’ conquest of the Aztecs, and the rise of Genghis Khan and the Mongols have in common? They were all dependent on horses. Want to learn about how horses have altered history on virtually every continent? Well then…giddy up. This course will tell the story of the horse in the World from prehistory to the modern era. Looking at the dual development of horses and humans, and focusing on important events and themes from the cavalry to racing to the Pony Express, this course will seek to uncover how the horse has shaped human history and culture throughout the World.

<P>Countless generations have gone to war, and the world has been dramatically shaped on and off the battlefield. How and why were these wars fought? What resulted? This class is centered on the choices these generations made and their consequences on society. The old adage declares, “All’s fair in love and war,” but throughout history, there has been debate over how wars are fought and the behavior of officers and soldiers. Are all wartime actions justified? Is victory the ultimate goal, or is the manner in which the war was fought equally as important? This course will examine the tactics and ethics of war and society from a civilian and military perspective.

<P>“Remember the ladies,” Abigail Adams wrote her husband John, reminding him to include the rights of women among the goals of the American Revolution. Although often viewed in a more modern context, the quest for women’s rights in America has existed since the nation’s founding. This course will follow the lives of American women from pre-contact Native society through the modern day. It will explore a variety of themes connected to gender, race, and status by observing the lives of women within diverse societies. In doing so, students will learn to view the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s and 70s against the foundations of the nineteenth and early twentieth century suffragists and the Revolutionary-era Daughters of Liberty and Republican Womanhood. From the witches of Salem to Susan B. Anthony to Gloria Steinem, this course overall aims to tell the story of women in America. </P>

<P>History is a collection of stories of the lives of many people, but is the life of a single person history? But who tells our story? Who determines our history? Today, journalists, rather than historians, write most of the popular biographies. So is biography also history? Or is it something else? This course will follow the intersection of the individual story with that of society, asking several fundamental questions: Does history change if we view it from the perspective of one person? Is the individual representative of society? Why do people make certain choices? What is gained through using a narrow lens to view wider events? Focusing on rotating individuals, this course will explore a historical period though the eyes of a single person. Students will read multiple accounts of the life of one person, and write their own narrative on a selected person during a limited timeframe. </P>

<P>This course examines the ways in which Americans from the colonial period to the present have shaped their physical surroundings and in turn been shaped by those built environments.  It focuses on the importance of the space and place in American history by exploring the physical landscapes of large cities, small towns, rural communities, and sprawling suburbs; the development of regions like the South, the Industrial Belt, the Sunbelt, and the West; and the role of human products like farms, factories, railroads, houses, main streets, chain restaurants, and Wal-Marts.  Throughout, it traces how these built environments both shaped and were shaped by individuals and communities, culture, politics, and the economy. </P>

<P>What would you do? The British army has fired at American colonists in Lexington and Concord; do you join the Patriots or keep your oath of loyalty to the King? Civil War has broken out and your home state has succeeded from the Union, but you are an officer in the US Army. Do you join the Confederacy? It’s August 1945, you’re Harry Truman and Japan won’t surrender. Do you drop the atomic bomb? History is full of turning points where the decisions of one person or a group of people have shaped the future. This course will explore these historical turning points and seek to understand why people made certain choices. Students will be asked to evaluate the mindset, ethics, and ideologies of historical individuals in order to evaluate decisions and consequences—ultimately asking the question “What would I do?” </P>

<P>The American Revolution is perhaps the single most important event in the history of the United States. This class will examine the ideological and intellectual framework that made this revolution possible. The war will be examined not only as a military conflict, but also an event with tangible political, social, economic, racial, and gendered applications. Using primary and secondary sources, this class will be centered on understanding the American mindset from the French and Indian War through the War of 1812. It will analyze how thought influenced action in America ranging from the war to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. </P>

<P>Throughout the American Revolution, patriots had cast British tyranny as reducing them to slavery. The Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution reaffirmed liberty to its citizens, but the inherent hypocrisy of the phrase “all men are created equal” when cast against Revolutionary ideology and the institution of slavery continued to haunt the nation. This course will trace the coming of the Civil War from early republican and antebellum debates on slavery to Manifest Destiny and through Southern secession. It will then examine how the Civil War represented differing definitions over the Revolutionary conception of liberty. From the floor of Congress to the battlefield of Gettysburg, students will explore the question of regional character, state’s rights, pro/anti-slavery, and governmental authority. In addition to examining national questions, this course will also focus on the role of Missouri as a boarder states and the local history of the Kingdom of Callaway. </P>

<P>For centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was a barrier. This formidable body of water represented a vast unknown. The discovery of the New World challenged many of the conceptions held by the Old World. The discovery of the Americas forced Europeans to re-evaluate both themselves and their understanding of the world intellectually, religiously, and geographically. Within a short time, the Atlantic Ocean became a bridge not a barrier. The Atlantic connected four continents (Europe, Africa, North America, South America) in a network of trade, communication, language, culture, and migration. From the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries, the flow of goods, people, and ideas developed and shaped these coastal lands. Yet the Atlantic represented much more than simply an avenue for maritime trade.  It was an entity that affected the daily life of much of the known world. This course will investigate topics ranging from the Enlightenment, exploration, empire, monarchy, slavery, piracy, revolutions, and seek to answer how far was the reach of the Atlantic?

<P>“An iron curtain has descended…,” proclaimed former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. On March 5, 1946 in Fulton, MO, less than a mile from the William Woods’ campus, Churchill created a lasting metaphor to describe the mounting crisis between the Soviet Union and the West that would come to dominate the globe for nearly the next half century. Not even a year after the Allied victory in World War II, the world was to be drawn into conflict again—a shadow war fought on both sides with ideology and fear. The Cold War was waged between Marxism and communism against democracy and capitalism. This course will explore the period from 1945-1991 from a global viewpoint, highlighting the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Covering topics ranging from James Bond to the Berlin Wall, students will explore the ways in which the struggle between communism and democracy influenced daily life, foreign policy, and global conflict. </P>

<P>Do you want to work in a museum, at a historical site, in a library or archive, or maybe as a historian for an organization, or even a documentary filmmaker? Then this course is for you! But what is public history? Public history simply is presenting history for a general audience, not academics. Learn the practical skills necessary to be able to work as a public historian in a variety of occupations from tour guide to preservationist. In this course students will study the basic elements of public history, cultivate archival and manuscript research skills, and create displays and digital projects.  This upper division course will involve individual research and group collaboration to create an exhibit, performance, or digital project (website, documentary film, etc.) focused on a selected historical event, person, or theme. Students will be required to travel to historical sites, libraries, archives, museums, etc. The subject of the project will change whenever the course is offered, so students are welcome to enroll multiple times. </P>

<P>The Great War had been fought as “the war to end all wars,” and twenty years later British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain still promised “peace in our time.” But just six years later, nearly 80 million people were dead. Sparked by the rise of dictatorships, World War II was a clash of nations that represented a global conflict on a scale never before imagined. Exploring the perspectives of both the Allied and Axis powers, students will learn how the clash of ideologies and beliefs resulted in conquest, genocide, and, ultimately, liberation. Although traditionally understood as occurring from 1939–1945, this course will start from the war’s origins—beginning with the end of World War I through the rise of the Nazi Party to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Far from just a military history of war in Europe and the Pacific, this course will examine topics including: the Holocaust, ideologies (democracy, communism, fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, etc.), the A-bomb, world leaders (FDR, Truman, Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, etc.), politics, propaganda, crime, the home front, and many more. Concluding with the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Trials and the start of the Cold War, the class will also examine the war’s legacy and aftermath. </P>

<P>The Master of Health Administration (MHA) is a direct path to healthcare leadership.

See course listings in the respective program sections of the graduate catalog. </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Entrance requirements for both the Master of Business Administration and the Master of Health Administration programs must be met for entry into the Dual MBA/MHA Option. </P>

<P>Upon completion of the 60 required credit hours, two diplomas will be issued, one for the MBA and one for the MHA.  Under this program, the diplomas cannot be awarded separately. </P>

<P>This is an advanced learning and instructional theory, process, and structure course that introduces and reintroduces educators to the basic foundational theories, principles, and modern thought of human learning and cognition.  This course will also provide for professional educative practice and application of these concepts for all learners in the academic community (birth to adult).  This course also presents and compares contemporary theories of learning and addresses their application to learning.      There are multiple theoretical perspectives in this course that include:  behaviorism, cognitive learning processes, information processing, cognitive development, and social cognitive learning.  These foundational concepts have been applied to more modern thought through the process and structure of instructional and learning practices in today's schools that have not yet been recognized as a theory per se.  Modern theory, structures, and processes that will be investigated from current educational environments in this class will include such topics as:  brain-based research, multiple intelligences, learning styles, cooperative learning, adult learning processes, and systems thinking.      Class learning methods will emphasize cooperative learning through collaborative inquiry teams as well as individual assignments to achieve individual and collective proficiency over stated learning outcomes.  Application of these learning processes are focused not only on individual learner, but also as they apply to the role of an instructional leader in the position of a principal and/or curriculum leader role. </P>

<P>This 3-credit hour (six week) capstone course is designed to provide the student with application and reflective opportunities using those attitudes, skills, and behaviors learned in previous Ed.S program curricular design and instructional leadership skills necessary for success at the central school district and administrative office and building levels.  All written work will be developed individually, although required textbooks for this course.  Rather, all the textbooks and references (i.e. APA Manual, 5th edition) used earlier in the other Ed.S. program courses will be referred to, as needed to complete to assignments in EDU 696. During the practicum, while the student completes the required assignments, they will simultaneously be completing activities (estimated to total about fifteen hours) that can be counted toward completion of the 40 total experience hours required for the Ed.S. program. The students will be in the &quot;field&quot; observing, interviewing and gathering information from instructional staff in a school building and from the administrative staff at the central office of a school district.  With the guidance of the university facilitator for EDU696, the student will be exposed to, and produce, assignments involving concepts of administrative management of instructional programs and the development and moitoring of a school or district written curricula with student assessment. The final curriculum project (which will be developed during this course via several sub-assignments) will be submitted at the end of this six-week course.  This final project is a requirement for graduation and will apply previous learning and skills developed throughout this Ed.S. program for Instructional Leadership.  The final product will be archived by the University (for accreditation review) for a period of seven years. </P>
