In order to request accommodations to meet these technical standards, a student may make the appropriate request of the Office of Disability Services: 570-422-3954.The Office of Accessible Services Individualized for Students will evaluate a student who states he/she could meet the technical Standards with accommodations and confirm that the stated condition(s) qualifies as a disability under applicable laws. The Director of Disability Services, in consultation with the Director of the Athletic Training Program, and the student, will determine if the Technical Standards can be met with reasonable accommodations. </P>

<P>Clinical Education Plan </P>

<P>The Graduate PPP places equal emphasis on both the coursework and clinical fieldwork aspects of students’ education. The clinical fieldwork is a critical EDUCATIONAL requirement of the ATEP. Clinical fieldwork is where students learn to apply and refine the knowledge and skills they learn in their coursework. More importantly, clinical fieldwork is where they integrate all phases of Athletic training knowledge, skills, abilities and values to become competent practitioners. It is where students make the transition to clinical practice, develop a practice style and ultimately embrace the culture of the profession. </P>

<P>Clinical education will follow a logical progression that allows for increasing amounts of clinically supervised responsibility leading to autonomous practice upon graduation. The clinical education plan outlines the sequence of formal instruction and will provide students with authentic, real-time opportunities to practice and integrate athletic training (AT) knowledge, skills, and clinical abilities, including decision-making and professional behaviors required of the profession in order to develop proficiency as an Athletic Trainer. </P>

<P>Clinical education will allow the athletic training student (ATS) the opportunities to practice with different patient populations, health care providers, and in various health care settings relative to the ESU-Graduate Professional Practical Program (PPP) mission statement. Students enrolled in this program will be directly supervised by a clinical preceptor who will assist the student in their efforts to integrate theory into practice.  </P>

<P>Athletic Training Professional Organization </P>

<P>The National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) is the professional membership association for certified athletic trainers. Founded in 1950, the NATA has grown to more than 30,000 members worldwide today. </P>

<P>The Eastern Athletic Trainers' Association (EATA) formed in January 1949 when a few athletic trainers in the northeast decided to gather and share information. Today, the EATA encompasses all members of the National Athletic Trainers' Association who reside in either District I or District II. The Pennsylvania Athletic Trainers' Society (PATS) is a progressive organization of health care professionals who work under the direction of a licensed physician. </P>

<P>Certified athletic trainers working in the Commonwealth protect and enhance the health and welfare of our clients through prevention, recognition, management, and rehabilitation of injuries. </P>
