<P>ANSO 212 - Race and Ethnicity (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Contrary to the expectations of many modern social theorists, race andethnicity continue to be important elements in the lives of contemporarypeople, serving as frameworks through which individual identities,community actions, and cultural meanings are interpreted. This coursewill introduce students to the sociocultural analysis of racial and ethnicidentities. How did ethnic and racial identities and communities developover time? Why does race, though now understood to be a social ratherthan a biological category, continue to be (mis)understood as a biologicalcategory? How do aspects of political, class, gender, and sexual identitiesinfluence racial and ethnic identities? We will use a global perspectiveto understand the conception of race and ethnicity. We will explorethese topics among others including cultural and historical variability ofethnic and racial categories, the dialectical formation of identity, and thepersistence of certain forms of racial and ethnic prejudice. Students willbe expected to examine critically their own common assumptions andpresuppositions about race and ethnicity, and to begin developing thetheoretical tools for interpreting life in an ethnically diverse world.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_18080">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P>
</Div>

<P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes the useof the target language in most of its courses because students can bestappreciate another culture from within its own mode of expression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

<H3>Cultural Enrichment</H3>

<P>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.</P>

<H3>The Foresman Lounge</H3>

<P>All juniors in Art History and Visual Culture participate in Junior Day. Theyare required to make a formal presentation of current work or research.The presentation is made to the faculty and to the student's peers as a&quot;mini-symposium&quot; in the junior year. There is also a Senior Symposium inwhich Art History and Visual Culture seniors make a formal presentationof their research to an invited audience. Art History and Visual Culture:Students in Art History and Visual Culture learn writing skills that areintegral to the discipline and the liberal arts. Working closely withfaculty, students learn to translate visual observation and evaluation intowritten language; articulate questions for research; communicate theresults of their research discoveries in writing; and develop an informed,critical, and independent written voice. Our courses emphasize thesequential, graduated development of writing skills. These culminate inour required senior thesis and symposium. Denison University works tomake study abroad possible for all students. In Art History and VisualCulture, we encourage students to study abroad during their junior year.Most students who major in Art History and Visual Culture transfer twoclasses for the major, satisfy appropriate GE requirements, and gaingeneral credits towards graduation. Quite a few students do independentresearch or internships as part of their study abroad experience. Weencourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study ofﬁce to explore theiroptions.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_17174">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>In Studio Art we foster independent and creative thought, emphasizingart-making as a means of thinking about not only oneself, but ourrelationship to the world of ideas from multiple perspectives. We offertwo degree programs in Studio Art, a bachelor of arts (BA) and a bachelorof ﬁne arts (BFA). Both degree programs emphasize individuality,interdisciplinary work, collaboration and community. We encouragethe fluidity of learning and see art as a bridge to all areas of study andresearch. The BA and the BFA prepare students in different ways for avariety of post-graduate pursuits, be it graduate school or professionalendeavors in art and related ﬁelds. Students who plan to major in StudioArt are strongly advised to seek an advisor in Studio Art at the time oftheir decision to major. Studio Art majors are required to take a seriesof core courses and students need to work closely with advisors tocomplete these core courses by end of the ﬁrst semester in their junioryear. Students should expect to work two hours per week outside ofclass for each credit hour of a course. For students to whom off campusstudy is an option, we transfer up to 4 courses from an off-campus studyexperience towards the major, pending approval from the Chair.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_16531">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The Department of Biology endeavors to provide a comprehensivefoundation in concepts and skills across the breadth of biology. Thisis achieved in part through an introductory core of three courses thatprepare students for a deep exploration of sub-disciplines and researchmethods through subsequent advanced courses. The core covers themajor concepts of biology, encompassing an exploration of the naturalhistory of life on Earth, coupled with the basic skills of acquiring andprocessing information, solving problems, and analyzing data. Ourprogram then allows students the flexibility to explore speciﬁc areas ofbiology in depth through a suite of advanced courses in which they canexpand and apply their knowledge and skills.</P>

<P>The major prepares students for careers in science and related ﬁelds,as well as graduate and professional schools (including pre-medical,pre-dental and pre-veterinary studies), while allowing students theflexibility to design the program that best suits their speciﬁc interestsand career goals. In addition, biology majors are offered the opportunityto collaborate with faculty in research and laboratory instruction, topresent exceptional work at professional meetings, and to assist in themaintenance of the 350-acre Biological Reserve and other departmentalfacilities. Information on studies in Pre-Health is provided in the &quot;SpecialPrograms and Opportunities&quot; section of the catalog.</P>

<P>Writing is an integral component of science, and as such, the BiologyDepartment understands that the development of writing skills isessential for all students who pursue the study of biology. The goal forour students is that they emerge as strong writers, able to constructcohesive bodies of written work in which they express clear, concise andlogical arguments, supported by empirical evidence and/or informationfrom appropriate sources. A developmental model of writing skills istightly woven into the biology curriculum to achieve this goal. Our majorcore curriculum establishes the foundation of good writing practices.Basic grammatical expression is addressed in BIOL 210 - MolecularBiology and Unicellular Life, while BIOL 220 - Multicellular Life focuseson understanding the format of biological literature, culminating inBIOL 230 - Ecology and Evolution, where students write multiple full-length papers. Taken sequentially, BIOL 220 - Multicellular Life andBIOL 230 - Ecology and Evolution serve as one of the W requirementsfor general education. In our advanced curriculum, students continue toexplore more sophisticated levels of writing, including employing distinctdisciplinary conventions and engaging with different genres applicableto biological writing. Students who undertake a senior research projectwrite a comprehensive thesis of their work (counting as an additional Wrequirement), putting into practice the many writing skills that they havedeveloped throughout the curriculum.</P>

<H2>Biology Major</H2>

<H3>Requirements for Biology Majors</H3>

<P>Students can pursue either a B.A. or B.S. degree in Biology (distinctionsbetween the two degrees are outlined below). For either degree, studentsshould aim to complete the three Biology core courses by the end of theirsecond year: BIOL 210 - Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220- Multicellular Life, and BIOL 230 - Ecology and Evolution. Students whohave completed comparable course work at other accredited institutionsmay petition to have such courses transferred to Denison and creditedtoward the major, at the discretion of the department. In contrast,students with credit-earning scores on Advanced Placement (4 or 5)or International Baccalaureate (6 or 7) tests in Biology will be grantedacademic credit for BIOL 100 - Modern Topics in Biology, but typically willbe required to complete all three major core courses.</P>

<P>Majors must achieve a grade point average of 2.0 or higher across thethree core courses (BIOL 210 - Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life,BIOL 220 - Multicellular Life, BIOL 230 - Ecology and Evolution) uponcompletion of the core sequence before proceeding to 300-level electivecourses. Students who do not meet the GPA requirement must repeat oneor more core courses to achieve the standard; the highest grade awardedfor any repeated core course will be exclusively used in calculating the“biology core GPA”, but all biology grades will be used to calculate theoverall major GPA for graduation, as per university policy. This policyapplies only to students pursuing a biology major; it does not apply tostudents pursuing the biology minor or other non-biology degrees.</P>

<P>The major additionally requires two semesters of introductory levelchemistry (CHEM 131 - Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamicsand CHEM 132 - Organic Structure and Reactivity; grades of C orbetter are strongly recommended). CHEM 131 - Atoms and Molecules:Structure and Dynamics must be completed before undertaking 300-levelelectives, but CHEM 132 - Organic Structure and Reactivity can be takenconcurrently.</P>

<P>Biology majors subsequently complete ﬁve 300-level advanced courses.Any combination of advanced courses may be taken, but one of theseelectives must be designated a “biological diversity” course (seedescription below). BIOL 452 - Advanced Senior Research is credited asa 300-level course, but BIOL 361 - Directed Study, BIOL 362 - DirectedStudy), BIOL 363 - Independent Study, BIOL 364 - Independent Study),and BIOL 451 - Senior Research are not counted as 300-level advancedcourses toward the requirements for the major. Students are encouragedto consult with an advisor in the Biology Department in order to select themost appropriate suite of advanced courses.</P>

<P>Biology majors preparing for medical school or most graduate programsare additionally advised to take CHEM 251 - Intermediate OrganicChemistry, and CHEM 258 - Intermediate Biochemistry, PHYS 121 -General Physics I - PHYS 122 - General Physics II), and two semestersof college-level math (e.g., MATH 130 - Essential of Calculus, MATH 135- Single Variable Calculus, or MATH 145 - Multi-variable Calculus) orMATH 120 - Elements of Statistics). These courses can count towardthe &quot;science cognate&quot; requirement that is part of the B.S. degree (seerequirements below).</P>

<P>Lastly, students majoring in Biology must satisfactorily completeBIOL 300 - Biology Assessment I (core curriculum assessment examtaken during the term immediately following completion of the biologycore) and BIOL 301 - Biology Assessment II (senior interview; takenduring the ﬁnal semester prior to graduating) in order to fulﬁll therequirements for the degree.</P>

<P>The Department of Biology is committed to awarding credit for coursesoffered through these programs that provide a sufﬁcient focus onbiological concepts and methods (lecture and laboratory). With priorapproval from the department, a maximum of two off-campus coursesmay be counted toward the requirements of the major. The Richard C.and Linda G. Seale Scholarship provides support to qualiﬁed Denisonstudents for participation in summer courses at the Duke UniversityMarine Laboratory. Financial aid may be available for other off-campusprograms.</P>

<H3>General Education Credit in Biology</H3>

<P>Students receive a lab science general education requirement bycompleting nearly any course offered by the Biology Department. Whilethe 200-level courses are generally recommended for Biology and relatedmajors, non-majors are welcome to take the initial biology major corecourse (BIOL 210 - Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life), and they canalso consider taking one of our non-majors courses. The various versionsof Modern Topics in Biology (BIOL 100 - Modern Topics in Biology:lab science GE; BIOL 103 - Modern Topics in Biology: lab science andquantitative reasoning GEs; and BIOL 104 - Modern Topics in Biology:lab science and oral communication GEs), and BIOL 110 - Biology andPolitics of Women's Health (lab science and oral communication GEs)are designed for students to explore scientiﬁc inquiry and biologicalconcepts through speciﬁc topics in the instructor's area of expertise. Inaddition, students who have had extensive biology training in secondaryschool may petition the Biology department for BIOL 100 - ModernTopics in Biology credit without General Education credit. However, suchpetitions must be made before the completion of the student's third yearat Denison.</P>

<H3>Advanced Placement</H3>

<P>Students with credit-earning scores on Advanced Placement (4 or 5)or International Baccalaureate (6 or 7) tests in Biology will be grantedacademic credit for BIOL 100 - Modern Topics in Biology. However, asnoted above, students granted such AP/IB credit typically will be requiredto complete all three major core courses for the major.</P>

<H3>Biology and Computational Science</H3>

<P>Students with an interest in both Biology and Computational Science maypursue a major in Biology with a concentration in Computational Science.Students interested in this option should refer to the description of theComputational Science concentration in the Computer Science section ofthe catalog, and should consult with a faculty member early in planningtheir Denison curriculum.</P>

<H3>Biology and Environmental Studies</H3>

<P>Students with an interest in both Biology and Environmental Studies maypursue a major in Biology with a minor in Environmental Studies, or amajor in Environmental Studies with a concentration in biology. Studentsare advised to choose the program path that best suits their post-graduate goals, and to seek early consultation with faculty in Biologyand/or Environmental Studies. Speciﬁcs regarding these options can befound in the Environmental Studies section of the catalog.</P>

<H3>Biology and Neuroscience</H3>

<P>Students with an interest in both Biology and Neuroscience may pursuea major in Biology with a concentration in Neuroscience. Studentsinterested in this option should consult with a Neuroscience facultymember early in their career.

<P>Every multicellular organism begins its life as a single cell. Developmentalbiology is the study of the progression from this single cell to a complex,multicellular organism. Recently the powerful tools of molecular biologyhave linked the ﬁelds of embryology and genetics to reveal how cells,tissues, organs, and organisms develop. Especially striking is theconservation of molecules and mechanisms that underlie developmentalprocesses in different organisms. This course provides an overview ofthe major features of early embryonic development in animals, and themechanisms (molecular mechanism when known) that underlie them.We focus on two major aspects of developmental biology: (1) How is thebasic body plan established? How does the basic organization of theembryo arise from the fertilized egg? What are the cellular mechanismsunderlying morphogenesis and the appearance of pattered structures inthe embryo? (2) How do parts become different in the embryo?</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_16223">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<Div>The Black Studies Program invites students to investigate the Blackexperience as it manifests in Africa, North America, Latin America,the Caribbean, and other parts of the African diaspora. While theProgram's primary focus is the study of the Black experience in NorthAmerica, fundamental to this enterprise is a recognition of the triangularrelationship between Africa, the Caribbean and the United States.</Div>

<Div>The Program seeks to serve the general needs of the college by providingcourse offerings across the full range of academic divisions. At thesame time, it is designed to meet the specialized interests of studentsthrough an interdisciplinary major and minor. Therefore, many appropriatecourses are found under the rubric of other departments. Black Studiesmajors and minors are encouraged to complete some portion of theirundergraduate education abroad; many off-campus study opportunitiesavailable through Denison are relevant to Black Studies and help majorsand minors gain global perspectives and experiences.</Div>

<Div>Through our courses, we teach students to write using variousdisciplinary frameworks to place Black life, experiences, and cultureat the center of their analyses or to interrogate societal dynamics thatshape, and are shaped, by Black life and culture. To do this, our students'writing might include personal narratives, formal essays, or theoreticaldiscourses. Our aim is to support students in selecting the mode ofwritten expression and developing the tools to utilize those modes ofexpression in ways that reveal, articulate, and analyze Black life andculture and the relevant dynamics of society.</Div>

<Div>The Black Studies curriculum is administered by a faculty committee andthe director of the Center for Black Studies. This committee reviews andapproves the educational plans developed by majors in consultation withthe director of the Center for Black Studies. Students wishing to major orminor in Black Studies should contact the director of the program.</Div>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_15804">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has two primary goals,which in practice are tightly interrelated. First, we seek to promotea level of scientiﬁc literacy and chemical understanding among allstudents taking courses in the department that will contribute to theUniversity’s fundamental mission “to inspire and educate our studentsto become autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and activecitizens of a democratic society.” Secondly, we will provide a rigorousand comprehensive program in chemistry and biochemistry suitablefor those students pursuing careers in science and technology. In itscourses the department seeks to progressively develop skills in buildingqualitative and quantitative interpretation of chemical phenomena, inexperimental analysis and design, and in written and oral communicationof scientiﬁc ideas. Graduates of this program, grounded in a well-developed molecular worldview, are expected to explain the behaviorof chemical and biological systems based on physical models. Thedepartment is also deeply committed to sustaining a vigorous anddiverse range of collaborative student-faculty research. A community ofmutual support among students, faculty, and staff is a vital element inachieving our goals.</P>

<P>The Chemistry and Biochemistry curriculum provides courses that aredesigned to enable students, as contributing professionals and engagedcitizens, to deal effectively with a world increasingly dominated by theideas and methods of modern science. Majors are qualiﬁed for immediateemployment in industry. However, many elect to attend graduateschool in chemistry, biochemistry, and related areas, or enter schools ofmedicine, dentistry, or engineering. The department is approved by theCommittee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society tooffer a Certiﬁcate of Professional Training in Chemistry to students whosatisfy certain requirements.</P>

<H2>Requirements for Chemistry &amp;Biochemistry Majors</H2>

<P>The department offers three options for degrees in Chemistry &amp;Biochemistry: Bachelor of Science (B.S.) programs in Chemistry and inBiochemistry that provide a rigorous course of study in preparation forprofessional careers, graduate work in chemistry/biochemistry or relatedﬁelds, or professional schools (medical, dental, pharmacology, veterinary);and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) program in Chemistry for students intendingto pursue ﬁelds such as dentistry, medicine, secondary school teachingor other areas requiring a strong chemistry background. Earning a B.A.degree does not preclude a professional scientiﬁc career, although anadditional year of undergraduate study may be required for admissionto some graduate programs. The department also offers a minor inChemistry.</P>

<P>Our program requires courses at the introductory (100), intermediate(200 and 300), and advanced (400) levels. We expect that majors willcomplete the required 300-level courses by the end of their junior year.The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry recommends stronglythat students earn a C or better in each of the core courses, CHEM 131- Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics, CHEM 132 - OrganicStructure and Reactivity, CHEM 251 - Intermediate Organic Chemistry andCHEM 258 - Intermediate Biochemistry, before proceeding to 300-levelcourses. 400-level courses, to be counted toward the major, need to betaken after the prerequisites. Any request to waive this requirement mustcome prior to taking the course. We strongly encourage all majors to havean advisor in the department.</P>

<P>Students pursuing any of the three majors are required to complete thefollowing nine common courses plus the additional courses listed foreach program:</P>

<H2>Research and ACS Certiﬁcation</H2>

<P>For students pursuing the B.S. degree in either Chemistry orBiochemistry, two semesters of Senior Research (or a summer researchexperience at Denison followed by one semester of Senior Research inthe same laboratory) may be counted as one of the 400-level electives.</P>

<P>The B.S. Chemistry major who takes two semesters of Senior Researchas part of the degree requirements will earn a degree certiﬁed to theAmerican Chemical Society. The B.S. Biochemistry major who takesCHEM 317 - Intermediate Inorganic Chemistry, two semesters of SeniorResearch and three additional 400-level CHEM courses as part of thedegree requirements will earn a degree certiﬁed to the American ChemicalSociety.</P>

<P>Majors are encouraged to participate in the various on-going researchprojects in the department. Additional research opportunities areavailable in the department during the summer and as part of the OakRidge Science Semester (http://denison.edu/academics/oak-ridge).</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<P>Students interested in teaching should consult with faculty in theDepartment of Education. Faculty and staff in the Department ofEducation assist students in creating individually designed plans forobtaining licensure through a range of programs after graduation.Students interested in pursuing a B.A. degree in Chemistry beforepursuing a teaching career are strongly encouraged to take all three 300-level Chemistry course options (as described below).</P>

<P>The Chemistry courses listed above must be taken at Denison with thefollowing exception: the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistryrecognizes the valuable contribution that off-campus study can provideto a broad liberal arts education, so one course in the major at the 300-level or higher may be taken at another institution, providing that priorapproval is received from the department. Students considering studyoff-campus are encouraged to discuss these plans with their academicadvisor early in their Denison careers. The department understands thattransfer students, students who adopt a chemistry or biochemistry majorafter the ﬁrst year, and students who study off-campus may have uniqueneeds; we encourage them to contact us so that we can work together tohelp them achieve their academic objectives.</P>

<P>Approved eye protection is required in all laboratory courses.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_15706">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P>

<P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<H3>General Departmental Regulations</H3>

<P>Students who want to fulﬁll the basic requirement in language bycontinuing one begun in secondary school will ﬁnd it advantageousto begin their course work in the ﬁrst year. The Department of ModernLanguages strongly recommends that students complete their languagerequirement by the end of their sophomore year.</P>

<H3>The Language Lab</H3>

<P>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its27 Macs, zone-free DVD player and document camera. It also has aVIA Connect PRO, which is a wireless collaboration and presentationsolution that makes sharing and presenting easier for all computersin the room. The lab provides support for learning activities outsideand inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to researchand collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authenticmaterials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only forindividualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars thatuse a variety of digital materials for class discussion.</P>

<H3>Cultural Enrichment</H3>

<P>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.</P>

<H3>The Foresman Lounge</H3>

<P>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denisoncommunity with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions,classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette witha table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It isalso equipped with a wide range of technological devices to enrich ourstudents’ learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screenTV connected to cable; the TV is also connected to a zone-free DVDplayer and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted dataprojector, which connects to a networked Mac computer, the DVD playerand document camera.</P>

<H3>The Language and Culture Program</H3>

<P>This exciting residential option gives students the opportunity to honelanguage skills and to participate in special cultural events. Students whochoose this residential option will live in close community with their peerswho share enthusiasm for language and culture study. Extracurricularactivities and programming in the Language House support languageacquisition and permit a closer relationship with professors and languageassistants from the Department of Modern Languages.</P>

<H1>Classical Studies</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_15239">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The Department of Classical Studies offers courses in the languagesand culture of ancient Greece and Rome. Students are introduced tothe intellectual, social, and cultural achievements of classical antiquitythat are the foundation for the formation and identity of modernwestern society. It is a curriculum that engenders both interdisciplinaryapproaches to knowledge and the development of analytical skills. Themajor and minor in Classical Studies entails an education focusingon the history and culture of classical antiquity. Whether throughcourses focused on classical languages, ancient history, the rhetoric ofpolitics, the logic of philosophy, or the art of poetry, the study of classicalcivilization inculcates a lucidity of expression and a predilection forreason, as it inspires creativity, civic awareness, ethical behavior, andcritical inquiry. The minor in Greek focuses on the language and cultureof ancient Greece from the Mycenaean world of Olympian gods, kingsand heroes, through the cultural and intellectual domination of thedemocracy of ﬁfth century Athens, to the Hellenistic empire and legacyof Alexander the Great. The study of Greek enables students to read theoriginal works that have deﬁned western literature and philosophy, fromthe epics of Homer to the dialogues of Plato. The minor in Latin focuseson the language and culture of ancient Rome from its origins as a smallvillage in central Italy, through its transformation into the capital of aMediterranean and European empire, to its identity as the &quot;eternal city&quot;and center of Christendom. The study of Latin enables students to readand comprehend a language that has deﬁned a literate and educatedcitizen of western society since the Roman Empire of the Caesars.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<H3>Graduate Study</H3>

<P>Students interested in pursuing graduate study in Classics shouldunderstand that such programs normally focus on the languages.Therefore, in addition to majoring in Classical Studies, students shouldalso minor in both Ancient Greek and Latin, preferably taking a languagecourse every semester as an undergraduate. A Ph.D. in Classics is theterminal degree for a combination of Ancient Greek and Latin. However,it is also possible to earn a Master’s degree in only Ancient Greek or onlyLatin, in which case a Classical Studies major may minor in either AncientGreek or Latin. Students should consult with a member of the departmentas early as possible if they are interested in graduate school in Classicsor related ﬁelds, such as Classical Archaeology.</P>

<H3>Eta Sigma Phi</H3>

<P>Classical Studies sponsors a chapter of the national honorary societyin Classics, Eta Sigma Phi. Membership in our local chapter requires thecompletion of a minimum of two courses in either Ancient Greek or Latin,a declared major or minor in the department (CLAS, GRK, or LAT), and aminimum GPA of 3.0 in the department.</P>

<H3>Departmental Recognition</H3>

<P>Majors in Classical Studies are eligible for Departmental Recognitionof Senior Research, according to guidelines established by the college,including the completion of a yearlong senior research project (CLAS 451- Senior Research and CLAS 452 - Senior Research). Students shouldconsult with the Chair of the department and the Registrar for speciﬁcrequirements and acknowledgments.</P>

<H3>Directed Studies</H3>

<P>Our current curriculum includes the possibility of a minor in AncientGreek and/or Latin. For students ﬁnishing the 111-112 sequence ofa classical language at Denison, or for those beyond the 111-112sequence, the department offers a 211 level course in the fall semesteronly, followed by CLAS 361 - Directed Study - CLAS 362 - DirectedStudy or CLAS 363 - Independent Study - CLAS 364 - Independent Study.Faculty members in the department supervise Directed or IndependentStudies, following a &quot;tutorial&quot; model. There is a syllabus for these courses(361-362-363-364) based on the author, topic, or genre being studied; toqualify as a course toward the minor, it must be taken for 4 credits. ForDirected or Independent Studies in Ancient Greek or Latin, students mustwork with a faculty member in the department and receive permissionfrom the department Chair, completing the appropriate form availablefrom the Registrar's Ofﬁce.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_14862">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The Communication Department offers a rigorous and robustcurriculum that addresses three overarching areas of study: RelationalCommunication, Rhetoric, and Media Studies. In the tradition of theliberal arts, we encourage students to take courses from all threeareas of study to appreciate the complexity of communication. It isour commitment to educate autonomous thinkers who use moraldiscernment when addressing the issues of our time through acurriculum that engages students in intersecting media, texts, andinteractions when analyzing meaning-making in any given context.</P>

<P>Our curriculum emphasizes cognitive complexity in processes of inquiry,analysis, reflection, writing, and speaking.</P>

<P>Throughout the curriculum we generate opportunities in many waysfor students to practice what they are learning. Students practice thediscipline through structured opportunities that promote original researchin senior seminars, conference presentations, journal publications,and summer research. In terms of less traditional modes of practicestudents have multiple opportunities to address publics through speakingand writing, ethically engaging with other students from a variety ofbackgrounds and perspectives, using technology as agents rather thanconsumers, and interrogating and rethinking the performance of the self.Insofar as &quot;practicing&quot; the discipline involves mindful awareness andreflection on the processes of communication that continually surroundstudents, the department does this as a matter of course.</P>

<P>COMM 140 - The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentiousstruggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one’s cultural“taste” was a signiﬁcant factor in determining one’s standing in thesocial hierarchy. Debates about “high” vs “low” culture and about whatcultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a communityhave involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us witha lens through which to understand historical social changes. It alsoallows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instanceabout the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historicalprecedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeksto trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe totheir culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In sodoing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competingideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading someof the prominent theorists of “high” culture and then problematize theirarguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posedby the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historicaldebate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popularculture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways toanalyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we oftenunthinkingly consume.</P>

Rather than focusing onquestions of harmonic theory (as a music theory class would do) or thescience of cognition (as a psychology or neuroscience class would do),it explores how musical meaning is rooted in cultural experience. As aCommunication course, it explores how our everyday interactions aroundmusic—our aesthetic arguments, our uses of music to sell productsand ideas, even also our uses of music to police behavior and eventorture others—are deeply tied to social processes of identity, ideology,and power. Class materials and methods will be drawn from sources inmusic, sound studies, cultural studies, rhetoric, media studies, relationalcommunication, and newly emerging sub-, inter-, and trans-disciplinaryﬁelds.</P>

How do cultural performances (musical concerts,sporting events, or dance) help us better understand ourselves and oursociety? In this class we examine a range of theories that see privatebehaviors and public performances as rehearsed, audience-oriented, andcreative acts. Theorists such as Erving Goffman, Judith Butler, PierreBourdieu, and Victor Turner will guide our examination of both &quot;everyday&quot;performativity (in regard to bodily stigma and identities of class, race,gender, and sexuality) and cultural performances (such as musicalconcerts, sporting events, and dance).

In readings, screenings, written assignments, anddiscussions you develop a working knowledge of different intellectualtraditions used to study media. From the very start, the course pushespast simplistic, binary assessments of media consumption as beingeither “good” or “bad.” Instead, we survey the complicated routes throughwhich media forms and practices inform people’s understandings ofthemselves and the world around them. Organized into three units, thecourse aims to provide you with conceptual frames for 1) understandingthe relationship between media and culture, 2) identifying how mediamake claims to represent truth and authenticity, and 3) comprehendingthe role of media in ideological conflict. Throughout the term, you areasked to question many ideas and beliefs that people take for granted:that media are “bad” for children, that some television programmingis “realistic,” or that we could ever exist outside the web of mediatedcommunication that informs our day-to-day lives, even if we wanted todo just that. The overarching aim of the course is nuance – a deeperunderstanding of media, and a reﬁned critical lens of assessing its role incontemporary life.</P>

<P>COMM 345 - Cultural Globalization and Identity (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>This course will critically engage with the phenomenon of the globalcirculation of culture. It will seek to understand the consequences ofthe process whereby texts, ideas and images that for long remainedconﬁned to their locations of origin are today increasingly mobile andde-territorialized. Objects of popular culture such as television, cinemaand music, are circulating and being consumed around the world andare helping challenge the traditional markers of human identity suchas nation, culture and language. While they are allowing individuals toimagine alternatives to existing realities they are also engendering abacklash against a perceived imposition of new ideas, values and culture.This course will seek to familiarize students with these ongoing changesand the conflicts over cultural and national identity that it has given riseto. We will begin with arguments that present a totalizing view of thisprocess (the Cultural Imperialism thesis) and then over the course of thesemester complicate and nuance those arguments by introducing agencyand empowerment for the consumers of global culture. We will do thisby closely studying actual case studies (from reality TV in Saudi Arabiaor McDonalds in Japan) in order to understand the stakes involved inthe struggle to deﬁne and &quot;protect&quot; national and cultural identity. At theend of this semester long course students should have gained a deepunderstanding of why the process of global flow of culture is a deeplycontentious and political phenomenon. Understanding these conflictsthrough the lens of identity will help students complicate that term aswell as interrogate their views about their own identity.</P>

<H2>Computational Science Concentration</H2>

<P>Computational Science is the ﬁeld of study concerned with constructingmathematical models and numerical solution techniques, and usingcomputer algorithms and simulation to analyze and solve scientiﬁc,social scientiﬁc, and engineering problems. The Computational Scienceconcentration consists of four core courses - MATH 145 (124), 213(231), CS 173 and one of CS 109, 110, 111, or 112, and an additionalcourse at the 200 level or above. This additional course, which may bein another department, must have a strong and persistent mathematicalmodeling or computing component and must be approved in advanceby the Mathematics and Computer Science Department. In addition, thestudent must take a two-semester sequence of courses in a departmentother than Mathematics and Computer Science. A written plan forcompleting the concentration must be approved by the Mathematics andComputer Science Department prior to enrollment in the elective course.In particular, the elective course and cognate requirements above mustbe chosen in consistence with a valid educational plan for the study ofComputational Science (as deﬁned above). Any mathematics major whowishes to complete this concentration must choose a computer sciencecourse as an elective course. Any computer science major who wishes tocomplete this concentration must choose a mathematics course as anelective course. A double mathematics and computer science major isnot eligible for this concentration.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<P>Students who intend to continue with graduate study in ComputerScience should pursue the Bachelor of Science degree.</P>

<P>Computer Science students should be adept at not only solvingproblems through the implementation of computer programs, but also incommunicating those solutions to a wide variety of audiences. Studentsshould learn the proper use of documentation to share their programswith users and other computer scientists, be prepared to compose proofsand analyses of their algorithms, and have opportunities to write formalpapers.</P>

<H3>Research at Denison</H3>

<P>Denison offers a number of research opportunities, including fundingfor summer research projects.  The Anderson Foundation and theDenison University Research Foundation (DURF) support qualiﬁedstudents conducting summer research. For off-campus researchopportunities in Computer Science, see the Oak Ridge Science Semesterdescribed at http://denison.edu/academics/oak-ridge or various NationalScience Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5049) experiences.Interested students should consult a faculty member as early as possiblein the fall semester.</P>

<H3>Off-Campus Study</H3>

<P>The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science stronglyencourages students to globalize their education by completing someportion of their undergraduate education abroad. A majority of Denisonstudents spend a semester abroad during their junior year and manymore spend a summer (or two) abroad. Denison offers a wide rangeof opportunities to study off-campus that are highly relevant to yourDenison experience.</P>

<P>Going abroad allows students to enhance their knowledge whileexperiencing another culture and way of life. Students gain valuableexperience that will beneﬁt future career goals and/or graduate schoolopportunities. Math and Computer Science majors who are fluent inanother language will have special advantages in the job market.</P>

<P>Students may take up to two classes outside the department to transfertowards the major at Denison.  Additional courses taken outside Denisonmay accrue credit hours towards graduation, but will not contribute torequirements in the major.  Courses taken outside the university mustbe pre-approved for acceptance towards major requirements.  Studentsshould provide the department chair syllabi for the intended courses fordepartment approval.  Students may petition the department chair forexceptions to this policy.  In particular, transfer students may be eligibleto transfer additional courses towards major requirements.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_13642">Mission Statement and Goals</H2>

<P>We believe that vital dance artists and scholars develop fromindependent thinkers who are committed to cultivating a personalaesthetic and artistic focus, and who resourcefully engage in originalresearch and commit to the construction of knowledge. Our missionsupports the development of student artists/scholars who are informedcitizens and responsible agents of positive change in a world where themoving arts are essential. Our goal of exposing students to cutting edgeand experimental dance practices from diverse cultures and with globalperspectives is embedded in our curriculum and ideology. The focus ofour movement practices intentionally centralizes Modern/PostmodernDance and African/African-Diasporan forms, shifting the paradigm ofdance education away from a ballet-centered model. The integration ofembodied practices with scholarly inquiry is integral to our mission.</P>

<P>Writing within the Major: Both dance scholars and dance artists cometo better understand their ideas and those of others through writing.We focus our teaching of writing on experiential and conceptual ideasprompted by, and about, the body, to generate precise description andsophisticated analysis. Our aim is to hone students’ observation andreflection skills, and ability to document these intelligently and conciselythrough writing.</P>

<H2>Requirements for the Major in Dance (B.A.Degree)</H2>

<P>36 credits minimum The Bachelor of Arts degree in Dance reflects aphilosophy that integrates principles of theory and practice resultingin the discovery of an original voice. &quot;Movement Practices&quot; coursesengage students in dance technique and performance work, and inlearning and applying physical skills to the creation and reconstructionof African/Diasporan and modern/postmodern dance. &quot;Dance Studies&quot;courses emphasize creating, moving, recording, reading and writing,exposing the fundamental patterns of skilled movement acquisition,generating close textual analysis of speciﬁc movement forms, practicingdance making, and culturally contextualizing the diversity of danceforms. Advanced Studies courses provide opportunities to deepen andintegrate through independent research. In all courses, the boundariesbetween practice and theory are purposefully blurred, indicating ourcommitment to a liberal arts curriculum rather than a conservatorymodel. Denison University works to make study abroad possible forall students. Studying dance abroad allows students to experienceanother culture and way of life through the lens of movement and dancestudies. These opportunities integrate the department’s mission andmake possible a deepening understanding and expansive perspective onmovement in a global context. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study ofﬁce to explore their options.</P>

<P>Alternatively, a student may submit an individualized 3-4 course electiveplan, which must include at least one analytics-intensive course, to beconsidered for approval by the Data Analytics Committee.  A successfulone-page proposal will clearly describe the student’s desired learninggoals and how the proposed courses together achieve these goals. The proposal should also demonstrate the feasibility of completing theproposed courses in the time remaining before graduation.  Proposalsmust be submitted prior to the end of the sophomore year.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<P>Students who want to acquire deeper technical skills in data analyticsmay take additional advanced courses such as MATH 145 - Multi-variableCalculus, MATH 213 - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, CS 173- Intermediate Computer Science, CS 271 - Data Structures, MATH 435- Mathematical Modeling, CS 337 - Operations Research, MATH 415 -Operations Research, and CS 339 - Artiﬁcial Intelligence. Students mayalso pursue a second major in Computer Science or Mathematics. Due tosome course overlaps, these options require only 6-7 additional courses.</P>

<Div>
<Div>
<P>DA 101 - Introduction to Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Many of the most pressing problems in the world can be addressedwith data. We are awash in data and modern citizenship demands thatwe become literate in how to interpret data, what assumptions andprocesses are necessary to analyze data, as well as how we mightparticipate in generating our own analyses and presentations of data.Consequently, data analytics is an emerging ﬁeld with skills applicableto a wide variety of disciplines. This course introduces analysis,computation, and presentation concerns through the investigation ofdata driven puzzles in wide array of ﬁelds – political, economic, historical,social, biological, and others. No previous experience is required.</P>
</Div>

<Div>
<P>DA 200 - Data Analytics Colloquium (1 Credit Hour)</P>

<P>The Data Analytics colloquium involves three central learningcomponents. 1) regular engagement with guest presentations andcommunity activities in data analytics, 2) group discussion featuringcritical analysis and connection of themes found in the guestpresentations and in related data analytics topics, and 3) preparationand reﬁnement of professional communication skills necessary for therequired internship component of the data analytics major. This courseprovides an opportunity for students to connect on data analytics ideasand applications, using a range of perspectives that may or may not benormally encountered in a traditional course. Students will develop theknowledge, skills, and methods they need to progress to more advancedlearning, while also creating bridges with members of the data analyticscommunity within and outside of Denison. The course must be takentwice by majors: once as a sophomore, and again as either a junior orsenior.</P>

<P>Prerequisite(s): DA 101 (may be taken concurrently).</P>

<Div>
<P>DA 301 - Practicum in Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Utilizing Denison as a model of society, this practicum set in a seminarwill explore questions of collective import through the analysis of newand existing sources of data at Denison. A problem-driven approach willlead to the acquisition of new, appropriate data analytic skills, set in anethical context that carefully considers the implications of data displayand policy recommendations on community members. A signiﬁcantcomponent of the course is working with policymaking and implementingprofessionals on campus and developing presentation skills appropriatefor professional communication with the public. Though a signiﬁcantlearning opportunity itself, this course should also be seen as a prelude toa community internship in the post-Junior year summer.</P>

<P>Prerequisite(s): DA 101, CS 181 and MATH 220, or consent of instructor.</P>
</Div>

<Div>
<P>DA 350 - Advanced Methods for Data Analytics (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>This course is designed to develop students' understanding of the cuttingedge methods and algorithms of data analytics and how they can beused to answer questions about real-world problems. These methods,and the underlying models, can be used to learn from existing datato make predictions about new data. The course will examine bothsupervised and unsupervised methods and will include topics such asclustering, classiﬁcation, and network analysis.</P>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_13247">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Denison Seminars are specially designed courses offered each semesterfocusing on topics that integrate and transcend traditional departmental,programmatic, and/or divisional boundaries. Denison Seminars are liberalarts courses that are directed toward a broad and diverse audience.They have no prerequisites.  Enrollments in Seminars are limited to 8-16students with sophomore or junior standing. Denison Seminars areinnovative, exciting opportunities open to all Denison sophomores andjuniors.</P>

<P>Many Denison Seminars include a travel component. Students normallyare charged a fee of $800 for a course with a travel component outsideof North America, and $500 for a course with travel within NorthAmerica.  Fees are automatically waived for those students withsigniﬁcant ﬁnancial need as determined by the Financial Aid Ofﬁce. Because of the unique nature of Denison Seminars, students normallymay take no more than one (see Additional Points of Interest).</P>

<P>Denison Short-Term Seminars are normally 2-credit courses (creditapplied in the fall semester following completion of a summer or breakexperience).  The short-term seminars are advertised in the fall semesterand are enrolled via contacting the instructor.  Students pay all costsunless they are determined to have very signiﬁcant need by the FinancialAid Ofﬁce.  Those with very signiﬁcant need will pay a deposit fee,normally $500, to enroll in the experience.  Every effort is made to makeDenison Seminars and other faculty-led opportunities affordable for everystudent.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<P>Preference is given to sophomore and junior students who have not hada prior Denison Seminar and are not concurrently enrolled in a DenisonSeminar.  Students who have already taken a Denison Seminar or areenrolled in one may take a second or subsequent seminar if there areseats available in it after the close of the registration period. In addition,students may petition the Academic Standing Board to request that theybe given, as an exception, the same preference in registration as thosestudents who have not had a seminar even if the petitioner has taken aseminar before.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_12317">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The purpose of the economics curriculum is to educate students inthe nature and uses of economic reasoning. We are an economicsdepartment that values diverse theoretical and methodologicalperspectives on economic analysis and its application. We are cognizantof the importance of the other social and natural sciences, the arts, andthe humanities to a more complete understanding of human society. Ourcurriculum introduces students to a core body of economic knowledgeand to research skills, integrating disciplinary education with the liberalarts mission of the university. Economics majors develop the ability tothink analytically and creatively about complex economic issues andpolicy choices facing our global society.</P>

<P>The content of our curriculum is tiered. In introductory courses studentslearn the basic principles of economics. In intermediate courses studentsdevelop their understanding of microeconomic, macroeconomic, andeconometric theory. The 200-level electives give students an opportunityearly in their careers to use introductory theory to better understand theirworld. The 400-level electives give students an opportunity to study indepth, a particular ﬁeld of economics through application of the requisitebasic skills, and appropriate theoretical models and empirical methods.These courses primarily focus on national and international concerns,public policies, and controversies in economic theory and policy.</P>

<P>Good economic writing represents good economic thinking. TheEconomics Department encourages students to cultivate the habitsof good economic writing by requiring students to take one electivecourse that satisﬁes the department's writing requirement. Students areexpected to use the vocabulary and theories of economics to correctlymake cogent evidence-based arguments.</P>

<P>The Department of Economics supports students who globalize theireducation by completing some portion of their undergraduate educationabroad. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study Ofﬁceto explore their options. If a student studies abroad then: (1) Only oneeconomics course can transfer in to satisfy major requirements. (2)That course must have economics prerequisites. If Economics 101 andEconomics 102 are prerequisites, then the course transfers in as a 200-level elective. If the prerequisite is Economics 301 or Economics 302,then it transfers in as a 400-level elective. (3) The course must be aneconomics course, not a business or similar course. (4) Economics 301,302, and 307 may not be taken abroad.</P>

<P>Graduates of the Department of Economics seeking immediateemployment have been successful in securing interesting andchallenging positions in business, government, and non-proﬁtenterprises. The economics curriculum also provides students with theopportunity to prepare themselves for graduate or professional studies ineconomics, business, public administration, international affairs, law andothers.</P>

<P>Economic growth is traditionally perceived as the solution to thesocio-economic ills of poverty, unemployment and more generallyunderdevelopment. However, economic growth is also accompaniedby increased pressure on and, over time, deterioration of the naturalenvironment. The objective of this course is to explore the relationshipbetween economic growth and the natural environment. While theconcept of economic growth occupies a central place in economic policy-making, we will discuss whether economic growth is compatible with thesustainable-development worldview adopted by the UN and many otherglobal and local economic actors. Sustainable development emphasizesthe need to embark upon a development path that not only takes intoaccount the environmental, social and economic needs of the presentgeneration, but also those of future ones.</P>

Thesecond section of the course will look at a variety of explanations forincreasing income inequality. We will examine how the key themes oftechnical change, de-industrialization, immigration and globalizationshaped the American economy over the last several decades. The primaryfocus of the ﬁrst two sections will be upon income inequalities arisingfrom changes in the ideological, demographic, macroeconomic andinstitutional context. In addition, we will investigate the impact of thesetrends on the middle class and different segments of the labor force.Finally, we will discuss why inequality might matter and how the trendsdiscussed in the course could shape America’s future and discusswhether and what policy changes might be needed.</P>

<P>ECON 417 - The Eurozone: Optimal Currency Area or IncompleteMonetary Union? (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the ﬁrst successful multi-national, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Severalcountries in many regions of the world (such as South America, theMiddle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the stepsof the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in thenear future. However, the ﬁnancial crisis of the late 2000s followed bythe sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception ofthe Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we willseek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broaderevolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socio-economic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of theEurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomicmodels which underlie the concept of ‘optimal currency area’ and aninvestigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completedproject. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutionsto the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone)will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and todiscuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives thatmember-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. thepursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranationalﬁscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political andeconomic devolution towards smaller scale European projects.</P>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_12097">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The Department of Education emphasizes the study of education as asocial institution and analysis of teaching and learning in interdisciplinaryterms. The Educational Studies major is designed for students who wishto prepare for a career in education in elementary or secondary schools,or in the broader community. The curriculum introduces students tolearning theory and the social foundations of education, and it allowsfor experiential learning in the ﬁeld. This study ﬁts well into a broaderliberal arts education and allows time for students to complete amajor in an additional ﬁeld of study, for example, in the discipline oneintends to teach. The Educational Studies major does not lead directlyto licensure; however, faculty in the Department of Education assiststudents in creating individually designed plans for obtaining licensureafter graduation through a range of graduate and other programs.</P>

<P>Educational Studies students will have multiple opportunities tocommunicate original thinking through writing, to explore various genres,and to address diverse audiences through course assignments. Studentswill learn how to develop a focused, well-supported essay. Also, theywill acquire the skills to blend written language with other modes tocommunicate a message, and how to navigate various formattingguidelines informing the ﬁeld of education. During their senior year,students will reflect upon a collection of essays they have producedin previous courses through a capstone, portfolio project. The projectinvites them to assess the themes, areas of growth and quality, and towitness their engagement in writing as a process.</P>

<P>Educational Studies students are encouraged to consider taking asemester off-campus. This option allows for comparative study ofeducation and often, extended apprenticeships in schools. EducationalStudies students have studied, for instance, in Chile, England, Denmark,Northern Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and The Philadelphia Center.Please contact an Educational Studies faculty member for more details.  The Department plans to launch a collaborative learning initiative withTurku University, Finland in 2019.</P>

We have designed a programthat meets a variety of needs and enables students to pursue a varietyof personal and professional goals, whether deﬁned by individual orcollaborative intent, subject breadth or depth, instructional model, sourceengagement, writing development, or other pedagogical features. Thefaculty in English participate actively in the General Education Program,the Writing Program, Women's and Gender Studies, Black Studies, QueerStudies, International Studies, Environmental Studies, and servicelearning opportunities.</P>

<P>All students may enjoy readings and lectures made possible by theendowed Harriet Ewens Beck Fund, which has brought such writersas Susan Orlean, Ted Kooser, Alice Walker, Bill Bryson, Maxine HongKingston, Adrienne Rich, Louise Erdrich, and Antonya Nelson for visitsor residencies each year. The curriculum in English is also enhanced bya variety of opportunities for students to pursue publishing their workslocally in a variety of student-edited journals.

<H1>Environmental Studies</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_11073">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<Div>Environmental Studies is an interdisciplinary inquiry into the relationshipbetween humans and the environment. Both a major and a minor areavailable to students with an interest in the rigorous study of theseissues. The major requires students to develop a speciﬁc environmentalfocus as a concentration in addition to the environmental core anddistribution courses. The minor in ENVS allows students to integrate anenvironmental perspective with their major ﬁeld of study.</Div>

<Div>As an interdisciplinary area, Environmental Studies draws on workin the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. Itendeavors to bridge these many intellectual approaches and perspectivesin the hope that students will gain a deeper understanding both of theenvironmental concerns facing the world and of proactive opportunitiesfor change. Among issues of concern and investigation are resourceutilization, the impact of technology on ecosystems, relationshipsbetween the environment and sociocultural systems, geographicanalysis, environmental economics and policy, conservation of biologicaldiversity, nature writing, alternative dispute resolution, environmentalpsychology, political ecology, environmental photography, sustainableagriculture and environmental ethics, among many others.</Div>

<Div>Students who major in ENVS choose an area of concentration during thesophomore year.  Prospective ENVS majors are encouraged to discusspossible concentrations with any of the ENVS-afﬁliated faculty listedabove prior to the sophomore year.    </Div>

<Div>ENVS courses and General Education (GE) requirements </Div>

<Div>Courses taken under the ENVS heading typically fulﬁll the Interdivisional(I) General Education requirement.  In the case of cross-listed courses,students may choose to enroll under the ENVS heading to earn theInterdivisional (I) GE, or the heading of the home department to earnthe GE designation appropriate for that department.  In either case, thecourse will count toward the ENVS major or minor.  </Div>

<Div>Off-Campus Study</Div>

<Div>Students are encouraged to participate in study abroad programs whenappropriate to enhance the concentration area or otherwise supplementcourse offerings at Denison. Students who want to study abroad shouldplan to do so during their junior year. Courses taken abroad that serveas substitutes for courses listed above or that are otherwise used tosatisfy elements of the Environmental Studies major must be approvedin advance by the Environmental Studies Director, prior to the student'sdeparture for the off campus program. A maximum of two off-campuscourses may be used to satisfy requirements in the major for studentswho spend one semester off-campus, and a maximum of three off-campus courses may be used to satisfy requirements in the major forstudents who spend two semesters off-campus.</Div>

<Div>
<Div>
<P>ENVS 100 - Integrated Environmental Studies (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>In this course the student will consider environmental problems throughthe lenses of many different academic disciplines. The purpose ofthis approach is two-fold: 1) to enhance the student’s understandingof environmental issues as multi-dimensional dilemmas, and 2) toencourage the student to seek synergistic solutions. The coursefocuses on three major realms of environmental studies. In the ﬁrst,students will consider the human relationship with the non-human world,including problems of ethics, social and psychological connectionswith nature, ecological services, biodiversity, aesthetics and utility. Thesecond section addresses agriculture and aquaculture in the context ofecological limits, economics and policy. The third section explores theglobal aspects of energy use and climate change, with special emphasison technology, disparity and human rights. The laboratory component ofthe course will expose the student to local and regional environmentalproblems and solutions. Field trips, guest speakers, analysis anddiscussion will emphasize the necessity of multidisciplinary integrationin the design of sustainable environmental systems. Students willapply concepts of quantitative, qualitative and representative analysisto evaluate environmental questions and will learn to convey theseconcepts in writing. Course fulﬁlls Interdivisional (I) GE requirement.</P>
</Div>

<Div>
<P>ENVS 102 - Science and the Environment (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>This course provides an introduction to the biogeochemical aspectsof environmental problems.

<P>ENVS 236 - Political Ecology (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>What really causes deforestation? How is a ﬁsh ‘cultural?’ Why doAmericans spend so much time and money on their lawns? Should webe saving people or endangered species? Why are ecosystem servicesso hard to privatize? Is obesity truly just a question of consuming toomany calories? These are all questions that political ecology can helpus to answer. Political ecology is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld that situatesenvironmental change within broader networks of political, economic, andsocial relations. It differs from other environmental approaches in thatit views power, material nature, everyday struggles and practices, socialjustice, and discourse to be critical components of human-environmentinteractions. In this course, we will: (a) study the theoretical foundationsof political ecology, (b) evaluate some of the theses it puts forward,and (c) apply political ecology insights to contemporary environmentalissues.

The premise ofthe course is this: if you want to improve the state of the planet, youhave to propose a solution. To make a solution happen, you shouldunderstand the process of getting an idea through the decision-makingsystem. Effecting change requires a background in the system(s) thatmake things happen, whether you ultimately want to work within thesystem or outside it. This course is divided into two main components:an overview and implementation of problem solving techniques, and anin-depth examination of the U.S. Congress' role in environmental policyformation. The latter section culminates in a &quot;Moot Congress&quot; undertakenby students at the end of the semester. Not recommended for ﬁrst yearstudents.

<P>ENVS 256 - Farmscape: Visual Immersion in the Food System (4 CreditHours)</P>

<P>Every human being has an intimate relationship with food, often withdeep emotional facets. Yet we in the U.S. know very little about the foodsystem that sustains us – it is a mysterious and often invisible set ofprocesses, organizations, and people. This remarkably complex web ofinputs, labor, machinery, laws, subsidies, mergers, and so many othercomponents is one that we take largely for granted. This class seeksto align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. Acritical part of our existence that we experience through all of our sensesis one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we havethis occasion to use sight in a formalized way – photography – to tellnew stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding offood, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curatorialprocess of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly uniqueopportunity. Our immersion in these critical issues can bring full circle theunderstanding we gain through many eyes to enhance awareness in otherpeople about the ways in which our food system connects us all together.Course fulﬁlls the ENVS Humanities/Arts requirement.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_10817">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P>

<P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skillsand knowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language.When students take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use thetarget language in subsequent courses dealing with the culture. TheDepartment emphasizes the use of the target language in most of itscourses because it believes that students can best appreciate a culturefrom within its own mode of expression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>Students who want to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). Students who have taken FREN 214 - What Makes the FrenchFrench? may also enroll in the intensive summer program in Martinique(contact Dr. Armstrong, Dr. Choquet or Dr. Mokam for more information).On-campus opportunities to improve their command of the languageare provided by the Language and Culture Program, language tables,international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

<H3>The Language Lab</H3>

<P>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its27 Macs, zone-free DVD player and document camera. It also has aVIA Connect PRO which is a wireless collaboration and presentationsolution that makes sharing and presenting easier for all computersin the room. The lab provides support for learning activities outsideand inside the classroom, ranging from grammar drills to researchand collaborative writing projects, as well as discussions of authenticmaterials published on the Internet. The area is designed not only forindividualized instruction but also for group work and small seminars thatuse a variety of digital materials for class discussion.</P>

<H3>General Department Regulations</H3>

<P>Students planning to major in the Department are advised to begincourse work in the ﬁrst year. Those who wish to fulﬁll the basicrequirement in language by continuing one begun in secondary schoolwill ﬁnd it advantageous to begin their course work in the ﬁrst year.Whether students satisfy the language requirement by continuing withtheir secondary-school language or by taking up a new language, theDepartment of Modern Languages strongly recommends that studentscomplete their language requirement by the end of their sophomore year.</P>

<H3>Cultural Enrichment</H3>

<P>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.</P>

<H3>The Foresman Lounge</H3>

<P>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denisoncommunity with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions,classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette witha table and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It isalso equipped with a wide range of technological devices to enrich ourstudents’ learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screenTV connected to cable; the TV is also connected to a zone-free DVDplayer and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted dataprojector that connects to a networked Mac computer, the DVD playerand document camera.</P>

<H3>The Language and Culture Program</H3>

<P>This exciting residential option gives students the opportunity tohone their language skills and to participate in special cultural events.Students who choose this residential option will live in close communitywith their peers who share their enthusiasm for languages and cultures.Extracurricular activities and programming in the Language Housesupport language acquisition and permit a closer relationship withprofessors and language assistants from the Department of ModernLanguages.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_10497">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>In the Department of Geosciences we investigate the Earth in thebroadest sense: how it formed, how it evolved and continues to evolve,how Earth systems interact to produce the environment in which welive, and how present and future changes may affect the habitability ofEarth. The central goal of the department is to educate students aboutthe nature and history of the Earth, the processes that shape the Earth,and the impacts those processes have on human populations.</P>

<P>An understanding of the Earth is an important component of globalcitizenship. Many critical environmental issues face humanity, includingglobal climate change, water shortages, loss of arable land, naturalhazards such as earthquakes and flooding, and the availability ofpetroleum and other energy resources. Citizens and professionals withtraining in the geosciences will contribute to addressing these and otherproblems, while increasing opportunities for humans to live sustainablyon the Earth.</P>

<P>The department provides non-majors with a basic knowledge of theEarth and Earth processes that will serve their needs as future citizensand community leaders. Geoscience majors and minors develop astrong background in the geosciences in preparation for employmentopportunities in ﬁelds such as environmental science, geotechnicalengineering, exploration for natural resources, geologic research,environmental law, and earth science teaching. Many geosciencegraduates continue their training in graduate school; others enter thework force directly.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_10282">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P>

<P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in subsequent courses dealing with the culture and society.The Department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of itscourses because it believes that students can best appreciate a culturefrom within its own mode of expression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, political science, and English. Courses in culturalstudies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, also presentmultiple perspectives on other cultures and various areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

<H1>Global Commerce</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_10057">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The Global Commerce major explores the globalized nature of moderncommerce—the exchange of goods, services, information, and currency,both for-proﬁt and non-proﬁt. The major provides an interdisciplinaryexamination of globalization and its relationship to markets, exchange,and organizational cultures.</P>

<P>Language study at least to the intermediate level is fundamental to theGlobal Commerce major.  When students declare the GC major, they mustidentify their language of study to ensure that they will be in a positionto use their developing language skills as they progress through themajor.  In addition to this language facility, throughout their GC majorexperience, students develop sophisticated analytical skills in assessingand engaging in a globalized society.</P>

<P>To that end, the major is built around 5 “Commerce Core” courses (inaddition to ECON 101 - Introductory Macroeconomics and ECON 102 -Introductory Microeconomics, and MATH 120 - Elements of Statistics).  In the introductory GC 101 - Commerce and Society, students explorethe relationships between commerce and society in different timesand places, through a variety of humanities and social science lenses.  In GC 200 - Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce, sophomoremajors design a “Global Focus” that will allow them to develop a deepunderstanding of a particular geographic area by studying its culture,history, social and political context, and language(s).  The goal of thisglobal focus is not to make the GC major a specialist in one region ofthe world but, rather, to develop their capacity to adapt to working in anyglobal region by knowing what kinds of information is required to operateeffectively in an unfamiliar society.</P>

<P>GC 200 - Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce is paired withGC 201 - Elements of Commerce, which exposes students to a coreof applied skills related to the areas of commerce, business, globalorganizations, and entrepreneurship (i.e., skills related to multipleworkplace environments) and fosters students’ understanding of how theliberal arts underpin and support these skills.  Junior majors take GC 301- Global Financial Markets, in which they examine the global dynamicsof markets, market regulation, and ﬁnancial institutions.  GC 401 -Global Commerce Senior Seminar, the senior capstone seminar, requiresstudents to articulate and apply their accumulated knowledge from theirGlobal Commerce major experiences, inside and outside the classroom,in part by producing a ﬁnal semester-long, team-based assignment inwhich they create a team plan, collect and analyze data, and craft aproposal for a global commerce-related initiative.  In addition to workingwith experienced and dedicated Denison faculty, these courses offer GCmajors opportunities to interact with visiting speakers, including alumniand Columbus-area professionals, in conversations about the dynamicsand challenges of globalized commerce.</P>

<P>In addition to these required courses, the GC program offers majors arobust co-curricular program that enriches student engagement withone another and with faculty teaching courses in both the CommerceCore, and courses related to the global areas of study.  (Learn more aboutGlobal Commerce Outside the Classroom.)</P>

<P>Learning goals for the Global Commerce major include the developmentof an advanced understanding of the complex ways in which theeconomy and trade are connected to culture, social movements, andother global factors; immersion in the study of a particular geographicarea—or the connections between multiple regions for the transregionaloption—emphasizing the study of culture, history, social context, andlanguage; building well-developed cultural fluency skills, includingintermediate-level facility with at least one foreign language; thedevelopment of student creativity and autonomy in creating a meaningfuland coherent global focus or transregional option; the integration of asigniﬁcant off-campus experience with the curricular study of commerceand cultural context; the development of a sound understanding ofthe elements of commerce, including familiarity with basic aspects ofﬁnancial accounting, spreadsheet proﬁciency, business language andetiquette, and business ethics; and the development of a supportive andengaged student cohort in the major.</P>

<H3>Language Courses</H3>

<P>Signiﬁcant language study is essential to understanding the dynamicsof a global society, to competing with international candidates for jobs,and to operating to full effect in global businesses and organizations.All Global Commerce majors are required to attain depth in a languageother than English, typically by taking at least two language coursesbeyond the 112 level. Additional language study is strongly encouraged,and any additional language courses can apply toward the Global Focus.If students are already native speakers of a language other than English,they will still be expected to fulﬁll the language requirement of the GlobalCommerce major by studying at least two semesters of a language otherthan English.</P>

<H3>Global Focus</H3>

<P>The Global Commerce major seeks to integrate the study of commercewith a deep understanding of the cultures and societies of a geographicalregion beyond North America. Courses in the Global Focus are drawnfrom the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Majors choose one of thefollowing geographic areas as a Global Focus:</P>

<P>The Global Focus consists of six courses (see lists of qualifying coursesavailable from the Global Commerce ofﬁce each semester), at least fourof which must address the particular region of study. Two of the coursescan be cognates that relate to global commerce and/or internationalissues generally but do not necessarily focus on the student’s selectedregion. Up to three of the Global Focus courses may be taken off-campus.Any exceptions must be approved by the Global Commerce Director inconsultation with the Global Commerce committee. Students will developa cohesive curricular plan for their Global Focus in GC 200 - Global FocusProposal for Global Commerce.</P>

<H4>Transregional Option</H4>

<P>The Global Focus component of the major also can be fulﬁlled througha “transregional option.” In this option, students focus on the flowand exchange of a variety of elements—such as information, goods,services, or labor—between two or more geographic regions. Thesophomore seminar proposal must make a clear case for the pursuitof the transregional option and for the coherence of their six proposedcourses. Students electing to pursue the transregional option must stillmeet the Global Commerce language requirement.</P>

<H3>Off-Campus Study</H3>

<P>An off-campus experience is required of Global Commerce majors.Ideally, the off-campus experience occurs in the geographical regionof the Global Focus or is tied to the Global Focus in terms of topicsof study. In the GC 200 - Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerceproposal assignment, students are required to indicate and explainthe rationale supporting their choice of an off-campus experience.

Physical exercise improves physical capacity.Performance guides self-referential thought. Competition yields a drivefor improvement. And that striving for success within a team enlightensthe ties that shape community. At each level, there is agreement thatindividuals must exercise autonomous thought, act individually withinthe context of their moral structure, and contribute to the sharedenvironment.</Div>

<H1>History</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_8944">Departmental Guidelines and LearningGoals</H2>

<H3>Mission</H3>

<P>History is a way of thinking about the world that teaches us to valueand embrace the complexities and ambiguities of life. Students learn tosee the multiple layers of causes and effects, changes and continuities,individual experiences and broader social dynamics that shape humansocieties and cultures across time and place. History questions not only,what happened, but even more importantly, why did something happenthe way it did? How were different people engaged and impacted? Whatdid this change mean to people in that time and place? What has it meantto people in other times and places? What does it mean to us now, in ourown time and place?</P>

<P>History students weave answers to these questions into compellingstories and persuasive arguments. These narratives, when wellconstructed, are moving and beautiful. They prompt thinking aboutthe diversity of human experience, both across the globe and closeto home, and about how peoples’ ideas and cultural practices vary byperiod, region, and social circumstance. With classes focused on theUnited States, Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East,history provides students the opportunity to explore the world broadlyand deeply. Moreover, history allows us to see the world through the eyesof others as we confront human achievement, struggle, and failure andthus provides the tools for empathy, objective thought, and engagedcitizenship.</P>

<P>History majors graduate prepared to negotiate a complex, uncertain, andoften changing world landscape, equipped with unique abilities to discernand integrate multiple perspectives as they engage in creative problemsolving.</P>

<P>INTL 200 - Themes and Approaches in International Studies (4 CreditHours)</P>

<P>The main goals of this course are to introduce sophomore students, whohave completed INTL100, to some of the key themes and theories withinthe purview of International Studies to help them shape their individualconcentrations in the major. The course also provides opportunities forstudents to examine various world problems through an interdisciplinarylens, drawing on both political-economic and sociocultural analyticalframeworks in various disciplines. Finally, students learn the basics ofacademic research and writing processes, i.e., formulating a well-deﬁnedtopic, posing a relevant research question, ﬁnding and interrogatingappropriate sources, justifying the research’s intellectual contributionto a broader scholarly audience and, when applicable, to the efforts tosolve real-world problems, through writing and revising a carefully craftedprose. Among numerous debates and issues that International Studiesscholars grapple with, the course focuses on four broadly conceivedthemes: economic development, nationalism and national identity,transnational migration, and mediated and material culture. After learningmajor scholarly approaches to theorize each of these themes, studentsdevelop individual research project and write a scholarly paper, completewith abstract, introduction, literature review, case study, and conclusion.At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to formulate,broaden, and contextualize their thematic and topical concentrationswithin the interdisciplinary scheme of International Studies, and beequipped with academic research skills to pursue their concentrations inthe major.</P>

<Div>
<P>INTL 201 - Major Proposal for International Studies (1 Credit Hour)</P>

<P>The required mid-level course is for all International Studies majors.The goals of this one-credit course are to create a vibrant intellectualcommunity of students, in which they collaboratively formulate individualinterests in the ﬁeld of International Studies through discussion andpeer-reviews in class, and consultation with the course coordinator(International Studies Program Director) and faculty advisor assignedby the coordinator. Through these processes, the students are expectedto not only develop strong camaraderie among them as the new INTLmajors, but also formulate comprehensive plans for how they will pursuetheir interests in International Studies during their ﬁnal two years atDenison. This involves charting out their courses in International Studiesfor the next two years-including coursework from off-campus studyprograms that they wish to count towards the International Studiesmajor. By the end of the course, students submit the major proposal, inwhich they synthesize coursework, off-campus study (or an internship),and language training in a way that allows them to develop a coherentarea of expertise within International Studies, and they will share theirgoals and plans with their cohort and a wider International Studiescommunity. The proposals will be evaluated by the course coordinator,who consults with the entire International Studies Program Committee.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_8645">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P>

<P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of this opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

<H3>General Departmental Regulations</H3>

<P>Students who want to fulﬁll the basic requirement in language bycontinuing one begun in secondary school will ﬁnd it advantageousto begin their course work in the ﬁrst year. The Department of ModernLanguages strongly recommends that students complete their languagerequirement by the end of their sophomore year.</P>

<H3>The Language Lab</H3>

<P>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27Macs, zone-free DVD player and document camera. It also has a VIAConnect PRO that is a wireless collaboration and presentation solutionthat makes sharing and presenting easier for all computers in the room.The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside theclassroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborativewriting projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materialspublished on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualizedinstruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a varietyof digital materials for class discussion.</P>

<H3>Cultural Enrichment</H3>

<P>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where the Denisoncommunity can ﬁnd information about upcoming events.</P>

<H3>The Foresman Lounge</H3>

<P>Located in the central hub of the department, it provides the Denisoncommunity with a space for a wide range of activities such as receptions,classes, and informal gatherings. This area has a kitchenette with atable and chairs for sharing lunch or a coffee with our faculty. It is alsoequipped with a wide range of technological devices with which to enrichour students’ learning experiences. This room has a 52-inch flat screenTV connected to cable, The TV is also connected to a zone-free DVDplayer and a document camera. The lounge has a ceiling-mounted dataprojector, which connects to a networked Mac computer, the DVD playerand document camera.</P>

<P>Although the Department of Modern Languages offers majors in French,German and Spanish, it also offers courses in other languages for thepurpose of general education and support of other college programs.Courses in Japanese are listed below.</P>

<H3>The Language and Culture Program</H3>

<P>This exciting residential option gives students the opportunity tohone their language skills and to participate in special cultural events.Students who choose this residential option will live in communitywith their peers who share enthusiasm for language and culture study.Extracurricular activities and programming in the Language Housesupport language acquisition and permit a closer relationship withprofessors and language assistants from the Department of ModernLanguages.</P>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_8445">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies is designedto promote a multidisciplinary approach to social, historical, political andlinguistic issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is founded on thebasic pillars of a Liberal Arts education such as understanding the personas a whole, promoting critical thinking and expanding cultural horizons.Its mission is to provide students a strong historical, social and culturalfoundation for the understanding of speciﬁc components of differingLatin American and Caribbean cultures. Through this approach, we striveto foster critical awareness of the heterogeneity that characterizesthe region as well as a critical understanding of the complexities of itsrelationship with the United States. The curriculum of the Latin Americanand Caribbean studies concentration expresses our commitment todeveloping the person as a whole by allowing students to explore,analyze, discuss, read and write about a variety of themes directly relatedto Latin America, from different theoretical frameworks. This in turnencourages students to reflect upon their own cultural background.</P>

<H1>Lugar Program</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_8424">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The program is named in honor of Richard Lugar, Denison Universityclass of 1954, who represented Indiana in the United States Senatefrom 1977-2013. As one-time Mayor of Indianapolis, former chair of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee, and Denison Trustee, SenatorLugar’s record is a model for all who aspire to engage in public service.Inspired by Senator Lugar’s legacy of academic excellence, distinguishedservice, and prominent role in American politics and foreign policy, theLugar Program is open to students of all majors and partisan preference.International students are welcome to enroll.</P>

<P>The Lugar Program features two tracks. Track One focuses on Americanpolitics and public policy. It combines coursework in these areas with acongressional internship. Students must complete a total of four coursesin American politics and foreign policy, including POSC 307 - The Politicsof Congress and either POSC 214 - Doing Political Science: Foreign PolicyFormulation or POSC 341 - The Conduct of American Foreign Policy. Theother two Track One course requirements may be fulﬁlled by completingany of the Political Science class offerings in the subﬁelds of AmericanPolitics. Students must earn a grade of C or better in each Lugar Programcourse. Completion of all four Lugar Program courses is required beforebeginning the congressional internship. Students may intern in anycongressional ofﬁce during the summer following either their sophomoreor junior year. The Lugar Program will endeavor to place interns in theofﬁce of a member of the House or Senate. Alternatively, students mayopt to participate in an approved off-campus program and intern for anentire semester under the auspices of their Washington program.</P>

<P>The Lugar Program will only sponsor students for congressionalinternships who have a record unblemished by serious disciplinary oracademic infractions as reported by the Ofﬁce of Student Developmentand the Provost's Ofﬁce.</P>

<P>Track Two has been designed for students with an interest ininternational affairs and foreign policy, especially with an aptitude forthe study of foreign languages and a desire to pursue a career in suchﬁelds as national security, homeland defense, weapons proliferationand foreign affairs. In particular, Track Two provides a foundation forgraduate study at the Graduate School of International Policy Studiesat the Monterey Institute in California, or at similar graduate programsthat also require extensive language training. To complete the TrackTwo program at Denison, students must take two years (four semesters)of coursework in a foreign language. Although French, German, andSpanish are acceptable, students interested in the Monterey option areencouraged to study Arabic, Chinese or Japanese. Some courseworkin a language could be undertaken at Monterey or another institution,most likely during the summer. Students must take four courses selectedfrom the Political Science Department offerings in the subﬁelds ofComparative Politics or International Politics. The minimum grade in eachof these courses and in every semester of foreign language instruction isa C. Track Two contains an experiential/internship component that mustbe completed while participating in an approved off-campus program.</P>

<P>For both tracks, with the approval of the Director, one off-campus coursemay be used to fulﬁll Lugar course requirements.</P>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_7780">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Mathematics is an essential part of a liberal arts education withnumerous connections to a variety of disciplines. The study ofmathematics is a challenging and exciting activity that sharpens logicalreasoning skills and improves problem solving ability. The curriculum isdesigned so students can apply these skills to analyze both real-worldquestions and explore sophisticated mathematical theory.</P>

<P>Students interested in the Mathematics major should take MATH 135 -Single Variable Calculus and MATH 145 - Multi-variable Calculus followedby MATH 213 - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations and MATH 300- Introduction to Proofs by the end of their sophomore year. It is stronglyrecommended that Mathematics students take CS 109 - DiscoveringComputer Science, CS 110 - Discovering Computer Science: Digital Mediaand Games, CS 111 - Discovering Computer Science: Scientiﬁc Data andDynamics or CS 112 - Discovering Computer Science: Markets, Polls, andSocial Networks by the end of their sophomore year.</P>

<P>Most upper level mathematics electives fall into two categories:Foundations and Modeling.</P>

<P>Foundation courses focus on teaching abstract reasoning and thereading, creation, and writing of rigorous proofs in the study of thefoundational structures of mathematics. Currently these coursesare:</P>

<P>This additional course, which may be in another department, must have astrong and persistent mathematical modeling or computing componentand must be approved in advance by the Mathematics and ComputerScience Department.  In addition, the student must take a two-semestersequence of courses in a department other than Mathematics andComputer Science.  A written plan for completing the concentration mustbe approved by the Mathematics and Computer Science Departmentprior to enrollment in the elective course. In particular, the elective courseand cognate requirements above must be chosen in consistence witha valid educational plan for the student of Computational Science (asdeﬁned above).  Any mathematics major who wishes to complete thisconcentration must choose a computer science course as an electivecourse. Any computer science major who wished to complete thisconcentration must choose a mathematics course as an elective course. A double mathematics and computer science major is not eligible for thisconcentration.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<H3>Research at Denison</H3>

<P>Denison offers a number of research opportunities, including funding forsummer research projects.  The Anderson Foundation and the DenisonUniversity Research Foundation (DURF) support qualiﬁed studentsconducting summer research.  For off-campus research opportunities inMathematics, see the Oak Ridge Science Semester (https://denison.edu/academics/oak-ridge) or various National Science Foundation ResearchExperience for Undergraduates (https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5044) experiences.  Interested students shouldconsult a faculty member as early as possible in the fall semester.</P>

<H3>Off-Campus Study</H3>

<P>The department of Mathematics and Computer Science stronglyencourages students to globalize their education by completing someportion of their undergraduate education abroad. A majority of Denisonstudents spend a semester abroad during their junior year and manymore spend a second summer abroad. Denison offers a wide range ofopportunities to study off-campus that are highly relevant to the Denisonexperience.</P>

<P>Going abroad allows students to enhance their knowledge whileexperiencing another culture and way of life. Students gain valuableinternational experience that will beneﬁt future career goals and/orgraduate school opportunities. Math and Computer Science majors whoare fluent in another language will have special advantages in the jobmarket.</P>

<P>Students may take up to two classes outside the department to transfertowards the major at Denison.  Additional courses taken outside Denisonmay accrue credit hours towards graduation, but will not contribute torequirements in the major.  Courses taken outside the university mustbe pre-approved for acceptance towards major requirements.  Studentsshould provide the department chair syllabi for the intended courses fordepartment approval.  Students may petition the department chair forexceptions to this policy.  In particular, transfer students may be eligibleto transfer additional courses towards major requirements.</P>

We believe that performance andintellectual study of music mutually deepen and strengthen one another.Our music majors and minors attain fluency in music through rigorousstudy of music history, theory, and technique, and apply this knowledgein performance and analysis. In accordance with the ideals of a liberalarts education, our department offers a broad exposure to musics acrosstime and place. We open music classes, lessons, and ensembles to theentire campus, forming not only an integral part of life at Denison, butalso a tool for connecting our students with the broader community. Bymodeling a vibrant community of musicians and audiences, we foster aculturally and ethically informed citizenship with a lifelong passion for thearts.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_5851">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Neuroscience is the interdisciplinary study of the brain and nervoussystem, with a scope that ranges from molecules and cells to behavior,cognition, and emotion. Denison's Neuroscience Concentration achievesthis interdisciplinary perspective via courses in Biology, ComputationalScience, Philosophy, and Psychology. These courses are intended tocomplement the student’s major. Students who want to pursue theNeuroscience Concentration are required to have either a primary orsecondary academic advisor who is a member of the NeuroscienceFaculty.</P>

<H1>Off-Campus Study</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_5685">Overview</H2>

<P>Learning through global experiences is integral to a Denison education.We provide individualized mentoring to help students craft their off-campus experience and take advantage of learning opportunities thatfoster global competencies essential in today’s workforce.  With morethan 180 Denison-accepted off-campus study programs to choose from,students have many opportunities to realize the full potential of theireducation, hone a language, develop workplace skills, and maximizemulticultural understanding.</P>

<P>In addition to semester, or year-long study abroad, shorter termopportunities are also possible.  Denison Seminars, semester-long creditbearing courses with an off-campus travel component, are another waystudents can develop global competencies. Students can also participatein summer, short-term faculty-led credit bearing seminars.</P>

<P>There are many other opportunities for students to apply and extend theiroff-campus learning.  These include independent research, internships,and lectures that connect students to international educators and peersaround the world.  Off-Campus Study works closely with the KnowltonCenter and Lisska Center to share information about the many globallearning opportunities and resources available to Denison students.</P>

<H2>Planning for Off-Campus Study Program</H2>

<P>The ﬁrst step in planning for off-campus study is to attend a StudyAbroad 101 session led by student returnees.  Next, students schedulean appointment with an OCS advisor.  Working with OCS and theiracademic advisors, students articulate learning goals for an off-campusstudy experience, explore a range of options among the Denison-accepted programs, and carefully consider the timing of participation andintegration with degree requirements.</P>

<P>Denison maintains a list of accepted off-campus programs thatmeet the pedagogical and academic standards associated witha Denison liberal arts education.  The current list can be found at&lt;globaltools.denison.edu&gt;. Students who withdraw from the university toattend a program that is not on Denison’s list of approved programs arenot eligible to receive transfer credit.</P>

<H2>Proposing Off-Campus Study</H2>

<P>Students normally seek approval for one semester and/or a summerof off-campus study during their Denison career, though approval foran academic year of off-campus study is also possible. (Note thatinstitutional ﬁnancial aid may be applied to a maximum of one semesterof study – see Financing Off-Campus Study.)</P>

<P>To pursue off-campus study for academic credit, students must ﬁrstpropose a plan and obtain Denison approval for such study. Onceapproved by OCS, the student is then responsible for completing anapplication with the program provider.  OCS staff assists and advisesstudents with both steps in the process.</P>

<H2>Eligibility Guidelines</H2>

<P>Please note that eligibility guidelines for Off-Campus Study are reviewedannually and subject to change.</P>

<Div>

<Div>
<H2>Balancing Participation</H2>

<P>Denison strives to accommodate the off-campus study proposals of allqualiﬁed students.  There are, however, two related points that impactthis policy. First, Off-Campus Study establishes limits on the number ofparticipants in some programs in order to facilitate optimal integrationinto the range of experiential learning contexts and communities. Second,to facilitate the sustainable management of Denison's on-campushousing resources, slots for off-campus study in the fall semesterare awarded on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served basis based on the date ofthe student’s required OCS appointment and the completion of therequired forms for Step One of the OCS Proposal Process. There are fourexceptions to this policy:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>
<P>•</P>
</Lbl>

<LBody>
<P>
<P>the student is proposing a program that is only offered during the fallsemester;</P>
</P>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

<P>•</P>
</Lbl>

<LBody>
<P>
<P>the student will be studying abroad during the senior year;</P>
</P>

<P>•</P>
</Lbl>

<LBody>
<P>
<P>the student has a conflict with a speciﬁc course offering in her/hismajor program, as documented by the Academic Planning Form andconﬁrmed by the appropriate department chair;</P>
</P>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>
<P>•</P>
</Lbl>

<LBody>
<P>
<P>the student is on the team roster for a spring semester sport, asconﬁrmed by the appropriate coach.</P>
</P>
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>If studying off-campus in the fall semester is not covered by one ofthese exceptions, the student should schedule the required advisingappointment to start the OCS Proposal process in April or at the verybeginning of fall semester, and then work diligently to complete theplanning meetings and forms required for that appointment.</P>

<H2>Financing Off-Campus Study</H2>

<P>To determine whether a given program is affordable, students shouldmake certain to consider out-of-pocket expenses as well as the invoicedprogram fees. A comprehensive cost estimate for any given program onthe Denison accepted list is available from the program provider.</P>

<P>To promote off-campus study, Denison does not require students topay its tuition or room/board fees during their term off-campus. Anadministrative fee of $280 for a summer program, $895 for a semesterprogram, and $995 for an academic year of study with a single programor provider is charged to cover the administrative support associated withoff-campus study.  </P>

<P>It is important to note that institutional aid, except for the GreatOpportunity (GO) program, and the OCS Grant program do not apply tosummer study.  In general, there are fewer ﬁnancial aid resources forsummer study, so students with ﬁnancial need are urged to considersemester study whenever possible.</P>

<P>Denison students may pursue one semester of off-campus study withinstitutional aid eligibility if they submit their Free Application for FederalStudent Aid (FAFSA) by March 1 and provide the required veriﬁcationof tax data to the Denison Financial Aid Ofﬁce by April 1. EstimatedFinancial Aid Awards are made available to students by May 15 (for fallstudy), and June 15 (for spring study). While Denison does not provideinstitutional merit-based aid for off-campus study, institutional need-based aid is available for eligible students.</P>

<P>A student’s eligibility is based on the estimated cost of participationfor the proposed off-campus study program and the estimated familycontribution from the FAFSA. Federal grants, State grants, and Federalloans, as well as any other external sources of aid, are the initial sourcesfor meeting ﬁnancial need for eligible students. If a student’s need is notfully met by those funding sources, Denison grant funding is available toassist in meeting a portion of remaining need. For students with unmetneed after the Denison ﬁnancial packaging process, OCS works withprogram providers to award additional grants to help bridge this gap.</P>

<H2>Academic Regulations for Off-CampusStudy</H2>

<P>Denison requires that students participate fully and responsibly in allacademic aspects of the proposed off-campus study program, includingrequired language and area studies courses.  Failure to do so will resultin a grade of U (Unsatisfactory) for the off-campus study placeholdercourse listed on the Denison academic record for the term abroad.</P>

<P>Students are enrolled for a holding place registration of 12 credits foreach term of off-campus study in order to report full-time study to theFederal Clearinghouse to facilitate the portability of ﬁnancial aid and/or to use of 529 college funds.  Students are therefore required to enrollfor at least 12 transferable U.S. semester credits for each semester ofoff-campus study, but may choose to enroll for up to 20 U.S. semestercredits per semester.  Students are limited to one course on an S/U gradebase per semester. The arrangements for such a choice must be madewith the program provider at the time of ﬁnal registration.</P>

<P>To receive transfer credit for an off-campus study experience, studentsmust work with the Registrar’s Ofﬁce and academic advisors to obtainpre-approval for their courses through the OCS course approval process. The University is under no obligation to transfer coursework or applytransferred coursework toward speciﬁc degree requirements unless thatcoursework has been approved in advance.</P>

<P>Students wishing to apply a course toward a major, minor, orconcentration requirements must receive approval directly from therelevant department/program.  Other coursework will be evaluated for itsrelevance to the Denison curriculum through the combined efforts of theRegistrar, OCS, and, as necessary, speciﬁc departments/programs.</P>

<P>All courses reported on the program provider’s transcript are postedto the Denison academic record with course titles, credits, and grades. This includes any course for which a student receives a failing grade,even though credit will not be awarded. While the grades for off-campusstudy coursework are not factored into the Denison cumulative gradepoint average, it is important to note that they could be factored intoa composite grade point average should a student pursue graduate orprofessional school after graduating from Denison.</P>

<H2>Disciplinary Policy</H2>

<P>Recognizing the role of students as ambassadors of Denison, thespecial privilege of participating in off-campus programs, and the levelof maturity required for students to be successful negotiating thechallenges and potential risks associated with study away, the Ofﬁceof Off-Campus Study routinely consults with the Ofﬁce of CommunityValues and Conflict Resolution to assess students’ disciplinary historyas part of the approval process for off-campus study. Frequency, severity,community impact of violations, and student’s disciplinary status(e.g., Disciplinary Probation) are the disciplinary variables that mayimpact eligibility. Students on disciplinary probation or suspension arenot eligible to participate in off-campus study during the semester ofprobation or suspension. Students must be on campus and cleared ofany disciplinary sanctions during the semester prior to study away.</P>

<P>Violations that occur after a student has been approved for study abroad,but before their departure for off-campus study may also influence astudent’s eligibility to participate. Denison reserves the right to withholdor rescind approval for any student based on their disciplinary history orviolations, regardless of the number of incidents on the student’s record.</P>

<P>The program provider may request information from the student abouttheir disciplinary record as part of the admission process.  In these cases,the student will be asked to sign a waiver allowing Denison to providethis information to the program. If you have concerns about how yourdisciplinary history may affect your eligibility for study away, pleaseconvey these during the advising process in the ofﬁce of Off-CampusStudy.</P>

<H2>Educational Enrichment Leave of Absence</H2>

<P>Students may apply for an Educational Enrichment Leave of Absence(EEL) to pursue experiential learning opportunities that are not creditbearing or structured educational opportunities whose coursework is notapplicable to a Denison Baccalaureate degree.  Examples of structurededucational opportunities whose coursework is not applicable include theNational Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), Outward Bound, Semesterat Sea, specialized technical or training programs, religious education, orculinary institutes.</P>

<P>Students wishing to pursue an EEL are required to meet with and anadvisor in OCS, as well as their academic advisor, and then to submit awritten rationale to OCS.  The rationale must articulate a clear connectionbetween the student’s broader educational goals and the proposedenrichment program. A student may opt to pursue study at a localinstitution as an adjunct activity as part of an EEL.  However, thiscoursework may not exceed eight credits and must be approved inadvance through the normal transfer credit evaluation process. Thewritten rationale should address the plan to obtain credit elsewhere.</P>

<P>During an EEL, the student retains her/his Denison enrollment depositand information systems privileges. However, the student is consideredwithdrawn from Denison during her/his period of leave for the purposesof ﬁnancial aid and loan deferment.  EEL’s are usually for one semester,but may extend to an academic year. See the Student Handbook forspeciﬁc details regarding the processes for registration, housing, andﬁnancial aid following a leave. If a student does not enroll at Denisonfollowing the EEL, the leave reverts to a Withdrawal and the enrollmentdeposit is forfeited.</P>

<H2>Health Insurance Coverage</H2>

<P>Denison carries EIIA Insurance for all members of our community. Students participating on an international off-campus program arecovered for emergency medical, evacuation, and repatriation insuranceaccording to the stipulations of our policies (available upon request).  Forongoing and chronic problems or standard (non-emergency) health care,students should rely on their domestic health insurance coverage. Manyprogram providers include the purchase of either regular or emergencycoverage in the program fee, but it is important to make certain thatthis is the case and, if so, that it is adequate to a student’s particularhealthcare needs.   Denison also recommends that at least one parent/guardian obtain a passport so that travel will not be unduly delayed in thecase of a student medical or personal emergency abroad.</P>

<H2>Health Advisories, Travel Advisories, andTravel Warnings</H2>

<P>Denison strongly recommends that all students avail themselves ofthe travel information available at the U.S. State Department (http://travel.state.gov/), Centers for Disease Control (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/), and World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/en/)web sites.  In particular, students should carefully consider the safetyinformation included in State Department travel advisories for thecountry(ies) in which they are pursuing off-campus study and/or forany other country to which they are planning to travel during their timeabroad.</P>

<P>Denison reserves the right to withdraw its approval for study on an off-campus program if a State Department travel warning or a CDC or WHOtravel advisory is in place for the program location at the start of theprogram. Withdrawal of approval for an off-campus study program bars astudent from receiving Denison credit for the program and from applyingﬁnancial aid to the program costs. To make certain that a student maymake an informed decision regarding participation on a program, theissue of potential loss of Denison approval for an accepted program willbe brought to the student’s attention as far in advance of the programstart date as is feasible.</P>

<P>In the case of a State Department travel warning or a CDC or WHO traveladvisory arising after a program has started, Denison will work closelywith the educational partner and other informed parties to determinean appropriate course of action.  In the case of requiring that a studentreturn home, Denison will pursue reasonable steps with the programprovider to mitigate the ﬁnancial and academic impact of such an action.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<H3>Summer Session</H3>

<P>The premise guiding this four-week session is that organizationsneed persons capable of examining problems with a critical andimaginative eye and of responding in an ever-changing environmentwith policies, actions, and decisions derived from a broad knowledgebase. A major strength of Denison's liberal arts program is that it fostersthe development of this broad knowledge base, as well as critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. The summer seminar focuseson the application of those skills in organizations. Working primarilywith Denison alumni/ae, students are introduced to the language andfundamental principles of organizational management, decision-making,marketing, ﬁnance, and accounting. Equipped with this information,students serve as consultants for local nonproﬁt and commercialenterprises, taking on the tasks of researching and analyzing problems,formulating solutions, and presenting ﬁndings to clients. In addition,students travel to cities such as New York, Chicago, and Washingtonto learn ﬁrst-hand the nature of operations in advertising agencies,investment banks, manufacturing plants, and other organizations.</P>

<H3>Internship and Integrative Paper</H3>

<P>The internship should take place during the months following thesummer session. The internship will become the venue where courseworkand the summer seminar are brought into play. The completion of theinternship shall result in a major, integrative paper.</P>

<H1>Philosophy</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_5117">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>To do philosophy is to encounter some of the most fundamentalquestions that can be asked about human existence. Philosophicalinvestigation leads students to recognize the potentially unnoticedassumptions that underpin even our most ordinary ways of interactingwith other persons and engaging in human projects. Such assumptionsconcern, for example, the nature of human knowledge, action, and value.Philosophy challenges students to move beyond uncritical patterns ofthought, to recognize problems, and to exchange a more naive worldviewfor a more considered and justiﬁable one. In doing so, students learnto think in ways that are simultaneously disciplined and imaginative.Philosophy Department faculty members cooperatively approach theseconcerns from diverse perspectives, both in studying the works of majorphilosophers and in their own creative activity. Students are encouragedto join with the faculty in this inquiry and to philosophize creatively ontheir own. The courses and seminars in the Department are intended todevelop the abilities necessary for these activities.</P>

<P>Typically students without previous experience with philosophy will enrollin PHIL 101 - Introduction to Philosophy, PHIL 121 - Ethics: PhilosophicalConsiderations of Morality or PHIL 126 - Social and Political Philosophy.Students who wish to continue in Philosophy and perhaps to major orminor in it will often take PHIL 231 - Greek and Medieval Philosophy orPHIL 232 - Modern Philosophy as their second course. These are requiredcourses for the major and prerequisites for some of our upper-levelcourses. However, there are many ways to move through our curriculumdepending on a student's particular interests and departmental offeringsin any given semester.</P>

<P>The Philosophy Department welcomes double majors and self-designedmajors, and is experienced in helping students integrate Philosophywith work in other disciplines. To avoid possible scheduling problems,students considering a major in Philosophy (or one which includesPhilosophy) should consult the Department early in their college career.</P>

<P>The Philosophy Department participates in the interdepartmental majorin PPE (p. 
<Quote>150</Quote>
) and several of our courses are cross-listed with otherinterdisciplinary programs, including Global Commerce, EnvironmentalStudies, Queer Studies, and Women’s and Gender Studies.</P>

<H2>Philosophy Minor</H2>

<P>Philosophy, by its very nature, is ideally suited to assist a student inintegrating and articulating knowledge gained in other areas. For thisreason we attempt to tailor a student's minor program in Philosophyaround the speciﬁc course of studies being pursued in the selected majorsubject. This means that our minor program places a premium upondepartmental advising.</P>

<P>Each Philosophy minor is required to choose a department memberas a Philosophy advisor. The Philosophy advisor will not replace thestudent's primary academic advisor. However, the Philosophy advisorwill have responsibility for guiding the student in designing the minorprogram in Philosophy. A minor in Philosophy requires ﬁve courses inthe department. Among these courses must be PHIL 231 - Greek andMedieval Philosophy or PHIL 232 - Modern Philosophy and at least onecourse numbered 300 or higher.</P>

<H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2>

<P>Additional information about Philosophy courses and a course guide withmore detailed descriptions of current courses may be obtained from thePhilosophy Department, and is available on the department's website(https://denison.edu/academics/philosophy).</P>

<H3>The Titus-Hepp Lecture Series</H3>

<P>Each year the department sponsors a colloquium series, bringing tocampus nationally and internationally known philosophers who presenttheir current work and meet with students and faculty. Visitors haveincluded Tyler Burge (UCLA), Bonnie Honig (Brown),  Graham Harman(SCI-Arc), Anthony Kenny (Oxford), Linda Martín Alcoff (Hunter Collegeand CUNY Graduate Center), Ruth Millikan (Connecticut), Charles Mills(CUNY Graduate Center), Martha Nussbaum (Chicago), Geoffrey Sayre-McCord (UNC Chapel Hill), Peter Singer (Princeton), and others.</P>

<H3>Other Philosophy Activities</H3>

<P>The Philosophy Department annually publishes a national undergraduatephilosophy journal, Episteme. This journal is edited and produced byphilosophy majors and minors in consultation with a faculty advisor.Episteme encourages and receives submissions from undergraduatephilosophy students throughout the country and internationally. Inaddition, philosophy students organize Philosophy Coffees, informaldiscussions of philosophical topics, about three times each semester.Special coffees are held annually for parents during Big Red Weekend,and during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Celebration.</P>

Depending on thesemester, issues of applied ethics - having to do with abortion, medicalethics, business and professional ethics, ethics and the environment, warand peace, etc. - will be raised as well.</P>
</Div>

<Div>
<P>PHIL 126 - Social and Political Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>This course is about justice, power, and freedom, as ideals and asrealities, and about whether objective or rational justiﬁcations of politicaland social views and actions are practical or even possible.

Among the ﬁgures studiedwill be Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein,Quine, and others. The course is intended for most students as asecond course in philosophy; its goal is to prepare students for furtherphilosophical work by providing them with experience in philosophicalstudy beyond that offered in Philosophy 101. Some students withparticular interest in the ﬁeld, however, may choose to begin theirphilosophical studies with this course. In either case, the course willgive students the opportunity to grapple with fundamental philosophicalquestions by examining the works of a series of great ﬁgures in thehistory of philosophy.</P>

<P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</P>

<P>PHIL 232 - Modern Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Thinkers such as Rene Descartes, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant arecurrently referred to so often, in so many different contexts, that theirnames have been transformed into immediately recognizable adjectives(Cartesian, Humean, Kantian). But what did these philosophers actuallybelieve? And why did they believe it? This course is an intermediate-levelsurvey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the “EarlyModern” or “Modern” era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). Whilethese and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley)in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostlyon their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophyof mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) toappreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical;b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation formuch of the modern—western, anyway—worldview; and c) to determine ifwhat they say is either true or false.</P>

<P>PHIL 275 - Philosophy of Feminism (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Feminism and philosophy both make the invisible visible, the implicitexplicit. Both make us aware of assumptions we make in our everydaylives and challenge us to justify them. This course examines ways inwhich feminist theory enriches philosophy and vice versa. Feministcriticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophicalassumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the worldand other people. How does feminism destabilize philosophy and affectphilosophical conceptions of knowledge, reality, metaphysics, agency,or morality? How does philosophy enrich feminist understandings ofoppression, privilege, or equality? We will consider a range of formsof oppression and privilege, particularly as they affect women, andconceptions of sex, gender, and race in the context of debates aboutgender violence, work and family, as well as feminist discussions ofepistemology, ethics, and science.</P>

Smart, Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Daniel Dennett,Patricia and Paul Churchland, Jerry Fodor, Fred Dretske, Hillary Putnam,and others. We will address questions such as whether we can knowthere are other minds, whether mental states are identical or reducibleto brain states, how it is that our thoughts can be about anything at all,whether there is a &quot;language of thought&quot;, and whether our ordinary talkabout mental events genuinely explains human actions.</P>

<P>PHIL 298 - Existentialism (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Existentialism asks how we can generate a meaning for our lives withoutappealing to outside sources. Many existentialists embrace a viewcharacterized with the slogan “existence precedes essence.” This sloganmeans that any attempt to ﬁgure out what one is must begin with thefact that one is. In addition, if existence precedes essence, then theremay well be a multiplicity of ways that one can be, making choosingbetween these ways a difﬁcult task. That one’s existence may well beexperienced as constrained by social forces seemingly beyond one’scontrol complicates matters. We will read from a variety of sources,including philosophical sources such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre,de Beauvoir, or Judith Butler as well as literary or biographical sources,e.g., Beckett, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, and others.</P>

<P>PHIL 321 - Metaethics (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>We spend much of our time trying to answer such questions as: Howought we to act? What should we value? and What type of person shouldwe be? But, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to thesequestions and decide among them only if we correctly answer anotherset of questions ﬁrst. For instance, how can we know what we shouldvalue unless we understand what values are, whether they exist andwhether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we oughtto act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally goodor why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the ﬁrstplace? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. Itinquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments andattitudes. As such, it draws on many other areas of philosophy, includingepistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language.</P>

Can it be deﬁnedindependently of consideration of what the &quot;good&quot; is for human beings?Is justice possible in a society marked by signiﬁcant religious, ethnic,cultural or other sorts of pluralisms? What is the relation betweenjustice and nationhood, and what can be said about justice betweennations? How is justice connected to social equality, and to liberty?What is meant by economic justice? What is the relation between justiceand democracy?

<P>PHIL 333 - History of Analytic Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>This course is an introduction to the methods and the history of theanalytic tradition. This tradition can be distinguished in a number ofways. Methodologically, it tends to employ careful argumentationand formal tools like logic and mathematics to provide analyses ofscientiﬁc, psychological, and linguistic data. Historically, it is usuallytraced back to a group of Anglo-European philosophers—Frege, Russell,Moore, and Wittgenstein—writing around the beginning of the twentiethcentury. Thematically, it is primarily driven by the ambition of providinga systematic account of the relationship between language, thought,and the world. This course explores early and recent contributions of theanalytic tradition to epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language,philosophy of science, and ethics.</P>

<P>The study of physics is a challenging and intellectually rewarding activityselected by those who seek to sharpen and broaden their appreciationand understanding of the physical world and their relationship to it. Tothis end, courses offered by the Department of Physics and Astronomyare designed to bring the student to an increasingly independent level ofinvestigation in experimental and theoretical physics, and to a level ofsophistication commensurate with an individual's motivation, goals, andabilities.</P>

<P>A major in Physics is an excellent preparation for careers in engineering,medicine, business, computer science, law, industrial management, andteaching. Sufﬁcient flexibility exists in the major program to suit theneeds and goals of the individual.</P>

<P>The department of political science strongly encourages studentsto globalize their education by completing some portion of theirundergraduate education abroad. A majority of Denison students spenda semester abroad during their junior year and many more spend asummer (or two) abroad. Denison offers a wide range of opportunities tostudy off-campus that are highly relevant to both your major and generaleducation. Many include either independent research opportunities orinternships.</P>

<P>Going abroad allows students to enhance their knowledge of politicswhile experiencing another culture and way of life. Students gain valuableinternational experience that will beneﬁt future career goals and/orgraduate school opportunities.

<P>POSC 214 - Doing Political Science: Foreign Policy Formulation (4 CreditHours)</P>

<P>Foreign policy formulation is concerned with how internal factors shapea state's policy toward the outside world. Traditionally, foreign policyanalysts considered the state as a unitary actor. Today, we are moreappreciative of the multiple domestic inputs in foreign policy making,and more sophisticated in the use of analytic tools to facilitate ourunderstanding of the foreign policy formulation process. The class isstructured around four distinct “sources” of US foreign policy formulation:institutional; role; societal; and, individual. While we cover each source indistinct units for purposes of analytic clarity, throughout our study we willobserve that no one decision can be explained fully without some overlapof sources.</P>

<P>POSC 311 - Political Organizations in the U.S (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>&quot;Democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the parties.&quot; Yet, some,including the Founding Fathers, have been less sure of Schattschneider'struism, warning of the mischiefs of faction. Political organization,however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure ofAmerican democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interestgroups, and social movements have formed and acted to create andinsure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In thecourse, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death ofpolitical organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature ofpolitical organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations,as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism,media, technology and money.

<P>POSC 315 - Power and Gender (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Despite considerable progress, gender remains an essential dividing linein politics. Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of publicofﬁcials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances inrole models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychologyall shape what amounts to the political “gender system.” In this course,we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through agendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developedsocieties. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role inachieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual,social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate thatbias. Students will conduct a range of original empirical research tocontribute to these important debates.</P>

<P>POSC 326 - Radical Right Parties and Politics in Europe (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>What accounts for the emergence, persistence and demise of &quot;radical&quot; or&quot;far right&quot; political parties in Europe? After a period of post-war stability,European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led toseveral new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation;a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; andthe emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This coursefocuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in WesternEurope during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on whatmany scholars label the &quot;far&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; right. These parties tend to beorganized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizingnationalism, exclusion of &quot;foreigners,&quot; a strong state, welfare chauvinismand, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semesterstudents will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties andtheir politics across Europe and discern the differences between whatscholars describe as &quot;populist radical&quot; or &quot;populist far&quot; right parties fromother parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis partieswhich are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist.</P>

<Div>
<P>POSC 348 - Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 CreditHours)</P>

<P>This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviorsduring crisis situations concerning the three &quot;big&quot; states in WesternEurope: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to asthe EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is itthat we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries whichhave been the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years?Are these countries &quot;middle powers&quot; or &quot;big powers&quot;? What role do theyplay in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the &quot;three big&quot; can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system.</P>

<P>POSC 349 - Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</P>

<P>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since thebeginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorismdates only from the French Revolution (1789-1799). In this course, wewill explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analystsargue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorismdiffers from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, andso on. We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholarsthink that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorismas planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We willcompare the various deﬁnitions and perspectives to determine whichmight work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, wewill focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science andhow they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, andthe media.</P>

Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroad,with programs approved by Denison, should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are also subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

The area is designed not only for individualizedinstruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a varietyof digital materials for class discussion.</P>

<H3>Cultural Enrichment</H3>

<P>Each semester the Department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The Departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.</P>

<LBody>
<P>Fostering the formulation of a personally meaningful andsophisticated psychological perspective.</P>
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The ﬁrst priority for all majors should be to obtain a ﬁrm foundation in thebasic topic areas of psychology and in research methodologies. For thisreason, psychology majors are urged to select a broad range of coursesin addition to those offerings that are particularly relevant to their primaryinterests. Students of psychology should aim for both breadth anddepth of knowledge in the discipline. The requirements for a major inpsychology at Denison are relatively flexible in order to provide studentswith the opportunity to select those courses and experiences that bestcomplement their personal goals. At the same time, the flexibility of theserequirements requires that psychology majors work closely with theiracademic advisors to develop an appropriate plan of study.</P>

<P>Writing Program Statement: Psychology students will demonstratecompetence in reviewing, developing, conducting, and analyzingpsychological research, and crucially, in communicating scientiﬁcresearch to diverse audiences. Writing manuscripts describing theirempirical psychological research will be one core-learning goal. Studentswill write formal research reports that are modeled on the majorcomponents of the American Psychological Association’s PublicationManual. The development of these essential scientiﬁc writing skills willbe coordinated across the department’s research courses; those aredevelopmentally and systematically linked at the 200 and 300-levels.Writing critical analyses or literature reviews of research will be a secondcore-learning goal. Students will write formal papers that include a criticalanalysis, or review, of a body of research and that draws conclusionsfrom existing literature on a topic of interest. Students will have multipleopportunities to develop critical analysis writing skills in lecture anddiscussion-based courses at the 200 and 300-levels and in History andSystems of Psychology, which is the curriculum’s capstone course. As ofFall 2016 the Psychology Department’s 300-level Research courses fulﬁlla W-overlay.</P>

<H1>Queer Studies (Concentration)</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_2884">Program Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>An evolving and expanding discipline, Queer Studies encompassestheories and thinkers from many ﬁelds: cultural studies, gay and lesbianstudies, transgender studies, race studies, women's and gender studies,literature, history, ﬁlm, media, postmodernism, post-colonialism, andmore. By engaging with this diverse range of ﬁelds, the work of QueerStudies distinguishes itself in that it focuses on issues surroundingsexuality and gender (and other axes of marginalized identity) andthe way(s) that the questions raised in these other arenas might bemodulated through that central lens. To that end, Queer Studies examinesthe cultural, social, historical, and political implications of sexuality andgender from the perspective of those marginalized by the dominantsexual and gender ethos; it explores the ways that culture deﬁnes andregulates sexuality and gender (and more broadly normativity) as wellas the reverse, the ways that sexuality and gender structure and shapesocial institutions and power structures.</P>

<H1>Religion</H1>

<Div>
<H2 id="LinkTarget_2624">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>The academic study of religion is a multi-disciplinary exploration ofthe many ways in which religion functions in the lives of individuals,American society, and the global community. It critically examines therole of religion as an active force that has social, ethical, and ideologicalconsequences. Students learn to assess how religion has shaped theircultures, their family lives, their suppositions of what matters and what isethical, and their sense of who they are. Students thus gain the analytical,relational, and expressive skills essential to a liberal arts education.</P>

<P>One need not be religious to study religion.  The academic study isa lens through which the persistence of religion in the social spherebecomes evident and the personal sphere is enriched.  This academicexercise conﬁrms and contests the prevailing sense of reality.  Whatis considered normal in our society is subject to critical review.  In theprocess it enhances skill-sets with transfer value in the vocational sphereas well as deepened awareness of what deﬁnes us as individuals andnations.  Critical consciousness on moral issues, global relationships,and the existence of community is a result of this academic exercise.Therefore, the questions raised may be more important than the answersconstructed. Students who study religion learn how to ask these criticalquestions.</P>

<H3>Off Campus Study</H3>

<P>Denison University works to make study abroad and other off-campusstudy possible for all students, typically during their junior year. Moststudents who major in Religion transfer one or two courses for theconcentration within the Religion major, satisfy a GE requirement or two,and gain general credits towards graduation. Quite a few do independentresearch or internships as part of their study abroad experience. Weencourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study ofﬁce to exploreoptions, and to meet with a faculty advisor in the Religion Departmentto discuss how study abroad can best be integrated into the student'smajor.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_2326">Departmental Guidelines and Goals</H2>

<P>Educated people spend their lives pursuing growth in political, socialand intellectual freedom. One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the realization that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding</P>

<P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The Department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P>

<P>With a view toward career opportunities, the Department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas,such as history, philosophy, international studies, environmentalstudies, biology, economics, political science, and English. Coursesin cultural studies and literature, aside from their intrinsic worth, alsopresent multiple perspectives on other cultures and areas of intellectualexperience.</P>

<P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of theDepartment and the Ofﬁce of Off-Campus Studies (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve their command of thelanguage are provided by the Language and Culture Program, languagetables, international ﬁlms, club meetings, and similar activities sponsoredby the Department. There are as well subsidized ﬁeld trips to museumsand pertinent activities in cities across the country, and in some casesinternational travel.</P>

<H3>Spanish Program Mission</H3>

<P>Our mission is to enrich students' views on life by learning Spanish andcrossing cultures in an intellectually challenging context. By workingclosely with professors, in and outside the classroom, students acquireproﬁciency in critically analyzing the complex issues of today's world.</P>

<H3>Spanish Program Vision</H3>

<P>Our students become co-learners with each other and us, and competentin intercultural communication and the study of cultural discourses. Theyengage with a wide range of texts and develop analytic and evaluativeskills to be active participants in an evolving world. They connect withthe world in multiple signiﬁcant ways: study abroad, student conferences,guest speakers, extracurricular activities, and community outreach. Ourprogram is a rigorous, intellectually stimulating and fulﬁlling endeavor,responding to an ever-changing world. It integrates culture, language, andliterature through, and across, multiple perspectives and methodologies.It also forges ties with many other departments throughout the universityso that our discipline can facilitate research and the acquisition ofknowledge across the curriculum.</P>

<H3>Goals for the Major</H3>

<P>In our courses students cultivate functional language abilitiesand develop knowledge of the cultures and literature of Spanish-speaking peoples. They do so through historical breadth and depth ofinquiry, covering different Hispanic regions and exploring a variety ofinterdisciplinary approaches. Students will develop critical languageawareness, interpretation and translation, historical and politicalconsciousness, social sensibility, and aesthetic perception.</P>

<P>At the linguistic level the Spanish program subscribes to the Standardsfor Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century articulated by theAmerican Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1575">Departmental Mission and Goals</H2>

<H3>Mission Statement</H3>

<P>The Women's and Gender Studies Program at Denison University takes itsmission to be three-fold: to foster a critical awareness of, and intellectualsensitivity to, content, method and real-life implications of the ﬁeld.</P>

<P>Our goal is to engage students in the intellectual content of the discipline:theories about power and intersecting dimensions of human difference;articulations about gendered subject formations and politicized aspectsof &quot;identities,&quot; including race, class, age, religion, sexuality; knowledgesharing of women's life experiences, histories, and visions; and signiﬁcantareas of feminist thought and action, including transnationalism, post-coloniality, embodiment, technoscience, and intersectionality.</P>

<P>Also, guided by methods that are inflected by interdisciplinarity, we aimto engage students in questioning issues of power and justice, privilegeand oppression, in disciplines, such as anthropology, biology, blackstudies, communication, dance, education, international studies, literarystudies, political science, sociology, philosophy, psychology, etc., whiledeveloping understanding of these issues from an interdisciplinary andinterconnected perspective.</P>

<P>We aim to engage students in the quotidian implications of theiracademic engagement by challenging them to experience therelationship between theory and practice. We strive to expose students toconcepts concerning how the academic study of race, class, and genderboth locally and globally, is informed by, and has the power to, transformlives.</P>

<H3>Curricular Goals</H3>

<P>Denison's Women's and Gender Studies faculty are dedicated to helpingstudents develop rigorous analyses of culture, politics, ideas and text, aswell as creative leadership skills. We hope to impart to our students thehistory, analysis and practice of feminist scholarship, means of creativeexpression for their intellectual interests and concerns, and politicalservice and activism.</P>

<P>Students are required to take an introductory course WGST 101 - Issuesin Feminism, a feminist methods course, WGST 310 - Feminist ResearchMethods and a feminist theory course, WGST 311 - Feminist Theory aswell as to engage in a senior practicum—a research, activist, or artisticexperience that involves sustained activity in community engagementand written response WGST 451 - Senior Research-WGST 452 - SeniorResearch. Additionally, students are required to select additional courses,most of which are cross-listed, according to WGST guidelines and theirown interests.</P>

<P>The required courses in the major and minor explore gender and justiceissues, provide the methods and information to conduct rigorousanalysis, engage our students in ways that challenge them to expandtheir thinking about the material they meet in the world, and give them theopportunity to embody feminist pedagogies. The elective courses will dothe same in the context of their ﬁelds of study.</P>

<P>Students have the opportunity of participating in a variety of internships,fellowships, and research opportunities located throughout the countrythat acquaint them with gender issues (information available throughthe Knowlton Center for Career Exploration and the Lisska Center forScholarly Engagement). Students are encouraged to develop leadershipskills by taking an active part in campus life, including engaging inprojects developed inside and outside the academic program and theCenter for Women's and Gender Action. As examples, projects haveincluded a national grant application, a campus-wide study on violence,and a beneﬁt concert.</P>

<P>The Women's and Gender Studies Program sponsors regular symposia ongender issues that include presentations by Women's and Gender Studiesfaculty as well as Women's and Gender Studies scholars from abroad andthe United States. With the support of the Laura C. Harris endowment,the Women's and Gender Studies Program has hosted internationallyrenowned scholars including Linda Alcoff, M.

<P>The Writing Program afﬁrms the importance Denison places oninculcating in our students the importance of learning to write, not onlyas a means of expressing themselves, but also as a way of learning.We believe that good writers take intellectual risks, explore ideas, makeconnections, and participate in broader, on-going conversations throughwriting. Our program aims to develop these habits of mind. We expectstudents to be able to make cogent arguments, anticipate and meet theneeds of their audience, gather and synthesize evidence, and apply theconventions of style and grammar. By repeated experiences in writing-intensive courses situated within the context of academic programsacross the university, students will develop writing skills and deepen theirliberal arts education.</P>
