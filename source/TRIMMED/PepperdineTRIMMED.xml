<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>The mission of the Business Administration Division is to provide students with a superior business and liberal arts education that prepares them for lives of ethical service and professional achievement in a competitive world. </P>

<P>The program at Seaver College is unusual in that it is embedded in a college of arts, letters, and sciences. More than tolerating or coexisting with the traditional goals of liberal baccalaureate education, the division seeks to embrace fully a liberal arts education as an essential component of the educated man or woman. The division expects its graduates to do well in business, yet of most importance is that they do well as individuals who are finding meaning and significance in life and are contributing to making the world a better place. Our goal is to educate students for ethical, fulfilling lives of service. </P>

<P>A liberal arts education has to do more with a spirit of inquiry than content; therefore, rather than taking a narrow approach, the division emphasizes broadly applicable skills: personal judgment and responsibility; an active, questioning mind sensitive to contexts; and the ability to make sense of “facts” and their implications for society. Questions of why or why not are more important than those of “how to.” </P>

<P>In addition to preparing students for life, the curriculum prepares students for careers in accounting, business, or management, and is an excellent foundation for graduate work in business administration. Special emphasis is currently available in the areas of economics, computer science, marketing, management, and finance if students choose their elective courses to match their interests. The various emphases allow students to prepare for entry-level jobs, while the other business requirements ensure a broader background for future professional advancement. </P>

<P>An accounting major is available for students who plan to do graduate work in accounting or to enter the fields of public or private accounting. This major involves more course work than the other majors. Its requirements are outlined below in the course requirements. </P>

<P>An international business major is available for students who are specifically interested in global business careers. This major requires some educational work abroad unless one is an international student. </P>

<P>The degrees offered by the Seaver College Business Administration Division are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). </P>

<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>The Communication Division includes many interrelated academic disciplines dealing with the theory and practice of human communication, whether in written, oral, or visual form. In many professions—teaching, journalism, management, screen arts, advertising, public relations, politics, community service, the ministry, and, increasingly, in government and industry—conscious attention must be devoted to developing professional communication skills. Even in the daily experiences of citizenship, family living, and business, the quality of life depends heavily upon the effective communication of information, values, and feelings. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2903">Special Programs and Opportunities </H3>

<P>The Communication Division sponsors a variety of programs and societies to supplement the regular academic schedule. </P>

<P>These organizations provide opportunities for communication majors to meet and work with professional journalists, broadcasters, advertising agencies, communication managers, organizational consultants, and public relations experts, and to enter professionally-sanctioned state and national competitions. Regular activities for journalism and broadcasting majors include the annual journalism and screen arts award banquets and participation in the Associated Collegiate Press convention, and the national conference of the Public Relations Student Society of America. There are active chapters of Lambda Pi Eta, the communication honor society; and the Public Relations Student Society of America. </P>

<P>The Pepperdine Communication mentoring fellowship offers students an opportunity to be mentored by members of the broadcast industry. Broadcast students participate in national video festival competitions at BEA and Reelstories. </P>

<P>Internship programs provide opportunities for all majors to work in a professional capacity with advertising and public relations agencies, with local radio stations, TV stations, and newspapers, and with governmental and industrial concerns. Students perform communication functions at the same time they complete their academic training. </P>

<P>Campus media and the forensics team, centered in the Communication Division, are important parts of student life. Students on the forensics team compete in British Parliamentary debate in the US and abroad. The University-operated television and radio stations provide entertainment and information to the campus and the Malibu community, and also provide invaluable on-air opportunities. Student publications inform the campus community through the newspaper, the Graphic; the Online Graphic; and the feature article magazine, Currents. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2904">Communication Bachelor of Arts Degrees </H3>

<P>Human symbolic activity is the focus of the communication disciplines. The use of symbols differentiates humans from all other forms of life. Hence, the heart of a liberal education is an understanding of how human symbols function in relationships, cultures, and societies. From ancient to modern times, philosophers and theorists have recognized the central importance of communication to human development and performance. </P>

<P>Communicating is a process that involves the interaction of human beings in society; it can be the means to create, maintain, or destroy societies and cultures. As communicators, humans are involved intrapersonally through thoughts, emotions, and beliefs and interpersonally through manifested symbolic communication activities. People also communicate via mediated channels and have messages distributed to mass audiences. By examining the various communication processes and systems, one can become a more beneficial and effective producer and consumer of various types of communication in an ever-changing global environment. </P>

<P>While there are many curricular differences in communication studies, the areas within the discipline share much in common. Clearly, our theoretical bases are all interrelated and interdependent. Differences do exist at the application level, but the concept of a common, supporting core of theory and research is fundamental to the Communication Division. Students majoring in any communication major must also take COM 180 as a part of their general education requirements. No other Seaver College general education course will serve as a substitute for this course. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Advertising </H3>

<P>The advertising major prepares students for careers in advertising agencies, in the advertising departments of the mass media, or in business organizations performing advertising functions. In addition to the general education requirements, all advertising students must take 44 units (34 upper-division) in the major and nine to 12 upper-division units in an outside concentration. </P>

<P>The outside concentration of nine to 12 upper-division units is designed to complement and support the major. The area of concentration must be outside of mass communication, and the student’s major advisor must approve the concentration area and the specific courses to be taken. </P>

<P>Communication Core Courses: 12 units </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2905">Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies </H3>

<P>The student who majors in communication examines the role of verbal and nonverbal communication in human relationships. Since the process of communication is profoundly affected by contexts, modes, and media, as well as by personal characteristics, the major requires a broad range of courses. The study of communication is crucial to a broad liberal arts education. </P>

<P>Not only is the ability to communicate with symbols uniquely human (and, hence, central to understanding the human condition), but it is also of practical value. Communication skills are important in work and leisure, profession and home, politics and religion, and in many other areas. Many careers require a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of communication. </P>

<P>Because of our commitment to the liberal arts and the interdisciplinary nature of communication theory and inquiry, students in this major take course work in human communication, in mass communication, and in other complementary areas. </P>

Believing that our students need to know how to behave professionally if they are to be successful in their work, we run our rehearsals according to the rules of Actors Equity, which places high expectations on both the actors and the production team. Realizing that the theatre is a public laboratory in which performers and audience members engage in the exploration of ideas, we select plays that pose fundamental questions about what it means to be a human being, created in the image of God, living in the midst of a fallen world. </P>

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Art History </H3>

<P>Study of the visual arts prepares students for leadership in the global, connected, and dynamic world of the 21st century. To truly understand the significance of a work of art, the art historian must comprehend not only its formal qualities, but also the political, social, and religious contexts in which the work was created. Students of art history place art in its comprehensive historical context, assess art and the field of art history critically and analytically, master research, writing, and presentation skills, and foster community engagement in art through outreach and education. By examining works of art from multiple perspectives, students develop an appreciation for diverse cultures and the vital role that art plays in human expression across time and space. </P>

<P>Students planning to major in art history spend the first two years taking two foundational courses, completing general education requirements, and mastering language skills. The junior and senior years are spent concentrating on the major. In consultation with an art history faculty advisor, art history majors can select one or more areas of concentration depending on interests and career goals. Majors are strongly encouraged to participate in at least one of Pepperdine’s international programs after consulting with an art history advisor regarding which international programs and courses would be most appropriate. </P>

<P>Art history majors should consider selecting German or French for their language requirement, as these languages are generally required in graduate-level art history programs. Students who test out of the Seaver College language requirement are strongly encouraged to take a 252-level language course and one upper-division language course in their language of choice. </P>

<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division believes that undergraduate education is the special place where students can refine their values and learn the ideas and methods of thinking that will enrich their lives and vocations. Its programs develop the excellence of mind and qualities of soul that foster intellectual independence: spirited inquiry and disciplined imagination; intelligent interpretation and persistent questioning of texts; reverence for language and rigorous exposition, argumentation, logic, and problem solving; attentiveness to the phenomena of time and the ordering of history; and aesthetic and ethical understanding. These programs of study are morally inscribed, mobilizing the virtues that go hand-in-hand with academic inquiry—courage and confidence in one’s undertakings, charity and civility, honesty and humility—all of which sustain communities of learning. This education aims to develop the whole person, whose habits of reflection and sound judgment strengthen students for lives of thoughtfulness, service, and responsible influence. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_2931">This academic division offers degrees in the several areas of study listed above. Students majoring in the humanities disciplines have gone on to careers in elementary, secondary, and college-level education; law and advocacy; business and nonprofit corporations; professional writing and editing; stage and the arts; and television, radio, and film. The division’s emphasis on independent, rigorous thought and on collaborative analysis provides excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields. Graduates have achieved advanced degrees in business, creative writing, education, English, law, librarianship and information management, ministry and religion, and philosophy. Because the courses in this division develop skills and practices in written and verbal communication and in the arts of inquiry, they also complement any major. Double majors with non-humanistic disciplines are always welcomed. </P>

<H3>Professional Preparation </H3>

<P>Teaching and the Humanities </P>

<P>The Teacher Education department, housed in the same division with Humanities, maintains completely current instruction on all requirements toward a California teaching credential. The liberal arts for education major provides the breadth required of candidates for the multiple subject credential, while the English major provides the breadth and depth required of candidates for the single subject credential in English. (Single-subject teaching credentials are offered in a variety of other curricular areas as well.) Students can acquire both subject matter preparation and skills preparation, including: interpretation of literature; knowledge of the structure, history, and diversity of the English language; oral and written language skills; uses of technology; and (if they choose) teaching foundations and methodology. This study will prepare students for the appropriate credential examinations and for effective, well-informed teaching in their future occupation. </P>

<P>Business and the Humanities </P>

<P>The modern business world recognizes the value of a strong background in the liberal arts and the humanities for management positions in business. Corporate leaders have found that students majoring in the humanities have acquired the skills and training valuable for success in business: communication skills; flexibility; decision-making ability; research skills; appreciation of creativity and excellence; and sensitivity to cultural and ethnic differences. Humanities students considering business careers may take a number of business courses along with their Humanities Division courses. With this combined background they will find broad opportunities in the business field. </P>

<P>Pre-Law and the Humanities </P>

<P>Since the student will learn the content of law in law school, the best preparation in pre-law is an education that hones skills in analytical and logical thinking and in written and oral communication. A complete education should be the primary purpose of any liberal arts program, and the knowledge and intellectual maturity which the study of the humanities provides are aimed toward that goal. The English, history, and humanities degree programs are designed to provide training and practice in the skills needed in the field of law: logical thinking and analysis of arguments; close reading and analysis of texts; and effective writing and speaking. These skills will prepare students for the LSAT, for successful performance in their legal studies, and for a fulfilling career. </P>

<P>Professional Writing and Editing </P>

<P>The ability to write well has become a highly valued specialization; persons skilled in this area find careers in writing and editing not only in publishing companies and magazines, but in businesses and government agencies of all sorts, and in the creative arts. The degree programs in creative writing and in the English writing and rhetoric emphasis provide profession-oriented training and practice that foster creativity in a variety of genres and for a variety of purposes, critical appreciation of written texts, refinement of communication skills, and knowledge of language conventions. These degree programs coordinate classroom learning with practical application through University creative writing publications and internships. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2932">Special Programs and Opportunities </H3>

<P>The Humanities and Teacher Education Division offers students many opportunities to broaden the study of their chosen discipline and to apply their knowledge in practice through tutoring, writing internships, and guided research. These activities prove valuable in developing knowledge and skills needed in graduate study and in various careers. </P>

<P>Minors </P>

<P>Students have the opportunity to add to their major in one of the humanities disciplines and minor in one (or more) of the following: African American studies, digital humanities, film studies, creative writing, writing, and women’s studies. In addition, the English and history disciplines offer minors as well as majors. In consultation with their advisors, students may design a rich and varied undergraduate experience. </P>

<P>Practical Application </P>

<P>Students who distinguish themselves in writing have the opportunity to gain practical experience applying their skills. After studying in a Writing Center practicum, they may be recommended for a paid position as a tutor in the Writing Center. In addition, writing internships are available in business, nonprofit organizations, and publishing companies. </P>

<P>Research </P>

<P>Students may participate in a summer research program under a faculty member who will direct a small group in a focused project. Summer research helps students to expand and refine their research skills, gain advanced knowledge in the field, develop professionalism, and identify their career goals. The summer research experience is especially valuable for students planning on graduate study in their discipline. </P>

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing </H3>

<P>The creative writing major is primarily designed to prepare students for inspiring careers as professional writers of screen and television, the novel, poetry, and the short story. Through intensive practice in our three-tiered creative writing sequence, students hone not only their skills but their understanding of the expectations and challenges of writing and publishing. </P>

<P>The major also prepares students for advanced graduate degrees in creative writing, literature, and other fields, as well as a variety of professional careers. Many careers demand a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of writing; while providing this understanding, creative writing also fine tunes the student’s ear for language. These skills are important in work and leisure, written and oral media, self-exploration and politics, and in many other areas. </P>

The proposal should include a bibliography of relevant material (primary and secondary) as well as an abstract of the project. Students should work closely with their faculty mentor on the thesis. During the spring of their senior year, honors students will enroll in ENG 490 (an existing course that also includes non-honors students) and write an article-length thesis. The thesis will be submitted in April of the students’ senior year to their thesis advisor and to the English Honors Committee, who will determine whether honors will be awarded. Students are encouraged to present their research at local and national meetings and/or submit a revised article-length manuscript to a scholarly journal for publication.

<H5 id="LinkTarget_2945">Teaching Credential Programs </H5>

<P>The objective of the Seaver teacher education program is to provide teacher candidates with the professional preparation and clinical experiences necessary to qualify them for the SB2042 Multiple Subject Preliminary Teaching Credential or the SB2042 Single Subject Preliminary Teaching Credential. The teaching credential program at Seaver is integrated into the bachelor’s degree so that a candidate can work toward a bachelor’s degree and a teaching credential simultaneously. Completing a bachelor’s degree and the teacher education program generally requires eight or nine semesters; therefore, careful attention should be given to course scheduling. EDUC 461, 462, and 463/464 should be taken before the Teaching and Content Area Methods course (EDUC 510 or 520). Teacher candidates should plan their schedules in order to be ready to take the methods courses and clinical experiences during their last two semesters. Teacher candidates are encouraged to complete all major course work before their full-day student teaching clinical experience begins and may choose to complete it either during their senior year or immediately upon graduation. </P>

<P>The credential programs were developed in compliance with requirements of the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The SB2042 credential issued by CTC includes English Learner authorization. To learn about California Teaching Credentials, see the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing at

<H5 id="LinkTarget_2946">Multiple-Subject Credential </H5>

<P>The multiple-subject teaching credential is generally considered to be an elementary school credential, most applicable to kindergarten and grades 1 through 6, where one classroom teacher traditionally is responsible for multiple subjects in the curriculum. This credential entitles the holder to teach a self-contained program, individually or as part of a teaching team, from preschool through grade 12. </P>

<P>Multiple-subject credential candidates must demonstrate subject-matter competence in the broad range of school curricula and teaching topics by passing the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET), which is offered regularly throughout the region by Evaluation Systems, Pearson. The state of California requires that students must have established subject-matter competence prior to beginning EDUC 510 and EDUC 521. This is a state requirement and cannot be waived. Other qualifications may need to be met through course work and/or tests. Students may discuss additional requirements with their advisor. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5 id="LinkTarget_2947">Single-Subject Credential </H5>

<P>Single-subject credential candidates may teach a single subject, specified on the credential, from preschool through grade 12. However, this credential is generally recognized as most appropriate for for those who want to teach middle and high school, grades 6 through 12. </P>

<P>Prior to beginning EDUC 520 and EDUC 521, teacher candidates must take and pass the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) to establish subject-matter competence. English majors in the commission-approved subject-matter program at Seaver are exempt from taking the CSET. All other candidates are required to take the CSET.

<H3>Bachelor of Arts in International Studies </H3>

<P>Every generation believes its own time to be of the greatest historical significance, but surely the past century was one of the more influential in history. Technological developments allowed scarcely-imagined advances in communication, transportation, and production. Medical research conquered ancient scourges and allowed millions to live who otherwise would have succumbed to disease. The world’s population soared from one to over six billion as a result of all these developments. Worldwide warfare brought to an end the age of empires, which had been a constant of the international scene since the dawn of history, and established the ideal of political and economic liberty. Religious belief, far from disappearing as many predicted, became increasingly influential worldwide. </P>

<P>These events have resulted in the emergence of a global metropolis where many different groups of people inhabit a world where traditional barriers of time and distance have fallen dramatically. The United States, the leading power of this time, has but four percent of the population of this new metropolis. Consequently, Americans—indeed, people from all countries— will need an ever-deeper understanding of the other residents of the global metropolis to maintain political stability, foster economic growth, and understand the views of those with markedly different attitudes, assumptions, and goals. This understanding will occur in a century in which constant change becomes a constant. In this volatile and interdependent world, students of international affairs must possess a keen grasp of the relationship of political, economic, and cultural forces. </P>

<P>To meet this challenge, Seaver College offers a bachelor of arts in international studies, which is an interdisciplinary major comprised of a sequence of courses in international politics, economics, and communication. Students further specialize in one of seven functional or regional areas such as economic studies, political studies, international management studies, international/intercultural communication studies, Asian studies, European studies, or Latin American studies. </P>

<P>The international studies major is designed for students who may enter such varied fields as diplomacy, government service, international mass media, multinational business, international religious service, and other fields requiring international understanding and expertise. It also provides a solid foundation for students wishing to pursue graduate degrees or to enter the job market for further experience and training in multicultural contexts. </P>

<P>The primary aims of the international studies major are: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>To provide undergraduates with the technical skills and conceptual ability to understand, appreciate, and interact profitably with communities outside American society. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>To demonstrate an understanding of the ethical implications of cross-cultural and global issues. </LBody>
</LI>

<Sect>
<H5>First-Year Program </H5>

<P>The international studies major should enroll in the typical first-year program as outlined in this catalog, taking COM 180, ECON 200, POSC 104, and languages as part of the general education work. Students planning to study abroad during their sophomore year should complete as many of these courses as possible during their first year. </P>

<H5>Study Abroad </H5>

<P>The international studies major is strongly encouraged to study abroad through International Programs. The programs are an excellent way to gain overseas experience and make rapid progress in fulfilling the language requirement for the international studies major. Please see the International Programs section of the catalog for more detailed information. </P>

<H5>Required Courses for the Major </H5>

<P>The total number of units required for the major varies by specialization, but most require 32 units. See each specialization for exact course requirements. Four courses comprise the core of the international studies major. INTS 344, INTS 351, and INTS 514 provide students with an understanding of the economic, cultural, and political factors that comprise the international environment. (Students specializing in economic studies will take ECON 212 rather than INTS 351.) The Senior Seminar (INTS 497) is the major capstone course that integrates the student’s studies in these areas in general and the specialization in particular. </P>

To meet this challenge, the division sponsors courses in Asian culture as well as extracurricular activities that put students in contact with scholars, diplomats, and business executives in the Asian community. The international studies major offers an Asian studies specialization that allows students to investigate traditional Asian views and institutions in a comparative way under the guidance of experts in Chinese and Japanese history, literature, and language. </P>

<H5>Economic Studies Specialization </H5>

<P>The past century has been a time of phenomenal world economic growth. International trade and finance play a crucial role in the global metropolis. Increasingly, international political and cultural disputes are closely related to this tighter economic integration of the world’s countries. The economics studies specialization provides students with a foundation and understanding of the production, distribution, and consumption of resources within both domestic and international political systems. It also provides the background for further study of international economics or entry into a public or private organization concerned with economic issues. </P>

<P>This specialization requires the completion of 36 units plus a minimum of eight units of foreign language. ECON 210, ECON 211, and MATH 140 should be taken as prerequisites.

<H5>International/Intercultural Communication Studies Specialization </H5>

<P>Cultural diversity is a fact of the global metropolis. Human societies have developed myriad ways of coping with and surviving the physical and social environment. Therefore, people are very different in their ways of making sense of the world, their acceptable rules for behavior, and their deeply-felt values. Increasing globalization brings many of these cultures in increasing contact—and conflict—with one another. The international studies major offers an international/intercultural communication studies track for students desiring to explore more deeply the cultural dimensions of international communication. This specialization has been developed especially for those who see their future work with individuals within international and intercultural institutions. Such work could relate to the mass media but is not limited to such efforts. Anyone working with educational, religious, or political institutions and any other group in which human interaction is of major significance could choose this particular specialization. In combination with business administration offerings or courses in political science, this emphasis also provides an opportunity for a broad-based preparation leading to enrollment in graduate programs or specific service career. </P>

<P>This specialization requires the completion of 31 to 32 units in addition to a minimum of eight units of foreign language. ECON 200 and either PSYC 200 or SOC 200 should be taken to satisfy the GE requirement in human institutions and behavior. </P>

<H5>The Honors Research Program in Biology </H5>

<P>Biology majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how scientists design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Students apply to the program in their sophomore or junior year and are admitted to the program based upon GPA, recommendations, career goals, and potential for successful completion of the program. Students are selected by a committee at midyear and, upon acceptance, develop research proposals in close consultation with a faculty member. After proposals are reviewed and approved by the committee, students begin preliminary experimentation. All students are required to spend the summer following acceptance to the program in full-time data collection and analysis. In order to complete the program, students must present their data in thesis form to an examining committee. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student’s transcript and diploma be marked “Honors in Biology.” Thesis projects are often presented at local and national meetings and published in national and international scientific journals. </P>

<H3>The Division </H3>

<P>With an emphasis on academic rigor and intellectual inquiry based on the personal commitment of each faculty member to Christ and the Christian faith, the Religion and Philosophy Division seeks to lead students into a deeper understanding of religion, especially of Christianity. </P>

<P>Academically, the division focuses on the one hand on biblical studies, Christian history, systematic theology, and practical theology/ministry; and on the other hand it explores matters of human knowledge and experience, morality and ethics, and reasoning. To those ends the division offers courses that introduce the student to the study of religion and philosophy within a variety of cultures, both ancient and modern. </P>

<P>Through its undergraduate majors, the division prepares students for a variety of undertakings. Some religion majors become ministers in local churches. Some will go on to earn graduate degrees (MA, MS, or MDiv) to enhance their ministerial skills and/or to pursue a career in university teaching. Majors in religion or philosophy provide students with a broad, liberal arts degree that prepares them well for graduate work and careers in law, journalism, business, psychology, counseling, government, and public service, to name but a few. </P>

<P>Through its three graduate degrees (MA in Religion, MS in Ministry, and MDiv), the division prepares students for a variety of Christian ministries, and for further graduate study in several related fields. Students who wish to combine their theological training with the training of the legal profession may earn the master of divinity degree jointly with the Juris Doctorate from the Pepperdine University School of Law. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H3 id="LinkTarget_2974">Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy </H3>

<P>The philosophy major is designed to offer students a broad education in historical and contemporary philosophical explorations of various regions of human experience, including the nature of knowledge and reality, the theoretical foundations of morality and ethics, and the distinction between cogent and fallacious reasoning. Philosophy examines the fundamental assumptions and problems implicit in the framework of human experience, critically assesses those assumptions, and seeks to articulate and defend alternatives for their improvement. Consequently, the philosophy major offers students a valuable educational background for the pursuit of careers in law, journalism, government, Christian ministry, public service, and business. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Course Requirements </H5>

The political science major is designed for students who are interested in public service and administration, politics, diplomacy, public relations, law, or business, or who wish to continue in graduate studies to pursue an academic career. A specialized major in government is also designed to satisfy the guidelines for a single-subject teaching credential in government. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>Course Requirements </H5>

<P>All political science majors must take POSC 104 (four units). Normally, they should take this course before taking upper-division political science courses. </P>

<P>The political science major requires a minimum of 32 upper-division units. Political science majors who take POSC 250 must take 28 upper-division units to complete the major. To ensure a breadth of knowledge, a political science major must take at least one course from four of the following five fields of political science, and include a presentation skills/research methods course as well as a writing-intensive course: </P>

<P>Methodology: POSC 250 (GE, PS, RM), 310 (PS, RM), and </P>

<P>460 (PS, RM) Political theory: POSC 311 (WI), 416, 417, 518 American government and politics: POSC 409, 420–437 International relations: POSC 344 (WI), 442–449 Comparative government: POSC 353 (WI), 410, 451–459, 461 </P>

<P>No more than one supervised fieldwork class (POSC 495) can be included in the minimum of 32 upper-division political science units. A maximum of four units in supervised fieldwork may be taken for credit/no credit toward the required units in the major. Political science majors, particularly those planning to pursue graduate studies in political science, are urged to meet their general education mathematics requirement by taking POSC 250. </P>

<P>Students majoring in political science may choose to have one of the following classes applied toward the requirement of 32 upper-division units, but no more than one class will be accepted: INTS 445, INTS 453, INTS 455, or INTS 465. INTS 445 fulfills the Comparative Politics subfield requirement. INTS 453, INTS 455, and INTS 465 fulfill the International Relations subfield requirement. For students participating in the political science honors program, credit for POSC 491 and POSC 493 cannot be included in the minimum of 32 upper-division political science units. </P>

<H5>The Honors Research Program in Political Science </H5>

<P>Political science majors are encouraged to participate in the Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how professional political scientists design research projects, collect and analyze data or interpret philosophical texts, and communicate their results to the academic community. Students apply to the program in the spring semester of their junior year and are admitted to the program based on their GPA, career goals, successful completion of a course or courses in political methodology (such as POSC 250, 310, and/or 460), and the degree of congruence between the topic of the student’s proposed honors project and the expertise of the regular members of the political science faculty. Students are selected by a committee in the spring semester of the student’s junior year and are notified in time for preregistration for the fall semester of the next academic year. Upon acceptance into the program, students enroll in POSC 491: Honors Seminar. During the spring semester, the student will research and write an article-length manuscript under the supervision of one of the regular political science professors. In order to complete the program, students must present their findings in thesis form to an examining committee composed of the thesis supervisor and two other regular political science faculty. After each candidate successfully completes an oral thesis defense, the committee recommends that the student’s transcript and diploma be marked “Honors in Political Science.” It is expected that the thesis will be presented as an academic conference paper and that a revised version will be submitted for publication as an article in a scholarly social science journal. </P>

<H3 id="LinkTarget_2986">Bachelor of Arts in Psychology </H3>

<P>The psychology major is designed for students who (1) plan careers as professional psychologists, (2) regard psychology as a liberal arts undergraduate foundation for subsequent training in other professions, and (3) are generally interested in understanding human behavior. Because graduate study is usually required for careers in the psychological professions, the major is designed to give adequate preparation for such study. </P>

<P>A total of 43 units is required for the major. These include 16 units of foundation requirements, 13 to 16 upper-division units selected from each of four basic content areas, and three to four upper-division units chosen from capstone courses, from either applied or integrative areas. Remaining units may be selected from the four basic content areas, capstone courses, or special interest areas. Scientific writing and service learning are important components of the psychology curriculum. Students wishing more information about the major and careers in psychology should pick up the Psychology Advisory Handbook in the Social Science Division office and attend functions of Psi Chi, the national honor society in psychology. </P>

<Sect>
<H5>The Honors Research Program in Psychology </H5>

<P>Psychology majors are encouraged to participate in the two-semester Honors Research Program, which is aimed at providing students with insight into how psychological scientists design research projects, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Students apply to the program in the fall semester of their junior year and are admitted to the program based on their GPA, career goals, and successful completion of prerequisite psychology courses (PSYC 200 or 210, 250, 310, and enrollment in 442 during the spring semester of their junior year). Students are selected by a committee in the fall semester of their junior year and are notified in time for preregistration for the spring semester of that same academic year. Upon acceptance into the program, students enroll in PSYC 493 (Honors Research Seminar I) and PSYC 442 (Intermediate Statistics and Computer Applications) for the spring of their junior year, and then enroll in PSYC 494 (Honors Research Seminar II) for the fall of their senior year. During the first semester of the program, the student will design an original experiment including the formulation of a hypothesis, completion of a literature review, and creation of a research design under the supervision of one of the psychology professors. Students will be required to present their research proposals formally to the psychology faculty and the other students in the class. During the second semester of the program, students will collect and statistically analyze their data. In order to complete the program, students must present their research findings in written, APA format as a manuscript for publication as well as successfully complete an oral research presentation before the psychology faculty and students. Upon successful completion of these research requirements, the psychology faculty will recommend that students’ transcripts and diplomas be marked “Honors in Psychology.” It is expected that the research will be presented at a local, regional or national professional psychological conference. </P>

<H5>Industrial/Organizational Psychology Minor </H5>

<P>A minor in industrial/organizational psychology can be combined with a major in any field. A minimum of 19 units in the areas of psychology and business are required for the industrial/organizational psychology minor. Those majoring in the fields of psychology, sociology, and business may find an industrial/organizational psychology minor especially helpful to their career goals, but those majoring in political science, economics, religion, communication, and other fields may find it equally beneficial. A minor in industrial/organizational psychology may help students gain admission to master’s degree programs in business as well as industrial/ organizational psychology. The minor may also prepare students to secure employment in the human services field immediately after graduation with a bachelor’s degree. </P>

<P>Today, industrial/organizational psychologists continue to be active in offering professional services through the scientist/practitioner model in settings that involve human resource management. They work in both private and nonprofit sectors and in government agencies. Many offer service as professional consultants, managers, or evaluators.
