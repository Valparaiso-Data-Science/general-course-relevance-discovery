<P>Section Descriptions of 10130. Core Biology </P>

<P>A. Neurobiology. This course explores the principles governing the organization, operation, and evolution of living systems by examining these concepts through the lens of neuroscience. Through laboratory investigations, readings from the popular and scientific press, and directed writing exercises, the methods of scientific inquiry and logic of scientific reasoning will be introduced. In this exploration, the following questions will be addressed: How are all living organisms organized and how does that organization contribute to their function? What are the mechanisms by which organisms sense and respond to changes in their environment and engage in functional interactions within that environment? What are the biological and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie natural organismal behaviors including, but not limited to, motivated and circadian-driven behaviors? Both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems will be examined to explore the processes at work in all living systems as well as the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of life's diversity. M. McNulty. Autumn, Spring. L. </P>

<P>B. Microbes and Immunity. These sections cover the most basic concepts in biology, such as life, macromolecules, cells, energy, metabolism, evolution, and genomics, as well as human anatomy and physiology. These particular sections draw examples from microbiology and immunology to tie these basic concepts together. </P>

<P>E. Ecology. Have you wondered how the environment has influenced your anatomy, physiology, and psychology through your lifetime? Each one of us continuously interacts, directly or indirectly, with the rest of the Earth’s biodiversity at different levels, from molecules, cells, organisms, populations, ecosystems, and the whole biosphere. Are we really independent individuals, or do we need a better concept that broadens our understanding of the world we live in? In this course you will examine fundamental biological principles to understand how organisms live and thrive in a complex and intricate network that we call nature. You will develop your own criteria based on evidence obtained through hypothesis testing and identification of legitimate sources of information. O. Pineda. Autumn, Winter. L. </P>

<P>F. Ecology and Evolution. This course focuses on the interaction of organisms with their environment and evolutionary processes that lead to diversity and adaptation.

<H3>Civilization Studies </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64311">Civilization studies provide an in-depth examination of the development and accomplishments of one of the world's great civilizations through direct encounters with significant and exemplary documents and monuments. These sequences complement the literary and philosophical study of texts central to the humanities sequences, as well as the study of synchronous social theories that shape basic questions in the social science sequences. Their approach stresses the grounding of events and ideas in historical context and the interplay of events, institutions, ideas, and cultural expressions in social change. The courses emphasize texts rather than surveys as a way of getting at the ideas, cultural patterns, and social pressures that frame the understanding of events and institutions within a civilization. And they seek to explore a civilization as an integrated entity, capable of developing and evolving meanings that inform the lives of its citizens. </P>

<P>Unless otherwise specified, courses should be taken in sequence. Note the prerequisites, if any, included in the course description of each sequence. Some civilization sequences are two-quarter sequences; others are three-quarter sequences. Students may meet a two-quarter civilization requirement with two courses from a three-quarter sequence. </P>

<P>Because civilization studies sequences offer an integrated, coherent approach to the study of a civilization, students cannot change sequences. Students can neither combine courses from a civilization sequence with a freestanding course nor combine various freestanding courses to create a civilization studies sequence. Students who wish to use such combinations are seldom granted approval to their petitions, including petitions from students with curricular and scheduling conflicts who have postponed meeting the civilization studies requirement until their third or fourth year in the College. </P>

As we examine the variety of their experiences, we will often call into question what we mean in the first place by “Europe” and “civilization.” Rather than providing a narrative of high politics, the sequence will emphasize the contested geographic, religious, social, and racial boundaries that have defined and redefined Europe and its people over the centuries. We will read and discuss sources covering the period from the early Middle Ages to the present, from a variety of genres: saga, biography, personal letters, property records, political treatises, memoirs, and government documents, to name only a few. Individual instructors may choose different sources and highlight different aspects of European civilization, but some of the most important readings will be the same in all sections. The two-quarter sequence may also be supplemented by a third quarter, in which students will have the opportunity to explore in greater depth a particular topic in the history of European civilization. This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_64312">General Education Sequences </P>

<P>All first-year students take a Humanities sequence that engages them in the pleasure and challenge of humanistic works through the close reading of literary, historical, and philosophical texts. These are not survey courses; rather, they work to establish methods for appreciating and analyzing the meaning and power of exemplary texts. The class discussions and the writing assignments are based on textual analysis. In combination with these courses, students are required to take a zero-unit seminar (HUMA 19100 Humanities Writing Seminars) that introduces the analysis and practice of expert academic writing. </P>

<P>All HUMA 10000-level sequences that meet general education requirements, listed below, are available as either a two-quarter sequence (Autumn, Winter) or as a three-quarter sequence (Autumn, Winter, Spring). Once students begin a sequence, they are expected to remain in the same sequence. Students are expected to complete this foundational requirement in their first year. NOTE: Students registered in any of the sequences below must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>HUMA 11500-11600-11700. Philosophical Perspectives I-II-III. </P>

<P>This sequence considers philosophy in two lights: as an ongoing series of arguments addressed to certain fundamental questions about the place of human beings in the world and as a historically situated discipline interacting with and responding to developments in other areas of thought and culture. Readings tend to divide between works of philosophy and contemporaneous works of literature, but they may also include texts of scientific, religious, or legal practice. </P>

<P>HUMA 11500. Philosophical Perspectives I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In Autumn Quarter, we explore fundamental ethical questions-concerning virtue, the good life, the role of the individual in society-as they were formulated by ancient Greek writers and philosophers. Our focus is on Plato, Aristotle, and the Greek dramatists. Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>HUMA 11600. Philosophical Perspectives II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Winter Quarter explores metaphysical and epistemological questions as they arise in seminal writings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Skeptical arguments-about the possibility of various kinds of knowledge and of freedom-are a focus. Authors tend to include Descartes, Hume, Voltaire, Newton, and others. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): HUMA 11500 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. </P>

<P>HUMA 11700. Philosophical Perspectives III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>HUMA 12050-12150-12250. Greece and Rome: Texts, Traditions, Transformations I-II-III. </P>

<P>This sequence takes the view that traditions are not normative but formative: less stable, pre-given structures than self-constituting and self-questioning bodies in perennial transformation. In that light, it offers a grounding in some major texts of the Classical Greek and Latin traditions (read in English translation) as well as their reception at pivotal moments in modernity. These are texts that have sustained a community of reading and commentary, debate and critique, ever since their inception, and which continue to resonate through our institutions and values today. In our encounter with them, we will develop the tools to follow our curiosity and read in inquiring and original ways, as well as to defend our readings with respect to the texts. Each quarter is devoted to one or two genres and each includes Greek, Roman, and modern texts that build on each other. Autumn opens with the epic. Winter sees us delve into the paired genres of tragedy and history, examining how each tries to explain and evaluate societies through distinct modes of narrative and speech. Spring alternates between comedy as a vehicle for subverting, defending, or reconciling ourselves to social norms and the subject of love in philosophical and literary perspectives. </P>

<P>HUMA 12050. Greece and Rome: Texts, Traditions, Transformations I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Autumn Quarter examines the epic tradition with a focus on warfare, foundation, and the social order. Readings cover Homer's Iliad, Vergil's Aeneid, and Dante's Inferno. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>HUMA 12150. Greece and Rome: Texts, Traditions, Transformations II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Winter Quarter focuses on how tragedy and history confront familial, social, and external conflict in different genres. Readings cover Aeschylus, &quot;Oresteia,&quot; selections from the histories of Herodotus, Livy, and Tacitus, tragedies by Seneca, and several of Shakespeare's history plays. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): HUMA 12050 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. </P>

<P>HUMA 12250. Greece and Rome: Texts, Traditions, Transformations III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Spring Quarter picks up comedy from Dante's Divina Commedia-the Inferno was read in the Autumn-and explores the genre head-on with readings from Aristophanes, Plautus, and Shakespeare that treat social integration with a lighter touch than do the texts from Autumn and Winter. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): HUMA 12150 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. </P>

<P>Humanities </P>

<P>HUMA 12300-12400-12500. Human Being and Citizen I-II-III. </P>

<P>Socrates asks, &quot;Who is a knower of such excellence, of a human being and of a citizen?&quot; We are all concerned to discover what it means to be an excellent human being and an excellent citizen, and to learn what a just community is. This sequence explores these and related matters, and helps us to examine critically our opinions about them. To this end, we read and discuss seminal works of the Western tradition, selected both because they illumine the central questions and because, read together, they form a compelling record of human inquiry. Insofar as they force us to consider different and competing ways of asking and answering questions about human and civic excellence, it is impossible for us to approach these writings as detached spectators. Instead, we come to realize our own indebtedness to our predecessors and are inspired to continue their task of inquiry. In addition to providing a deeper appreciation of who we are as human beings and citizens, this sequence aims to cultivate the liberating skills of careful reading, writing, speaking, and listening. 2017–18 readings for this general education sequence consisted of philosophical and literary texts from Ancient Greece to the twentieth century, organized around the themes of &quot;Human Being&quot; and &quot;Citizen." </P>

<P>HUMA 12400. Human Being and Citizen II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Readings in the Autumn Quarter included Genesis, Plato (Euthyphro and Apology), and Homer (Iliad). The Winter Quarter focused on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Augustine's Confessions, and Dante's Inferno. The texts for the Spring Quarter were Shakespeare's The Tempest, Kant's &quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot; and Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, No Name in the Street by James Baldwin, and Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse.

<P>HUMA 13500-13600-13700. Introduction to the Humanities I-II-III. </P>

<P>This sequence emphasizes writing, both as an object of study and as a practice. As we study the texts of the course, we pay special attention to questions about how they function as instances of writing: How does the writing of a text shape the way that we understand it? How does writing shape our sense of what we are doing in the humanities? Such questions about writing will lead to similar questions about language in general: How is our understanding shaped by the language we use? In the Autumn Quarter, we'll ask these questions within classical and familiar norms for using language to argue, to analyze, to be accurate, to be logical, and so on. In Winter and Spring Quarters, we'll move to challenges, and radical criticisms, of these familiar ideas. As to practice: The writing workload of the course is significant. Students will write at least one writing assignment each week, and we discuss these assignments in small writing workshops. This is not a course in remedial writing; rather it is a course for students who are particularly interested in writing or who want to become particularly proficient writers. Readings for the course are selected not thematically or chronologically, but to serve the focus on writing. </P>

<P>HUMA 13500. Introduction to the Humanities I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the Autumn Quarter, we read two of Plato's Dialogues, the Declaration of Independence, selections from History of the Peloponnesian War, and a Shakespeare play. Terms Offered: Autumn.

<P>HUMA 14000-14100-14200. Reading Cultures: Collection, Travel, Exchange I-II-III. </P>

<P>This sequence is devoted to the cultivation of the art of interpretation through the close reading of objects across a broad range of times and places, from the Homeric epic to contemporary film, folk tale to museum. In each case the goal is to work outward from the textual details—construing the term text generously so as to include any form of cultural production—and develop insight into the local emergence and global circulation of objects of interpretation. In the process the sequence explores questions about memory, home, and belonging; about the various historical forms of cultural production, from epic to folk tale, music, film, and novels; about the challenges of translation to responsible interpretation; about texts as formative sources of human community, inter-personal obligation, and transcendence; about hybridity and the legacy of colonialism; and, of course, about the role of humanistic inquiry in addressing all these questions. The year is divided into three conceptual themes that allow us to explore the above questions: collection, travel, and exchange. Readings in the past have included Homer, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;; &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;; Ovid, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;; Balzac, &quot;Père Goriot&quot;; Harriet Jacobs, &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;; Pu Songling, &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot;; Charlie Chaplin, &quot;Modern Times&quot;; Zora Neale Hurston, &quot;Of Mules and Men&quot;; T. S. Eliot, &quot;The Waste Land&quot;; museum visits; graphic novels; music, visual art, and cultural criticism. </P>

<P>HUMA 16000-16100-16200. Media Aesthetics: Image, Text, Sound I-II-III. </P>

<P>This sequence examines a question central to humanistic thought across cultures and historical periods: How do different kinds of media allow us to perceive and represent our world? We study how painting, photography, writing, film, song, and other media have allowed for new forms of knowledge, expression, and experience— but have also been seen as ethically dangerous or politically disruptive. The sequence traces philosophical and aesthetic debates about media from antiquity to the present in various cultural contexts; we examine discussions of image, text, and sound in Plato, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, W. E. B. Du Bois, Alfred Hitchcock, Toni Morrison, and recent critical theory. Throughout, we develop attention to the “aesthetics” of media by closely studying how specific aspects of complex works of art and literature lead audiences to think and feel in particular ways. </P>

<P>HUMA 16000. Media Aesthetics: Image, Text, Sound I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Autumn Quarter focuses on images, imitation, and seeing. Images may seem to simply reflect the real, but they just as often distort or distance viewers from it. We explore the strangeness of images through Diego Velasquez's Las Meninas, Plato's Republic, Hitchcock's Vertigo, and Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>HUMA 16100. Media Aesthetics: Image, Text, Sound II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Winter Quarter focuses on writing, reading, and signs. Language is an extraordinarily flexible medium for representing events and experiences-but it also raises distinctive challenges of interpretation, decoding, and translation. We examine some of these challenges through Plato's Phaedrus, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, and Alison Bechdel's Fun Home. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): HUMA 16000 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. </P>

<P>HUMA 16200. Media Aesthetics: Image, Text, Sound III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Spring Quarter focuses on sound, music, and listening. How do sounds or noises become meaningful? Why are music and voice so effective at expressing desire, suffering, or even overwhelming the intellect? We explore these and other questions through William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience, W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk, Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, contemporary albums, and sound art. Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): HUMA 16100 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence.

<P>HUMA 17000-17100-17200. Language and the Human I-II-III. </P>

<P>Language is at the center of what it means to be human and is instrumental in most humanistic pursuits. With it, we understand others, describe, plan, narrate, learn, persuade, argue, reason, and think. This course aims to provoke us to critically examine common assumptions that determine our understanding of language—and more specifically, the ways we, as speakers or writers, use it to communicate meaning. </P>

<P>HUMA 17000. Language and the Human I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Autumn Quarter of this sequence explores fundamental questions about the nature of language, concentrating on the conventional character of language as a system, and language in the individual. We discuss: the properties of human languages (spoken and signed) as systems of communication distinct from other forms (including animal and artificial systems), whether some languages are more primitive than others, how language is acquired, used, changes, and evolves, what it means to be bilingual. Typical texts used include Plato's Cratylus, parts of Finnegans Wake, Locke, Truffaut's L'enfant sauvage, Turing. Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>HUMA 17100. Language and the Human II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Winter Quarter is generally devoted to examining how language mediates between the individual and society, its origin, spread, evolution, and development, and its role in power, identity, culture, nationalism, thought, and persuasion, as well as its use in naming, politeness, irony, and metaphor. Further examined are the nature of translation, writing systems, language and artificial intelligence, invented languages, and to what extent language shapes or influences perception of the world and cognition. Readings typically from Whorf, Orwell, Grice, and others. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): HUMA 17000 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. </P>

<P>Humanities </P>

<P>HUMA 17200. Language and the Human III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The topics addressed in the Spring Quarter vary from year to year: We may look at language and poetry, the nature of metaphor, rhetorical force of language. These questions are examined through classic and contemporary primary and secondary literature, with readings which may be drawn from literary, linguistic, philological, and philosophical traditions (in varying years, from parts of the Bible, Beowulf, Chaucer, Descartes, and Rousseau to Borges, Chomsky, and others).

<P>HUMA 18000-18100-18200. Poetry and the Human I-II-III. </P>

<P>What is poetry and why do we do it? This three-quarter sequence examines the practice of poetry as a form of communication, linguistic innovation, and embodied presence. How is poetry as language and action different from other forms of activity? What is the role of poetry in society, in regard to memory, performance, storytelling, and history; ritual and creation; knowledge and formation of selfhood; institution and revolution? This sequence addresses these questions in the poetry of different eras and peoples, including works of Homer, Sappho, Catullus, poets from the T’ang period in China, Rumi, Ki no Tsurayuki, John Donne, Louis Zukofsky, Dahlia Ravikovitch, Anne Carson, N. Scott Momaday, Claudia Rankine, and others. It provides students with skills in the close reading of texts and performance and a grasp of the literary, philosophical, and theoretical questions that underpin the humanities. In the spring, students may take a third quarter of Humanities or shift into a related Arts general education course (CRWR 18200). </P>

<P>HUMA 18000. Poetry and the Human I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In Autumn (form/formation/transformation), we closely analyze poetry to understand its distinctive qualities, looking at questions of form and rhythm, translation and adaptation, and experimentation with genre. We also explore argumentation, criticism, and the role of poetry in mapping creation through practices of language, image, and sound. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence </P>

<P>HUMA 18100. Poetry and the Human II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In Winter (crisis/performance/politics), we turn to questions of social rupture, breakdown, and reformation as we consider the ways that poetry revolts, reflects, and rebuilds in political crises. We will also look at poetry in performance, and performance as poetry, to consider how poetry is practiced in non-textual media such as spoken word, film, and dance. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): HUMA 18000 Note(s): These courses must be taken in sequence </P>

<P>HUMA 18200. Poetry and the Human III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the Spring Humanities course (object/event/narrative), we consider the poem first as an object that expresses the processes of writing and the materiality of the body, then as a staged and sonic event, and finally as a way of shaping a life or of conceiving an afterlife. Note: CRWR 18200 may also be taken as the third quarter of Poetry &amp; the Human, and is counted towards the Art-Music-Drama core requirement.

<P>Writing Seminars </P>

<P>HUMA 19100. Humanities Writing Seminars. 000 Units. </P>

<P>These seminars introduce students to the analysis and practice of expert academic writing. Experts must meet many familiar standards for successful writing: clear style, logical organization, and persuasive argument. But because they work with specialized knowledge, experts also face particular writing difficulties: they must be clear about complexities and specific about abstractions; they must use uncomplicated organization for very complicated ideas; they must create straightforward logic for intricate arguments; they must be concise but not incomplete, direct but not simplistic; they must clarify the obscure but not repeat the obvious; and they must anticipate the demands of aggressively skeptical readers. The seminars do not repeat or extend the substantive discussion of the Humanities class; they use the discussions and assignments from those classes as a tool for the advanced study of writing. We study various methods not only for the construction of sophisticated and well-structured arguments but also for understanding the complications and limits of those arguments. These seminars also address issues of readership and communication within expert communities. As students present papers in the seminars, we can use the reactions of the audience to introduce the techniques experts can use to transform a text from one that serves the writer to one that serves the readers. Terms Offered: Autumn,Winter,Spring Note(s): These seminars are available only in combination with either a two- or a three-quarter general education sequence in the Humanities. </P>

<P>Collegiate Courses </P>

<P>The 20000-level Collegiate courses in Humanities seek to extend humanistic inquiry beyond the scope of the general education requirements. A few of them also serve as parts of special degree programs. All of these courses are open as electives to students from any Collegiate Division. </P>

<P>HUMA 25202. Media Ecology: Embodiment &amp; Software. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Media ecology examines how the structure and content of our media environments-online and offline, in words, images, sounds, and textures-affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; or alternatively, media ecology investigates the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter. At stake are issues about agency-human or material-and about determinism-how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface). In our actual and virtual environments, how do we understand performing our multiple human embodiments in relation to other bodies (organism or machine) in pursuit of social or political goals?

<P>HUMA 25206. Digital Culture: Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms, and the Web. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In contrast to print culture and electronic culture, yet embedded in them, contemporary digital culture engages us in human-computer systems empowered as media for mobile communication in the global network society. In our conjoined online and offline environments, we inhabit human-computer hybrids in which (for instance) we learn, imagine, communicate, pay attention, and experience affect. How can we understand and critique our theories, concepts, practices, and technologies of intelligence and information in relation to the capacities of these digital machines with which we co-evolve? For exploring this question, our case studies include comparing artificial and natural intelligences, as well as examining algorithms and their socio-political impacts, in current web functionalities such as search (Google) and social media (Facebook,Twitter).

<P id="LinkTarget_64314">General education courses in the Physical Sciences benefit from a rich tradition of scientific discovery at the University of Chicago. The late University of Chicago professor and Nobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who predicted the existence of black holes based on theoretical considerations, described well the importance of science in our lives when he said, &quot;Science is a perception of the world around us. Science is a place where what you find in nature pleases you." </P>

<P>Under the designation PHSC, the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division offers several sequences of courses from the Astronomy and Astrophysics, Chemistry, Geophysical Sciences, and Physics departments, tailored to provide an interesting and useful education for non-scientists in their goal of satisfying their general education requirement in the physical sciences. The goal of general education in the physical sciences is to engender in the student the ability to understand and assess our understanding of the physical world. One can argue that the fundamental tenet of liberal education at the University of Chicago is to cultivate an appreciation for critical inquiry and the basis for judgement. The physical sciences contribute to this mission in teaching the principles of experimentation, observation, and the principles of scientific inquiry. Chemistry and physics are advanced through laboratory experiments that study the structure of nature and build models which we extrapolate from those observations. Astronomy and geophysical sciences develop methods to make inferences about the world around us based on observations which cannot always be recreated in a laboratory. </P>

<P>While the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Departments do not offer PHSC courses, these subjects are strongly connected to the physical sciences. Mathematics is the language of science and the only known way to make quantitative assessments about the experiments. Statistics teaches us how to interpret experimental results and how to assess a level of confidence in the conclusions derived from them, while computer science enables us to analyze large and complex data and simulate physical processes whose properties cannot be determined mathematically. The techniques developed and applied to scientific inquiry provide valuable tools to the basis of inquiry in any field, and indeed in our lives in general. </P>

<P>Students are required to take at least two courses in the physical sciences to satisfy the general education requirement. This requirement may be met by taking an introductory sequence in Chemistry, Geosciences, or Physics, or by taking any acceptable pairing of Physical Sciences (PHSC) courses, which generally have a broader focus than the disciplinary sequences. It is strongly recommended that the general education sequence in the physical sciences be completed in the first two years. </P>

<P>General Education Sequences for Science Majors </P>

<P>The following introductory sequences may be used to satisfy the general education requirement in the physical sciences for all students, although these tend to be taken by sciences majors or by students who have a particular need for science (namely, premeds). The sequences are: </P>

<P>CHEM 10100-CHEM 10200 </P>

<P>CHEM 11100-CHEM 11200* </P>

<P>CHEM 12100-CHEM 12200 </P>

<P>GEOS 13100-GEOS 13200 </P>

<P>PHYS 12100-PHYS 12200*# </P>

<P>PHYS 13100-PHYS 13200 </P>

<P>PHYS 14100-PHYS 14200* </P>

<P>*For information, see the Placement Tests and Advanced Placement Credit sections elsewhere in this catalog. </P>

<P>#PHYS 12100 has the prerequisite of CHEM 11300 or CHEM 12300. </P>

<P>Physical Sciences Courses for Non-Science Majors </P>

<P>There are several sequences in the physical sciences, each of which introduces a different discipline and different aspects of scientific knowledge. Physical Sciences (PHSC) courses fall mainly into four general categories that we might conveniently label as &quot;Physics,&quot; &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics,&quot; &quot;Geosciences,&quot; and &quot;Chemistry.&quot; As a general rule, courses from two different categories may not be combined to satisfy the two-quarter general education requirement in the physical sciences. It is strongly recommended that the general education sequence in the physical sciences be completed in the first two years. Some PHSC courses restrict registration for students beyond the second year. </P>

<P>Students who seek to deviate from the combinations identified here must submit a petition to the master of the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division, Harper Memorial Library 235 (HM 235). </P>

<P>The PHSC courses in the Physics category are PHSC 11100-11200 Modern Physics I-II, PHSC 11300 Everyday Physics, and PHSC 11400-11500 Life in the Universe I-II; PHSC 11600 Physics for Future Presidents: </P>

<P>Fundamental Concepts and Applications, and PHSC 11700 Physics for Furture Presidents: Energy and Sustainability. The approved sequences among these courses are listed below. Other sequences are not permitted. </P>

<P>PHSC 11400 </P>

<P>PHSC 11600-11700 Physics for Future Presidents: Energy and Sustainability; Physics for Future Presidents: Fundamental Concepts and Applications </P>

<P>Students wishing to take a three-quarter Physical Sciences sequence may take PHSC 11100-11200-11300, although at present only one of PHSC 11200 and PHSC 11300 is offered in any given year. Students wishing to take a three quarter Physical Sciences sequence may also combine PHSC 11600-11700 with any other Physical Sciences core courses except PHSC 11100. </P>

<P>The PHSC courses in the Geosciences category are PHSC 10100 Origin and Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth, PHSC 10800 Earth as a Planet: Exploring Our Place in the Universe, PHSC 11000 Environmental History of the Earth, PHSC 13400 Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast, and PHSC 13600 Natural Hazards. The only approved sequences among these courses are listed below. The courses in these sequences can be taken in any order. Under no circumstances may a student get credit for both PHSC 10100 and PHSC 10800. Below is a summary of approved courses: </P>

<P>PHSC 12300-PHSC 13400 </P>

<P>PHSC 13400-PHSC 13600 </P>

<P>There is one sequence of PHSC courses with a focus on Chemistry, PHSC 12300 Chemistry for an Alternative Energy Economy, PHSC 12400 The Chemistry of Big Problems, and PHSC 12500 Molecular Mechanisms of Human Disease. PHSC 12300 may also be paired with PHSC 13400 Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast. </P>

<P>PHSC 12300-PHSC 13400 </P>

<P>Beginning in the 2017–18 academic year, a 5 on the AP Chemistry exam conferred credit for CHEM 11100. Students who have credit for CHEM 11100 by either taking the course or by AP credit and do not wish to take CHEM 11200 or 12200 may complete the general education requirement with either of the following three courses offered by the Department of Chemistry: </P>

<P>PHSC 12300 </P>

<P>PHSC 12400 </P>

<P>PHSC 12500 </P>

<P>Two sequences are available that pair Geosciences and Astronomy and Astrophysics courses. The approved </P>

<P>sequences are PHSC 10800 Earth as a Planet: Exploring Our Place in the Universe + PHSC 12720 Exoplanets, and PHSC 10100 The Origin and Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth + PHSC 12720 Exoplanets. </P>

<P>PHSC 10100-PHSC 12720 </P>

<P>PHSC 10800-PHSC 12720 </P>

<P>Students who wish to take a three-quarter sequence may enroll accordingly: PHSC 12700 Stars (Autumn Quarter) + PHSC 10100 The Origin and Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth (Winter Quarter) + PHSC 12720 Exoplanets (Spring Quarter). </P>

<P>PHSC 12700-PHSC 10100-PHSC 12720 </P>

<P>Physical Sciences </P>

<P>The on-campus PHSC courses in the Astronomy and Astrophysics category are PHSC 12600 Matter, Energy, Space, and Time, PHSC 12610 Black Holes, PHSC 12620 The Big Bang, PHSC 12700 Stars, PHSC 12710 Galaxies, and PHSC 12720 Exoplanets. PHSC 12600-12610-12620 is a logical progression that applies physical principles based on terrestrial experiments to the cosmos at large. Similarly, PHSC 12700-12710-12720 is a logical progression that concerns observed properties of important classes of astronomical objects. Thus, a two-quarter sequence can be built most naturally from 12600 + 12610 or 12600 + 12620, and similarly from 12700 + 12710, 12700 + 12720 or 12710 + 12720. It is also possible to make two-quarter sequences from 12600 + 12710 (galaxies are an example of structure that evolved from early conditions), from 12700 + 12610 (black holes are an end state of stellar evolution), and from PHSC 12600 + 12700. </P>

<P>PHSC 12600 must be taken as the prerequisite before PHSC 12610 or PHSC 12620. Either PHSC 12700 or PHSC 12710 can be taken as the prerequisite before PHSC 12720. Three-quarter sequences may be created by adding any third of the six courses, subject to prerequisite restrictions. The approved sequences among these courses are: </P>

<P>PHSC 12600-PHSC 12610 </P>

<P>PHSC 12600-PHSC 12620 </P>

<P>PHSC 12710-PHSC 12720 </P>

<P>Every Spring Quarter a three-course Astronomy program (http://study-abroad.uchicago.edu/programs/ paris-astronomy) is offered in Paris, composed from the PHSC courses numbered in the 12600s and 12700s that are offered on campus. The Astronomy program in Paris satisfies the general education requirement in the physical sciences. </P>

<P>PHSC 11900 and PHSC 12000 were offered for the last time in academic year 2014–15. PHSC 11902 was offered for the last time in summer 2015. Students who have taken PHSC 11900 or PHSC 11902 may complete their general education requirement by taking PHSC 12600, PHSC 12620*, PHSC 12710, or PHSC 12720. Students who have taken PHSC 12000 may complete their general education requirement by taking PHSC 12600, PHSC 12610, PHSC 12700, or PHSC 12720**. For students who do not have a preference for a particular course, suggested pairings are PHSC 11900 with PHSC 12600 and PHSC 12000 with PHSC 12600 or 12700. Please note: PHSC 11900 may not be combined with PHSC 12610 or PHSC 12700, and PHSC 12000 may not be combined with PHSC 12620 or PHSC 12710. </P>

<P>* Discouraged because PHSC 11900 may not provide adequate preparation for PHSC 12620. ** Discouraged because PHSC 12000 may not provide adequate preparation for PHSC 12720. </P>

<P>PHSC course electives that fit into the Astronomy and Astrophysics category are numbered in the 18000s. These courses may only be used as a third physical sciences general education course and may be combined with any acceptable two-quarter sequence, including those outside of the Astronomy and Astrophysics category. </P>

<P>Note on General Education in the Sciences: </P>

<P>Along with one of these two-quarter sequences, students must register for at least two quarters of an approved biological sciences sequence and at least one quarter of an approved mathematical science. A sixth quarter must be taken in any one of the three areas: physical sciences, biological sciences, or mathematical sciences. (If the mathematical sciences requirement is met by taking calculus, two quarters must be taken.) </P>

<P>General Education Courses </P>

<P>PHSC 10100. Origin and Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the physical and chemical origins of planetary systems, the role of meteorite studies in this context, and a comparison of the Earth with neighboring planets. It then turns to chemical and physical processes that lead to internal differentiation of the Earth. Further topics include the thermal balance at the Earth's surface (glaciation and the greenhouse effect), and the role of liquid water in controlling crustal geology and evolution. </P>

<P>(L) Instructor(s): A. Davis Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>PHSC 10800. Earth as a Planet: Exploring Our Place in the Universe. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the diversity of bodies in our Solar System, and the physical and chemical processes that have shaped them over their histories. We will also discuss how these studies have carried us away from an Earth-centered view of the universe to one where Earth is just one of billions of planets that exist in our galaxy. Topics to be covered include: early observations of the Solar System and the laws of planetary motion, the formation and evolution of the Moon, the structure and geophysical evolution of the planets, and the search for habitable environments outside of Earth. (L) Instructor(s): F. Ciesla Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>PHSC 11000. Environmental History of the Earth. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course considers how physical and biological processes determine environmental conditions at the surface of the Earth, and how environments have changed over the 4.5 billion-year history of Earth. Topics include the methods of historical inference in geology; major transitions in the history of life, including the origin of life, the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthesis, the origin of animals, and the series of massive extinctions that have repeatedly re-set ecosystems both on land and in the sea; and ecosystem evolution, including the environmental effects of human evolution. Labs involve hands-on study of rock and fossil specimens, and analysis and interpretation of datasets drawn from the scientific literature and/or faculty research programs. Instructor(s): M.

<P>PHSC 11200. Modern Physics II: Paradoxes in Modern Physics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Physics advancements are often the result of conflict between, on the one hand, existing ideas and speculations, and on the other, observations and measurements. In this course, we explore historical and modern paradoxes in physics including quantum phenomena, elementary particle physics, and others. We match common sense and sensibility with scientific abstraction to broaden our understanding of the physical world. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): PHSC 11100 Note(s): Must be taken with PHSC 11100 </P>

<P>PHSC 11300. Everyday Physics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will be a walking tour through various topics in physics. It is not organized in the traditional way (mechanics, heat, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity) but rather will look at real-world phenomena and try to figure out what is going on. Relying somewhat on knowledge gained in PHSC 11100, we will ask questions about the world around us. No formulas will be used. Questions might include, &quot;Which draws more water from Lake Michigan, evaporation or the city of Chicago?&quot; and &quot;How does my cellphone work and what can I do to improve its reception?&quot; The course will also address more substantial topics such as measuring the density of air, figuring out whether airplanes should be able to fly, estimating the density of the Sun, and determining the size of molecules.

<P>PHSC 12300. Chemistry for an Alternative Energy Economy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will cover the chemistry of alternative energy technologies and the potential for science to provide climate change solutions. Topics will include both non-renewable energy sources (fossil fuels and nuclear) and renewable energy sources, including electricity production (photovoltaics, solar thermal, wind, hydro and geothermal, fuel production (solar and biofuels), and energy storage (batteries and fuel cells). We will also touch on climate change mitigation approaches (carbon capture and geoengineering). Discussion of these topics will be enriched by an understanding of the basic chemical principles behind energy production and conversion. Students will gain an appreciation of the pivotal role chemistry can play in an alternative energy economy and a foundation to better understand energy issues. The lab component will provide experiential support of the lecture material through hands on experiments and exploratory projects. (L) Instructor(s): Jessica Swanson Terms Offered: Autumn.

<P>PHSC 12600. Matter, Energy, Space, and Time. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A comprehensive survey of how the physical world works, and how matter, energy, space, and time evolved from the beginning to the present. A brief survey of the historical development of mathematics, physics, and astronomy leads to a conceptual survey of the modern theory of the physical universe: space and time in relativity; the quantum theory of matter and energy; and the evolution of cosmic structure and composition. The major theme of this course is the understanding of all nature, from the prosaic to the exotic, using powerful quantitative theory grounded in precise experiments. Although quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, students will not be expected to employ mathematics beyond algebra. (L) Instructor(s): Stephan Meyer Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): ASTR 12600 </P>

<P>PHSC 12610. Black Holes. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Black Holes are the most exotic, extreme and paradoxical systems in the universe. They are the densest concentrations of energy, yet they convert all matter that falls in to pure space-time curvature; they radiate more power than anything else, even though most of their radiation is not even made of light; they are mathematically the most perfectly understood of any physical structure, but their enigmatic behavior is still the subject of a violent disagreement among experts that highlights our ignorance of how quantum physics relates to gravity. This course will survey the physics of space and time, the nature of black holes, their effects on surrounding matter and light, the astrophysical contexts in which they are observed, frontier areas of research as quantum gravity and gravitational waves, and the importance of space-time physics to everyday needs such as navigation and energy. The modern theory of space and time, as well as black holes, will be placed in historical context, with special attention to the work of Albert Einstein. Experimental exercises will include direct measurement of the speed of light and gravitational mass, and experience with interferometry. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, but mathematics beyond algebra will not be required.

<P>PHSC 12620. The Big Bang. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Big Bang model describes the Universe on the largest scales and its evolution from the earliest observationally accessible times through the formation of the complex world we live in today. This powerful framework allows us to interpret a wide range of observations and to make detailed and precise predictions for new experiments. The key motivating observations include the expansion of the Universe and how it has changed with time; the existence of radiation indicating a hot and dense early phase; the abundance of the light elements; and how matter is organized over a wide range of physical scales. The model naturally incorporates dark matter and dark energy, two surprising and poorly understood components that govern the growth of structure over time. The course will explore the history of scientific cosmology and the evidence for the Big Bang model, its consequences for the earliest moments after the Big Bang, and its predictions for the eventual fate of the Universe. Labs will include a hands-on measurement of the relic cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe and the use of astronomical data to verify key discoveries in the history of Big Bang cosmology. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, but prior experience with mathematics beyond algebra will not be required.

<P>PHSC 12700. Stars. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Elements such as carbon and oxygen are created in fusion reactions at high temperatures and pressures in the deep interiors of stars, conditions that naturally arise in stars like the Sun. This course will outline the physical principles at work and the history of the development of the key ideas: how nuclear physics and the theory of stellar interiors account for how stars shine, why they live for such long times, and how the heavy elements in their cores are dispersed to form a new generation of stars. Gravity assembles stars out of more diffuse material, a process that includes the formation of planetary systems. The course shows how, taken together, these physical processes naturally lead to the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life, namely elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and planets in stable orbits around long-lived stars. The course features quantitative analysis of data; any tools needed beyond pre-calculus algebra will be taught as part of the course.

<P>PHSC 12710. Galaxies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Galaxies have been called &quot;island universes,&quot; places where stars are concentrated, where they are born, and where they die. The study of galaxies reaches back to the Renaissance; Galileo Galilei first pointed a telescope skyward in 1610 and confirmed a then 2000 year-old Greek conjecture about the nature of our own galaxy-the Milky Way. This course will use extensive modern observational data from a wide range of telescopes to trace the modern picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the stars in them. Galaxies will then be used as markers of yet larger scale structures, in order to explore the influence of gravity over cosmic time. The object of study in this course is galaxies, and the narrative arc traced through that extensive data and understanding will highlight our profound discovery that most of the mass in galaxies (and the Universe as a whole) is in fact an exotic form of matter-dark matter-that we cannot directly see. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course in both laboratory work and lectures, but mathematics beyond algebra and some geometric understanding will not be required. This course will feature several observationally-oriented labs that will allow students to directly experience how some of the modern understanding of galaxies has arisen.

<P>PHSC 12720. Exoplanets. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The past two decades have witnessed the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars and the characterization of extra-Solar (exo-) planetary systems. We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere. Although quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, students will not be expected to employ mathematics beyond algebra.

The epistemological foundations of the scientific method, in particular as applied to cosmology (from Galileo to the modern context) will be examined, as will positivist vs. realistic outlooks on cosmology. (For example, what does science say-or not say-about the inside of a black hole, or the space beyond the Hubble horizon?) We will ponder questions such as: Do the epistemological foundations of science require us to be able to repeat relevant experiments? If so, does this disqualify cosmology as a science? If not, why? Might our universe be part of a computer simulation? What information could possibly convince us that this is true or false?

<P id="LinkTarget_64315">The distinguished American sociologist, David Riesman, who played a major role in the creation of the general education program in the social sciences at Chicago, once observed that it was only with a &quot;marvelous hubris&quot; that students were encouraged to range over such &quot;large territory&quot; in the social sciences. Indeed, since the 1940s, yearlong sequences designed to introduce students to different types of social scientific data and different forms of social sciences inquiry have become a permanent feature of the Chicago curriculum. Although considerable variety manifests itself in the way the social sciences courses in general education are organized, most of the sequences are informed, as Robert Redfield once suggested, by an attempt &quot;to communicate the historical development of contemporary society&quot; and by an effort &quot;to convey some understanding of the scientific spirit as applied to social problems and the capacity to address oneself in that spirit to such a problem.&quot; By training students in the analysis of social phenomena through the development and use of interdisciplinary and comparative concepts, the courses also try to determine the characteristics common among many societies, thus enabling the individual to use both reason and special knowledge to confront rapid social change in the global world of the late twentieth century. </P>

<P>SOSC 11400. Power, Identity, Resistance I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The first quarter of this sequence focuses on key texts for liberal political and state conceptions. We explore the distinctly modern liberal claim that society or groups of associated individuals make states for their own protection and the governance of their affairs. We interrogate authors on questions concerning individuality, liberty, equality, the limitation of state power, the importance of political stability, the value of democratic participation in governance, the role that organized society plays in political life, and the degree to which social and political relations vary historically-- among other issues. We address both defenders and critics of the liberal conception of liberty and the state. Texts vary by year. Typical authors assigned include some combination of Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Burke, Constant, Smith, Wollstonecraft, Paine, Hegel, Tocqueville, Mill, Marx, Du Bois, Durkheim, Weber, Dewey, Schmitt, Arendt, Polanyi, Hayek, Foucault.

<P>SOSC 12600. Self, Culture, and Society III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In Spring Quarter, students consider contemporary issues and social science approaches to them. Beginning with post-modern, post-colonial, and other critiques of sciences of self, culture, and society (as articulated by Kuhn, Foucault, and Said), the course investigates how new theories arise and new problems are addressed, how new perspectives (more global, more inclusive) test and challenge, and how social scientists change, renew, and improve their insights. The quarter focuses on topics of contemporary concern, including the human impact on the environment, feminism outside the West, and the rise of global cities.

<P>SOSC 13100-13200-13300. Social Science Inquiry I-II-III. </P>

<P>&quot;Social Science Inquiry&quot; explores classic and contemporary points of view about ways of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information about public policy issues. The course aims to provide the student with an introduction to the philosophy of social science inquiry, a sense of how that inquiry is conducted, and an understanding of how policy implications can be drawn responsibly from evidence provided by empirical social science. The sequence's objective is to convey both the promise and the pitfalls of social science and a sense of its uses and abuses. During the 2018–19 academic year, two sections within the &quot;Social Science Inquiry" sequence will each offer a different topical focus: one section on formal theory (&quot;Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory&quot; SOSC 13110-13210-13310) and one section on spatial analysis (&quot;Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis" 13120-13220-13320). </P>

<P>SOSC 13100. Social Science Inquiry I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Autumn Quarter starts by introducing students to the various ways that social scientists think about the world. Examples include theoretical models from Milton Friedman, Thomas Schelling, and John Nash; path-breaking experiments from Stanley Milgram and Daniel Kahneman; and quantitative research on topics ranging from voting to gun violence to baby names. Through these works, students will learn how researchers theorize about social phenomena. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence.

<P>SOSC 13110-13210-13310. Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory. </P>

<P>Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory builds on the rich traditions of rational choice scholarship set in place by James Coleman and Gary Becker. Mastering game theoretic and public choice models is an invaluable tool for understanding how interest groups influence politics, how voting takes place in Congress, how matches are made in the dating world, or how neighborhood arrangements are coordinated. More broadly, applications of formal theory to social science include explaining how peace negotiations occur between governments and rebels in the aftermath of civil war, how trade unionists bargain over wages with employers, and even the decisions of autocrats to step down from power and allow for free elections. SSI-Formal Theory will introduce students to the systematic study of social, political, and economic interactions, where the optimal course of one person's action depends on the options and preferences of other people involved in the interaction. Students will learn how to model strategic situations in the language of mathematics and how to make equilibrium predictions. </P>

<P>SOSC 13110. Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>SOSC 13120-13220-13320. Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis. </P>

<P>Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis deals with the fundamental role of space, place, location, distance, and interaction—crucial to tackling many research questions in the social sciences. This sequence of three courses explores the fundamentals of spatial analysis, a collection of quantitative methods in which space is explicitly accounted for. The three courses explore different concepts of space; how it is measured, represented, and accounted for in social science methodology; and how spatial problems are solved (spatial reasoning). </P>

<P>SOSC 13120. Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the concept of spatial thinking and how it has been incorporated in research in the social sciences. Fundamental notions related to space, such as location, distance, spatial interaction, among others are explored in classic readings in quantitative geography, as well as in several recent examples of research papers in urban studies, sociology, political science, criminology, public health, and economics.

<P>SOSC 14100-14200-14300. Mind I-II-III. </P>

<P>&quot;Mind&quot; explores subjective experience and behavior through the lens of underlying mental processes, biological mechanisms, and social context. Drawing from research in the social sciences and beyond, the course broadly considers how empirical approaches can shape our understanding of long-standing questions about human experience. Each quarter of Mind is taught by a different group of faculty, and the material in each quarter is arranged into a broad theme that makes connections across quarters. These themes vary from year to year. </P>

<P>SOSC 14100. Mind I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The first quarter of Mind builds an intellectual framework for understanding the mental and behavioral phenomena of animals, connecting philosophical and historical foundations to the modern scientific literature. What is the difference between the subjective and the objective? How do the mind and body relate to each other? How do nature and nurture impact behavior? These are some of the broad questions that are addressed. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>SOSC 14200. Mind II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The second quarter of Mind explores the concept of &quot;mechanism,&quot; or different kinds of causal models and theories that are used to explain mental phenomena from different levels of scientific analysis (e.g., biological, cognitive). Focusing on empirical literature, this quarter's emphasis on mechanism builds upon the intellectual foundations established in Autumn Quarter.

<P>SOSC 16100-16200-16300. Global Society I-II-III. </P>

<P>Global Society is organized around three essential areas for making sense of a globalized world: social thought, population, and social change. The sequence is designed to cultivate an understanding of social science research that extends beyond experiences and processes that are particular to Western civilizations. The curriculum will expose students to a long-standing, globally expansive canon within the social sciences and teach students to distinguish cultural particulars from universal concerns. </P>

<P>SOSC 16100. Global Society I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The first quarter of Global Society addresses social thought from a global perspective by first considering some classic works from the Western tradition and then reading major statements about society from the classical traditions of others cultures including: Latin America, Islam, East Asia, and Africa. In Global Society, students read these statements simultaneously as theoretical treatises, as empirical approaches, and as normative prescriptions for the social world. This three-pronged approach enables us to disentangle differences in empirical perception from differences in values and to assess how, in combination, these color our own inevitably particular judgments of world events. The course opens a set of themes that will run through the entire sequence: individual-and-society, tradition-and-change, sources of social values, difference and particularity. The pedagogical emphasis is on close reading, discussion, and analytic writing. Possible readings include: Thomas More, J. J. Rousseau, D. F. Sarmiento, Ali Shariati, Raden Ayu Kartini, and Léopold Sédar Senghor Instructor(s): A. Abbott Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped. </P>

<P>SOSC 16200. Global Society II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The second quarter of Global Society is built around the theme of population and is designed as a hybrid course that brings together a) an intellectual history of population thought and census-taking and b) a practical introduction to basic demographic tools and contemporary debates about population. Students will engage Malthus, his detractors, and new incarnations of Malthusian thought in detail. Questions considered will include: What is a population? What is at stake when we count? How many people can this earth support? What are the implications of population shifts for individual life chances? For social values and patterns of difference? Students will learn how to construct basic period lifetables, how to compare populations and sub-populations using basic standardization techniques, and how to analyze generations and cohorts in context. At the same time, since population issues like reproduction, migration, and mortality are simultaneously philosophical, political, and empirical matters, students will connect these practical and empirical analyses to political and value debates about the causes and consequences of population change. Possible texts include: Graunt, Petty, Malthus, Nehru, Wu Ta-k'un, and contemporary instantiations. Instructor(s): J. Trinitapoli Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): SOSC 16100.

<P>SOSC 16300. Global Society III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This third part of the sequence marries themes that emerge from Global Social Thought and Population, with an emphasis on social change and development during twentieth and twenty-first centuries. From the perspective of Global Society, &quot;change&quot; and &quot;development&quot; encompass everything from micro-level changes in gender relations to macro-level shifts in the global economy. With new theoretical and empirical tools from parts 1 &amp; 2 of the sequence, students will engage the empirical, the theoretical, and the normative aspects of defining and evaluating long-run and short-run social change. Using global and comparative lenses, we examine forms of state repression, civil resistance, religious transformations, technological and economic changes, and the effects of these large social patterns on individual persons. Students will write about the relationship of individuals to broad forces of social change, connecting themes from the first and second quarters. The sequence concludes with a set of writing workshops designed to guide students through the steps of producing a capstone sequence paper. Using the skills and tools they've acquired throughout the sequence, students will analyze the relationship of a particular cohort (anchored in a time, place) to social change, with a focus on the empirical, normative, and theoretical stakes, their causes and consequences.

<P>This lecture-based course provides a broad survey of the history of city planning. It focuses on the normative: the endeavor to control and design the physical fabric of cities. What are the different ways cities have been envisioned and planned and to what effect? What are the competing theories of good city design that underlie city plans, and how do these plans interrelate to the social, political, cultural, and economic forces shaping cities? The course explores city planning's successes and failures, its tangible effect on urban pattern and form, and the extent to which city planning ideals have changed over time. Though the emphasis is on city planning's history, current debates about city planning within the context of the history of the profession will also be engaged. Emphasis will be on U.S. and European city planning experience, although global practices will also be surveyed. Instructor(s): E.

<H2>Programs of Study </H2>

<P id="LinkTarget_64316">The programs of study, known as majors, include a narrative description and a summary of course requirements. Students should read the complete narrative descriptions because the summary eliminates essential information. An explanation of the components of each course entry follows. </P>

<P>Course Numbering </P>

<P>Unless an exception is noted, course numbering typically follows standard guidelines. Courses numbered 10000 are general education and introductory courses. Courses numbered 20000 are intermediate, advanced, or upper-level courses that are open only to undergraduates. Courses numbered 30000 and above are graduate courses that are available only to undergraduate students who obtain the consent of the instructor. Undergraduates registered for 30000-level courses will be held to graduate-level requirements. When a course is cross listed between the College (10000- to 20000-level courses) and graduate divisions or professional schools (courses numbered 30000 and above), College students may only register for the undergraduate number. Higher-numbered courses within each of these categories do not indicate increasing levels of difficulty. </P>

<P>In some departments, students with advanced standing and consent of instructor may register for higher-level courses. Except for language instruction courses, these courses are not listed in this catalog; students should contact individual departments for further information. </P>

<P>A number shown, for example, as 211xx, indicates that it is a course within the series 21100 through 21199; any information that describes 211xx applies to the entire range of courses available within the series. </P>

<P>Course Description </P>

<P>A narrative description follows the course number and title. Unless otherwise designated, courses are taught on campus. </P>

<P>&quot;L&quot; at the end of the course description indicates that the course has a laboratory requirement. Courses with laboratories do not yield extra credit. </P>

<P>Units </P>

<P>A student receives 100 units of course credit for most undergraduate courses. The appropriate unit value is listed next to the course title in the catalog and in the course details at Class Search (http://registrar.uchicago.edu/ classes). </P>

<P>Term Offered </P>

<P>Courses may be offered in Summer, Autumn, Winter, or Spring Quarter, or in multiple quarters. If a course is not offered in the current academic year but will be offered at a future time, that information appears in this field. </P>

<P>For faculty contact information, visit the University of Chicago online directory at directory.uchicago.edu. Many departmental websites include additional information about the research and scholarly interests of faculty members. </P>

<P>Equivalent Courses </P>

<P>Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the College, many courses are cross listed in multiple programs of study. For example, CMST 10100 Introduction to Film Analysis is cross listed among Art History, Cinema and Media Studies, English Language and Literature, and Visual Arts. </P>

<P>Prerequisites </P>

<P>A course may have one or more prerequisites for registration. Before registering for MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis, for example, a student must first have completed MATH 20000 Mathematical Methods for Physical Sciences I or MATH 20400 Analysis in Rn II. Another example: Some courses require students to be in their third or fourth year in the College. </P>

<P>Notes </P>

<P>The Notes field contains additional information that may be of use to students, for instance, that the course meets a general education requirement or that the course is required for students in a certain major. Certain courses, especially those that meet general education requirements, have mandatory attendance for the first class meeting; otherwise the student's registration will be dropped. Students are advised to pay close attention to these notes. </P>

<Sect>
<H3>Anthropology </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64317">Department Website: http://anthropology.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Anthropology encompasses a variety of historical and comparative approaches to human cultural and biological diversity, ranging from the study of human evolution to the study of cultures as systems of meaningful symbols. Faculty in the Department of Anthropology specialize in sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological anthropological approaches. They take up questions of anatomy, ecology, and genomics, as well as psychological, economic, philosophical, and historical issues, often in comparative perspective. Anthropology can lead (through graduate study) to careers in research and teaching in university and museum settings. More often it provides a background for further work in other disciplines of the social sciences, humanities, and biological sciences, as well as for professional careers in government, non-governmental work, business, law, medicine, social services, and other fields. </P>

<P>For more information, see the Department of Anthropology website (http://anthropology.uchicago.edu). </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The BA program in anthropology consists of twelve courses, of which at least ten are typically chosen from those listed or cross-listed as Department of Anthropology courses. The requirements for the major are: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>ANTH 21107 Anthropological Theory </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>One Methods course (ANTH 21420 Ethnographic Methods, ANTH 28400 Bioarchaeology and the Human Skeleton, ANTH 29500 Archaeology Laboratory Practicum, or an approved alternative in archaeological, linguistic, or biological anthropology) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>One Discovering Anthropology course. Designated courses will be added to a list each term. Descriptions will be available on the Department of Anthropology (http://anthropology.uchicago.edu) website. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Seven electives in Anthropology </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Two electives from Anthropology or from a related discipline, with approval from the director of undergraduate studies. To seek approval of non-departmental courses, submit a completed Course Petition Form (available in Haskell 119) and syllabus for the course(s) to the director of undergraduate studies. Ideally this petition should be submitted before the end of the second week of the quarter in which the student is enrolled in the course, but petitions may also be submitted for courses that have already been completed. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students are encouraged to construct individual programs; and, in so doing, they should consult periodically with the preceptor and the director of undergraduate studies. We strongly urge students who are majoring in anthropology to complete several introductory courses before enrolling in upper-level courses. Anthropology provides a broad view of the human career and condition. Students may select courses widely across all four subfields (sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological anthropology) within the major, or may focus their work within or across any of the subfields. </P>

<P>Students should confer with the director of undergraduate studies before declaring a major in anthropology and must obtain the endorsement of the director of undergraduate studies on the Student Program Form before graduating with a major in anthropology. Students should submit a copy of the approved form to their College adviser. </P>

<P>Students interested in the Anthropology major should endeavor to complete the three required courses (Theory, Methods, and Discovering Anthropology) by the end of their third year. When possible, completion of those courses by the end of second year is recommended as they provide foundational concepts that facilitate understanding of higher level course work. </P>

<P>Note: These requirements are in effect starting with the graduating Class of 2018. Students who matriculated prior to Autumn 2014 may adopt the modified requirements if appropriate and should consult with the department to design their program of study. </P>

<P>Introductory Courses and General Education </P>

<P>Courses designated as Discovering Anthropology provide introductions to some of the substantive, methodological, and theoretical issues of sociocultural, archaeological, linguistic, and biological anthropology. These courses do not presume any previous study of anthropology and may be taken in any order. However, students are urged to complete the general education requirement in the social sciences before taking more advanced courses in sociocultural anthropology. SOSC 11400-11500-11600 Power, Identity, Resistance I-II-III or SOSC 12100-12200-12300 Self, Culture, and Society I-II-III are particularly recommended. </P>

<P>Several sequences that satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies typically feature anthropological approaches and content. These courses are cross-listed with Anthropology and may be used toward the major if they are not used toward the general education requirement: ANTH 20701-20702-20703 Introduction to African Civilization I-II-III , ANTH 23101-23102-23103 Introduction to Latin American </P>

<P>Civilization I-II-III, ANTH 24001-24002-24003 Colonizations I-II-III, and ANTH 24101-24102 Introduction to the Civilizations of South Asia I-II. With prior approval, other civilization courses (if taken in addition to the courses used toward the general education requirement) can be used toward the Anthropology major, in accordance with the individual student’s needs or interests and up to the two-course limit for non-departmental courses. </P>

<P>The director of undergraduate studies may refer students who wish to emphasize archaeological, biological, linguistic, or sociocultural anthropology to faculty in these fields for assistance in the development of their individual programs. </P>

<P>Readings and Research Courses </P>

<P>When desirable for a student's individual anthropology program and with the approval of the director of undergraduate studies, preferably in advance, a student may also obtain course credit for supervised individual reading or research (ANTH 29700 Readings in Anthropology). </P>

<P>Students electing to write a bachelor’s essay for honors are urged to enroll in ANTH 29910 Bachelor's Essay Seminar in Winter Quarter of fourth year. They also have the option of taking ANTH 29900 Preparation of Bachelor's Essay, in which the student does supervised reading or research in preparation for the BA essay, in Autumn Quarter of fourth year. However, students can only use a total of two independent readings or research courses toward the major, chosen from among ANTH 29700, ANTH 29900, ANTH 29910, and BA essay seminars in other departments when required for a joint second major. Additional readings and research courses would count as general elective credits. </P>

<P>Field Courses </P>

<P>Students attending field schools or taking courses offered by other universities can solicit approval to obtain course credit (up to the two-course limit for nondepartmental courses) when appropriate for their individual program of study. Credit from other institutions would first need to be approved by the College (https:// college.uchicago.edu/advising/transfer-credit) and then by the director of undergraduate studies, if intended to count toward the major. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements </P>

<P>Note: These requirements are in effect starting with the graduating Class of 2018. Students who matriculated prior to Autumn 2014 may adopt the modified requirements if appropriate and should consult with the department to design their program of study. </P>

<P>± A maximum of two reading and research courses (chosen from ANTH 29700 Readings in Anthropology, ANTH 29900 Preparation of Bachelor's Essay, ANTH 29910 Bachelor's Essay Seminar, and BA courses from other departments) can be used toward the Anthropology major. </P>

<P>Grades </P>

<P>Courses counted toward the major must be taken for quality grades (no P/F grading). </P>

<P>Honors BA Process </P>

<P>Students who wish to be considered for honors must apply to the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year. Eligible candidates must have a GPA of 3.6 or higher in courses in the major and typically a GPA of 3.25 overall. To receive honors, students must develop an extended piece of research via a bachelor's essay under the approved supervision of a faculty member. BA projects involving alternative media (like film, photography, photo-essay, or art installation) might be acceptable if accompanied by a written text. </P>

<P>To execute a successful BA essay, students should begin considering their research question early on. Students should begin looking for a faculty supervisor in their third year and aim to have a topic identified by the beginning of the fourth year so that they have sufficient time to complete the necessary research and to write the paper. Students writing BA honors papers are strongly urged to enroll in ANTH 29910 Bachelor's Essay </P>

<P>Anthropology </P>

<P>Seminar in Winter Quarter of their fourth year. If possible, students should also consider starting their research under the independent supervision of their faculty supervisor in Autumn Quarter by registering for ANTH 29900 Preparation of Bachelor's Essay. Students who take these courses, ANTH 29700 Readings in Anthropology, and/or BA seminars for a second major may only use a maximum of two these courses toward the Anthropology major. </P>

<P>For award of honors, the BA essay must receive a grade of A or A- from the faculty supervisor and from the second reader. Students being recommended for honors must submit two copies of the completed paper to the program administrator no later than fifth week of the quarter of graduation. The faculty supervisor must be chosen from the Anthropology faculty. Affiliated faculty may serve with approval of the director of undergraduate study. The second reader may be any credentialed scholar/scientist approved by the director of undergraduate study. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met. Approval from both program chairs is required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>ANTH 19601. Populism and Its Discontents. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Populism and its Discontents is a reading-based undergraduate discussion seminar. Populism is currently the word on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in current public debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time as the dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, but are not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Does populism look different in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the Global South force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants? Students will be asked to complete assignments drawing on the assigned readings and audiovisual materials and on contemporary media sources. Instructor(s): William Mazzarella Terms Offered: Spring.

<P>ANTH 20003. Discovering Anthropology: Reading Race. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Before and since Anthropology became a discrete scientific field of study, questions about the biological reality, potential utility and misuse of the concept of race in Homo sapiens have been debated. We will read and discuss a sample of writings by 18th, 19th, and 20th century and contemporary authors who attempted to define human races and those who have promoted or debunked the utility of the concept of race with special attention to it role in retarding social progress, and the extermination and exploitation of some populations and individuals.

<P>ANTH 20009. Embodiment: Governance, Resistance, Ethics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What does a study of the body teach us about governance and the experience of being governed? This course approaches bodies from three angles. First, bodies are targets of governance. They are objects to be reformed, regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and &quot;cared&quot; for. Next, as bodies get targeted for reform, they are also converted into potent sites of resistance and critique. Certain bodies in certain places elicit discomfort, unsettling common ideals of private and public, of developed and backward, of religious and secular, and, with them, dominant understandings of modern citizenship. Finally, bodies in their sensory and affective capacities are also mobilized as resources for crafting belonging beyond the assigned terms of law or the state. Drawing from ethnographic texts and with special emphasis on Latin America, this course introduces students to the anthropology of embodiment as well as related themes of bio-politics, gender, intimacy, political subjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, race, and aesthetics. In so doing, the hope is to generate new ways to make sense of matters near and far-from Lenin's body to Trump's hands, reproductive labor to sex work, dirty protest to women's marches, indigenous eco-rituals to queer intimacies.

<P>ANTH 20010. Anthropology of the Future. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Two major subfields of anthropology - archaeology and ethnography - have traditionally been oriented around the human past and the human present. But what about the future? Conceptions of the future and future-oriented behavior have long been understood to be a critical plane of difference between political economies, religions, and cultural groups, yet they have rarely been an explicit focus of study. When we shift the temporal frame to the future, questions that arise include: do all cultures have theories of the future? how much about human societies are intentional? how does ideology shape future possibilities? what role do imagined futures play in political life? We will consider theories of temporality, past futures (Aztec, Polynesian, Italian), and movements such as millenarianism, messianic religions, Marxism, Dadaism, utopian communities, Afro-futurism, transhumanism, and today's neo-futurist movements that deploy radical technology and speculative design in response to looming climate change. We will also explore the intimate relationship between speculative fiction (e.g., Ursula K. LeGuin, Kurt Vonnegut) and anthropology. Instructor(s): S. Dawdy Terms Offered: Autumn.

<P>ANTH 20011. Peasants: Anthropology, Rural Life, Capitalism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Only a few short decades ago, rural societies were at the center of anthropological inquiry and key sources of ethnographic insight. Today, anthropological attentions have redirected toward cityscapes and urban experiences, leading a recent review piece to wonder: &quot;Where have all the peasants gone?&quot; The answer, of course, is nowhere. Peasants may have slipped by the wayside of analysis, but nearly half of the world's population today remains rural, and more than ever, countrysides are acutely affected by the economic transformations reshaping our world and the uncertainties facing our future: the challenges of food security, sustainable living, (agricultural) biotechnology, ecological precariousness, global poverty, and escalating rates of urbanization and urban migration. In a decidedly non-trendy move, then, this course will take the anthropology of peasantry as its focus, and will make the case that small-scale farming communities remain highly relevant sites for diagnosing capitalism's changing conditions and its lived consequences. Our discussions will be at once historical, conceptual, and ethnographic, and will draw on a broad set of case-studies around the globe. We will review classic debates about peasantries in relation to the history of capitalism, and reflect on the analytical possibilities and limitations of the peasant concept.

<P>ANTH 20144. London Program: Institution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the first part of the course, focusing on William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's monumental poetic work Lyrical Ballads (1798), we will consider the implications of revolutions abroad and of institutionalizations of arts and culture at home for the rise of modern literary culture in Romantic-era Britain. Wordsworth famously envisioned a new role for the poet as that of a &quot;man speaking to men&quot; who could make &quot;incidents and situations from common life&quot; the proper matter of literature. As he did so, Wordsworth was confronting both the disappointed hope of the &quot;blissful dawn&quot; of the French Revolution and a cultural milieu reshaped by the emergence of institutions like the British Museum (1753), the Royal Academy of Art (1768), and the National Gallery (1824)-all of which continue to define British national culture. In the second part of the course, we will consider analogous developments of the present moment, including the institutionalization of new arts like fashion, to consider where (in what scenes, and in what forms of writing and media) we might look for Lyrical Ballads of our own time.

<P>ANTH 20540. The Chicago Climate Change &amp; Culture Institute-I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Climate change is arguably the greatest environmental, political and cultural challenge of our times. We are already beginning to feel its impacts in changing weather patterns and rising temperatures. In the years to come, Earth scientists tell us that climate change will impact every human being on the planet. We need to become informed and engaged about what awaits us and what we can do to avoid worst - case scenarios. This 3 - week intensive course of study focuses on three key questions: Why did climate change happen? How is it impacting different communities across the world? What can be done to prepare the world for a more environmentally secure future? The 4CI program features lectures by leading experts on climate change from the Social Sciences, Earth Sciences, Humanities, Art and Architecture. Seminar discussions and site visits to a variety of local initiatives working toward clean energy and sustainability goals round out the program. 4CI will give you the answers you want about climate change and the tools you need to start making a positive difference, whether that is on your campus, in your community or at your workplace. The program leverages the intellectual resources of one of the world's most prestigious research universities and will aquaint you with a city that proudly stands on the cutting edge of sustainable urbanism.

<P>Part one of the sequence takes a historical approach. We consider how different types of historical evidence-documentary, oral, and material-can be used to investigate processes of change and transformation in Africa from the early Iron Age through the emergence of the Atlantic world in the fifteenth century. We will investigate state formation in comparative perspective and examine case studies from the Swahili coast, the empires of Ghana and Mali, and Great Zimbabwe. The course also examines the diffusion of Islam, European contact, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Instructor(s): E.

<P>ANTH 20702. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century.

<P>ANTH 21107. Anthropological Theory. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Since its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed the relation between a self-consciously modernizing West and its various and changing others. Yet it has not always done so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories-a fact that has led, since at least the 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemological foundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over the course of the discipline's long twentieth century, form the 1880s to the present. Although we focus on the North American and British traditions, we review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German social theory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of modern anthropology as an empirically based, but theoretically informed, practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.

<P>Humans have &quot;made&quot; the natural world both conceptually, through the creation of various ideas about nature, ecosystem, organism, and ecology, and materially, through millennia of direct action in and on the landscape. Students will consider the conceptual underpinnings of contemporary notions of ecology, environment, and balance through the examination of specific historical trajectories of anthropogenic landscape modification and human society.

<P>A study of storytelling in non-literate and folk societies, antecedent to the complexities of modern narrativity, itself anchored in and energized by literacy. Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds, this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters, and motifs. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society. The central place of storytelling is shown in the humanistic and social sciences: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis. Student storytelling and performance of brief stories is encouraged and discussed in light of the main arguments of the course. Instructor(s): J.

<P>ANTH 21333. The Lived Body: Anthropology, Materiality, Meaningful Practice. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The body is implicated in all facets of human life. It is at once constraint and enabler, relational and personal, &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imagined.&quot; It is both individually performed and socially determined, the site of both domination and resistance. Anthropological theory has moved far from &quot;Cartesian dualism&quot; in which mind and body can and must be separate; this course will travel through ways of understanding bodies that have supplemented or bypassed this idea, or have existed outside of it entirely. We will consider what it means to have a body, to know a body, to be defined by a body-in short, to live a body. This course's topical readings are oriented around the idea that &quot;embodiment&quot; involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will consider experience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and ways of knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies, both internally and externally. To do so, we will balance theory and ethnography in both our consumption and production of scholarly material, including a final &quot;auto-ethnography&quot; in which students adopt a new body practice for the quarter.

<P>ANTH 21341. Making Plants Work: Anthropology of Human-Plant Relationships. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Food, drink, fuel, pharmaceuticals, clothing, cosmetics, construction material, furniture… Plants and their byproducts are everywhere we look. How have plants become so ubiquitous to human life? How have plants been used, adapted, processed, and sold over the course of history? How can studying plants and their interactions with humans provide a different perspective on the past, and insight into the future? This course explores how humans have made plants &quot;work,&quot; and how these working plants have, in turn, shaped the world in which we live. While often perceived as passive in comparison to human and animal counterparts, plants have played a critical role in shaping global social, economic, ecological, and political dynamics. As desired products, plants have entangled far-flung individuals and societies into complex relationships that reverberate across time and space. This course will survey the history of human-plant interactions through three units: domestication, colonialism, and modern technologies. We will examine a wide range of case studies, in an effort to gain comparative and multivocal understanding of human-plant relationships. In doing so, course materials touch on topics of general anthropological interest: political ecology, agency, social inequality, labor, global processes, the impacts of colonialism, the production of knowledge, and human/non-human relationships.

<P>ANTH 21342. Welcome to the Good Life: The Black Edition. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What do we mean when we say &quot;the good life&quot;? In the United States, the good life has long been synonymous with the idea of the American dream (the white picket fence, secure union job, stable marriage with 2.5 kids). But over the past several years, this romanticized image has increasingly been thrown into crisis with the rise of a destabilized national economy, political infighting, and in the aftermath of the housing collapse. It seems as though the veil has been lifted and the American Dream has been exposed as a fantasy object, if not a complete impossibility. But for people of color, and black people in particular who have been historically disenfranchised and thus unable to access the housing, education, and medical resources necessary to make the American dream a reality, this fantasy has always already been understood as such. Indeed, black experiences reveal how whiteness as a structural mechanism stands at the foundation of the American Dream. Instructor(s): Bock, Emily Terms Offered: Spring. Spring 2019 </P>

<P>ANTH 21343. Anthropology and/of Tourism: Of Otherness and Encounters. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Travelling as a mode of self-cultivation and world awareness has always captivated our imagination. With increasing ease of travel, tourism is a $ 2.3 trillion industry, with 1.25 billion annual travelers. How does reading ethnographies of tourism help us examine encounters with others as anthropology's central prerogative? From Emerson's quote - is the meaning of an encounter located within us or in the object? Is otherness some inherent quality or a product of specific narratives and practices? Encountering otherness being anthropology's primary research methodology, can ethnographers be compared to tourists? How is the discipline itself implicated in unequal power relations of cultural encounters? We will read ethnographies covering a range of concerns about tourism - its linkages with colonialism/neo-colonialism, its role in stereotyping indigenous cultures, its impact on the environment, on gender dynamics, on representations of nationhood and on cultivation of bourgeois selfhood. Our aim is to use anthropological insights to appraise the phenomenon of tourism as a whole, identifying its pros and cons; and to also flip this perspective to ask: what insights does tourism give us into encounters and othering as foundational concerns of anthropology?

<P>ANTH 21344. The Meaning of Police. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The purpose of this class is to offer students an intellectual toolkit for thinking critically and engaging politically with contemporary problems of police. It will introduce classical as well as emerging themes, drawing on research from diverse social and geographical locations. We will discuss, among other things, the paradox of legal lawlessness, the relationship between law and the body, and the unstable distinction between public and private violence. Paying attention to classed, sexed, and racialized notions of danger and threat, we will discuss the historical fabrication of criminality as well as the complex legacies of security and protection that underpin practices of criminal punishment. While subjecting policing to an anthropological interrogation-asking what police means for different people in different times and places-we will also consider the uneasy affinity between policemen and ethnographers in order to ask what it can teach us about police, and how it might illuminate our understanding of ethnography.

<P>ANTH 21420. Ethnographic Methods. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is a course on how to do ethnographic research. While recent decades have seen scholars rightfully insist on the artistic and inherently personal quality of 'doing' and 'writing' ethnography, the course aims to illuminate the regulating structures of thought and practice underpinning every piece of original ethnographic work. The course is both a reading and a research workshop. As a reading workshop, it seeks to enable students to read ethnography like ethnographers: identifying and learning from the inner workings of the research project at the heart of each ethnographic text. As a research workshop, the course progressively leads students to construct and implement a research project of their own. Students will methodically enact the physical techniques and analytic practices emerging from their reading of ethnography. Throughout the course, we will grapple with the challenges facing an ethnographic researcher, and identify the building blocks of an ethnographic project. In this effort, we will focus on the posing of a research question; the formulation of conceptual frameworks; constructing a statement of problem; actors and informants; the semiotics and pragmatics of interviewing; analysis of interactions qua participant-observer, and historical approaches in ethnography. Students will also experiment with forms of non-verbal visual representation.

<P>ANTH 21431. Counting, Calculation and Computation: Anthropologies of Number. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar introduces undergraduates to anthropologies of counting, calculation and computation. The course is split into two parts. In part one (Weeks 1-3), we will explore anthropological and historical approaches to number, mathematics and calculation per se, with the goal of developing an analytical toolset through which we can approach the categories &quot;counting&quot; and &quot;number&quot; more critically and creatively. In part two (Weeks 4-10), we expand on this toolset ethnographically, moving through a series of cases to examine how number, counting and calculation are situated variously in contemporary social life, with powerful ethical, political and even biological effects. We will move through themes including war and genocide, health and the body, human-machine interfaces, &quot;state science&quot;, environmental metrics, and software algorithms and &quot;big data&quot;. The ultimate objective will be to train students to identify and interrogate some of the myriad ways that number is always-already situated in social life - not coming objectively &quot;from nowhere&quot;. At the same time, we will try to firmly root our project in an anthropology of number per se, approaching our ethnographic selections from a footing slightly outside of STS or familiar humanist critiques of statistics. Together, we will test whether this footing leads us somewhere new. Instructor(s): Mullee, John Terms Offered: Winter. Winter 2019 </P>

<P>ANTH 21525. Love, Conjugality, and Capital: Intimacy in the Modern World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A look at societies in other parts of the world demonstrates that modernity in the realm of love, intimacy, and family often had a different trajectory from the European one. This course surveys ideas and practices surrounding love, marriage, and capital in the modern world. Using a range of theoretical, historical, and anthropological readings, as well as films, the course explores such topics as the emergence of companionate marriage in Europe and the connections between arranged marriage, dowry, love, and money. Case studies are drawn primarily from Europe, India, and Africa. Instructor(s): J. Cole, R.

<P>This course will explore issues of culture, technology, and environment in Japan through the lens of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Media Studies. The course is designed for undergraduate students. Its overall aim is to introduce students to some of the fundamental concepts, themes, and problematics in these fields via the particular social and historical circumstances in Japan. Some of the central concerns will be around issues of environment, disaster, gender, labor, media theory, gaming, and animation. In addition, we will devote attention to the recent emergence of the term media ecology as a framework problematizing technologically engineered environments. Instructor(s): M.

<P>ANTH 22129. The Vocation of a Scientist. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Max Weber wrote that to be a scientist one needed a &quot;strange intoxication&quot; with scientific work and a &quot;passionate devotion&quot; to research as a calling. And yet, such passion seemed to conflict with the ideal of value-neutral inquiry. This class considers the vocation of science since the turn of the twentieth century. What political, economic, and cultural forces have shaped scientific professions in the United States? How are scientists represented in public culture? How was American science experienced during the colonization of the Philippines? By exploring these questions, this class will examine the values and norms that make science into a meaningful vocation. Equivalent Course(s): HIPS 21407, KNOW 21407 </P>

<P>ANTH 22165. Politics of Technoscience in Africa. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Euro-American discourse has often portrayed Africa as either a place without science and technology or as the home of deep and ancient wisdom. European imperialists used the alleged absence of science and technology as a justification for colonialism while pharmaceutical companies sought out African knowledge about healing plants. In addition to their practical applications, science and technology carry significant symbolic weight in discussions about Africa. In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation? How have independent African governments dealt with the imperial legacies of science? From the interpretation of archaeological ruins to the design of new medical technologies, this class will examine science and technology as political practice in Africa.

<P>Relations of communication, as well as coercion, are central though less visible in Weber's famous definition of the state as monopoly of legitimate violence. This course reconsiders the history of the state in connection to the history of signs. Thematic topics (and specific things and sites discussed) include changing semiotic technologies; means; forces and relations of communication (writing, archives, monasteries, books, &quot;the&quot; internet); and specific states (in early historic India and China, early colonial/revolutionary Europe, especially France, Britain, and Atlantic colonies, and selected postcolonial &quot;new nations&quot;).

<P>ANTH 23026. Science in the South: Decolonizing the Study of Knowledge in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar will bridge anthropologies and histories of science, technology, and medicine to Latin American decolonial thought. Throughout Latin America, techno-scientific objects and practices, with their presumed origin in the Euro-Atlantic North, are often complexly entangled with neo-imperial projects of development and modernization that elongate social forms of colonization into the present. Technoscience and its objects, however, can also generate new creative, political, and life-enhancing potentials beyond or despite their colonial resonances, or even provide tools to ongoing struggles for decolonization. Together, seminar participants will explore what a decolonial approach to the study of science, technology, and medicine in the Global South, particularly in Latin America, has been and could become and how decolonial theory can inflect our own disciplinary, conceptual, and political commitments as anthropologists of technoscience.

<P>ANTH 23093. Latin American Extractivisms. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will survey the historical antecedents and contemporary politics of Latin American extractivisms. While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current &quot;neoextractivisms&quot; have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells, open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformations to local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present. Yet parallel to neo-extractive regimes, emergent Latin American social movements have unleashed impassioned and often unexpected forms of local and transnational resistance. Readings in the course will contrast cross-regional trends of extractive economic development and governance with fine-grained accounts of how individuals, families, and communities experience and respond to land dispossession, local and transregional conflict, and the ecological and health impacts of Latin American extractivisms.

<P>ANTH 23096. Development and the Right to Housing in Latin America: A Critical Appraisal. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Bringing a wide variety of disciplinary texts into conversation, this course leads towards a holistic understanding of the historically-rooted and globally-entangled housing condition of Latin America's urban poor. It encourages students to read along the grain of developmental discourse at different stages of twentieth-century development, thus advancing students' capacity to critically situate and condition global and national policies. The course analytically foregrounds problems of governance, resource distribution, and sociopolitical complexity, providing students with a representative range of case studies from across the subcontinent and interrogating what it means for social and economic goods to be labeled human rights. Throughout the course students will examine diverse housing arrangements and policies in the context of national, regional, and global development histories. Ultimately, this course advances comprehension of the particularities of contemporary Latin American societies and the particularities shared with the Global South and the world at large.

<P>ANTH 23607. The Immigrant as American Prototype. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This undergraduate seminar explores how the figure of &quot;the immigrant&quot; has come to mediate various origin myths and anticipatory imaginations of &quot;Americanness&quot; in contemporary political struggles. A central proposition of the course is that &quot;the immigrant&quot; should be seen NOT as an &quot;original&quot; founding subject of the United States and its &quot;American Dream&quot; but rather, as a modern prototype-forged only since the late 19th century-for stress-testing different models of American presence and power in the world. Importantly, this is a world increasingly ordered, as well as destabilized, by the expanding logics of industrial and corporate capital-a historical development with reverberating effects into our contemporary debates over the relation of &quot;the immigrant&quot; to American &quot;values&quot; and global &quot;competitiveness.&quot; Drawing on various historical, anthropological and audiovisual resources, this seminar aims to situate the emergence of &quot;the immigrant&quot; as American prototype in relation to (1) earlier cultural-historical archetypes of mass migration, such as &quot;the settler&quot; and &quot;the emigrant" and (2) current debates over nativist and cosmopolitan models of American security-cum-prosperity that take &quot;the immigrant&quot; as the limit case for evaluating &quot;the human,&quot; &quot;the normal,&quot; and &quot;the good life&quot; across nationalist and globalizing space-times. Besides conventional reading and writing assignments, this seminar will offer students the opportunity to experiment with multimedia methods for ethnographic research through a final web-based project in which students will draw from current news and popular media sources to assemble and critically present on their own version of &quot;the Immigrant&quot; as American prototype.

<P>’Populism and its Discontents' is a reading-based undergraduate discussion seminar. Populism is currently the word on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in current public debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time as the dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, but are not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Dose populism look different in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the Global South force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants? Students will be asked to complete assignments drawing on the assigned readings and audiovisual materials and on contemporary media sources. Instructor(s): W. Mazzarella Terms Offered: Summer.

<P>This is a course about intersections. Disability cuts across age, gender, class, caste, occupation, and religion- or does it? By some measures, people with disabilities are the largest minority group in the world today. In this course, we critically examine both the experiences of people with disabilities in a global context as well as the politics and processes of writing about such experiences. Indeed, questions of representation are perhaps at the core of this course. What role have the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and other nongovernmental social and human service agencies played in the creation of specific understandings of disability experience? We will ask whether disability is a universal category and we will consider how experiences of health, illness, disability, and debility vary. We will engage in &quot;concept work&quot; by analyzing the relationships between disability and impairment and we will critically evaluate the different conceptual and analytical models employed to think about disability. In doing so, we will engage with broader questions about international development, human rights, the boundaries of the nation, the family and other kinship affiliations, and identity and community formation. How is disability both a productive analytic and a lens for thinking about pressing questions and concerns in today's world? Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 25250, MAPS 46460 </P>

The &quot;natural&quot; aspects of reproduction intersect in increasingly fraught and often surprising ways with its technological/ scientific, institutional/professional, religious/spiritual, and political/ ideological aspects. The starting point for the course is that the reproduction of bodies is differently understood and politically contested among and for various groups of people. We will pay particular attention to the ways bodies, ideas, and technologies flow throughout global contexts, while exploring how inequalities at various levels (race, class, geographic region, nationality, gender, sexuality, practices of family making) impact the &quot;nature&quot; of the reproductive body, and how reproductive practices &quot;reproduce&quot; such inequalities. We will also explore how knowledge of the reproductive body is contested through biomedicine, law, and media, with particular attention to naturalizing discourse about gender and intuition. Finally, we will look at how ecology and reproduction are intertwined via concern about environmental toxicities and the impact of non-human actors. Instructor(s): A.

<P>In this course, we will explore how people experience religion across social and historical contexts with a focus on how religion shapes ideas of what it means to be mentally healthy and how to treat illness. In the first half, we will focus especially on the role of the body in religious experiences: how people comport, discipline, and alter their bodies in attempts to create religious experiences. In the second half, we will turn to the mind: how religion mediates cultural understandings of mental health, well-being, and illness and the experience of a normatively healthy mind and body.

<P>ANTH 24315. Culture, Mental Health, and Psychiatry. 100 Units. </P>

<P>While mental illness has recently been framed in largely neurobiological terms as &quot;brain disease,&quot; there has also been an increasing awareness of the contingency of psychiatric diagnoses. In this course, we will draw upon readings from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies to examine this paradox and to examine mental health and illness as a set of subjective experiences, social processes, and objects of knowledge and intervention. On a conceptual level, the course invites students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Questions explored include: Does mental illness vary across social and cultural settings? How are experiences of people suffering from mental illness shaped by psychiatry's knowledge of their afflictions? Instructor(s): E.

<P>ANTH 24316. Thinking Psychoanalytically: From the Sciences to the Arts. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Since Freud's seminal investigation into the nature of the mind, psychoanalytic thinking has offered a unique approach to unconscious, relational, and meaningful dimensions of human experience. Despite assaults on the field from numerous quarters, psychoanalytic thinking remains central to the work of practitioners across an array of disciplines. After an introduction to key psychoanalytic concepts including the unconscious, repression, and transference, we will investigate some of the ways in which these ideas are mobilized within clinical practice, neuroscience, anthropology, education, philosophy, literary studies, and the visual arts through a series of lectures presented by specialists from these fields. Along the way, we will gain an appreciation for some of the ways in which psychoanalytic perspectives continue to inspire a variety of current scientific and humanistic projects. Instructor(s): A.

<P>ANTH 24320. Cultural Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of &quot;normal&quot; psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of &quot;culture&quot; and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

<P>ANTH 24345. Anthropology and 'The Good Life': Ethics, Morality, Well-Being. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course takes a critical, historical and anthropological look at what is meant by &quot;the good life." Anthropologists have long been aware that notions of &quot;the good&quot; play an essential role in directing human behavior, by providing a life with meaning and shaping what it means to be a human being. Over the past several years, however, there has been an increasing demand for clarification on what is meant by &quot;the good life," as well as how cultural conceptions of &quot;the good&quot; relate to science, politics, religion, and personal practice. In this course, we will take up that challenge by exploring what is meant by &quot;the good,&quot; focusing on three domains in which it has most productively been theorized: ethics, morality, and well-being. Through a close reading of ethnographic and theoretical texts, as well as through analysis of documents and resources used and produced by different communities in order to explore the good life, we will gain an understanding of the different theoretical and methodological approaches for understanding the good in the social sciences, the various cultural logics shaping knowledge and practices of the good, and how human experience is shaped by those iterations in the process. The topics to be discussed include: the good life, moral reason, moral relativism, utility, deontology, virtue, happiness, well-being, flourishing, techniques of the self, spiritual exercises, professional ethics, neuroethics, and the moral sentiments.

<P>This course provides students with an introduction to the phenomenological approach in cultural psychiatry, focusing on the problem of &quot;how to represent mental illness&quot; as a thematic anchor. Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of &quot;psychopathology&quot; or &quot;madness.&quot; By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/ depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of &quot;how to represent mental illness," students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.

<P>ANTH 25118. Earthbound Metaphysics: Speculations on Earths and Heavens. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Social thought has recently reopened the subject matter of the &quot;world&quot;: what is it made of, how does it hold together, who and what inhabits it? Proposals and inquiries generated in response are as imaginative as they are self-consciously urgent: written on the crest of the global ecological disaster, from within the zones of disturbance or the sites of extreme intervention into the living matter and forms of life, contemplating the end of the world and possibilities of extinction, redemption, cohabitation, or &quot;collateral survival&quot; (Tsing 2015). All are variously political. Foregrounding the plurality of the material worlds and lived worldviews on the one hand, and of the shared historical predicament on the other, social thinkers question universal values and conceivable relations, and search for alternate forms of grasping, engaging, and representing the pluriverse. This course goes along with such interests in the &quot;worlds&quot; and collects a number of compelling, contemporary texts that are variously oriented towards cosmopolitics, &quot;minimalist metaphysics,&quot; &quot;new materialisms,&quot; speculative realisms, ecotheology, and multispecies coexistence. Readings will stretch out to examine some classic ethnographic texts and past theoretical excursions into the perennial problem of how to know and tell the unfamiliar, native, worlds, which are swept by, mingling with, or standing out in the more globalizing trends of capitalist, scientific, and secular materialism.

<P>ANTH 25200. Approaches to Gender in Anthropology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines gender as a cultural category in anthropological theory, as well as in everyday life. After reviewing the historical sources of the current concern with women, gender, and sexuality in anthropology and the other social sciences, we critically explore some key controversies (e.g., the relationship between production and reproduction in different socio-cultural orders; the links between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; in current theories of politics; and the construction of sexualities, nationalities, and citizenship in a globalizing world). Instructor(s): S. Gal Terms Offered: TBD Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 25201 </P>

<P>ANTH 25207. Gender, Sexuality, &amp; Religion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In many cultural contexts today, religion is often seen as a socially conservative force in public and political realms. For instance, Christian &quot;pro-life&quot; movements in the US often draw on tropes of women's &quot;traditional&quot; role as mothers to argue against easily accessible abortion clinics or contraceptives; recent faith-based objections to legal protections for LGBTQ individuals; and debates in the US and Western Europe about Muslim women's use of the veil as inherently disempowering women. Social scientists have often noted the logics of duality that shape our contemporary world: religious/secular, traditional/modern, conservative/liberal, private/public, etc. Within this logic, religious peoples are presumed to be traditional or &quot;primitive&quot; and therefore hostile to modernity or foreclosed from being modern. Similarly, to be progressive or liberal, one is assumed to be secular and skeptical of religion. Is it always the case, though, that religion is conservative, traditional, and works to maintain the status quo of possible gender roles and sexual identities in society? The goal of this course is to investigate this question. We will look at contemporary places around the world, multiple religions, and various genders and sexualities in order to complicate the picture of how religion and gender inform one another.

<P>ANTH 25209. Morality across the Life Course. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Morality across the Life Course. What does it mean to be a moral person? And how do moral expectations within a given society shift across the life course? Social scientists have noted that what it means to be a moral child may not always be the same as what it means to be a moral adolescent or middle-aged adult. At the same time, scholars have been interested in how moral ideals pass from one generation to another through processes such as socialization. Social reproduction must also deal with globalization and other sources of social change. By honing in on such processes of social reproduction and change, many have suggested we may better understand how moral beliefs change across generations and over time. In this course we will explore these processes of moral development, socialization, and change, drawing largely on anthropological and psychological research. While early developmental psychologists theorized moral development as stage-based and teleological (i.e., an ultimate, ideal adult moral personhood towards which developmental stages were progressive steps), anthropologists and cultural psychologists working in many different cultural contexts have complicated this understanding of morality. We will begin the quarter by looking at some of the early texts and theories about moral development in addition to early concerns about social reproduction across generations. Afterwards we will turn to a series of ethnographic monographs in order to explore in detail how particular life course stages are conceptualized in moral terms in various parts of the world and in different contexts of social change.

<P>ANTH 25255. Borders, (Im)mobilities and Human Rights. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the human cost of border control? To what extent do individuals possess the right to move to other states? How do different states with large populations of refugees and asylum seekers develop and enforce migration policies, and what do the differences in these policies reveal about the social histories and futures of these states? To address these questions, we will consider how borders, institutions, and categories of migrant groups mutually shape one another. We will explore the interrelationships between categories of migration-forced, economic, regular, and irregular-in order to understand the multiple and unequal forms of mobility experienced by those who inhabit these categories. By utilizing a framework of human rights, this course will investigate how contemporary issues in migration-such as border management, illicit movement, and the fuzzy distinction between forced and economic migration-raise and reopen debates concerning the management of difference. We will draw on the work of anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers, as well as journalists, legal, and medical professionals. Our readings each week will include a mix of conceptual, ethnographic, long-form journalism, and policy texts. When possible, we will also invite representatives from different Chicago-based organizations that promote and protect the rights of people in various situations of migration to come to our class to discuss their work.

<P>ANTH 25305. Anthropology of Food and Cuisine. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Contemporary human foodways are not only highly differentiated in cultural and social terms, but often have long and complicated histories. Anthropologists have long given attention to food. But, until quite recently, they did so in an unsystematic, haphazard fashion. This course explores several related themes with a view towards both the micro- and macro-politics of food by examining a range of ethnographic and historical case studies and theoretical texts. It takes the format of a seminar augmented by lectures (during the first few weeks), scheduled video screenings, and individual student presentations during the rest of the course. Instructor(s): S.

<P>ANTH 25401. Consumption. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The modern period was associated with industrial production, class society, rationalization, disenchantment, the welfare state, and the belief in salvation by society. Current societies are characterized by a culture of consumption; consumption is central to lifestyles and identity, it is instantiated in our technological reality and the complex of advertising media, structures of wanting and shopping. Starting from the question &quot;why do we want things&quot; we will discuss theories and empirical studies that focus on consumption and identity formation; on shopping and the consumption of symbolic signs; on consumption as linked to the re-enchantment of modernity; as a process of distinction and of the globalization of frames; and as related to time and information. The course is built around approaches that complement the &quot;productionist&quot; focus of the social sciences. Students interested in economic sociology and anthropology can supplement this course by one on Markets and Money. Instructor(s): K.

<P>ANTH 25411. California: Utopia/Dystopia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>California is a bellwether for the nation, and the site of both utopian and dystopian imaginaries. From Silicon Valley's reinvention of the world through technology, to Hollywood's national storytelling through film, from Disney's fantasyland to San Francisco's communes to LA's metropolis, California is a lightening rod for various visions of the future. It epitomizes the &quot;frontier&quot; where traditions hold less sway, especially for women and LGBTQ people. Both reactionary and progressive when confronted with social change, California previews debates that later happen on a national stage. Its current opposition to federal immigration policy should be considered alongside its history of legalized sinophobia and Japanese internment. It exaggerates American ideals and disgraces; consider the Gold Rush, which epitomized an American Dream of wealth for the taking and entailed a brutal genocide of Native Californians. The Bay Area sustainability cult exists alongside the most polluted places in the country. California hosts extremes of poverty and wealth, urban and rural, liberalism and conservatism (Reagan was, after all, Californian). We will consider California through ethnography, history, literature, sociology, theory, film, photography, and music. How do ideas about a place, and its lived reality, mutually shape each other? What is the role of utopian/dystopian thinking? A premise of the course is that utopia for some is dystopia for others. </P>

<P>ANTH 26760. Archaeology of Bronze Age China. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Bronze Age&quot; in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during which bronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by the society, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. &quot;Bronze Age&quot; in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy. This course will also visit the Smart Museum, the Field Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago to take advantage of the local collections of ancient Chinese arts and archaeology. Instructor(s): Y.

<P>Anyang is one of the most important archaeological sites in China. The discoveries of inscribed oracle bones, the royal cemetery, clusters of palatial structures, and industrial-scale craft production precincts have all established that the site was indeed the last capital of the Shang dynasty recorded in traditional historiography. With almost continuous excavations since the late 1920s, work at Anyang has in many ways shaped and defined Chinese archaeology and the study of Early Bronze Age China. This course intends to examine the history of research, important archaeological finds, and the role of Anyang studies in the field of Chinese archaeology. While the emphasis is on archaeological finds and the related research, this course will also attempt to define Anyang in the modern social and cultural contexts in terms of world heritage, national and local identity, and the looting and illegal trade of antiquities.

For instance we analyze the ways in which language has been instrumentalized by Nation-States to regiment and restrain the mobility of targeted populations. We deconstruct the straightforward correlation between socioeconomic integration and language competence in discourse produced by politicians and some academics alike. We also analyze how different types of mobility (e.g., slavery, colonization, and free individual migration) produce, at different times, differing sociolinguistic dynamics.

How is it gendered? How does it frame the narrative or drive it forward? How does language subvert or undermine the visual representation of sex? What does any of this tell us about gender, sexuality and erotics in non-pornographic contexts? Course readings focus on theories of pornographic representation, theories of language, gender and erotics, and methods of transcribing and analyzing dialogue. The course requires students to watch a wide range of pornography, including different varieties of straight, gay and trans porn, so anyone enrolling in the course must be interested in pornography as a social and cultural phenomenon and must also have experience watching porn and thinking about it.

<P>ANTH 27430. Linguistic Politics: Language Revitalization. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Linguists and the general public have long been alarmed about the number of languages that disappear from use, and so are no longer spoken in the world. Their speakers shift to other languages. As part of the response, social groups have been mobilizing for many decades to prevent such lapses/losses and shifts in use and to document, revitalize, archive and mobilize the resources of communication. This course takes up the processes by which shift happens, asking what &quot;language&quot; is in these transformations; what and how linguistic forms, cultural values, and social institutions are involved and what social activism can or cannot accomplish in the &quot;saving&quot; of languages.

<P>ANTH 27601. Populism and Its Discontents. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Populism and its Discontents is a reading-based undergraduate discussion seminar. Populism is currently the word on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in current public debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time as the dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, but are not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Does populism look different in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the Global South force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants? Students will be asked to complete assignments drawing on the assigned readings and audiovisual materials and on contemporary media sources. </P>

<P>ANTH 27605. Language, Culture, and Thought. 100 Units. </P>

<P>ANTH 28110. Human Origins: Milestones in Human Evolution and the Fossil Record. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims at exploring the fundamentals of human origins by tracking the major events during the course of human evolution. Starting with a laboratory based general introduction to human osteology and muscle function, the latest on morphological and behavioral evidence for what makes Homo sapiens and their fossil ancestors unique among primates will be presented. Our knowledge of the last common ancestor will be explored using the late Miocene fossil record followed by a series of lectures on comparative and functional morphology, adaptation and biogeography of fossil human species. With focus on the human fossil record, the emergence of bipedalism, advent of stone tool use and making, abandonment of arboreality, advent of endurance walking and running, dawn of encephalization and associated novel life histories, language and symbolism will be explored. While taxonomic identities and phylogenetic relationships will be briefly presented, the focus will be on investigating major adaptive transitions and how that understanding helps us to unravel the ecological selective factors that ultimately led to the emergence of our species. The course will be supported by fresh data coming from active field research conducted by Prof. Alemseged and state of the art visualization methods that help explore internal structures. By tracing the path followed by our ancestors over time, this course is directly relevant to reconnoitering the human condition today and our place in nature. Instructor(s): Z.

<H3>Art History </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64318">Department Website: http://arthistory.uchicago.edu Program of Study </P>

<P>The study of art history encompasses the visual art, architecture, and material culture of a wide range of regions and historical periods. Art history courses develop students' skills in visual analysis, interpretation of images and texts, use of historical sources, and engagement with scholarly debates. So conceived, the study of art is an element of a general, liberal arts education; the skills of analytical thinking, logical argument, and clear verbal expression necessary to the program are basic to most fields. While maintaining the University of Chicago’s traditional emphasis on the life of the mind, the major in art history prepares students for advanced study at the graduate level as well as for a wide array of careers involving visual acuity, design, research, and analysis. </P>

<P>Within the Art History Department, courses at the 10000-level meet the general education requirement in the arts. These courses may not be taken for credit toward the major, although majors are strongly encouraged to take at least one (1) to meet their general education requirements. Upper-level courses (20000-level) may take a relatively broad or narrow approach to particular periods, places, themes, or issues, or may deal with theoretical questions. The usual prerequisite for 20000-level Art History courses is consent of instructor or any 10000-level course in Art History or Visual Arts. </P>

<P>General Education Courses </P>

<P>Any of these 10000-level courses is an appropriate choice for any undergraduate to meet the general education requirement in the arts. None presuppose prior training in art. </P>

<P>Introduction to Art </P>

<P>ARTH 10100 Introduction to Art develops basic skills in the analysis and critical enjoyment of a wide range of visual materials. Issues and problems in the making, exhibition, and understanding of images and objects are explored through classroom discussion of key works, critical reading of fundamental texts, visits to local museums, and writing. </P>

<P>Survey Courses </P>

<P>Art in Context Courses </P>

<P>• ARTH 17000 through 18999 - introduce students to a well-defined issue, topic, or period of art in depth; at the same time, these courses explore issues of creativity, communication, and value in a series of concrete case studies. </P>

<P>Students who have taken at least one course in art history or visual art, or who have equivalent nonacademic experience, may elect to take an advanced lecture course, numbered from 20000 to 29999. The usual prerequisite is consent of instructor or any 10000-level course in art history or visual arts. The 20000-level art history courses investigate the arts of specific periods and places from a variety of perspectives. Some courses embrace large bodies of material defined by national culture; others follow developments in style, iconography, and patronage as they affect works in selected media. </P>

<P>Major in Art History </P>

<P>The BA in art history furnishes students with a broad knowledge of art, including architecture, even as it provides an opportunity for the complementary, intensive study of an area of special interest. The basic components of the concentration are: a Special Field, devised in consultation with departmental instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS); a distribution of courses outside the special field; at least two research papers in art history (emerging from ordinary course work in the department); and a third-year seminar on art-historical methods and issues. Fourth-year students who wish to pursue honors in the major conduct independent research on a topic of their own devising, producing a BA Paper with the guidance of a faculty member and a graduate preceptor. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Beginning with the Class of 2020, art history majors will follow the requirements outlined below. Students in the Class of 2019 have the option of adhering to the new or to the old requirements. They should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to address their options and any questions or concerns. </P>

<P>All art history majors are expected take at least one (1) course in art history at the 10000-level to fulfill their general education requirement in the arts. Although general education courses do not count for the major, </P>

<P>they are useful preliminaries to advanced work. It is, therefore, strongly recommended that students take such a course as early as possible in their undergraduate careers. Note: Students who have formally declared the major in art history are guaranteed admission to 10000-level courses by notifying the instructor in advance. </P>

<P>The Standard Curriculum </P>

<P>The standard formula for requirements in the major goes by the sobriquet “4-3-2-1.” All art history majors must complete the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Four (4) courses at the 20000-level to meet a distribution requirement within the department. These courses shall be selected in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Courses should be selected for maximal geographical, chronological, cultural, and methodological diversity, and for minimal overlap with the Special Field. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Three (3) courses at the 20000-level in a Special Field. Students develop the Special Field in consultation with departmental instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Because Special Fields reflect the interests of individual students, they range widely in topic, approach, and scope. Reading courses with art history faculty may be used to pursue specific questions within a Special Field. For more on the Special Field, seeSpecial Field below. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Two (2) courses at the 20000-level as free electives. Any art history courses at the 20000-level may satisfy this requirement. Courses outside the Department of Art History that relate directly to the Special Field are eligible to meet this requirement by petition to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>ARTH 29600 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History . Students are expected to take this course in the Winter Quarter of the third year. Students who wish to study abroad during that quarter must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies no later than the beginning of their third year to work out an alternative program of study. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>At least two research papers of 10–15 pages. See Research Papers below. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>In all of the above cases, graduate seminars at the 40000-level may count toward requirements in the major. Students are advised, however, that such courses impose special burdens of time and expertise, and admission to them is typically only by explicit approval of the instructor and may involve various prerequisites. </P>

<P>Students wishing to pursue honors in the major have additional requirements, described below under Honors. </P>

<P>Special Field </P>

<P>The Special Field is developed by the student in consultation with instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies, and may take various forms. It may be defined with reference to a civilization, a chronological period, a nation-state, a cultural institution, or a suitable combination; it may be conceptual in character (e.g., art and the history of science, urban history, geography, gender and sexuality studies); it may combine historical, critical, and theoretical perspectives (e.g., politics and visual art in the twentieth century); it may be based in a particular medium or class of object (e.g., the built environment, tomb assemblages, or prints); it may combine historical and studio-practice courses (e.g., DoVA, CMST, TAPS, Music) to explore interrelations (e.g., art and dance). In many cases, courses outside the Department of Art History will be directly relevant to the Special Field; up to two such courses may be counted toward the major as free electives to complement the Special Field. </P>

<P>For those writing a BA Paper, the topic normally develops from the Special Field and allows for further study in the Special Field through independent research and writing. </P>

<P>A proposal for the Special Field, in the form of a written petition, must be received by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and approved no later than the end of a student's third year. It is strongly recommended that students complete at least two courses in their Special Field by the end of their third year. The Special Field Declaration Form is available on the Department of Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/ undergraduate/major-requirements). </P>

<P>Junior Seminar </P>

<P>ARTH 29600 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History is designed to introduce the methods of art historical research. It is offered in Winter Quarter and required of art history majors; if they wish, minors may take the course to satisfy a 20000-level course requirement. Majors or prospective majors who wish to study abroad during Winter Quarter of their third year must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, preferably in their first or second year and no later than the beginning of their third year, to work out an alternative program of study. Second-year art history majors are permitted to enroll in the Junior Seminar with permission from the instructor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </P>

<P>Research Papers </P>

<P>All art history majors write at least two research papers of 10–15 pages. Students who wish to write a BA Paper should complete this requirement before the beginning of their fourth year. A research paper can be: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>a paper written to fulfill a course assignment, </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>the extension of a shorter course paper (either during the course or after its completion) to meet the page requirement, or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>a new paper on a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>The paper should include an analysis of existing scholarship and other relevant source materials. The paper should also draw on that scholarship and evidence to shape and support a thesis or argument of the student's own devising. Formal analyses of works of art and analytic papers on materials assembled by the instructor do not qualify. On completion of a research paper, students must submit an approval form, signed by the course instructor, to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. It is the student's responsibility to obtain this signature and to submit the form. Approval forms are available on the Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/ undergraduate/major-requirements). </P>

<P>Honors Art history majors who wish to pursue a BA with honors must complete the following requirements in </P>

<P>addition to the standard curriculum. These students must register for the BA Paper writing seminar (ARTH </P>

<P>29800 Senior Seminar: Writing Workshop) in Autumn Quarter of the fourth year. Writing the BA Paper is a </P>

<P>process that usually takes more than two quarters. Each student must secure the consent of an art history faculty </P>

<P>member who will serve as his or her adviser by the second week of Autumn Quarter (i.e., two quarters before </P>

<P>the planned quarter of graduation). Working with a preceptor, students must then complete a BA Paper by the </P>

<P>second week of Spring Quarter of the fourth year. The BA Paper is typically a 20- to 30-page research paper of </P>

<P>original work that grows out of the Special Field. For more information, see BA Paper and Seminar. </P>

<P>To be eligible for honors in the major, students must complete both the BA seminar and the BA Paper, and must have earned a major GPA of at least 3.5 and cumulative GPA of 3.3 at the time of graduation. Please note that completion of the BA Paper does not, in itself, guarantee honors in the major. Honors are awarded by the College on the basis of a departmental nomination of exceptional BA Papers. </P>

<P>BA Paper and Seminar </P>

<P>ARTH 29800 Senior Seminar: Writing Workshop is a workshop course offered in Autumn Quarter designed to assist students in writing and researching their BA Papers. Students typically take the seminar in Autumn Quarter before graduating in Spring Quarter; students graduating in Autumn or Winter Quarter should take the course in the previous academic year. In the closing sessions of the seminar, students present their work-inprogress for the BA Paper. They continue their research on the paper during the following quarters, meeting at intervals with their faculty BA advisor. Students have the option of taking ARTH 29900 Preparation for the BA Paper in Autumn or Winter Quarter to afford additional time for research or writing; this course is taught by arrangement between a student and his or her instructor. This course would be in addition to the 11 courses for the major with honors. </P>

<P>A polished draft of the BA Paper is due by Friday of ninth week of the quarter preceding graduation; the final version of the BA Paper is due Monday of second week of the quarter of graduation. Both the draft and final version of the BA Paper must be submitted in duplicate: one copy to the faculty advisor and the second to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Because individual projects vary, no specific requirements for the BA Paper have been set. Essays typically range in length from 20 to 30 pages, but there is no minimum or maximum. Students should consult their BA advisor regarding all details, including optimal length, of the BA Paper. </P>

<P>The BA Paper is a substantial research paper that presents an original argument or develops original evidence about an intellectual problem. The paper should demonstrate the student’s capacity to formulate a serious research problem, develop a clear thesis, and substantiate the thesis on the basis of careful analysis of relevant evidence and measured consideration of competing views. The originality of the BA Paper may lie in the discovery of evidence, a new, critical analysis of familiar claims, or the synthesis of materials. In keeping with guidelines set by the College, the Department of Art History only recommends papers that have earned the highest grade to the master of the Humanities Collegiate Division for consideration of departmental honors. </P>

<P>Double Majors and the BA Paper </P>

<P>Whether or not a single BA Paper can satisfy requirements for a double major in art history and another program is decided by the department on a case-by-case basis. Students should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. The criteria on which the decision is based include: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>the degree to which the resulting thesis is likely to speak from and to art history, even as it necessarily speaks from and to another field; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>the feasibility of the proposed advising arrangements for the proposed joint thesis; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>the department's estimation of the student's track record for independent work that bodes well for writing a successful thesis while navigating between two majors. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Transferring Credit No credit from Advanced Placement (AP) exams can be used in the major. Up to four courses taken outside the University of Chicago may be counted towards the art history major, contingent on approval by the College </P>

<P>and Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students planning to take courses outside the University are urged to consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies as they formulate their plans. Students should also consult with their College adviser to be sure that they understand the University’s procedures for transfer credit. Refer to Transfer Credit for more information. </P>

<P>While studying abroad, students are encouraged to keep excellent records: they will be required to submit the syllabus and all written work for each course in order to be considered for credit. Please note that some courses may be approved by the College but not by the major. </P>

<P>Students first apply for transfer credit from the College, and credit for courses taken as part of a University of Chicago–affiliated direct enrollment program is vetted by Study Abroad. When the credit has been approved, students petition the Director of Undergraduate Studies in writing for credit for the major. The petition must include a cover letter with the title and description of the course, as well as the name and location of the institution. To the cover letter should be attached a syllabus and a written record of the work the student did for the course. The Director of Undergraduate Studies will review the work for each course individually, determine if the course is applicable for credit in the major, and, if so, where that credit should be applied. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Art history majors should see the Director of Undergraduate Studies no less than once a year for consultation and guidance in planning a special field, in selecting courses, and in choosing a topic for the BA Paper if pursuing honors, as well as for help with any academic problems within the major. When choosing courses, students should refer to the worksheet available on the Art History website (https:// arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/major-requirements). This form helps each student and the Director of Undergraduate Studies monitor the student's progress in the program. </P>

<P>In order to keep an accurate record of students' progress to graduation, students will need to regularly provide a copy of the updated major worksheet to their College adviser for processing. </P>

<P>Recommendations for Art History Majors </P>

<P>Qualified undergraduate students in art history may, with the express permission of the instructor, enroll in graduate seminars in the department. (These seminars are also open to non-majors with the same proviso.) For students interested in graduate study in art history, it is advantageous to have performed well in a graduate seminar while completing the BA. </P>

<P>Students are urged to also pursue upper-level language courses. If a language course is relevant to a student's Special Field, the student may petition the Director of Undergraduate Studies to count it toward electives. </P>

<P>Those planning to continue their study of art history at the graduate level are advised to achieve language competency equal to at least two years of college study in French or German, or in the language(s) relevant for the geographic region that corresponds to their primary area of interest. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Art history majors must receive quality grades in courses taken for the major. ARTH 29900 Preparation for the BA Paper is open for Pass/Fail grading with consent of the instructor. Art history courses elected beyond program requirements may be taken for P/F grading with consent of the instructor. All courses taken to satisfy the general education requirement in the arts must receive quality grades. Nonmajors may select the P/F grading option with consent of the instructor if they are taking an art history course that is not satisfying a general education requirement. A Pass grade is given only for work of C– quality or higher. </P>

<P>Minor in Art History </P>

<P>Beginning with the Class of 2020, art history minors will follow the requirements outlined below. Students in the Class of 2019 have the option of adhering to the new or to the old requirements. They should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to address their options and any questions or concerns. </P>

<P>All art history minors are encouraged take at least one (1) course in art history at the 10000-level to fulfill their general education requirement in the arts. Although general education courses do not count for the minor, they are useful preliminaries to advanced work. It is, therefore, strongly recommended that students take such a course as early as possible in their undergraduate careers. Note: Students considering the minor in art history and seeking admission to a 10000-level ARTH course may identify themselves to the instructor in advance. </P>

<P>The formula for requirements in the minor goes by the sobriquet “3-and-3”: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>All art history minors take three (3) courses at the 20000-level to meet a distribution requirement within the department. These courses shall be selected in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Courses should be selected for maximal geographical, chronological, cultural, and methodological diversity, and for minimal overlap with the Special Field. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>All art history minors take three (3) courses at the 20000-level in a Special Field. Students develop the Special Field in consultation with departmental instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Because Special Fields reflect the interests of individual students, they range widely in topic, approach, and scope. Reading courses with art history faculty may be used to pursue specific questions within a Special Field. For more on the Special Field, see Special Field. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>In all of the above cases, graduate seminars at the 40000-level may count toward requirements in the minor. Students are advised, however, that such courses impose special burdens of time and expertise, and admission to them is typically only by explicit approval of the instructor and may involve various prerequisites. </P>

<P>In one of the courses, students also write one research paper of about 10–15 pages on a topic chosen with and guided by the instructor, by individual arrangement at the start of the quarter (see Research Papers). Minors may elect to take ARTH 29600 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History with the majors; if they do, they will research and write an essay on a topic of their choice instead of preparing a BA Paper proposal. </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program in art history must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Students choose courses in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. The Director's approval for the minor program should be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form available on the Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/program/minor-requirements). </P>

<P>Courses in the minor may not be double counted with the student's major(s), other minors, or general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Special Field </P>

<P>The Special Field is developed by the student in consultation with instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies and may take various forms. It may be defined with reference to a civilization, a chronological period, a nation-state, a cultural institution, or a suitable combination; it may be conceptual in character (e.g., art and the history of science, urban history, geography, gender and sexuality studies); it may combine historical, critical, and theoretical perspectives (e.g., politics and visual art in the twentieth century); it may be based in a particular medium or class of object (e.g., the built environment, tomb assemblages, or prints); it may combine historical and studio-practice courses (e.g., DoVA, CMST, TAPS, Music) to explore interrelations (e.g., art and dance). </P>

<P>Minor in Architectural Studies </P>

<P>Beginning with the Class of 2020, architectural studies minors will follow the requirements outlined below. Students in the Class of 2019 have the option of adhering to the new or to the old requirements. They should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to address their options and any questions or concerns. </P>

<P>The minor in architectural studies combines course work in art history, which equips students to analyze the form and changing history of the built environment in diverse cultures, places, and times, with up to three courses on architectural or urban topics offered in any department. Thus the minor enables students to enrich art historical analysis with methods from other disciplines. A student might choose to minor in architectural studies because the student is interested in the built environment—the inescapable setting of our lives—from a liberal arts perspective or because the student is considering applying to architecture school. The minor could represent an interest distinct from the student's major or it could complement a major in the social sciences or humanities by exploring the material setting of history and social life or the context for works of literature, film, music, or drama. It could equally complement a major in the sciences, such as medical fields, ecology, geology, physics, or mathematics. </P>

<P>Prospective minors need to meet with the Department of Art History’s Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of the third year to discuss their interests and course plans and to obtain advice and approval. Together the student and the Director of Undergraduate Studies will fill out the Minor Program Application Form listing the intended courses, which the Director signs. The student should download the form from the Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/architectural-studies) and submit the completed, signed version to his or her College adviser before the end of the third year. </P>

<P>Requirements </P>

<P>The minor in architectural studies requires a total of six courses at the 20000-level chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, all of which must either focus on the built environment or permit the student to devote the assignments or papers to the built environment. A minimum of three courses must be in the Department of Art History. The additional three courses may be taken in art history or in other departments or programs. Some of the programs that may offer relevant courses are geographical studies, visual arts, history, English language and literature, anthropology, and environmental studies. In one of the courses, students also write one research paper of about 10 to 15 pages on a topic chosen with and guided by the instructor, by individual arrangement at the start of the quarter (see Research Papers). </P>

<P>Minors are strongly encouraged to take ARTH 20700 Understanding the Built Environment when available. Minors may elect to take ARTH 29600 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History, for which they would research and write an essay on a topic of their choice instead of preparing a BA Paper proposal. This option is particularly suitable for minors interested in doing graduate work in architectural history. </P>

<P>Graduate seminars at the 40000-level may count toward requirements. Students are advised, however, that such courses impose special burdens of time and expertise, and admission to them is typically only by explicit approval of the instructor and may involve various prerequisites. </P>

<P>Contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies in art history if you have questions about whether a course may be counted toward the architectural studies minor. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Art History Courses </P>

<P>ARTH 10100. Introduction to Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course develops skills in perception, comprehension, and evaluation of various art objects. It encourages close analysis of visual materials, exploring the range of questions and methods appropriate to works of art, in their historical, theoretical, and social dimensions. Most importantly, the course emphasizes articulate writing and salient argumentation about visual and other aesthetic phenomena. Three coherent units, on Monument/ Site, Image/Medium, and Object/Museum, explore these issues across cultures and periods. Examples draw on original objects in campus collections. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring Winter Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>ARTH 14105. Introduction to Roman Art and Archaeology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course offers a survey of the art and archaeology of the Roman world from the founding of Rome in the eighth century BC to the Christianization of the Empire in the fourth century AD. Students will witness the transformation of Rome from a humble village of huts surrounded by marshland in central Italy into the centripetal force of a powerful Empire that spanned mind-bogglingly distant reaches of space and time. Throughout the course, we will consider how the built environments and artifacts produced by an incredible diversity of peoples and places can make visible larger trends of historical, political, and cultural change. What, we will begin and end by asking, is Roman about Roman art? Instructor(s): P. Crowley Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment.

<P>ARTH 14107. Greek Art and Archaeology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the art and archaeology of ancient Greece from ca. 1000 BCE - ca. 200 BCE. Participants will learn a lot of facts about the Greek world; they will see the Greeks emerge from poverty and anarchy to form a distinctive political and social system based on city-states, and they will see that system grow unstable and collapse. They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design many of which are still in use today. Along with these facts, they will acquire a conceptual toolkit for looking at works of art and for thinking about the relation of art to social life. Instructor(s): S. Estrin Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. Equivalent Course(s): CLCV 21807 </P>

<P>ARTH 14200. Introduction to Medieval Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the challenging world of medieval art. Beginning with the fourth-century fusion of Imperial and Christian images and ending with the advent of print, we trace how images and art-making took on new roles-and re-invented old ones-over the course of the Middle Ages. We consider architecture, sculpture, wall-painting, manuscript painting, stained glass, metalwork, and textiles in their historical contexts, questioning why medieval objects look the way they do and how they were seen and used by medieval viewers. Readings include medieval sources (in translation) and exemplary modern scholarship. Instructor(s): A. Kumler Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>ARTH 15650. Art Since 1900. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Focusing on the interrelationships between avant-garde culture and the emerging mass cultural formations of industrializing societies, our survey will address a wide range of historical and methodological questions: the impact of new technologies of production, the utopian projects of the Euro-American avant-gardes, the transformation of modernist conceptions of artistic autonomy, the changing roles of cultural institutions, the construction of social Others, the formation of new audiences, and the rise of &quot;contemporary art." Equivalent Course(s): ARTV 15650 </P>

<P>ARTH 15780. Modern Art from the Enlightenment until Today. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Surveying the history of modern Western art from the 18th through the 21st century, this course will introduce students to the artists, art works, and issues central to the relationship between art and modernity: the rise of the self and identity politics, the growth of the metropolis, the questioning of the &quot;real&quot; and the invention of photography, the autonomous thrust and semiotic potential of abstraction, the political ambitions of the avantgarde, and the impact of consumer and media cultures. Most discussion sections will center around original works of art and take place in the Smart Museum of Art. Instructor(s): C. Mehring Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>ARTH 15800. Contemporary Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will consider the practice and theory of visual art in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Among the subjects that will drive our narrative will be the rise of postmodernism, pop art, the aesthetics of the social movements of the 1960s, institutional critique, the relationship between reproductive media and Feminism, the concept of spectacle, conceptual art, the appearance of a global art industry after 1989, the connections between art school and art-making, &quot;relational aesthetics,&quot; the fate of art in the age of the Internet, the art of the post-studio moment, and what happens to art when it engages with *everything*.

Equivalent Course(s): ARTV 20006 </P>

<P>ARTH 17121. The Art of Leonardo da Vinci. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The central focus of this course will be on the small, damaged and disputed body of paintings that Leonardo has left to us, the wealth of his drawings that help us make sense of that problematic heritage and provide the most direct route into his creative thinking, and the hundreds of pages of text in the form of notes in mirror-image handwriting that comment on art and so many other subjects. Our structure will be roughly chronological, including his late fifteenth-century Florentine artistic and social context; his two long periods in Milan as a court artist; his triumphant return to Florence and rivalry with the young Michelangelo; his brief and unsatisfying stay in papal Rome; and his final years in France. Among the themes that will be critically examined are: Leonardo's role in the creation of what is still grandiosely called the High Renaissance; the value and problematic aspects of thinking of him as the quintessential artist-scientist; the significance of the fact that he has been a figure of such obsessive art-historical and broader cultural significance for over 500 years; and the ways in which recent scientific examination and digital imaging have shed surprising amounts of new light on his art. Through the concentrated study of the works of Leonardo and his artistic context, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art history to some of the major avenues for analysis and interpretation in this field.

Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 21414 </P>

<P>ARTH 17410. Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and Beyond. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course looks at Wright's work from multiple angles, examining his architecture, urbanism, relationship to the built environment and socio-cultural context of his lifetime, and legend. We'll take advantage of the Robie House on campus and the rich legacy of Wright's early work in Chicago; we'll also think about his later &quot;Usonian" houses for middle-income clients and the urban framework he imagined for his work (&quot;Broadacre City&quot;), as well as his Wisconsin headquarters (Taliesin), and spectacular works like the Johnson Wax Factory (a required one-day Friday field trip, if funds permit), Fallingwater, and the Guggenheim Museum. By examining on architect's work in context, students will gain experience analyzing buildings and their siting, and interpreting them in light of their complex ingredients and circumstances. The overall goal is to provide an introduction to thinking about architecture and urbanism. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Urban Design. Instructor(s): K. Taylor Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 20502, AMER 17410 </P>

<P>ARTH 17700. 19th Century French Art in the Art Institute. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we will closely examine 19th century paintings and sculptures in the Art Institute of Chicago and seek to understand how and why art changed during this period. Topics to be considered include the meaning of stylistic innovation in the 19th century, the development and dissolution of the genres as landscape and portraiture, and varying conceptions of realism and abstraction. Most class sessions will be devoted to looking at works in the galleries of the Art Institute. Because attendance is mandatory, students should consider whether their schedules will allow time for traveling to and from the museum for class meetings. Assignments include three papers and a variety of written homework exercises. Instructor(s): M. Ward Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>ARTH 17705. A Curating History: The Documenta Case. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course proposes a reading of recent art history as seen through the periodical prism of one of the field's most important, signature events - the five-yearly Documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany. Starting with the landmark 1972 edition organized by Harald Szeemann and ending with the 2017 edition which I worked on as a member of its curatorial team, the course will discuss one Documenta edition per class to touch upon key issues of contemporary art practice and theory: the dynamics of globalization; gender and identity; the vagaries of market influence; history and memory; the pressures of the political; questions of aesthetics and beauty. As a history of exhibition making and curatorial practice, the course will also draw on recent developments of the biennial model (in Venice, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, the Whitney etc.), and will be recounted in part from the perspective of actual exhibition-making experience. The class will consist of hands-on curatorial experimentation, as well as writing and reading assignments that mirror and follow the 45-year arc of our historical periodization. Instructor(s): D. Roelstraete Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.

<P>ARTH 17735. The Art of Post-Revolutionary Mexico. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course surveys the landscape of Mexican art from the eve of the Revolution (1910-1920) into the 1940s, exploring the developments, debates, and problems of this particularly rich moment in the history of twentieth-century art. Within the context of post-revolutionary society and politics, we will study the production, circulation, and reception of prints, photographs, easel painting, film, and craft, along with the celebrated work of the Mexican muralists. Issues to be addressed include: the formation of new ideas of nation and citizenship, debates about art, politics, and social efficacy, the relationship of artists to the state, the place of the Indian in the new social order, the incorporation of both old and new media and technologies, and the intersection of gender, class, and national identities. Students will develop their ability to analyze works of art both formally and historically and will learn the fundamentals of art historical writing. Instructor(s): M. Sullivan Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. Equivalent Course(s): LACS 17735 </P>

<P>ARTH 18000. Photography And Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is a core course that serves as an introduction to the history of art by concentrating on some fundamental issues in the history of photography and film. The course is divided roughly in half between still photography and film. The central theme of the course concerns the way in which photographs and films have been understood and valued during the past 165 years. There have been profound changes in attitudes and beliefs regarding the nature of photographs throughout the history of photography (this is likewise true of film). The current range of views is very different from those held by the various audiences for photographs and films in the last century and the century before. For instance, photographs were originally conceived of as copies of things that can be seen, but the notion of copy was drawn from a long-established set of views about what makes a picture a work of art and copies were said to be incapable of being works of art. This view continues to haunt the writings of some critics and historians of photography and film. The course will concentrate on the work of photographers, theorists of photography and film, and on films by John Huston, Billy Wilder, and Roman Polanski. Instructor(s): J. Snyder Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>ARTH 20000. Introduction to Film Analysis. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces basic concepts of film analysis, which are discussed through examples from different national cinemas, genres, and directorial oeuvres. Along with questions of film technique and style, we consider the notion of the cinema as an institution that comprises an industrial system of production, social and aesthetic norms and codes, and particular modes of reception. Films discussed include works by Hitchcock, Porter, Griffith, Eisenstein, Lang, Renoir, Sternberg, and Welles.

<P>ARTH 20612. Early Christian and Late Ancient Jewish Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the rise of both Christian and Jewish art in the context of the Roman Empire - both in the eastern Mediterranean and in the city of Rome itself - from minority and subaltern contexts to the rise of Christian hegemony. It will examine the formation of characteristic religious iconographies and visual identities in response to those available in the material and visual culture of the Roman world, and will explore the ways these experimental and often surprising visual forms were ultimately transmuted into what are now the recognizable models for these religions. The course is intended for both undergraduates and graduate students, and will be taught over 5 weeks in the Spring Quarter on an intensive schedule. It will be examined on the basis of a paper, due on a subject to be agreed and on a date to be agreed at the end of the Spring quarter.

<P>ARTH 20700. Understanding the Built Environment. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims to equip students with the basic skills and knowledge required to analyse architecture and the urban environment. It offers an introduction to the methods and procedures of the architectural historian. These include practical tasks such as understanding architectural terminology, reading and interpreting architectural drawings, engaging with buildings 'on site', and studying buildings in context through urban design issues, such as street networks and public spaces. At a broader level, the course will involve critical discussions about the relationship between architecture and society, the building as a historical object, cultural representations of architecture, and modes of perceiving/experiencing the built environment. The course will operate through a combination of in-class seminars and site visits to buildings in Chicago. This course is specifically geared to introducing the fundamentals of architectural history to those undergraduate students seeking a minor in architectural studies. However, MA and PhD students in other fields are welcome to register. Instructor(s): N. Atkinson Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 30700 </P>

<P>ARTH 21320. Philippe Parreno's Media Temporalities. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the 2013 exhibition &quot;Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, the French artist Philippe Parreno (b. 1964) turned the monumental space of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris into a living, evolving organism, where music, light, films, images, and performances led visitors through a precisely choreographed journey of discovery, based on the idiosyncratic body of work that he had created since the early 1990s. This course is devoted to an in-depth study of Parreno's work and the highly original form of media thinking that informs it. Rather than focusing on the properties of distinct media or on multimedial forms or presentation, his works explore the new forms of life and social existence that result from the various ways in which 20th- and 21st-century media technologies store, manipulate, and produce time. This is a form of thinking and artistic creation that addresses the realities of formats, programs, and platforms rather than media apparatuses and messages, and that engages everything from architecture and design to social situations, natural worlds, and virtual beings. (The course will be taught in collaboration with Jörn Schafaff). Instructor(s): I. Blom Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 31320, MAAD 21320, CMST 23412, CMST 33412 </P>

<P>ARTH 21810. Post-War American Avant-Garde. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the 1940's the American avant garde cinema gained a new identity with the work of filmmakers like Maya Deren, and Kenneth Anger. Working primarily in 16mm, exhibiting mainly in non-commercial theaters, pursuing new models of sexuality, perception and political action, a generation of filmmakers formulated an alternative cinema culture and a new visionary aesthetic. This tradition gained further definition in the following, with journals, new critical discourses and a network of exhibition. Film modes moved through the mythic and dreamlike cinema of Stan Brakhage, Bruce Baillie, the underground cinema of Ken Jacobs, Andy Warhol and Jack Smith, and the structural films of Hollis Frampton, Michael Snow and Ernie Gehr. The course will trace these develops and examine its legacy. Instructor(s): T. Gunning Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): CMST 10100, ARTH 20000, ENGL 10800, ARTV 25300, or consent of instructor.

<P>ARTH 22302. Byzantium: Art, Religion, Culture. 100 Units. </P>

<P>IIn this introductory seminar we will explore works of art and architecture as primary sources for Byzantine civilization. Through the close investigation of artifacts of different media and techniques, students will gain insight into the artistic production of the Byzantine Empire from its foundation in the 4th century AD to the Ottoman conquest in 1453. We will employ different methodological approaches and resources that are relevant for the fruitful investigation of artifacts in their respective cultural settings. In order to fully assess the pivotal importance of the visual arts in Byzantine culture, we will address a wide array of topics, including art and ritual, patronage, the interrelation of art and text, classical heritage, art and theology, Iconoclasm, etc. Equivalent Course(s): HCHR 32302, ARTH 32302, RLVC 32302 </P>

<P>ARTH 22405. Perspective: Rhetoric &amp; Poetic. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By reading classic texts and analyzing works of art deploying linear perspective, from paintings to the built environment and photography, this course will examine ways that perspectival projection functions as a poetics-as a purportedly coherent system of organizing form--and as a rhetoric--as a means of persuading viewers of perspectivally informed works of art to perceive them in particular terms. To this end, it will necessarily also consider the history of the rise and uses of perspective, and place texts and works of art within that history. Instructor(s): J. Snyder &amp; K.

<P>ARTH 23015. Ornament and Islamic Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Intricate patterns, luxurious materials, the absence of human figures: in the western imagination ornament and Islamic art are synonymous. This class will interrogate why, even after decades of scholarship to the contrary, the rhetoric of ornament and Islamic art persists. What does it mean to call a work of art-and by extension an entire culture-ornamental? This class positions ornament as a critical lens and explores how western ideas about the role of ornament shaped, and were shaped by, the study of Islamic artworks. In locating the ornamental history of Islamic art, we will confront legacies of imperialism and orientalism, interwoven with politics of technology, representation, and design. Islamic ornament once inspired artists and fueled early art historians. But the seeds that had been sown in the nineteenth century bore quite a different fruit in the twentieth, and modernism's explicit rejection of the ornamented surface pushed Islamic art from center stage to the periphery. We will consider foundational works of Islamic art and architecture (including textiles, carpets, metalwork, ceramics, arts of the book, calligraphy, and examples of mosque and palace architecture) and analyze the ways in which they have been imagined by European and American artists, theorists, and historians. In-class lectures and discussions will be supplemented with visits to Special Collections and the Rookery. Instructor(s): M. MacMurdie Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>ARTH 23700. The Painted Room in Early Modern Italy and China. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course concentrates on Raphael, perhaps historically the most influential figure of the outsized trio (including Leonardo and Michelangelo), who embody the &quot;culminating moment&quot; of the Renaissance. Some attention will be given to the history of the idea and to the style concept &quot;High Renaissance&quot; and its usefulness as a vehicle for understanding three such diverse personalities. While we will try to do justice to the enormously diverse, if short, career of Raphael, the investigation of the High Renaissance will lead us to examine the mature works of Leonardo and Michelangelo's painting and sculpture through 1520 (including the Sistine Ceiling and the Julius Tomb), which is the part of their careers that overlap with Raphael. Special attention will be given to the writings and drawings of the major artists as a means of interpreting their works. Instructor(s): C.

<P>ARTH 23807. Rhoades Seminar: Art, War, &amp; Pageantry in Medieval &amp; Early Modern Europe. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Today war is often thought of as the antithesis to art and culture, but in the medieval and early modern world it was a great stimulus to the arts in all media. Weapons were adorned like jewelry, while armor could imitate the fashion of the finest silks. This seminar will study the material remains of this culture of conflict and pageantry as it influenced technology, costume design, architecture, visual culture, the art of the book, and especially metalwork in medieval and early modern Europe. Themes include the pageantry of tournaments, the art of heraldry, the visual culture of war-its glories and miseries, the image of noble princes, music, the birth of martial art manuals, fashion on the battlefield, fortification technology and the engineer. With a focus on object-based study, lectures will analyze the collections at the Art Institute of Chicago including: armor, edged weapons, textiles, prints, rare books and many other facets of this martial culture. Students will be encouraged to engage with this cultural history of warfare and pageantry as it relates to their own fields of interest and explore the broad and definite impact of conflict on the arts of design.

<P>ARTH 24002. Advanced Nonfiction Workshop: Writing About the Arts. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Writing about the arts has long been a way for writers to investigate the wide world and to look inward. In this course, we'll be focusing on the visual arts, and we'll try to see how reflecting on painting, photography, installation art, and those arts that get called &quot;decorative&quot; gives us ways to consider the object in space, and also history, war, friendship, education, material culture, aesthetics, and coming-of-age. In writing, we will practice all kinds of forms: lyric fragments; polemics; reviews; catalog essays; museum wall texts; personal meditations on a single work; documentation of lost techniques and lost works; and history, criticism, and biography written for readers outside the academy. Students will also write a longer essay to be workshopped in class. We'll read and discuss writers such as Susan Sontag, Geoff Dyer, Claudia Rankine, Tiana Bighorse, Rebecca Solnit, Zbigniew Herbert, Donald Judd, Octavio Paz, Mark Doty, Hervé Guibert, Kevin Young, Lawrence Weschler, and Walter Benjamin. Students will make some guided and some independent visits to museums, including the Art Institute, DuSable Museum of African American History, Smart Museum of Art, Oriental Institute, and National Museum of Mexican Arts.

<P>ARTH 24170. Research the Chicago Cityscape. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course has three goals: (1) To support artist Theaster Gates's renovations of South Side Chicago buildings for civic uses with student research on the architectural and social history of prospective buildings and their environs. The Stony Island Arts Bank and the Arts Incubator at the University are examples of Gates's work: https://rebuild-foundation.org/ (2) To develop research skills, which can be adapted to other built environments. </P>

<P>(3) To develop an understanding of Chicago's built environment and its social history. We meet twice a week, once to discuss common readings and once for a longer session to enable field trips (a tour of Gates's area; visits to research archives) and collaborative research work among students. Students will work together to produce historical reports. Permission of instructor required. Please send an email explaining your interest in the course and any relevant background experience (e.g., previous course work in architectural or urban history, urban problems, or experience with any aspect of the built environment or Chicago history).

<P>This class is an architectural studio based in the common residential buildings of Chicago and the city's built environment. While a design project and architectural skills will be the focus of the class, it will also incorporate readings, a small amount of writing, and some social and geographical history. We will: (1) give students interested in pursuing architecture or the study of cities experience with a studio class and some skills related to architectural thinking, (2) acquaint students intimately with Chicago's common residential buildings and built fabric, and (3) situate all this within a context of social thought about residential architecture, common buildings, housing, and the city.

<P>ARTH 24416. Biocentrism: The Concept of Life in German Literature and Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the notion of life broadly understood, drawing on texts from a variety of disciplines (literature, philosophy, art history, biology) as well as on artworks that reflect on the concept of life. How did artists and writers conceive of the process of life? How did they situate life in relation to movement? How do notions of the organic/inorganic, material/spiritual organize writers' and artists' understanding of life? How did scientific and cultural currents such as organicism, vitalism, constructivism influence literary and aesthetic practices and theoretical frameworks? What are the networks of exchange between literature, the arts, and the emerging life sciences in the period? These and other questions will be grounded in close consideration of works by Aristotle, Nietzsche, Freud, Rilke, Woolf, Kafka, Benjamin, Haeckel, Murnau, Kandinsky, Klee, Mies. Instructor(s): M.

<P>ARTH 24615. Modern &amp; Contemporary Materialities (Suzanne Deal Booth Conservation Seminar) 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims to explore the links between materiality, making, and meaning of modern art and investigate how surface, form, texture, and color are localized in particular artistic or historical contexts. It can be argued that the discipline of art history still remains substantially divided between those who study what objects mean and those who study how objects are made, where 'meaning' typically derives from cultural hermeneutics, while 'madeness' remains the province of technical analysis. The course will discuss the methods, theory, and strategies of a material-based approach, its forms of writing and claims to meaning. Readings will be drawn from a variety of disciplines, including art history, visual and material culture, anthropology, philosophy, and material science. Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 34615 </P>

<P>ARTH 24625. Chinese Art &amp; Material Culture in the Field Museum Collection. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Most classes will be held in the galleries of Cyrus Tang Hall of China and the Elizabeth Hubert Malott Hall of Jades on the second floor in the Field Museum. Class attendance and participation in class discussion are mandatory. The installation introduces objects in historical and anthropological contexts in keeping with the Field Museum's history and mission. It features objects made for and used by people of diverse social strata, geographies, and ethnicities and features particular types of materials used from the Neolithic through Early Modern periods of Chinese history. The class will examine artworks from perspectives of material culture, media, and image-making. Assigned readings will provide historical information and scholarly perspectives on objects in cultural contexts of production, function, religious worship, and burial in tombs. Students will closely study individual objects from these perspectives, discuss them with the class, and write about them, focusing on the significance of certain visual and material elements, their continuing use, and innovations and changes that occurred over time. The classes will also include meetings with curatorial and research staff members who will introduce their work on the collections-research, installation, and history of acquisitions. Visits will include access to conservation and storage areas. Instructor(s): K. Tsiang Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Most courses will meet off campus at the Field Museum; plan accordingly.

<P>ARTH 24810. The Body and Embodiment in Ancient Greek Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Whether naked or clothed, male or female, mortal or divine, the body takes pride of place in the visual worlds constructed by ancient Greek artists. Yet this emphasis on depicting the body begs the question: What is a body that exists as an image? What, in other words, is a body that is not embodied? This problem, articulated already in our ancient sources, serves as the starting point for this course's investigation of the relationship between images of the body in Greek art and the experiences such images solicited from their viewers. It examines, on the one hand, how Greek art promoted the body as a social construct--through artistic practices that configured the body's appearance, like distinctive techniques, styles, and iconography; through conceptual categories that ascribed identities, like gender, class, and race; and through contexts that integrated depictions of the body into lived experience, like sanctuaries, cemeteries, and domestic settings. But we will give equal attention to the viewer's subjective experience of embodiment, including its sensorial and affective dimensions, and the ways in which that experience is negotiated and articulated as a function of works of art. Finally, we will turn to the legacy of the Greek body in more recent centuries and consider its enduring impact as a visual paradigm today. Instructor(s): S.

<P>This course examines the visual, material, and political encounters between the peoples of Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas between the era of European expansion inaugurated circa 1450 to the abolitionist period of the mid eighteen hundreds. It seeks to bring a multicultural framework to the understanding of the early modern period. We will examine the role of images, material exchange and visual reckoning in the early modern institutions and endeavors that helped shape our current world: the Atlantic slave trade, envisioning the other in European and non-European art, religious encounters and conflicts, visual and material exchange in scientific explorations, imperialism and colonialism. Special attention will be given to the enduring effects of these interactions in contemporary European societies and emphasis brought to a critical consideration of the idea of the Renaissance as a keystone of histories of 'Western' art, culture, and science.

<P>ARTH 25300. Pilgrimage in Antiquity and the Early Christendom. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will present an interdisciplinary interrogation into the nature of pilgrimage in pre-Christian antiquity and the rise of Christian pilgrimage in the years after Constantine. It will simultaneously be a reflection on the disciplinary problems of examining the phenomena of pilgrimage from various standpoints including art history, archaeology, anthropology, the history of religions, the literary study of travel writing, as well as on the difficulties of reading broad and general theories against the bitty minutiae of ancient evidence and source material. The core material, beyond the theoretical overview, will be largely limited to antiquity and early Christianity; but if students wish to write their papers on areas beyond this relatively narrow remit (in other religions, in the middle ages, modern or early modern periods), this will be positively encouraged!

<P>ARTH 25708. Imagining Private Life in Early Modern China. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines how artists, poets, moralists, politicians, and philosophers painted, sang about, or legislated private life in early modern China. The paintings, poems, and documents we examine will allow us to peer deeply into the private lives of people speaking as intellectuals, monks, lovers, married couples, or parents. In addition to such private objects as pillows, mirrors, or personal fans, we'll also look at paintings about private matters intended for viewing in public. To prepare us for this voyeuristic voyage, we will read modern studies of early modern family life in China by historians, sociologists and anthropologists, as well as primary legal and philosophical arguments written in classical and early modern China. We will also read some primary and secondary materials relating to private life in early modern Europe. Students will acquire a basic understanding of moral, political, and legal issues relevant to the conduct of private life at the time. Along the way, students will learn the fundamentals of conducting social history research using primary materials, including visual art. We will view works at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the class. Requirements include regular class participation, short class presentations, a longer presentation, and a final paper based on the longer presentation. Graduate students will be expected to write longer papers utilizing more advanced research methods, including the use of primary languages. Instructor(s): M.

<P>ARTH 25900. Theories of Media. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the concept of media and mediation in very broad terms, looking not only at modern technical media and mass media, but at the very idea of a medium as a means of communication, a set of institutional practices, and a habitat in which images proliferate and take on a &quot;life of their own.&quot; The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the &quot;unmediated&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot;? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of &quot;metapictures&quot; or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become &quot;mixed&quot; in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T.

<P>ARTH 26110. Ways of Curating and Collecting. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar takes stock of contemporary currents in curating and collecting practices at a time when we are experiencing rapid expansion of the museum sector internationally, and witnessing the growing ubiquity of &quot;curation&quot; within the spheres of leisure, culture, entertainment and tourism. Using institutions across campus, the city of Chicago and beyond as our primary locus, we will explore curatorial and collecting strategies employed by a variety of visual arts institutions and platforms from the scale of the single-room/single curator gallery, to the museum and the international biennial. We will consider how curatorial and exhibition-making practices have evolved from the latter half of the 20th century to the present day. We will consider the sociocultural and political implications of curatorial work, and reflect on the shifting status of the art object within collecting and non-collecting institutions. Together we will explore significant curatorial projects at a local, national and international level; we will undertake site visits as well as play host to visiting curators, artists and thinkers. Course readings will feature the writings of seminal international curators as well as selections from historians and theorists in the field of curatorial studies. Students will work through a series of independent and collaborative assignments as well as a final project that integrates curatorial theory and practice. Instructor(s): Y.

We will be closely engaged with the historical development of print media and the technical advances that opened new possibilities to artists, while also addressing prints' relationship to other art forms. In addition, we will tackle broad thematic issues including originality and reproduction, dissemination and collecting, formats and genres, and markets and value. Grounded in the firsthand examination of original works of art, the course will encompass leading masters of printmaking such as Dürer, Callot, Rembrandt, Goya, and Whistler, as well as lesser-known figures and side currents in the European tradition. In concert with other course requirements, students will have the opportunity to help prepare a small exhibition of prints. Instructor(s): A.

<P>ARTH 26790. A Curating Case-Study: The Hut. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course - part curatorial practice, part art theory - will be taught in tandem with an exhibition titled &quot;The Hut&quot;, opening at the Neubauer Collegium gallery in the spring of 2019. We will be using this exhibition project, originally conceived for the 2018 Venice architecture biennial, as a framework, test site and occasional hut-sized classroom for hands-on curatorial exercises as much as artistic and philosophical debate. Both seminar and exhibition center on three philosophers' huts; these act as platforms to discuss a wide range of issues pertaining to modern and contemporary art debates: Ludwig Wittgenstein's hut in Norway, Martin Heidegger's hut in the Black Forest, and a Ian Hamilton Finlay sculpture titled &quot;Adorno's Hut&quot; (after Theodor Adorno). The course will map the relationships between these three philosophers and the shadows they cast across 20th century aesthetics and art theory, as well as consider topics related to escape and escapism, exile and retreat, habitation and homelessness, as seen through the prism of architecturally inflected contemporary art practices. The seminar's bibliography will be shaped in large part by readings of said philosophers. We will also be studying artworks, meeting artists and visiting exhibitions and sites of architectural interest. A final project, consisting of writing & construction work, will seek to expand the scope of philosophical architecture and building philosophy. Instructor(s): D.

<P>ARTH 27420. Modernist Architecture on Campus. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How have universities brought modern architecture into campuses designed in traditional architectural styles, whether classical or medieval? How have they balanced architecture's capacity to exemplify a consistent institutional image and to symbolize innovative leadership? Can the two be integrated, whether in single new buildings, renovations of old buildings, or groupings of old and new? What effect do new building materials, methods, and technologies, as well as new purposes for buildings, have on these questions? While acknowledging other institutions, the course will focus on our own campus history, examining varied approaches to updating our collegiate Gothic campus architecture and layout from the construction of Levi Hall (the Administration Building) in the 1940s to the present. We will analyze buildings and campus plans in relation to the abundant and largely unstudied drawings and related building documents at Special Collections, and work together to interpret the histories we produce in the context of the broader, changeful history of modernist architecture and its debates. Our work will lay the foundation for a future architectural exhibition. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Urban Design. Instructor(s): K.

<P>ARTH 27800. The Material Science of Art (Suzanne Deal Booth Conservation Seminar) 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will introduce students to the methods, theories, and strategies of scientific approaches to studying art objects and consider the meaning of different materials and surfaces across artistic media. It will showcase new scholarship generated in the field of conservation science and object-based art history that draws its strength from the collaborative work among scientists, conservators, art historians, and theorists. Conservation science draws on the applied sciences and engineering to understand how to preserve the world's cultural heritage and forge connections between making and meaning. The course will explore scientific examinations to investigate the production and use of art objects. Focusing on material studies of paintings and sculptures, pigments as well as their binding media, students will learn about the material make-up of art objects by employing visual analysis alongside practical studies using scientific analysis and imaging on campus and at the Art Institute of Chicago. Readings will be drawn from a variety of disciplines, including material science and chemistry, art history, visual and material culture, anthropology, and philosophy. Instructor(s): M.

While the princes of these courts were of Turkic and/or Mongol origin, they adopted many of the cultural and artistic expectations of Perso-Islamicate court life. Further, many objects and monuments patronized by these courts belong to artistic histories variously shared with non-Islamic powers from the Byzantine Empire to China. Questions of how modern scholars have approached and categorized the arts and architecture of these courts will receive particular attention. Each student will write a historiographic review essay with a research component. Instructor(s): P. Berlekamp Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): NEHC 38002, ARTH 38002, NEHC 28002 </P>

<P>ARTH 28405. The Films of Alfred Hitchcock. 100 Units. </P>

<P>No single filmmaker has equaled Alfred Hitchcock's combination of popular success, critical commentary and widespread influence on other filmmakers. Currently, his work is so familiar it threatens to be taken for granted. This course will reveal Hitchcock as the filmmaker who systematically used the stylistics of late silent film to forge a dialectical approach to the so-called Classical Style. Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, yielding a configuration of suspense, sensation and perception. Tracing Hitchcock's career chronologically, we will follow his intertwining of sexual desire and gender politics, and his reshaping of melodrama according to Freudian concepts of repression, memory, interpretation and ab-reaction, as he navigates from silent film to sound and from Great Britain to Hollywood.

<P>ARTH 28815. World's Fairs, 1851-1937: Chicago and Paris. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The great era of world's fairs (or universal expositions) lasted about ninety years. Although this golden age originated in London and took expression on every continent, two of its most significant hosts were Paris and Chicago. This course will examine the character and impact of expositions in these two cities, concentrating on Paris expositions held between 1855 and 1937 and the two Chicago fairs of 1893 and 1933. Particular attention will be given to the art, design, and architecture featured, stimulated, and sometimes ignored by the fairs. But technological, racial, political, institutional, and social themes will be examined as well. This colloquium is meant to encourage creation of research papers. It will meet once a week and there will be heavy reliance upon images at each session. Equivalent Course(s): HIST 28805 </P>

<P>ARTH 29410. Dimensions of Citizenship: The Venice Architecture Biennale 2018. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In conjunction with the US pavilion at the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale - co-commissioned by the University of Chicago and co-curated by Professor Niall Atkinson - this Gold Gorvy Traveling Seminar will explore the multiple relationships between architecture and citizenship both in contemporary practice and in historical perspective. The course will be centered around the pavilion's theme of architecture and citizenship at seven spatial scales: Citizen, Civic, Region, Nation, Globe, Network, Cosmos. Through these scales, students will engage critically with the works of participating artists, architects, and designers, works that address the spatial dimensions of belonging in contemporary society. Students will also explore the historical dimensions citizenship through Venice's complex history as a globally connected maritime empire that incorporated multiple linguistic, ethnic, and religious communities. Finally, the seminar will take account of the politics of national display at the root of the biennale itself and the relationship between historical and contemporary spatial experiences of citizenship and rights of abode, belonging and exile, migration and refuge, and the design of liminal spaces such as ships, ports of entry, quarantine centers, and ghettoes as places of agonistic cultural exchange. Instructor(s): N. Atkinson Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): This is a traveling seminar; the course in its entirety will be taught Sept 4-25 in Venice. Registration is limited and by instructor consent only. Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 39410 </P>

<P>Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 39504 </P>

<P>ARTH 29600. Junior Seminar: Doing Art History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The aim of this seminar is to deepen an understanding of art history as a discipline and of the range of analytic strategies art history affords to students beginning to plan their honors papers or, in the case of students who are minoring in art history, writing research papers in art history courses. Students read essays that have shaped and represent the discipline, and test their wider applicability and limitations. Through this process, they develop a keener sense of the kinds of questions that most interest them in the history and criticism of art and visual culture. Students develop a formal topic proposal in a brief essay, and write a final paper analyzing one or two works of relevant, significant scholarship for their topics. Instructor(s): P.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Astronomy is the oldest of the natural sciences; since antiquity astronomers have sought to understand the origin and destiny of the universe and its celestial contents. How did the universe evolve from an early, almost uniform, state to the rich structure that we see at the present epoch? Where did the elements of the periodic table come from? How do stars, along with their systems of planets, form and how do they change with time? Do other life-bearing worlds exist? These questions have evolved over millennia, with answers now sought using the mathematical, technological, and computational tools of modern astronomy. </P>

<P>For students interested in examining fundamental questions through scientific study of the universe, the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics offers several choices to explore. Options include general education courses, the minor program in Astronomy and Astrophysics (aimed at students not majoring in the sciences), and the major program in Astrophysics, with both BA and BS tracks. </P>

<P>General Education Courses </P>

<P>Many options are available for choosing two- or three-quarter sequences that will satisfy the general education requirement in the physical sciences from among six courses numbered in the 12000s. These courses are designed for students not majoring in the sciences and present a range of foundational topics, from the grand principles governing the universe and understanding its beginning, to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, and the search for habitable extrasolar planets. All courses numbered in the 12000s include labs for engaging in astronomical inquiry through classical experiments, opportunities for telescope observing, and data analysis. The Study Abroad program in Paris is another option for completing the general education requirement in the physical sciences. </P>

<P>Students seeking a more in-depth examination of selected astrophysical topics may take a course numbered in the 18000s as a third course in the physical sciences or as a general elective. While the 12000 and 18000 courses are aimed at students not majoring in the sciences, quantitative analysis is an important part of all courses offered by the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Any tools beyond pre-calculus algebra will be taught as needed. </P>

<P>Major in Astrophysics </P>

<P>The major program in Astrophysics reflects Chicago’s tradition of interdisciplinary study and emphasis on mastery of the intellectual processes of inquiry and discovery. Courses in Computer Science and Statistics complement a foundational program in Physics, reflecting the essential relationships among the physical sciences. Students will gain broad knowledge of the universal, physical laws from the nuclear to cosmological; familiarity with computational methods and statistical data analysis; and experience with experimental and observational techniques through participation in research. Graduates of the Astrophysics program will be positioned to pursue advanced degrees in physics, astronomy, or similar fields, or enter government service, science education, or scientific journalism. </P>

<P>There are two tracks for students interested in the major. The program leading to a BA in Astrophysics consists of fifteen courses beyond the general education requirement. The program leading to a BS in Astrophysics consists of eighteen courses beyond the general education requirement. The BS track is recommended for students expecting to apply to graduate school in the physical sciences. </P>

<P>Please note that courses counted toward the major must be taken for quality grades (no P/F grading). </P>

<P>Note: The 2018–19 academic year will be the first in which the major in Astrophysics is offered. In very particular cases, students in the Class of 2019 may be eligible to complete the major depending on how many requirements they have already completed. Interested students should consult with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and their College adviser immediately to determine the possibility and a proper course of study moving forward. This in no way guarantees that the major can be completed, however. Completion of the major for members of the Class of 2020 will also be contingent on the number of electives completed so far; these students should consult with the department as soon as possible. Students in the Class of 2021 who took Physics (or Chemistry, if interested in the Chemistry Variant) in their first year will be able to enter the major. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Students who have completed the requirements for the BA or BS in Astrophysics and who have begun a substantive research project with a research mentor are encouraged to prepare an honors thesis based on their work. To be considered for honors, a student must earn a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the required courses for the major and 3.0 overall (or obtain consent from the assistant chair for academic affairs), and have an approved research project that will be supervised by a faculty member. </P>

<P>Eligible students who wish to be considered for honors will first meet with the academic affairs administrator to obtain guidelines and requirements for this option, followed by a meeting with their research mentor resulting in a plan for the supervision of the research. The student enrolls in ASTR 29900 Honors Thesis in any quarter of their graduation year. A goal of the honors track is to mentor students through the process of preparing research and submitting it for publication. Along the way, students present their research to various groups, including Astronomy and Astrophysics faculty, for feedback and discussion. </P>

<P>Minor in Astronomy and Astrophysics </P>

<P>The grand narrative of astronomy holds wide popular appeal and lends itself to interdisciplinary study: there is a deep history and cultural context, the night sky is profoundly inspiring and accessible to everyone, and the spirit of exploration is communicated in daily media reports of new discoveries. The minor in Astronomy and Astrophysics was designed for students not majoring in the sciences to cultivate understanding of science as a human endeavor across multiple social, historical, and cultural contexts, and to develop comprehension of the quantitative reasoning that supports a deep conceptual understanding of science. </P>

<P>Students are allowed flexibility in selecting five courses to compose a rigorous program of study according to individual interest. The selection must include at least two courses numbered in the 12000s and at least one in the 18000s. It is possible for a student pursuing the minor to substitute a course numbered in the 20000s for one of the 18000 courses. Students interested in exploring this option must meet with the academic affairs administrator to discuss course selection. Please note: courses taken to satisfy the general education requirement in the physical sciences may not be counted towards the minor. Students who satisfy their general </P>

<P>education requirement in the physical sciences in Astronomy and Astrophysics may pursue the minor through completing the remaining courses numbered in the 12000s and at least one in the 18000s. </P>

<P>There are no Physics or Mathematics prerequisites for the minor. Courses must be taken for quality grades (no P/F grading). Students must meet with the academic affairs administrator before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor and fill out the College's Consent to Complete a Minor Program (http://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf) form. </P>

<P>Study Abroad Program </P>

<P>Every Spring Quarter a three-course Astronomy program is offered in Paris, composed from the courses numbered in the 12000s that are offered on campus. This sequence was designed for students not majoring in the sciences but may also be of interest to science majors who want to supplement their work in physics and chemistry with a quarter devoted to the cosmos. In Spring Quarter 2019, the Paris program will offer ASTR 12600 Matter, Energy, Space, and Time; ASTR 12610 Black Holes ; and ASTR 12620 The Big Bang. </P>

<P>The Astronomy program in Paris satisfies the general education requirement in the physical sciences. Students who have already completed their general education requirement in the physical sciences may count the three courses taken in Paris toward the five required to satisfy the minor in Astronomy and Astrophysics. For details, see the Study Abroad (https://study-abroad.uchicago.edu) page for Paris: Astronomy (http://studyabroad.uchicago.edu/programs/paris-astronomy). </P>

<P>Astronomy and Astrophysics Courses </P>

<P>ASTR 12600. Matter, Energy, Space, and Time. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A comprehensive survey of how the physical world works, and how matter, energy, space, and time evolved from the beginning to the present. A brief survey of the historical development of mathematics, physics, and astronomy leads to a conceptual survey of the modern theory of the physical universe: space and time in relativity; the quantum theory of matter and energy; and the evolution of cosmic structure and composition. The major theme of this course is the understanding of all nature, from the prosaic to the exotic, using powerful quantitative theory grounded in precise experiments. Although quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, students will not be expected to employ mathematics beyond algebra. (L) Instructor(s): Stephan Meyer Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 12600 </P>

<P>ASTR 12610. Black Holes. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Black Holes are the most exotic, extreme and paradoxical systems in the universe. They are the densest concentrations of energy, yet they convert all matter that falls in to pure space-time curvature; they radiate more power than anything else, even though most of their radiation is not even made of light; they are mathematically the most perfectly understood of any physical structure, but their enigmatic behavior is still the subject of a violent disagreement among experts that highlights our ignorance of how quantum physics relates to gravity. This course will survey the physics of space and time, the nature of black holes, their effects on surrounding matter and light, the astrophysical contexts in which they are observed, frontier areas of research as quantum gravity and gravitational waves, and the importance of space-time physics to everyday needs such as navigation and energy. The modern theory of space and time, as well as black holes, will be placed in historical context, with special attention to the work of Albert Einstein. Experimental exercises will include direct measurement of the speed of light and gravitational mass, and experience with interferometry. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, but mathematics beyond algebra will not be required. (L) Instructor(s): Craig Hogan Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): PHSC 12600 or PHSC 12700 Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 12610 </P>

<P>ASTR 12620. The Big Bang. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Big Bang model describes the Universe on the largest scales and its evolution from the earliest observationally accessible times through the formation of the complex world we live in today. This powerful framework allows us to interpret a wide range of observations and to make detailed and precise predictions for new experiments. The key motivating observations include the expansion of the Universe and how it has changed with time; the existence of radiation indicating a hot and dense early phase; the abundance of the light elements; and how matter is organized over a wide range of physical scales. The model naturally incorporates dark matter and dark energy, two surprising and poorly understood components that govern the growth of structure over time. The course will explore the history of scientific cosmology and the evidence for the Big Bang model, its consequences for the earliest moments after the Big Bang, and its predictions for the eventual fate of the Universe. Labs will include a hands-on measurement of the relic cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe and the use of astronomical data to verify key discoveries in the history of Big Bang cosmology. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, but prior experience with mathematics beyond algebra will not be required. (L) Instructor(s): Dan Hooper Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): PHSC 12600 Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 12620 </P>

<P>ASTR 12700. Stars. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Elements such as carbon and oxygen are created in fusion reactions at high temperatures and pressures in the deep interiors of stars, conditions that naturally arise in stars like the Sun. This course will outline the physical principles at work and the history of the development of the key ideas: how nuclear physics and the theory of stellar interiors account for how stars shine, why they live for such long times, and how the heavy elements in their cores are dispersed to form a new generation of stars. Gravity assembles stars out of more diffuse material, a process that includes the formation of planetary systems. The course shows how, taken together, these physical processes naturally lead to the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life, namely elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and planets in stable orbits around long-lived stars. The course features quantitative analysis of data; any tools needed beyond pre-calculus algebra will be taught as part of the course. (L) Instructor(s): Daniel Fabrycky Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 12700 </P>

<P>ASTR 12710. Galaxies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Galaxies have been called &quot;island universes,&quot; places where stars are concentrated, where they are born, and where they die. The study of galaxies reaches back to the Renaissance; Galileo Galilei first pointed a telescope skyward in 1610 and confirmed a then 2000 year-old Greek conjecture about the nature of our own galaxy-the Milky Way. This course will use extensive modern observational data from a wide range of telescopes to trace the modern picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the stars in them. Galaxies will then be used as markers of yet larger scale structures, in order to explore the influence of gravity over cosmic time. The object of study in this course is galaxies, and the narrative arc traced through that extensive data and understanding will highlight our profound discovery that most of the mass in galaxies (and the Universe as a whole) is in fact an exotic form of matter-dark matter-that we cannot directly see. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course in both laboratory work and lectures, but mathematics beyond algebra and some geometric understanding will not be required. This course will feature several observationally-oriented labs that will allow students to directly experience how some of the modern understanding of galaxies has arisen. (L) Instructor(s): Michael Gladders Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): PHSC 12600 or PHSC 12700. PHSC 12710 can be taken as the first course in a sequence combined with PHSC 12720. Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 12710 </P>

<P>ASTR 12720. Exoplanets. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The past two decades have witnessed the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars and the characterization of extra-Solar (exo-) planetary systems. We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere. Although quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, students will not be expected to employ mathematics beyond algebra. (L) Instructor(s): Leslie Rogers Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): PHSC 10800, PHSC 10100, PHSC 12700 or PHSC 12710. Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 12720 </P>

<P>ASTR 13300. Introduction to Astrophysics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course is intended for first-year students intending to major in Astrophysics as an introduction to the range of important physical processes that operate in astrophysical environments, and how these govern structures across a wide range of scales, from planets to superclusters. We will examine gravitating systems such as stars and galaxies, both in an out of equilibrium, in situations where the particles are collisionless (star clusters) and where the system is collisional (stars forming out of dense gas). The course will address thermal radiation in a number of contexts, including the relic radiation from the Big Bang. Line emission and absorption will also be introduced. Thermodynamic principles will be used to illuminate the behavior and evolution of a number of kinds of astrophysical systems, such as how supermassive black holes may have formed. Instructor(s): Angela Olinto Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): PHYS 13300; may be taken concurrently. </P>

<P>ASTR 18000. The Search for Extraterrestrial Life. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The origin of life is one of the biggest questions of modern science. While substantial progress has been made in understanding how life arose on our planet, such research represents just a single case study in how life originates and evolves. This course covers the search for life beyond Earth from the planets and moons of the Solar System to planets orbiting other stars and intelligent life that may have left its mark on macroscopic scales. The discovery of life beyond Earth would be transformative for our understanding of humanity's place in the universe. A range of ongoing and planned experiments have the potential to detect or put strong constraints on the existence of life during the next few decades. This class will mix traditional lectures with flipped classroom problem-solving sessions. Instructor(s): J. Bean Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>ASTR 18100. The Milky Way. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Within a largely empty universe, we live in a vast stellar &quot;island&quot; that we call the Milky Way. As we survey the stellar and interstellar components of the Milky Way-the distribution and motions of stars and interstellar gas, and how these dynamic, ever-changing components interact with each other during their life cycles inside the Milky Way-we will follow the path of ancient astronomers, wonder at their mistakes and prejudices, and form our own understanding. Instructor(s): Nickolay Gnedin Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Any two-course 10000-level general education sequence in chemistry, geophysical sciences, physical sciences, or physics. Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 18100 </P>

<P>ASTR 18700. From Fossils to Fermi's Paradox: Origin and Evolution of Intelligent Life. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course approaches Fermi's question, &quot;Are we alone in the universe?,&quot; in the light of recent evidence primarily from three fields: the history and evolution of life on Earth (paleontology), the meaning and evolution of complex signaling and intelligence (cognitive science), and the distribution, composition and conditions on planets and exoplanets (astronomy). We also review the history and parameters governing extrasolar detection and signaling. The aim of the course is to assess the interplay between convergence and contingency in evolution, the selective advantage of intelligence, and the existence and nature of life elsewhere in the universe - in order to better understand the meaning of human existence. Instructor(s): P. Sereno; L. Rogers; S. London Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Third or fourth-year standing Equivalent Course(s): BPRO 28800, PSYC 28810 </P>

<P>ASTR 20000. Tutorial in Astronomy and Astrophysics. 100 Units. </P>

Note(s): Students must arrange with instructor in advance of the start of the term. Class limited to six students. Available for either quality grades or for P/F grading. </P>

<P>ASTR 21100. Computational Techniques in Astrophysics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will introduce basic computational techniques most often used in astronomical research, such as interpolation, transforms, smoothing, numerical differentiation and integration, integration of ordinary differential equations, and Monte Carlo methods, and elements of basic computer algorithms, data structures, and parallel programming using Python as the main course programming language. Practical examples where these numerical techniques are applied will be covered via homework and in class exercises using real-world astronomical problems and results of recent papers with emphasis on implementing the algorithms from scratch. The course will cover the access to astronomical archival data, and how to search it efficiently, focusing specifically on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, but with introduction to other data sets. Machine learning methods will be introduced to illustrate how large data sets can be mined for interesting information. Instructor(s): Andrey Kravtsov Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): CMSC 12100; or CMSC 15100 or CMSC 16100 plus working knowledge of Python. </P>

<P>ASTR 21200. Observational Techniques. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will prepare students in methods that will be used in their independent research by introducing observation and analysis techniques in a field of astrophysics chosen by the instructor. Students will learn basics of astronomical instrumentation and will apply that knowledge in a practical context (for example, using an on-campus telescope or telescopes controlled robotically from campus). The process of data reduction and calibration will be illustrated, leading to the extraction of scientifically meaningful results. Instructor(s): Doyal Harper Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): ASTR 13300 or by consent of instructor. </P>

<P>ASTR 23000. Cosmos and Conscience: Looking for Ourselves Elsewhere. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Science and religion are two ways, among many others, that people can seek to know about reality: how do we construct ordered pictures of the whole-cosmos or civilization-and how do we relate to them in terms of action? How do we know what we do not know, and what does that kind of &quot;knowledge&quot; mean for the orientation and direction of human existence? How would cultural biases be affected by knowing that there are others &quot;out there" in the universe, should we discover them? From various perspectives, this course addresses these questions of the origins, structures, and ends of reality as we look for ourselves-seek understanding of the human condition-in the cosmos but also in complex religious and cultural traditions. Whereas in our popular culture, science is often identified with the realm of knowledge and religion is simply &quot;belief&quot; or &quot;practice,&quot; the course also seeks to trace the rational limits of science and the rational force of religion with respect to the ethical problem of the right and good conduct of human life. Instructor(s): W. Schweiker, D. York Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing. Equivalent Course(s): RLST 23603, BPRO 23000 </P>

<P>ASTR 23900. Physics of Galaxies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to galaxies and the interstellar medium and will examine the physical processes involved in their structure and evolution. Topics will include the stellar content of galaxies and the dynamics of stars within galaxies, the physical state of the interstellar medium, central supermassive black holes and power generation in active galactic nuclei, what can be learned about the distribution of mass from gravitational lensing, and processes that shape the relative distributions of dark matter and baryonic matter. Instructor(s): Hsiao-Wen Chen Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): ASTR 24100 or consent of instructor. </P>

<P>ASTR 24100. The Physics of Stars. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course develops the physical theory of the internal structure of stars and how their structure changes with time. The material illustrates how to build model stars based on these physical principles and covers observational constraints on these models, such as the neutrino flux from the core of the Sun. Topics include supernovae and the end states of stars-white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Instructor(s): Robert Rosner Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): ASTR 25400. </P>

<P>ASTR 24300. Cosmological Physics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to the principal topics in cosmology, including theoretical and observational foundations. Key topics will include the expansion of the Universe, dark matter and energy, cosmic microwave background, hot Big Bang, and the origin and evolution of structure. Instructor(s): Wayne Hu Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): ASTR 24100 or consent of instructor. </P>

<P>ASTR 25400. Radiation Processes in Astrophysics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Most of what we know about the Universe comes from detection of electromagnetic radiation emitted by individual sources or by diffuse media.#Once we understand the processes by which the radiation was created and the processes by which the radiation is scattered or modified as it passes through matter, we can address the physical nature of the sources.#The physics of radiation processes includes electricity and magnetism; quantum mechanics and atomic and nuclear structure; statistical mechanics; and special relativity. Instructor(s): Damiano Caprioli Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): ASTR 13300 and PHYS 15400. Equivalent Course(s): ASTR 30500 </P>

<P>ASTR 28200. Current Topics in Astrophysics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This advanced course presents the forefront research and interests of a member of the Astronomy &amp;; Astrophysics faculty, with instructors and topics changing annually. Instructor(s): Erik Shirokoff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): PHYS 15400. Recommended for third- and fourth-year students majoring in Physics or the Geophysical Sciences, or students who have completed two quarters of Calculus. </P>

<P>ASTR 28300. Current Topics in Astrophysics: Instrumentation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The topic of this course in 2019 is Catching Long-wavelength Photons. Many important events in the history of our universe are best observed at wavelengths between the microwave and the far-infrared. These include the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the early galaxies which played host to the first stars during the epoch of reionization, and the astrophysical processes which drive nearby star forming regions. This class will introduce these science topics and then explore in detail the tools and techniques required to measure this radiation. Topics will include: antennas, horns, and direct absorbers; receiver sensitivity and fundamental noise sources; coherent detectors, bolometers, and pair-breaking superconducting devices; microwave theory and interferometry; telescope fundamentals; and a survey of current and near-future instruments. This course should provide a comprehensive background for students interested in instrumentation for the CMB, submm, and far-IR astronomy. Grading will include problem sets and a final project in which students design their own detailed instrument proposal. There are no lab sections, though some class sessions will involve hands-on demonstrations in a research lab on campus.

<P>PROGRAM OF STUDY </P>

<P>Biology is the study of life, past and present. The faculty of the College believe that a sound knowledge of biology is essential for understanding the world in which we live, engaging many pressing problems facing humanity, and becoming a part of their eventual solution. The Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, therefore, provides a variety of general education courses for all College students—prospective biologists and non-biologists alike. Although most of the course offerings beyond the introductory year are designed to serve the needs of students majoring in biological sciences, many of these courses are well suited to students in other areas who wish to study some aspect of modern biology in greater detail. Courses on the ethical and societal implications of the biological sciences, for example, are of interest to many non-majors. For prospective biologists and medical professionals, our curriculum offers in-depth course work at all scales of life, from complex ecosystems to organisms to the molecular mechanisms operating in subcellular compartments. </P>

<P>Academic Honesty </P>

<P>Academic dishonesty is a matter of grave concern to the faculty of the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division and will not be tolerated. Students should become familiar with the guidelines presented in Doing Honest Work in College by Charles Lipson and consult with each of their instructors to make sure they understand the specific expectations of each course. Consequences of academic dishonesty (including plagiarism) may result in suspension or expulsion from the University. </P>

<P>The General Education Requirement in the Biological Sciences </P>

<P>Students choose one of the following options to meet the general education requirement in the Biological Sciences: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>a two-quarter general education sequence for non-majors; or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

</LI>
</L>

<P>Advanced Placement Credit </P>

<P>For students who do not plan to major in the Biological Sciences or prepare for the health professions, a score of 4 or 5 on the AP biology test confers credit for BIOS 10130 Core Biology. These students meet the general education requirement with either one or two topics courses in the Biological Sciences, depending on how the requirements in the mathematical and physical sciences are met; consult your College adviser for details. </P>

<P>Students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP biology test who complete the first three quarters of an Advanced Biology Fundamentals Sequence will be awarded a total of two quarters of credit to be counted toward the general education requirement for the Biological Sciences. This option is especially appropriate for students who plan to major in the Biological Sciences or prepare for the health professions, but it is open to all qualified students. </P>

<P>REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </P>

<P>The goals of the Biological Sciences program are to give students (1) an understanding of currently accepted concepts in biology and the experimental support for these concepts and (2) an appreciation of the gaps in our current understanding and the opportunities for new research in this field. Emphasis is placed on introducing students to the diversity of subject matter and methods of investigation in the Biological Sciences. The program prepares students for graduate or professional study in the Biological Sciences and for careers in the Biological Sciences. The following sections describe the requirements for a BA in the Biological Sciences. Sequences in the first year of the program are referred to as the Fundamentals and include the following: (1) The Advanced Biology sequence—designed for first-year students who have achieved a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Biology test. (2) Molecules to Organisms (Sections 1 and 2) sequence—begins in the Winter Quarter of the first year and is structured to provide students with a broad-based understanding of contemporary biology. </P>

<P>(3) Life, Ecosystems, and Evolution (formerly Track C)—designed for students interested in pursuing careers in ecology and evolution or environmental science. At the completion of the first three quarters of a Fundamentals sequence students begin taking the upper-level advanced elective courses and may start a specialization. </P>

<P>Other courses from quantitative programs may be counted by consent of the director of the specialization. </P>

<P>Research Component </P>

<P>Students will develop the skills necessary for quantitative biology research, which is expected to be primarily, though not exclusively, computational in nature. They will work on mini-research projects starting in the foundational BIOS 26210-26211 sequence and in the third year develop a research proposal under the direction of a faculty advisor, which has to be approved by the director of the specialization by the Spring Quarter. In their last year students will complete either (1) a senior honors project based on original research or </P>

<P>(2) a senior thesis project approved by the director of the specialization. Students are expected to communicate </P>

<P>and share their research with their peers through participation in the Quantitative Biology discussion club and by presenting their research in the annual Quantitative Biology undergraduate research conference. Opportunities to further their quantitative biology training and to work on their research project over the summer exist through summer quantitative biology fellowships. </P>

<P>REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </P>

<P>Students can earn a BS in the Biological Sciences by (1) completing three upper-level BIOS courses beyond those required for the BA degree, and (2) writing a BS thesis (research paper or literature review) under the supervision of an Adviser who is on the BSD research faculty. The BA is designed for students who wish to gain extensive training in modern biology but also retain the flexibility to take elective courses outside the major. The BS is suitable for students who wish to take more courses within the major and to write a senior thesis. Students completing the honors program or a specialization that requires a senior thesis can submit the same thesis for the BS degree. If you have any questions, please contact BSCD Senior Adviser Chris Andrews (candrews@uchicago.edu) or Megan McNulty (mmcnulty (mmcnulty@uchicago.edu)@uchicago.edu (nicho@uchicago.edu)). Details of the BS degree and a timeline for completion of requirements are provided on the BSCD website at https://bscd.uchicago.edu/page/bs-biological-sciences. </P>

<P>MINOR PROGRAM IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program must meet with one of the Senior Advisers of the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division by the Spring Quarter of their second year in order to obtain consent to pursue the minor and to plan out the appropriate curriculum (Chris Andrews [candrews@uchicago.edu] or Megan McNulty [mmcnulty (mmcnulty@uchicago.edu)@uchicago.edu (nicho@uchicago.edu)]). </P>

<P>The minor in Biological Sciences requires a total of seven BIOS courses beyond the general education requirement. Courses in the minor may be selected from a specific area of the Biological Sciences (e.g., molecular and cell biology, genetics, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, organismal biology, ecology, neurobiology, immunobiology, microbiology). Alternatively, courses may be selected from related areas to construct a program that gives a more inclusive account of how different disciplines of biology interact. These areas could comprise, for instance, immunology and microbiology, organismal biology and evolution, genetics and genomics, developmental biology and evolution, or ecology and evolution. Other combinations are also possible. </P>

<P>Students must meet general education requirements in the Biological Sciences and the physical sciences before entering the program. Biological Sciences courses at the 10000 level or above and MATH 13100 Elementary Functions and Calculus I and MATH 13200 Elementary Functions and Calculus II are the minimal general education requirements for the minor. Students interested in completing the minor are strongly encouraged to take BIOS 20153 Fundamentals of Ecology and Ev and BIOS 20151 Introduction to Quantitative Modeling in Biology (Basic) or BIOS 20152 Introduction to Quantitative Modeling in Biology (Advanced) to complete the general education requirement in the Biological Sciences, as these courses also serve as prerequisites to the Fundamentals courses (BIOS 20186-20198), three of which are required for the minor. Students who fulfill their general education requirement in the Biological Sciences via other paths may also request approval to pursue the minor. General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry are not specifically required. These courses would, however, allow for a greater variety of upper-level Biological Sciences courses, especially those in the areas of molecular and cellular biology; chemistry and/or biochemistry are usually prerequisites for those courses. </P>

<P>Following completion of the general education requirements, the minor can then be completed by taking three Fundamentals courses and at least four upper level electives to be chosen in consultation with one of the Senior Advisers in the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division. </P>

<P>Students who complete the pre-med sequence for non-majors (BIOS 20170s) are also eligible for the Biological Sciences minor. BIOS 20170 Microbial and Human Cell Biology and BIOS 20171 Human Genetics and Developmental Biology satisfy the general education requirement in biology; BIOS 20172 Mathematical Modeling for Pre-Med Students, BIOS 20173 Perspectives of Human Physiology and BIOS 20175 Biochemistry and Metabolism satisfy the fundamentals requirement. These students must follow up the 20170s with at least four upper-level electives to be chosen in consultation with one of the Senior Advisers in the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division. </P>

<P>No course in the minor can be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, nor can they be counted toward general education requirements. More than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses with University of Chicago course numbers. All courses for the minor must be taken for quality grades. </P>

<P>Prior to beginning the minor program, students must obtain formal approval from one of the Senior Advisers in the Biological Sciences on a form obtained from their College adviser and returned to the adviser by the deadline. To schedule an appointment with one of the Senior Advisers, contact Christine Andrews (candrews@uchicago.edu) or Megan McNulty (mmcnulty@uchicago.edu). </P>

Admissions decisions will be mailed in April. Note that these courses start at the beginning of September, typically four weeks prior to the start of the College’s Autumn Quarter and are completed by the end of Autumn Quarter. More information on the course content and the application process can be found at www.mbl.edu/ses (http://www.mbl.edu/ses). </P>

<P>September Courses (Autumn Quarter) </P>

<P>The College offers three courses at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. These intensive, three-week-long courses are designed for students with a strong interest in research in the sciences. All are taught by University of Chicago and MBL faculty, and take advantage of both the unique research strengths and the natural environmental resources found at MBL. The courses will each meet 5–6 days/ week, 8 hours per day, with lecture in the mornings and lab or fieldwork in the afternoons. Students may only enroll in one course. Classes are small (12–15 students maximum), and the teaching environment will allow extensive contact with the instructors. The course topics cross several disciplines; students in such majors as Biological Sciences, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Molecular Engineering, Geophysical Sciences, Environmental Science, and Chemistry are particularly encouraged to consider these opportunities. </P>

<P>Each course carries 100 units of credit. All courses count as upper-level electives for Biological Sciences majors; for students in other majors, the courses can be used as courses to fulfill the second quarter of the general education requirement in the Biological Sciences. Descriptions for BIOS 27720 Microbiomes Across Environments, BIOS 27721 Observing Proteins in Action: How to Design and Build Your Own, and BIOS 27723 Biodiversity and Genomics: Exploring the Marine Animal Diversity of Woods Hole Using Molecular Tools can be found in the General Courses section of this page. </P>

<P>Students register for a September MBL course as part of their Autumn Quarter course load. The courses will take place from September 1 through September 21, 2018. This will allow students to return to campus in time for the remainder of the Autumn Quarter. Since the courses at MBL are considered part of Autumn Quarter, students who participate in the program will take either 200 or 300 units of credit for the rest of the quarter. This is something applicants should consider carefully when looking at major and general education requirements. </P>

<P>In addition to tuition, each course has a program fee of $2,750, which covers three weeks’ dorm-style housing and meals at MBL, as well as all supplies and excursions. A limited number of need-based scholarships are available. Students seeking financial assistance are encouraged to apply early. Because of the small course sizes, the MBL program will be admissions-based. An application form can be found at college.uchicago.edu/ academics/mbl-september-courses. </P>

<P>For questions about the program, contact Jocelyn Malamy at jmalamy@bsd.uchicago.edu. (jmalamy@bsd.uchicago.edu) </P>

<P>Biological Sciences Sequences for Non-Majors </P>

<P>All students must take at least two courses in the Biological Sciences to fulfill the general education requirement. The requirement should be completed by the end of the second year. Information regarding course and sequence options for non-majors can be found on the Biological Sciences Curriculum page in this catalog. </P>

<P>BIOS 27721. Observing Proteins in Action: How to Design and Build Your Own. 100 Units. </P>

<P>New insights into cell function are now possible using technologies that resolve single molecules. However, as devices become more complicated, we are often faced with three questions: What is it that our instruments actually measure; how can we change the instrument to see a new behavior; and, how do we analyze the data to get the greatest insight? We will learn how to answer these questions by designing, building, and using our own electrical and optical instruments, making measurements, and then analyzing the results. Membrane proteins play an essential role in the behavior of all cells. We will study membrane protein channels in synthetic membranes, host cells, and giant axons from squid collected in the waters surrounding the MBL. The movement of electrical charge produced by conformational changes will be correlated with both the current passing thru single channels and structural information obtained from light and electron microscopy. The course will proceed from simple measurements to student-designed projects. Instructor(s): E. Schwartz, F. Bezanilla, E. Perozo Terms Offered: Autumn. L. September 2018.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Chemistry is concerned with the preparation, composition, and structure of matter and with the equilibrium and kinetic laws that govern its transformations. The BA and BS degrees in chemistry are designed to provide a broad foundation in the three principal branches of the science: inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. Analytical chemistry, often regarded as an independent branch, is incorporated into the program. Both curricula discuss experimental and theoretical work and emphasize their interdependence. Both degree programs prepare the student for a career in chemistry. However, the BS degree offers a more intensive program of study. The BA degree also offers thorough study in the field of chemistry, but it provides a wide opportunity for elective freedom and for the pursuit of interdisciplinary interests in areas such as biochemistry, biophysics, chemical physics, geochemistry, premedicine, and education. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The principal distinction between the BA and BS programs is the number of chemistry courses required. </P>

<P>Program Requirements: BA A minimum of eight courses in chemistry beyond the general education requirement (which should be taken in the first year) is required for the BA degree. </P>

<P>Program Requirements: BS A minimum of twelve courses in chemistry beyond the general education requirement (which should be taken in the first year) is typically required for the BS degree. </P>

<P>Accreditation </P>

<P>The Department of Chemistry also administers accreditation examinations for CHEM 11100-11200-11300 Comprehensive General Chemistry I-II-III to entering College students. Only incoming first-year and transfer students are eligible to take these examinations, which are offered at the beginning of Autumn Quarter. Students may receive credit on the basis of their performance on accreditation examinations. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students majoring in Chemistry must earn (1) a major GPA of 2.0 or higher and (2) a C- or higher in all courses required by the Chemistry major, including those courses counting toward general education requirements in the mathematical and physical sciences. Nonmajors may take chemistry courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. </P>

<P>Undergraduate Research and Honors </P>

<P>By their third year, students majoring in chemistry are strongly encouraged to participate in research with a faculty member. For more information on research opportunities, visit chemistry.uchicago.edu/kb. </P>

<P>Excellent students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Department of Chemistry should plan to submit an honors thesis based on their work. Students usually begin this research program during their third year and continue through the following summer and their fourth year. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the departmental counselor before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of CHEM 29900 Advanced Research in Chemistry or one year of CHEM 29600 Research in Chemistry during their third or fourth years. </P>

<P>To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BA or BS degree program in chemistry must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the departmental counselor and must be approved by the Department of Chemistry. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA paper or project requirement in another major. </P>

<P>To earn a BA or BS degree with honors in chemistry, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. </P>

<P>Sample Program </P>

<P>The following is a suggested schedule for completing a BA or BS degree in chemistry: </P>

<P>Joint Degree Programs </P>

<P>Students who achieve advanced standing through their performance on placement examinations or accreditation examinations may consider the formulation of a four-year degree program that leads to the concurrent award of the BS and MS degrees in chemistry. For more information, consult Ka Yee Lee at kayeelee@uchicago.edu and Vera Dragisich at vdragisi@uchicago.edu in the Chemistry Department. </P>

<P>Laboratory Safety In chemistry labs, safety goggles must be worn at all times. Students who require prescriptive lenses may wear prescription glasses under goggles; contact lenses may not be worn. Exceptions for medical reasons must be obtained from the lab director. </P>

<P>Minor in Chemistry </P>

<P>Before a student can declare the minor in chemistry, the student must complete the general education requirements in chemistry. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies' approval for the minor program; this is done through the Consent to Complete a Minor Program (http://college.uchicago.edu/sites/ college.uchicago.edu/files/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf) form, which can be obtained from the student's College </P>

<P>adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. </P>

<P>To earn the minor in chemistry, a student must complete five courses as outlined below. All lecture courses in the 20000 level (or above) in chemistry can be used as electives for the minor; the student has to make sure that prerequisites for the chosen courses are fulfilled. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Students minoring in chemistry must earn (1) a minor GPA of 2.0 or higher and (2) a C– or higher in all courses required by the chemistry minor. </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The major program in Cinema and Media Studies provides a framework within which students can approach the history of film and related media from a variety of historical, critical, and theoretical perspectives. Focusing on the study of the moving image, as well as sound, the program enables students to analyze how cinema creates meanings through particular forms, techniques, and styles; how industrial organization affects the way films are produced and received; and how the social context in which they are made and circulated influences our understanding of the medium. </P>

<P>At the same time, the goal is to situate the cinema and related media in broader contexts: modernity, modernism, and the avant-garde; narrative theory, poetics, and rhetoric; commercial entertainment forms and consumer culture; sexuality and gender; constructions of ethnic, racial, and national identities; and international media production and circulation. </P>

<P>Students focusing their studies in Cinema and Media Studies major will be trained in critical, formal, theoretical, and historical thinking and analysis. The curriculum fosters discussion and writing skills, and students will gain the tools to approach film history as well as today's media environment within specific cultural contexts and broad transnational perspectives. </P>

<P>Major Program in Cinema and Media Studies </P>

<P>Students wishing to major in Cinema and Media Studies should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies early in their second year to help construct their course plan going forward; this meeting should take place by the end of Spring Quarter of a student's second year. Participation in the major must be declared to the Director of Undergraduate Studies, and the subsequent approved paperwork will be sent to the student's College adviser for official registration. </P>

<P>The major in Cinema and Media Studies consists of twelve courses—four required courses and eight electives—and the completion of a BA research paper. The following four (4) courses are required: </P>

<P>CMST 10100 Introduction to Film Analysis: This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts </P>

<P>of film analysis. It should be completed before other Cinema and Media Studies courses; it must be </P>

<P>completed before other required courses. </P>

<P>CMST 28500-28600 History of International Cinema I-II: This required two-quarter sequence covers </P>

<P>the silent era (CMST 28500 History of International Cinema I: Silent Era) and the sound era to 1960 </P>

<P>(CMST 28600 History of International Cinema II: Sound Era to 1960), as well as major characteristics and </P>

<P>developments of each. It is typically taught in Autumn and Winter Quarters. It should be completed by the </P>

<P>end of the third year. </P>

<P>CMST 29800 Senior Colloquium: In Autumn Quarter of their fourth year, students must participate in a Senior Colloquium that helps them conceptualize their BA research paper and address more advanced questions of methodology and theory. There are additional stipulations for those pursuing a Creative BA; see BA Research Paper for details. Note: Students are also required to register for CMST 29900 B.A. Essay: CMST during their final year in the College, preferably during the quarter they intend to graduate. This is a zero-unit course, but enrollment ensures that a thesis grade will appear on the student's transcript. </P>

<P>Elective Courses </P>

<P>Of the eight (8) remaining courses, five (5) must either originate in or be cross-listed with Cinema and Media Studies. Students must receive prior approval of the five courses that they choose from the Director of Undergraduate Studies, and they are encouraged to consider broad survey courses as well as those with more focused topics (e.g., courses devoted to a single genre, director, or national cinema). The Major Course Agreement Form is to be signed by the Director of Undergraduate Studies by fourth week of Autumn Quarter of the student's third year and is available on the Cinema and Media Studies website. (https://cms.uchicago.edu/ undergraduate/requirements) </P>

<P>Although the other three (3) electives may be taken outside Cinema and Media Studies, students must demonstrate their relevance to the study of cinema. For example, a group of courses could focus on traditional disciplines (e.g., history, anthropology/ethnography, philosophy); subfields within area studies (e.g., East Asian, African American, Jewish studies); art forms and media (e.g., art history, theater, opera); or cross-disciplinary topics or sets of problems (e.g., the urban environment, violence and pornography, censorship, concepts of the public sphere). A Further Electives Form explaining the choice of outside electives must be submitted to the Director of Undergraduate Studies for approval. </P>

<P>Cinema and Media Studies courses eligible for the general education requirement in the arts (CMST 14400 Film and the Moving Image; CMST 14500-14599) may not be used to satisfy requirements in the Cinema and Media Studies major or minor. </P>

<P>BA Research Paper </P>

<P>Before the seventh week of Spring Quarter of the third year, students meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss the focus of their required BA project. Students should try to begin reading and research during Summer Quarter. Students must enroll in CMST 29800 Senior Colloquium during the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. By the end of week four of Autumn Quarter, students select a project advisor and prepare to present an outline of their project to the Senior Colloquium. Writing and revising take place during Winter Quarter. All students are required to register for the zero-unit course CMST 29900 B.A. Essay: CMST during the academic year in which they plan to graduate from the College. The final version is due by fourth week of the quarter the student intends to graduate. </P>

<P>The BA research paper typically consists of a substantial essay that engages a research topic in the history, theory, and criticism of film and/or other media. A creative project in film or video production supplemented by an essay (the Creative BA Option, outlined below) is sometimes an option, contingent on faculty approval. </P>

<P>Creative BA Option: To be considered for this option, the student will submit a written proposal to the Director of Undergraduate Studies by the seventh week of Spring Quarter of the third year. Priority will be given to students who have completed three production courses (two [2] of which must originate in Cinema and Media Studies) by the end of Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. These courses should be used to fulfill the electives in the Cinema and Media Studies major; two (2) of the courses must be taken by the end of the student's third year —a third production course may only be taken during Autumn Quarter of fourth year. </P>

<P>In addition to enrollment in CMST 29800 Senior Colloquium during the Autumn Quarter of the fourth year, students who supplement their BA thesis project with film or video work are required to enroll in the CMST 23905 Creative Thesis Workshop during Winter Quarter of fourth year. The Creative Thesis Workshop may not be counted toward distribution requirements for the major—it will serve as general elective credit only. All students are required to register for the zero-unit course CMST 29900 B.A. Essay: CMST during the academic year they plan to graduate from the College. </P>

<P>CMST 20400. Problems in the Study of Gender and Sexuality: Media Wars. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In our contemporary moment, we have become accustomed to terms such as 'counter-terrorism' that signal an effort to resist internal and external threats, and those suggesting that we live in an age of 'post-truth' dominated by 'corporate-media,' 'fake news,' and 'fact-challenged' journalism. Taking this platform as our starting place, this class explores how these terms and their use have been gendered; have situated both gender and sexuality as either weapons of resistance or objects of destruction. This class will be historically organized insofar as we will begin our discussion with ways that media - broadly conceived to include cinema, print and visual-cultural forms, television, and the internet - have aimed to 'counter' patriarchal, heteronormative, and hegemonic systems of representation of gender and sexuality.

<P>CMST 21810. Post-War American Avant-Garde. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the 1940's the American avant garde cinema gained a new identity with the work of filmmakers like Maya Deren, and Kenneth Anger. Working primarily in 16mm, exhibiting mainly in non-commercial theaters, pursuing new models of sexuality, perception and political action, a generation of filmmakers formulated an alternative cinema culture and a new visionary aesthetic. This tradition gained further definition in the following, with journals, new critical discourses and a network of exhibition. Film modes moved through the mythic and dreamlike cinema of Stan Brakhage, Bruce Baillie, the underground cinema of Ken Jacobs, Andy Warhol and Jack Smith, and the structural films of Hollis Frampton, Michael Snow and Ernie Gehr. The course will trace these develops and examine its legacy. Instructor(s): T. Gunning Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): CMST 10100, ARTH 20000, ENGL 10800, ARTV 25300, or consent of instructor.

<P>CMST 22507. Cinema and the Holocaust. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Focuses on cinematic responses by several leading film directors from East &amp; Central Europe to a central event of 20th century history -- the Holocaust. Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioning cameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandistic schemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocide produced after the actual traumatic events. This class aims at discussing the challenge of representing the Jewish genocide which has often been defined as un-representable. Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raise questions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production &amp; a search for relevant artistic means with which to engage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation of death &amp; suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization; intertwined notions of chance &amp; hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims. The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the course simultaneously explores extensive &amp; continuous cinematic production of the genre &amp; its historical development in various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, &amp; Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. Instructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Course requirements: film screenings, class participation, reading assignments, one class presentation, and a final project.

<P>In the 2013 exhibition &quot;Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, the French artist Philippe Parreno (b. 1964) turned the monumental space of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris into a living, evolving organism, where music, light, films, images, and performances led visitors through a precisely choreographed journey of discovery, based on the idiosyncratic body of work that he had created since the early 1990s. This course is devoted to an in-depth study of Parreno's work and the highly original form of media thinking that informs it. Rather than focusing on the properties of distinct media or on multimedial forms or presentation, his works explore the new forms of life and social existence that result from the various ways in which 20th- and 21st-century media technologies store, manipulate, and produce time. This is a form of thinking and artistic creation that addresses the realities of formats, programs, and platforms rather than media apparatuses and messages, and that engages everything from architecture and design to social situations, natural worlds, and virtual beings. (The course will be taught in collaboration with Jörn Schafaff). Instructor(s): I. Blom Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 31320, MAAD 21320, ARTH 21320, CMST 33412 </P>

<P>CMST 24107. Bombay to Bollywood. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course maps the transformation of the Hindi film industry in India. Starting out as a regional film production center, how did the Bombay film industry and Hindi cinema gain the reputation of being the leader of Indian cinema? This despite the fact that most critical acclaim, by the state and film critics, was reserved for &quot;art cinema.&quot; Through an analysis of Hindi films from the 1950s to the present we map the main trends of this complex artistic/ industrial complex to arrive at an understanding of the deep connect between cinema and other social imaginaries.

<P>CMST 24112. Screening India: Bollywood and Beyond. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Cinema is, unarguably, the medium most apposite for thinking through the complexities of democratic politics, especially so in a place like India. While Indian cinema has recently gained international currency through the song and dance ensembles of Bollywood, there remains much more to be said about that body of films. Moreover, Bollywood is a small (though very important) part of Indian cinema. Through a close analysis of a wide range of films in Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, and Urdu, this course will ask if Indian cinema can be thought of as a form of knowledge of the twentieth century.

<P>CMST 24201. Cinema in Africa. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines Africa in film as well as films produced in Africa. It places cinema in Sub Saharan Africa in its social, cultural, and aesthetic contexts ranging from neocolonial to postcolonial, Western to Southern Africa, documentary to fiction, art cinema to TV. We will begin with La Noire de... (1966), ground-breaking film by the &quot;father&quot; of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene, contrasted w/ a South African film, African Jim (1959) that more closely resembles African American musical film, and anti-colonial and anti apartheid films from Lionel Rogosin's Come Back Africa (1959) to Sarah Maldoror's Sambizanga, Ousmane Sembenes Camp de Thiaroye (1984), and Jean Marie Teno'ss Afrique, Je te Plumerai (1995). The rest of the course will examine cinematic representations of tensions between urban and rural, traditional and modern life, and the different implications of these tensions for men and women, Western and Southern Africa, in fiction, documentary and ethnographic film, including 21st century work where available.

<P>This course will explore post-World War II film from Poland-approaching the works both as examples of the cinematic art in the region and as a lens through which to view developments and transformations in East European culture. We will view ten films by most renowned directors from Poland. The course will assess what the end of World War II, joining the Eastern Bloc, the fall of communism, and finally the entry into post-Soviet Europe have meant for the film culture and the Polish national film tradition. We will also consider how Eastern European cinematic discourse is undergoing-or should undergo-revision, viewing it as an increasingly transnational phenomenon, rather than the example of a national film industry. The films will be viewed in the original language with English subtitles. Instructor(s): Kinga Kosmala Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>CMST 24414. Soviet Science Fiction. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the Soviet Union, science fiction played an integral part in intellectual debates about the best way to engage with the new realities of the twentieth century. This literary and cinematic genre was thought capable of reinventing the lives, realties and even beliefs of the Soviets. This course will study the cultural, historical, and political contexts of science fiction from the Soviet Union through literature such as Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopian novel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), Ivan Efremov's The Andromeda Nebula (1956), and the work Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, as well as through films such as Iakov Protazanov's Aelita (1924), the first Soviet science fiction film, along with later imaginings of space travel such as Pavel Klushantsev's Road to the Stars (1957), and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972)-a mysterious, human drama set in space. The primary goal of the course is to study how Soviet writers and filmmakers utilizes science fiction to interpret and/or comment upon their present historical moment? What alternatives to Soviet reality were proposed through science fiction? Lastly, how did science fiction texts and films relate to scientific research in the Soviet Union, especially the Soviet space program? Equivalent Course(s): REES 24414 </P>

<P>On the fiftieth anniversary of 1968 our course couples the study of revolutionary films (and films about revolution) with seminal readings on revolutionary ideology and on the theory of film and video. The goal will be to articulate the mechanics of revolution and its representation in time-based media. Students will produce a video or videos adapting the rich archive of revolutionary film for today's situation. The films screened will be drawn primarily from Soviet and US cinema, from the 1920s to the present day, proceeding more or less chronologically. We begin with newsreels and a &quot;poetic documentary&quot; by Dziga Vertov; they will be paired with classic readings from revolutionary theory, from Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin to Fidel Castro and Bill Ayres, and from film theory, including Vertov, Andre Bazin and Jean-Luc Godard. Readings will acquaint students with contemporary assessments of the emancipatory potential of film. Instructor(s): R. Bird; C.

<P>CMST 24530. Cowboys and Tramps in Film and Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the invention of two distinctly American literary archetypes: the cowboy and the hobo. Based on historical conditions of labor, economics, and westward expansion, the cowboy and the hobo, though both itinerant workers primarily employed seasonally in agriculture and ranching, were depicted very differently in literature and, later, film, during the decades in which they held influence over America's imagination and mythologization of itself. Evoking responses from fear to admiration and pity to envy, the cowboy and the hobo, both as historical figures and as fictional types, reflected the evolving realities of-and the broad range of attitudes toward-labor, masculinity, and place in a modernizing America. This course will examine literary and cinematic representations of hoboes, tramps, cowboys, and gunslingers from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, tracing their historical and cultural contexts. We will address pulp and dime novels as well as literary masterpieces, stage plays, poems, and feature films from the silent and sound eras, paying special attention to the effects of different media and art forms on the depiction and mythologization of these figures. Other themes include violence and the state, the American West, technology (trains, automation in agriculture, weapons), immigration and migration, race, and material culture. Authors and directors include Jack London, Charlie Chaplin, John Ford, Preston Sturges, Jack Kerouac, Hart Crane, Bret Harte, Terrence Malick, and Martin Scorsese.

<P>Nowhere has the advent of modernity been more closely entwined with cinema than in Central Asia, a contested entity which for our purposes stretches from Turkey in the West to Kyrgyzstan in the East, though our emphasis will be squarely on Soviet and post-Soviet Central Asia (especially Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan). This course will trace the encounter with cinematic modernity through the analysis of individual films by major directors, including (but not limited to) Shukhrat Abbasov, Melis Ubukeev, Ali Khamraev, Tolomush Okeev, Sergei Paradzhanov, Gulshad Omarova. In addition to situating the films in their cultural and historical situations, close attention will be paid to the sources of Central Asian cinema in cinemas both adjacent and distant; to the ways in which cinema enables a distinct encounter with modernity; and to the cinematic construction of Central Asia as a cultural entity.

<P>CMST 24568. The Underground: Alienation, Mobilization, Resistance. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The ancient and multivalent image of the underground has crystallized over the last two centuries to denote sites of disaffection from-and strategies of resistance to-dominant social, political and cultural systems. We will trace the development of this metaphor from the Underground Railroad in the mid-1800s and the French Resistance during World War II to the Weather Underground in the 1960s-1970s, while also considering it as a literary and artistic concept, from Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground and Ellison's Invisible Man to Chris Marker's film La Jetée and Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker. Alongside with such literary and cinematic tales, drawing theoretical guidance from refuseniks from Henry David Thoreau to Guy Debord, this course investigates how countercultural spaces become-or fail to become-sites of political resistance, and also how dissenting ideologies give rise to countercultural spaces. We ask about the relation between social deviance (the failure to meet social norms, whether willingly or unwittingly) and political resistance, especially in the conditions of late capitalism and neo-colonialism, when countercultural literature, film and music (rock, punk, hip-hop, DIY aesthetics etc.) get absorbed into-and coopted by-the hegemonic socio-economic system. In closing we will also consider contemporary forms of dissidence-from Pussy Riot to Black Lives Matter-that rely both on the vulnerability of individual bodies and global communication networks.

<P>What is a ghost? How and why are ghosts represented in particular forms in a particular culture at particular historical moments and how do these change as stories travel between cultures? This course will explore the complex meanings, both literal and figurative, of ghosts and the fantastic in traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tales, plays, and films . Issues to be explored include: 1) the relationship between the supernatural, gender, and sexuality; 2) the confrontation of death and mortality; 3) collective anxieties over the loss of the historical past 4) and the visualization (and exorcism) of ghosts through performance.

<P>CMST 24606. China's New Documentary Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Since the early 1990s, the &quot;new documentary&quot; has emerged as one of the most prominent phenomena in Chinese film and video, widely circulating at international film festivals and eliciting considerable critical debate. This course examines the styles and functions of China's &quot;new documentary&quot; over the last fifteen years, paying particular attention to the institutional, cultural, economic, and political conditions that underpin its flourishing. This overview will lead us to consider questions that concern the recent explosion of the documentary form worldwide, and to explore the tensions and imbalances that characterize the global circulation of the genre. We will address such issues as: what is &quot;new&quot; about China's recent documentary cinema; the &quot;national&quot; and &quot;transnational&quot; dimensions of documentary filmmaking, and the ways in which these dimensions intersect in its production and circulation; the extent to which the international demand for &quot;unofficial&quot; images from China has contributed to its growth; the politics involved in documentary filmmaking, and the forms and meanings of &quot;independent&quot; cinema in the wake of intensified globalization; the links between Chinese documentary and the global rise of documentary filmmaking, and the ways in which they challenge extant concepts and theorizations of the genre.

<P>CMST 24913. Making Sense of a Moving World: Japanese Cinema Through 1945. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The aim of this course is to explore a variety of filmmaking practices in relation to historical and cultural trends in Japan from the 1910s to the end of the Second World War. While we will watch films of the great auteurs such as Mizoguchi, Ozu, and Naruse, the increasing number of subtitled films and DVDs of prewar Japanese cinema allows for unprecedented access to a wide variety of filmmaking practices. Hence, in addition to auteur films, we will watch old-school period films and adaptations from popular literature, high speed nihilistic action films, socialist &quot;tendency&quot; films, critical documentaries, melodramas, experimental film and animation, and wartime propaganda. Along with the films, we will read writings on film by a range of thinkers and artists to engage with a variety of issues, including gender, realism, modernism, propaganda, human/animal, violence, and mass culture. We will look at the ways cinema, as both a participant in and a unique reflection on modernity, fundamentally transformed the relationship of Japan to the world.

A comparative framework is employed whenever lucrative to comprehend the East/Central European movements in the wider context of the European avant-garde. The course also traces the development and legacy (political and artistic) of these avant-gardes in their contemporary scenes. Plastic, verbal, and performative arts (including film) are studied.

<P>This course examines the nature and creation of suspense in literature and film as an introduction to narrative theory. We will question how and why stories are created, as well as what motivates us to continue reading, watching, and listening to stories. We will explore how particular genres (such as detective stories and thrillers) and the mediums of literature and film influence our understanding of suspense and narrative more broadly. Close readings of primary sources will be supplemented with critical and theoretical readings. Literary readings will include work by John Buchan, Arthur Conan Doyle, Feodor Dostoevsky, Graham Greene, Bohumil Hrabal, and J.M. Coetzee. We will also explore Alfred Hitchcock's take on 39 Steps and the Czech New Wave manifesto film, Pearls of the Deep.

<P>CMST 25514. Symbolism and Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In his 1896 essay on cinema, Russian writer Maxim Gorky described the new medium to &quot;madness or symbolism.&quot; The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was a dominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly) that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and even invisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention to French and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematic medium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and the mystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relates to notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and some American) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage to Andrei Tarkovsky.

<P>The idea of electromechanically transmitted moving images dates back to the nineteenth century and the first technological demonstration of televised moving images took place in the 1920s. While this course touches upon the early history of television, we will focus our attention on the era between the commercialization of television in the United States (in the early 1950s) and the rise of internet-based television via services such as Hulu (in the 2000s). As we will see, the history of television in these years, intersects with numerous other media, such as radio, film, video, digital games, and the novel. Alongside a study of the medium of television and its role in American culture, we will attend carefully to the form of TV narrative as it changes from an early episodic format to the complex long-form serial narratives that attained maturity in the 1990s. Through historical, formal, and cultural analyses, we will attempt to make sense of the recent renaissance of television narrative characterized by such serial programs as The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Mad Men. The course combines theoretical texts with close readings of particular television shows. Requirements include engaged participation in class discussion, weekly blog entries, a mid-term paper, and a substantive final research paper. There will be no exams. Instructor(s): P.

<P>Games are one of the most prominent and influential media of our time. This experimental course explores the emerging genre of &quot;alternate reality&quot; or &quot;transmedia&quot; gaming. Throughout the quarter, we will approach new media theory through the history, aesthetics, and design of transmedia games. These games build on the narrative strategies of novels, the performative role-playing of theater, the branching techniques of electronic literature, the procedural qualities of video games, and the team dynamics of sports. Beyond the subject matter, students will design modules of an Alternate Reality Game in small groups. Students need not have a background in media or technology, but a wide-ranging imagination, interest in new media culture, or arts practice will make for a more exciting quarter.

These directors were singled out at that time by the critics writing for the French journal Cahiers du Cinema as auteurs, directors with a consistent style. Critics in France, England, and the USA used the term mise en scene to discuss their use of framing, performance, editing, and camera movement and especially their use of new technologies such as wide screen and color.

<P>CMST 26500. The Films of Alfred Hitchcock. 100 Units. </P>

<P>No single filmmaker has equaled Alfred Hitchcock's combination of popular success, critical commentary and widespread influence on other filmmakers. Currently, his work is so familiar it threatens to be taken for granted. This course will reveal Hitchcock as the filmmaker who systematically used the stylistics of late silent film to forge a dialectical approach to the so-called Classical Style. Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, yielding a configuration of suspense, sensation and perception. Tracing Hitchcock's career chronologically, we will follow his intertwining of sexual desire and gender politics, and his reshaping of melodrama according to Freudian concepts of repression, memory, interpretation and ab-reaction, as he navigates from silent film to sound and from Great Britain to Hollywood.

<P>CMST 26503. Scandinavian Cinema in the Classic Period (1910-1960) 100 Units. </P>

<P>During the 1910s Scandinavian cinema was among the most popular cinemas in the world. The best directors, actresses, and actors developed a mastery of cinematic expression and screen appearance never seen before in cinema. Erotically charged melodramas and comedies were the most popular genres, but also poetic masterpieces such as The Passion of Joan of Arc are key works from this era. The course will explore the breathtaking appearances of such celebrated female stars as Asta Nielsen and Greta Garbo, and analyze silent masterpieces such as Blom's early science fiction films, the dramas of Christensen, Stiller, Sjostrom, and Dreyer, and the early films of Tancred Ibsen and Ingmar Bergman. All readings are in English. Instructor(s): E. Rossaak Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): PQ: CMST 10100 Introduction to Film or consent of instructor. Equivalent Course(s): CMST 36503 </P>

<P>CMST 26504. Ingmar Bergman: Cinema &amp; Theater. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will focus on cinematographic representations of theatrical and other artistic practices, primarily exemplified by many of Ingmar Bergman's films (e.g. The Seventh Seal and Fanny and Alexander) but also in the work of other film-directors. It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with - during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions - but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts. Interested 3rd and 4th year undergraduates allowed by instructor consent. ATTENDANCE AT FIRST CLASS SESSION IS MANDATORY.

<P>CMST 26601. The Soviet Visual Experience. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Soviet Union was a world in pictures, enabled and shaped by the media revolutions that accompanied every major period in its history, from the rise of cinema to the dawn of the internet. We will try to see communism as history and as promise, and to see how this relates to our own desire for social change in our own worlds. We will examine the interaction between Marxism, state power and image culture by focusing on key moments from the entire lifespan of the USSR (1917-1991) and from across the range of media,from graphic art and film to their reflections in literature and aesthetic theory. In addition to class readings and discussions, we will be able to engage directly with a vast array of material at exhibits of graphic art (three on campus, three more across the city) and film series that will be conducted in fall 2011 as part of the city-wide Soviet Arts Experience.

<P>CMST 26705. Kieslowski: The Decalogue. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this class, we study the monumental series &quot;The Decalogue&quot; by one of the most influential filmmakers from Poland, Krzysztof Kieślowski. Without mechanically relating the films to the Ten Commandments, Kieślowski explores the relevance of the biblical moral rules to the state of modern man forced to make ethical choices. Each part of the series contests the absolutism of moral axioms through narrative twists and reversals in a wide, universalized sphere. An analysis of the films will be accompanied by readings from Kieślowski's own writings and interviews, including criticism by Zizek, Insdorf, and others.

<P>CMST 27110. Digital Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Since the 1970s, movies have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. This course explores a range of issues related to the digitization of cinema's production, distribution, and exhibition, including the cultural contexts and aesthetic practices surrounding these technological shifts as well as their experiential and political dimensions. In particular, we will explore such topics as digital cinematography's relation to cinematic realism, emerging trends in editing practices, the political implications of digital special effects, and the ways that other digital media influence cinematic techniques. Texts discussed include works by Lev Manovich, Stephen Prince, Kristen Whissel, Hito Steyerl, Steven Shaviro, and Vivian Sobchack. Screenings include works by Lana and Lilly Wachowski, Agnes Varda, Bong Joon-Ho, Michael Bay, Brad Bird, and Leos Carax. Equivalent Course(s): MAAD 27110 </P>

<P>CMST 27112. Cinema and Movement. 100 Units. </P>

<P>That movies move Is one of the most basic facts about the medium. This course investigates various aesthetic dimensions of movement throughout the history of the moving image-from early cinema and the avant garde to Hollywood musicals and Disney cartoons. Combining philosophical, critical, and historical readings with careful analysis of films, we will cover topics that include early spectators' fascination with the moving image itself, the relation between the natural perception of movement and cinematic movement, the history and poetics of camera movement, different technologies for recording and simulating movement (including cel animation and CGI), and the problems that movement has posed as an object of aesthetic analysis. Texts discussed include works by Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson, Vivian Sobchack, Kristin Thompson, and Arthur Danto. Screenings include works by Busby Berkeley, Maya Deren, Max Ophuls, Chuck Jones, Chris Marker, Chantal Akerman, and Gus Van Sant. Instructor(s): J. Schonig Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>CMST 27201. Zizek on Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Slavoj Zizek has used film as the great expositor of his theories of ideology, perversion, sexuality, politics, nostalgia, and otherness. In this discussion-heavy course we will watch a lot of film from the directorial subjects of his main discussions (Chaplin, Rossellini, Lynch, Haneke, Kieślowski, Tarkovsky, von Trier, Hitchcock, and others) alongside Zizek's theoretical writings on their film. The course examines why for the man who has been called the &quot;Elvis of cultural theory&quot; film is such a perfect lens through which to examine social situatedness and intersubjective &quot;aporia.&quot; There is no &quot;paperwork&quot; assigned for the course. The course is conducted seminar style and participants are expected to be vocal, prepared, and somewhat ornery. Instructor(s): M. Sternstein Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 18600 </P>

<P>This course will examine influential writings on photography, film, and film narrative published in the postwar period in the context of semiology, structuralism, and narratology. We will examine how questions of form, structure, and narrative in film and photography are addressed by critics writing from the end of World War II until the early seventies, especially in France and Italy. In what ways can the image be considered a sign? How do images come to have meaning in a denotative or connotative sense? What are the principal codes organizing images as narrative media and how do spectators recognise those codes? Readings will include work by Roland Barthes, Christian Metz, Jean Mitry, Noël Burch, Raymond Bellour, Umberto Eco, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and David Bordwell, among others. Instructor(s): D.N.

<P>CMST 27800. Theories of Media. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the concept of media and mediation in very broad terms, looking not only at modern technical media and mass media, but at the very idea of a medium as a means of communication, a set of institutional practices, and a habitat in which images proliferate and take on a &quot;life of their own.&quot; The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the &quot;unmediated&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot;? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of &quot;metapictures&quot; or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become &quot;mixed&quot; in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T.

<P>CMST 27805. Framing, Re-framing, and Un-framing Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible band called film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to new media and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels and reassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the most radical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between the OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving image for more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologies to explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrial forces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use new computer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developed for and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching, analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless of previous programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture.

<P>CMST 27810. Cinema and New Media. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Over the past two decades, new media such as television, computers and the web, digital image production, and video games have begun to transform, and even supplant, the social and cultural prominence of cinema. This course will look at how these media work: the history of their development, the changes they have brought about in a broader media culture, their political implications, and their social status and significance (e.g., the place they occupy in culture, the kinds of interactions they make possible). The focus will equally be on the ways in which cinema has responded to the changing digital landscape, which will be explored through both blockbuster and experimental films as well as video and web-based art. Readings will be taken from the history of film theory, recent work in media history and archeology, and theoretical studies of digital media and technology. Instructor(s): D.

<P>CMST 27915. Introduction to Videogame Studies: Art, Play, and Society. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is intended as an introduction to the study of videogames in the humanities. Topics include videogame form (visual style, spatial design, sound, and genre); videogames as a narrative medium; embodiment and hapticity in videogame play; issues of identity/identification, performance, and access related to gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, ability, and class; and rhetorical, educational, and political uses of videogames. Just as the videogame medium has drawn from older forms of art and play, so the emerging field of videogame studies has grown out of and in conversation with surrounding disciplines. With this in mind, readings and topics of discussion will be drawn both from videogame studies proper and from other fields in the humanities - including, but not limited to, English, art history, and cinema and media studies. Undergraduates should be prepared for an MA-level reading load but will write final papers of the standard length for upper-level undergraduate courses (8-10 pages versus 12-15 for MA students). MA students interested in pursuing a particular research topic in-depth will be given supplemental readings. This course will also be designed to take advantage of the University of Chicago's videogame collection, and will require game play both individually and as part of group play sessions.

<P>Focusing on experimental moving-image approaches at a crucial moment in the emerging medium of virtual reality, this class will explore and interrogate each stage of production for VR. By hacking their way around the barriers and conventions of current software and hardware to create new optical experiences, students will design, construct and deploy new ways of capturing the world with cameras and develop new strategies and interactive logics for placing images into virtual spaces. Underpinning these explorations will be a careful discussion, dissection and reconstruction of techniques found in the emerging VR &quot;canon&quot; that spans new modes of journalism and documentary, computer games, and narrative &quot;VR cinema.&quot; Film production and computer programming experience is welcome but not a prerequisite for the course. Students will be expected to complete short &quot;sketches&quot; of approaches in VR towards a final short VR experience. Equivalent Course(s): MAAD 27920, CMST 37920, ARTV 27920, ARTV 37920 </P>

How does music of different styles and provenance contribute to the semiotic universe of film? And how did film music assume a central voice in twentieth-century culture? We study music composed for films (original scores) as well as pre-existent music (e.g., popular and classical music). The twenty films covered in the course may include classical Hollywood cinema, documentaries, foreign (e.g., non-Western) films, experimental films, musicals, and cartoons. Instructor(s): B.

<P>CMST 28921. Introduction to 16mm Filmmaking. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The goal of this intensive laboratory course is to give its students a working knowledge of film production using the 16mm gauge. The course will emphasize how students can use 16mm technology towards successful cinematography and image design (for use in both analog and digital postproduction scenarios) and how to develop their ideas towards constructing meaning through moving pictures. Through a series of group exercises, students will put their hands on equipment and solve technical and aesthetic problems, learning to operate and care for the 16mm Bolex film camera; prime lenses; Sekonic light meter; Sachtler tripod; and Arri light kit and accessories. For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the class will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots and lectures. As the semester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns and issues that arise in the production of the final projects.

<P>This course will examine the relationship between moving images, particularly motion-picture films, and the human sciences, broadly construed, from the early days of cinema to the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It will use primary source documents alongside screenings to allow students to study what the moving image meant to researchers wishing to develop knowledge of mind and behavior, and what they thought film could do that still photography and unmediated human observation could not. The kinds of motion pictures we will study will vary widely, from infant development studies to psychiatric films, from documentaries to research films, and from films made by scientists or clinicians as part of their laboratory or therapeutic work to experimental films made by seasoned filmmakers. We will explore how people used the recordings they made in their own studies, in communications with other scientists, and for didactic and other purposes. We will also discuss how researchers' claims about mental processes-perception, memory, consciousness, and interpersonal influence-drew on their understandings of particular technologies.

<P>Programs of Study </P>

<P>The BA degree in Classical Studies allows students to explore Greek and Roman antiquity in a variety of ways and provides excellent preparation for careers that require strong skills in interpretation and writing, such as teaching, scholarly research, law, and publishing, and in the humanities in general. Students may choose from the following three variants based on their preparation, interests, and goals: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The Language and Literature Variant combines the study of Greek and Latin texts with coverage of diverse areas, including art and archaeology, history, philosophy, religion, and science. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>The Language Intensive Variant focuses on languages with the aim of reading a larger selection of texts in the original languages; it is designed especially for those who wish to pursue graduate studies in classics. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>The Greek and Roman Cultures Variant emphasizes courses in art and archaeology, history, material culture, and texts in translation. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Classical Studies. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Language and Literature Variant </P>

<P>The Language and Literature variant combines the study of Greek and Latin texts with coverage of diverse areas, including art and archaeology, history, philosophy, religion, and science. It allows students to focus their language study exclusively on Greek or on Latin, or they may study both languages with an emphasis on one or the other. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Six courses (or the equivalent) in Greek and/or Latin, including the intermediate level (20100-20200-20300) or above in at least one of those languages. The program assumes that, in addition to the requirements for the major, students have completed or have credit for an initial year of language study in either Latin or Greek. Beginning-level courses may count in the major only if the student has already taken an intermediate (or higher) sequence in the other language. Examples of ways to satisfy the language requirement include: LATN 20100-20200-20300 Intermediate Latin I-II-III AND LATN 21100 Roman Elegy-LATN 21200 Roman Novel-LATN 21300 Vergil; OR LATN 20100-20200-20300 Intermediate Latin I-II-III AND GREK 10100-10200-10300 Introduction to Attic Greek I-II-III </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Six courses in Greek or Roman art, history, philosophy, religion, science, material culture, or classical literature in translation, with courses divided between at least two of those fields and with approval of the director of undergraduate studies. Any course that carries a Classical Civilization listing, or a Classics listing between 30100 and 39000, meets this requirement. Other eligible courses are offered in disciplines such as Art History, Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities, Philosophy, and Political Science. These courses should be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>By the end of the Spring Quarter of their third year, students are required to submit to the director of undergraduate studies a research skills paper of around 10–12 pages as a Word or PDF file in an email attachment. The paper, which will normally substitute for a final paper in a Greek (above 20300), Latin (above 20300), Classical Civilization, or Classics course, is designed to prepare students for the BA paper. Students will be expected to develop a reasoned argument on a particular topic, based not only on primary materials (ancient literary texts; material culture; etc.) but also on research of relevant secondary bibliography. Students should declare at the start of the quarter if they wish to take a certain course in conjunction with the research skills paper and should work closely throughout the quarter with the faculty instructor, who must approve the paper as satisfying the requirement. </LBody>

<P>The program assumes that, in addition to requirements for the major, students have met the general education requirement in civilization studies by taking two or three courses in a sequence related to the Ancient Mediterranean World: HIST 16700-16800-16900 Ancient Mediterranean World I-II-III; Rome: Antiquity to the Baroque sequence (taught in Rome); or Athens: Greek Antiquity and Its Legacy sequence (taught in Athens). Students who have met the general education requirement in civilization studies with a different sequence should complete one of these three sequences, which may then count toward the nine courses in classical civilization required for the major. </P>

<P>BA Paper Seminar and BA Paper </P>

<P>Candidates for the BA degree in all variants of the Classical Studies major are required to write a substantial BA paper. The purpose of the BA paper is to enable students to improve their research and writing skills and to give them an opportunity to focus their knowledge of the field upon an issue of their own choosing. </P>

<P>In their third year, by Monday of eighth week of Spring Quarter, students must submit to the director of undergraduate studies a short statement proposing an area of research. The statement should include an abstract of a paragraph or more, outlining the problem that you wish to tackle and sketching the argument you hope to elaborate in response. You can, if you wish, discuss questions of method or earlier scholarship. You should make reference here with as much specificity as possible to the primary sources on which you will draw to substantiate your claim. </P>

<P>The statement must be approved in writing by a member of the Classics faculty who agrees to be the director of the BA paper. In certain cases, students may have two co-chairs, including one member of the Classics faculty and one faculty member from another department. Classics faculty at the level of associate professor and above may advise up to three BA papers, while assistant professors may advise as many as two papers. Students needing assistance in finding a faculty member with whom to work should consult with the director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<P>Students may register for CLCV 29800 BA Paper Seminar in either Autumn or Winter Quarter of their fourth year, but they are expected to participate in seminar meetings throughout both quarters. The focus of the seminar is to discuss research problems and compose preliminary drafts of their BA papers. Participants in the regular seminar meetings are expected to exchange criticism and ideas with each other and with the preceptor, as well as to take account of comments from their faculty readers. The grade for the BA Paper Seminar is identical to the grade for the BA paper and, therefore, is not reported to the Registrar until the paper has been submitted in Spring Quarter. The grade for the BA paper depends on participation in the seminar as well as on the quality of the paper. At the end of Autumn Quarter, a provisional grade will be assigned by the preceptor and communicated to the student via the director of undergraduate studies. Once the BA paper has been submitted, the final grade will be determined jointly by the preceptor and faculty director. </P>

<P>The deadline for submitting the BA paper in final form is Friday of third week of Spring Quarter. This deadline represents the formal submission, which is final; students should expect to submit and defend substantial drafts much earlier. Both hard copies and digital copies are to be submitted to the faculty director, seminar preceptor, and director of undergraduate studies, unless otherwise indicated. Students who fail to meet the deadline may not be able to graduate in that quarter and will not be eligible for honors consideration. </P>

<P>Students who undertake a double major may meet the requirement for a BA paper in Classical Studies by making it part of a single BA paper that is designed to meet the requirements of both majors. This combined paper must have a substantial focus on texts or issues of the classical period, and must have a Classics faculty </P>

<P>member as a reader. CLCV 29800 BA Paper Seminar (the two-quarter BA Paper Seminar) is required of all students majoring in Classical Studies, whether as a double major or as a single major. The use of a single essay to meet the requirement for a BA paper in two majors requires approval from directors of undergraduate studies in both majors. A consent form, to be signed by the directors of undergraduate studies, is available from the College advisers. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All courses taken to meet requirements in the major or minor must be taken for quality grades. </P>

<P>The first-year sequences in Greek and Latin (GREK 10100-10200-10300 Introduction to Attic Greek I-IIIII and LATN 10100-10200-10300 Introduction to Classical Latin I-II-III) and the courses in Greek and Latin composition (GREK 34400 Greek Prose Composition and LATN 34400 Latin Prose Composition) are open for P/F grading for students not using these courses to meet language requirements for the major. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To be recommended for honors, a student (1) must maintain an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and a GPA of </P>

<P>3.5 or higher in the major and (2) must also demonstrate superior ability in the BA paper to interpret Greek or Latin source material and to develop a coherent argument. For a student to be recommended for honors, the BA paper must be judged worthy of honors by the faculty director, preceptor, and an additional faculty committee. Before the end of the Winter Quarter, the director of undergraduate studies will consult with both the faculty director and the BA preceptor to ascertain which students in the BA Seminar are likely to be nominated for honors and which papers will be forwarded to the faculty committee. </P>

<P>Minor Program in Classical Studies </P>

<P>The minor in Classical Studies requires a total of seven courses in Greek, Latin, or classical civilization. Students may choose one of two variants: a language variant that includes three courses at the 20000 level or higher in one language, or a classical civilization variant. </P>

<P>Students must meet with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Students choose courses in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. The director’s approval for the minor program should be submitted to a student’s College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser. </P>

<P>CLCV courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student’s major(s) or with other minors and (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be courses completed at the University of Chicago. </P>

<P>The following groups of courses would comprise a minor in the areas indicated. Other programs may be designed in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Minor program requirements are subject to revision. </P>

<P>Prizes and Grants </P>

<P>The Arthur Adkins Summer Research Fellowship is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The fellowship is targeted to third-year undergraduates who are bound for graduate school, and it provides means and opportunity for the writing of a superior research paper on any aspect of the ancient world from the Bronze Age through Late Antiquity. It may be used for travel to classical sites and collections or to other research centers, and/or for living expenses during a summer devoted to research between the third and fourth year. Applicants must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, a statement (2–3 pages) outlining their project and its relationship to existing knowledge in the field, a plan of research together with a provisional budget for the summer, and a letter from a faculty supervisor. A written report of what was accomplished during the period of the fellowship must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>This fellowship is not limited to Classical Studies majors and minors, or even to students of Greek and Latin, and although it may be used for research abroad, it does not require such research. But it does require that a student have a well-developed research project by the time of application. </P>

<P>The David Grene Fellowship is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The fellowship is targeted to undergraduates whose intellectual interests in the classical world have led them to an area of knowledge which they are unable to pursue during the regular academic year, and it allows them an opportunity to explore that interest through independent study during the summer before graduation. The independent study may involve training in a new discipline such as paleography or numismatics, first-hand experience of ancient sites and artifacts, or ancillary language study. It may be carried out under the auspices of an organized program like the American School of Classical Studies at Athens or the American Academy in Rome, or it may be tailored entirely according to the student's own plan. Applicants must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, project statement (2–3 pages), a provisional budget, and a faculty letter of recommendation. A written report of what was accomplished during the period of the fellowship must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>This fellowship is not limited to Classical Studies majors and minors, or even to students of Greek and Latin, and it need not directly involve the study of classics, but applicants must be able to demonstrate a background of interest in the classical world. </P>

<P>The Pausanias Summer Research Fellowship is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The fellowship provides support to an undergraduate student in Classical Studies for research abroad in sites of interest for classical studies. It may be used to pursue a project of the student's own design or to participate in appropriate institutional programs abroad. Applicants must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, project statement (2–3 pages), provisional budget, and a faculty letter of recommendation. A written report of what was accomplished during the period of the fellowship must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>This fellowship is limited to Classical Studies majors and minors. </P>

<P>The John G. Hawthorne Travel Prize is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The prize is given to an outstanding undergraduate student of classical languages, literature, or civilization for travel to Greece or Italy or for study of classical materials in other countries. It may be used to pursue a project of the student's own design or to participate in appropriate programs conducted in Greece or Italy. Applicants must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, project statement (2–3 pages), provisional budget, and a faculty letter of recommendation. A written report of what was accomplished during the period of the prize must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>This prize is open to any student who has taken a GREK, LATN, or CLCV course in the College, and may be used for travel in Greece and/or Italy, or for classics-related study there or in other appropriate locations. </P>

<P>The Leon Golden Undergraduate Research Fellowship is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The fellowship is intended to enable undergraduates majoring in Classical Studies to develop an original research project in the field or to pursue training in ancillary studies that will enrich their work in classics. Applicants </P>

<P>must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, a statement (2–3 pages) outlining their project together with a provisional budget, and a letter from a faculty supervisor. A written report of what was accomplished during the period of the fellowship must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>This fellowship is limited to Classical Studies majors, and it requires that a student have a well-developed project by the time of application. </P>

<P>The Nancy P. Helmbold Travel Award is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. It is awarded to an outstanding undergraduate student of Greek and/or Latin for travel to Greece or Italy. Applicants must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, an itinerary or project statement (2–3 pages), proposed budget, and a faculty letter of recommendation. A written report of what was accomplished during the period of the award must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>This award requires a student to have taken a GREK or LATN course (not merely a CLCV course) in the College. It may or may not be used for study or research, but it must be used in Greece and/or Italy. </P>

<P>The Paul Shorey Foreign Travel Grant is expected to be worth $3,000 this year. The grant is given to a student of Greek or Latin who has been accepted to participate in the Athens Program or the Rome Program of the College, and it is to be used to defray costs incurred in the program. The terms of the grant stipulate that it is to be awarded to a &quot;needy and deserving&quot; student. Students who have been accepted into one of the programs and who wish to be considered for the Shorey grant are invited to submit statements explaining their need in the first week of Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>The Classics Prize is a cash award of $500 made annually to the student who graduates with the best record of achievement in the Classical Studies major. </P>

<P>Examples of past successful application statements for the summer awards are available from the undergraduate prize coordinator, Peter White, (https://classics.uchicago.edu/faculty/white) or the director of undergraduate studies, Sofia Torallas Tovar (https://classics.uchicago.edu/faculty/tovar). </P>

<P>Offered through the Society for Classical Studies (SCS): </P>

<P>The Lionel Pearson Fellowship seeks to contribute to the training of American and Canadian classicists by providing for a period of study at an English or Scottish university. The competition is open to students majoring in Classics, or closely related fields. Fellows must undertake a course of study that broadens and develops their knowledge of Greek and Latin literature in the original languages; candidates should therefore have a strong background in the classical languages. Normally, the recipient will hold the fellowship in the academic year immediately after graduating with a bachelor’s degree. The term of the fellowship is one year. The recipient may use the fellowship for part of a longer program of study, but under no circumstances will support from the fellowship extend beyond one year. Fellows are responsible for seeking and obtaining admission to the English or Scottish university where they intend to study. </P>

<P>The maximum amount of the fellowship will be $24,000, which may be used to offset academic fees, travel expenses, housing and subsistence costs, and book purchases. The fellowship amount ($24,000) is the maximum that the SCS can award, but the Faculties of Classics of both Oxford and Cambridge Universities have generously offered to support the tuition expenses of any Pearson Fellow enrolled at their institution. In these instances funds provided by the SCS should be adequate to offset the fellow’s other expenses, and the SCS will attempt (but it cannot guarantee) to obtain a similar accommodation from another institution in the UK should the fellow attend a university other than Oxford or Cambridge. Note: The SCS cannot guarantee tuition support from other Faculties at Oxford and Cambridge (such as Philosophy or History). Students should be aware that if they can pursue their preferred course of study under the rubric of Classics, it would be to their advantage. </P>

<P>Candidates for the fellowship require nomination by the director of undergraduate studies by the end of the Spring Quarter for a rising fourth-year student. The Department of Classics may only nominate one student, and therefore requests that interested students submit the following materials by Friday of eighth week in the Spring Quarter of their third year: </P>

<P>CLCV 14113. Introduction to Roman Art and Archaeology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course offers a survey of the art and archaeology of the Roman world from the founding of Rome in the eighth century BC to the Christianization of the Empire in the fourth century AD. Students will witness the transformation of Rome from a humble village of huts surrounded by marshland in central Italy into the centripetal force of a powerful Empire that spanned mind-bogglingly distant reaches of space and time. Throughout the course, we will consider how the built environments and artifacts produced by an incredible diversity of peoples and places can make visible larger trends of historical, political, and cultural change. What, we will begin and end by asking, is Roman about Roman art? Instructor(s): P. Crowley Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 14105 </P>

<P>CLCV 15000. Myth and Its Critics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Myth is essential to how humans make sense of the world: our foundational stories explain the nature of the world; they justify and explore social and sexual difference; they teach and test the limits of human agency. The course will survey contexts and uses of myth-making in the ancient Mediterranean world. We will also explore the many traditions of critique and anxiety about myth-making, among philosophers, literary critics and religious authorities. Instructor(s): C. Ando Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): HIST 17000, SIGN 26037 </P>

<P>CLCV 20118. Changing, Resting, Living: Aristotle's Natural Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How can many things be one thing? Aristotle's answer to this question treats living things--plants and animals-as the paradigm cases of unified multiplicities. In this course, we will investigate how such things are held together and what makes it possible for them to change over time. Readings will be from Aristotle's Physics, Metaphysics, De Anima, Parts of Animals, On Generation and Corruption, and De Motu Animalium. (B) Instructor(s): A. Callard Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Students who are not enrolled by the start of term but wish to enroll must (a) email the instructor before the course begins and (b) attend the first class.

<P>CLCV 20216. Egypt in Late Antiquity. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Egypt in Late Antiquity was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and religions. With the native Egyptians subject to a series of foreign masters (Greek and Roman), each with their own languages and religious practices, Egyptian society was marked by a rich and richly documented diversity. In this course we will pay special attention to the contact of languages and of religions, discussing on the basis of primary sources in translation different aspects characteristic of this period: the crises of the Roman Empire and their effects in Egypt, the emergence of Christianity and the decline of paganism, the development of monastic communities. The course will end at the Islamic conquest. Equivalent Course(s): NEHC 20287, CLAS 35716, HREL 30287, NEHC 30287 </P>

<P>CLCV 20400. Who Were the Greeks? 100 Units. </P>

<P>If the current resurgence of interest in ethnic studies is a direct reflection of a contemporary upsurge in ethnic conflict throughout the world, it remains the case that notions of peoplehood and belonging have been of periodic importance throughout history. This course will study the various expressions of Greek identity within shifting political, social, and cultural contexts from prehistory to the present day, though with a strong emphasis on classical antiquity. Particular attention will be given to theoretical issues such as anthropological definitions of ethnicity, the difference between ethnic and cultural identities, methods for studying ethnicity in historical societies, and the intersection of ethnicity with politics.

<P>CLCV 21717. Sophocles, Ajax. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A close literary and philological analysis of one of the most remarkable and perplexing of all Greek tragedies. We will consider the play's portrayal of the nature and limits of one form of male heroism against the background of earlier poetry and contemporary history; and we will attempt constantly for elate philological and literary approaches to one another in order to understand better not only Sophocles' play but also the strengths and limitations of the ways in which scholars try to come closer to it.

<P>CLCV 21718. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle on Courage. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is courage? Is it: doing what you should do, even when you are afraid? Can you be courageous without being afraid? Can you be couragoues and know that you are doing the right thing? Can you be courageous if you are not in fact doing the right thing? Can you have precisely the correct amount of fear and still fail to be courageous? Could you be courageous if you weren't afraid to die? Courage is, arguably, the queen of the virtues. In this class, we will use some Socratic dialogues (Laches, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedo) and some Aristotelian treatises (Nicomachean Ethics, Eudemian Ethics) as partners in inquiry into the answers to the questions listed above.

<P>This course examines the art and archaeology of ancient Greece from ca. 1000 BCE - ca. 200 BCE. Participants will learn a lot of facts about the Greek world; they will see the Greeks emerge from poverty and anarchy to form a distinctive political and social system based on city-states, and they will see that system grow unstable and collapse. They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design many of which are still in use today. Along with these facts, they will acquire a conceptual toolkit for looking at works of art and for thinking about the relation of art to social life. Instructor(s): S.

<P>CLCV 22115. Carolingian Renaissance. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Carolingian Renaissance flowered thanks to the leadership of a new royal (AD 751) and then (from Christmas 800) imperial dynasty. Expansive political and cultural initiatives reshaped Europe into a distinct space, not least, though paradoxically, through its fragmentation after AD 843. We shall study the actors and trends at play, the important role of Classical models and Latin book culture, and consider the relevant sources in all their physical, textual, and imaginative variety.

<P>CLCV 22514. Markets and Moral Economies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the ways in which economic behavior in the Roman Empire was informed by, and itself came to inform, social and religious mores and practices. We will explore the interrelationship between culture and economy from the accession of Augustus to late antiquity and the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Particular attention will be given to Roman attitudes towards labor, the ethical issues surrounding buying and selling, and alternative allocative mechanisms to the market. Of constant concern will be the tension between the perspectives and prejudices of elites, which stand behind so much surviving literary evidence, and the realities of everyday commerce and economic life as they can be glimpsed in the archaeological and epigraphic record. Instructor(s): L. Gardnier Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): CLAS 32514 </P>

<P>CLCV 22518. Humor in Antiquity. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Satire, spoof, social comedy-much of what we think of as funny today was also funny to the Greeks and Romans. In this course we will look at highlights of Greco-Roman humorous writing, with a special focus on dramatic comedy (Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, Terence) and on satire (Horace, Persius, Juvenal). We will also look at some more recondite gems, including Lucian's comic essays and the cheeky biographies of the Roman emperors. Topics include the way that comedy comments on power and society, and the way that comic tropes persist or differ across time and genre. Instructor(s): A. Horne Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>CLCV 22700. Ancient Philos/Hist Philos-1. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An examination of ancient Greek philosophical texts that are foundational for Western philosophy, especially the work of Plato and Aristotle.

<P>CLCV 22718. Sports and Leisure in the Ancient World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>For many of the ancients, leisure was more than a pastime: it was the most serious business of life. This course examines Greco-Roman reflections on athletics-the games-alongside philosophical discussions of leisure. Our goal is to study a wide range of perspectives on the use of non-work time, from the flippant (Ovid) to the deathly serious (Pindar, Aristotle). The unifying theme is that, for almost every figure we study, leisure is not only more important than work, but requires deeper reflection to do well. Ancient readings will be supplemented by selections from modern writers on leisure. Instructor(s): A. Horne Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>CLCV 22914. The Italian Renaissance. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Florence, Rome, and the Italian city-states in the age of plagues and cathedrals, Dante and Machiavelli, Medici and Borgia (1250-1600), with a focus on literature and primary sources, the recovery of lost texts and technologies of the ancient world, and the role of the Church in Renaissance culture and politics. Humanism, patronage, translation, cultural immersion, dynastic and papal politics, corruption, assassination, art, music, magic, censorship, religion, education, science, heresy, and the roots of the Reformation.

<P>CLCV 22917. How to Build a Global Empire. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Empire is arguably the oldest, most durable, and most diffused form of governance in human history that reached its zenith with the global empires of Spain, Portugal and Britain. But how do you build a global empire? What political, social, economic, and cultural factors contribute to their formation and longevity? What effects do they have on the colonizer and the colonized? What is the difference between a state, an empire, and a &quot;global" empire? We will consider these questions and more in case studies that will treat the global empires of Rome, Portugal, and Britain, concluding with a discussion of the modern resonances of this first &quot;Age of Empires."

<P>CLCV 23400. Boethius: Consolation of Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Consolation of Philosophy, which Boethius wrote in prison after a life of study and public service, offers a view on Roman politics and culture after Rome ceased to be an imperial capital. The Consolation is also a poignant testament from a man divided between Christianity and philosophy. About 70 pages of the text are read in Latin, and all of it in English. Secondary readings provide historical and religious context for the early sixth century AD.

<P>This course will focus on nine of Aristophanes' plays in translation (Acharnians; Wasps; Clouds; Peace; Birds; Lysistrata; Thesmophoriazousai; Frogs; and Ploutos) in order to determine the value Old Comedy possesses for reconstructing sociohistorical structures, norms, expectations, and concerns. Among the topics to be addressed are the performative, ritual, and political contexts of Attic comedy, the constituency of audiences, the relationship of comedy to satire, the use of dramatic stereotypes, freedom of speech, and the limits of dissent.

<P>CLCV 24017. The Spartan Divergence. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sparta was a Greek city, but of what type? The ancient tradition, or at least the larger part of it, paints the portrait of an ideal city-state. The city was supposed to be stable and moderately prosperous. Its citizens were allegedly models of virtue. For many centuries the city did not experience revolutions and its army was invincible on the battlefield. This success was attributed to its perfect institutions. Following the track opened by Ollier's Spartan Mirage, modern scholarship has scrupulously and successfully deconstructed this image of an ideal city. But what do we find if we go beyond the looking glass? Was Sparta really a city &quot;like all the others&quot;? This class will show that we must go deeper into our evidence in order to make sense of the extraordinary success followed by the brutal collapse of this very special city-state.

<P>CLCV 24116. History of Skepticism, Pre-socratic Greece to Enlightenment. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Doubt has been a fundamental tool from the foundations of Western philosophy, used by radicals and orthodox thinkers, skeptics and system-builders, theologians and scientists. Philosophical skepticism and its evolving palette of intellectual tools shaped the ancient philosophical schools of Greece and Rome, the solidification of early Christian doctrine, the scholastic debates of the later Middle Ages, the neoclassical explosions of the Renaissance, the &quot;new philosophy&quot; of the seventeenth century, the radical projects of the Enlightenment, and the advent of the modern scientific method. This course reviews the history of systematic philosophical doubt, focusing on primary source readings from Sextus Empiricus and Cicero to William of Ockham and the Averroist controversies, to Montaigne, Descartes, Bacon, and Diderot. Undergraduate writing assignments focus on polishing advanced writing ability through short assignments targeting concision, critical thinking, and journalistic writing skills with creative elements. Enrolled graduate students will be invited to additional graduate-only discussions and have supplementary assignments, including secondary source and historiographical readings and self-designed customized research papers. Both undergraduates and graduate students from outside the Department of History are welcome. Instructor(s): A.

<P>CLCV 24118. Coptic Bible. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Coptic versions of the Bible present one of the earliest translations of Christian scripture as the new religion spread. Understanding how the Bible (canonical and non-canonical) was read and used in Egypt at this early stage implies studying the development of Christian communities in those agitated times, as well as paying attention to questions of literacy and linguistic environment, book production, Bible (both Greek and Coptic) on papyrus, and translation and interpretation in Antiquity. The course will draw on materials assembled from my work on the critical edition of the Gospel of Mark, but will also look into other materials like the Coptic Old Testament, and non-canonical scriptures such as Nag Hammadi and the Gnostic scriptures. No previous knowledge of Coptic is required. A brief introduction to the Coptic language will be part of the class, and parallel sessions of additional language instruction will be planned for those who are interested in learning more.

<P>This course studies the interplay between warfare and the political, social, and economic structures of the ancient Mediterranean world. We explore such topics as the motivations for and ideology of armed conflict, the relationship between military organization and civic structure, and the impact of hegemonic and imperial expansion on both the conquerors and the conquered. Readings incorporate foundational modern perspectives, but they emphasize ancient sources in translation. Instructor(s): C.

<P>CLCV 24818. The Body and Embodiment in Ancient Greek Art. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Whether naked or clothed, male or female, mortal or divine, the body takes pride of place in the visual worlds constructed by ancient Greek artists. Yet this emphasis on depicting the body begs the question: What is a body that exists as an image? What, in other words, is a body that is not embodied? This problem, articulated already in our ancient sources, serves as the starting point for this course's investigation of the relationship between images of the body in Greek art and the experiences such images solicited from their viewers. It examines, on the one hand, how Greek art promoted the body as a social construct--through artistic practices that configured the body's appearance, like distinctive techniques, styles, and iconography; through conceptual categories that ascribed identities, like gender, class, and race; and through contexts that integrated depictions of the body into lived experience, like sanctuaries, cemeteries, and domestic settings. But we will give equal attention to the viewer's subjective experience of embodiment, including its sensorial and affective dimensions, and the ways in which that experience is negotiated and articulated as a function of works of art. Finally, we will turn to the legacy of the Greek body in more recent centuries and consider its enduring impact as a visual paradigm today. Instructor(s): S.

<P>CLCV 24918. Early Traveling Writing: Pausanias in Roman Greece. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Through a close reading of Pausanias, who wrote his Description of Greece during the Roman imperial period, this course explores ancient forms of travel writing and associated interests in the places, peoples, myths, ruins, and material objects of the Mediterranean world. Moving from the apparent ethnographic lens of earlier Greek literature to Roman imperialist expeditions, readings and discussions will examine the sociopolitical contexts out of which Pausanias emerged as a literary author, and his legacies in and relationship to the wide array of genres of modern travel writing, from Lewis and Clark to John Steinbeck. Key topics will include: movement through space, tourism, nature, landscape, town and country, sites and spectacles, myth, ritual, and acts of remembering and forgetting. Instructor(s): C.

<P>CLCV 25117. Philo of Alexandria. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will read the Greek text of Philo's de opificio mundi, with other brief excerpts here and there in the Philonic corpus. Our aim will be to use this treatise to elucidate the thought and character of one of the most prolific theological writers of the first century. We will seek to understand Philo as a Greek author and the nature and origins of his style, Philo as a proponent of Platonism, and Philo as a Jew in the context of Alexandrian Judaism. We will also examine his use of the allegorical method as an exegetical tool, and its implications for pagan, Jewish and early Christian approaches to sacred texts.

<P>CLCV 25218. Mediterranean Islands: Odd and Insular Histories. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Islands, and Mediterranean islands in particular, have long provoked curiosity and intrigue, and have persisted as places for thinking about utopia, incongruity, distinctiveness, or backwardness since antiquity. This course interrogates the representations of islands in ancient thought as well as their own archaeological and historical records in order to trace their often elliptical categorization in modern scholarship. Are islands unique because they are isolated, or rather because they become crossroads of interaction? From the mythical island of the Cyclopes, to the Aegean archipelagos, to the large masses like Sicily or Cyprus, discussions will explore approaches to insularity, isolation, connectivity, and identity using a wide range of textual and material evidence and theoretical insights from geography, anthropology, history, literature, and environmental science.

<P>CLCV 25417. Censorship from the Inquisition to the Present. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Collaborative research seminar on the history of censorship and information control, with a focus on the history of books and information technologies. The class will meet in Special Collections, and students will work with the professor to prepare an exhibit, The History of Censorship, to be held in the Special Collections exhibit space in the spring. Students will work with rare books and archival materials, design exhibit cases, write exhibit labels, and contribute to the exhibit catalog. Half the course will focus on censorship in early modern Europe, including the Inquisition, the spread of the printing press, and clandestine literature in the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Special focus on the effects of censorship on classical literature, both newly rediscovered works like Lucretius and lost books of Plato, and authors like Pliny the Elder and Seneca who had been available in the Middle Ages but became newly controversial in the Renaissance. The other half of the course will look at modern and contemporary censorship issues, from wartime censorship, to the censorship of comic books, to digital-rights management, to free speech on our own campus. Students may choose whether to focus their own research and exhibit cases on classical, early modern, modern, or contemporary censorship. This course is part of the College Course Cluster, The Renaissance.

<P>CLCV 25818. Stoic Ethics Through Roman Eyes. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The major ideas of the Stoic school about virtue, appropriate action, emotion, and how to live in harmony with the rational structure of the universe are preserved in Greek only in fragmentary texts and incomplete summaries. But the Roman philosophers give us much more, and we will study closely a group of key texts from Cicero and Seneca, including Cicero's De Finibus book III, his Tusculan Disputations book IV, a group of Seneca's letters, and, finally, a short extract from Cicero's De Officiis, to get a sense of Stoic political thought. For fun we will also read a few letters of Cicero's where he makes it clear that he is unable to follow the Stoics in the crises of his own life. We will try to understand why Stoicism had such deep and wide influence at Rome, influencing statesmen, poets, and many others, and becoming so to speak the religion of the Roman world.

<P>CLCV 26011. Ancient Views of the Economy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The ancient economy is a topic that for a long period had fallen into neglect. But for a few years it has experienced an exceptional revival in the field of ancient studies. This is why it is time to revisit classical authors and examine what they can tell us on the economic world they were living in. Starting with Herodotus, moving on with Thucydides, Ps-Iamblichus, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, Livy and Cicero, this course will provide a general outlook of what the writers of the Classical and Hellenistic period (for Greece) or Republican period (for Rome) can teach us on the topic. It will show certain continuities between some of them but will also be explicit on the vivid debates that could oppose others. Beyond the economic paradigm, it will also provide a new approach to a series of ancient authors. Instructor(s): A. Bresson Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CLAS 36011 </P>

<P>CLCV 26017. Gods and God in Imperial Asia Minor (1-300 CE) 100 Units. </P>

<P>Roman Asia Minor in the Imperial period provides an extraordinary case of religious plurality and creativity. Pagans, Jews, Christians, even already Christian heretics, interacted in the same space. The frontiers between Jewish and Christian communities were, at least at the beginning, more fluid than was long thought. But even the frontiers between paganism and Judaism or Christianity were certainly not as rigid as was later imagined. This does not mean, however, that there were no tensions between the various groups. This class will examine the various aspects of this religious diversity as well as the social and political factors that may explain the religious equilibrium prevailing at that time in Asia Minor.

<P>This course will examine some of the Greco-Roman roots of early Christianity. We will focus on affinities between Christianity and the classical tradition as well as ways in which the Christian faith may be considered radically different. Some of the more important issues that we will analyze are: 1. &quot;The spell of Homer.&quot; How the Homeric poems exerted immeasurable influence on the religious attitudes and practices of the Greeks. 2. The theme of creation in Greek and Roman authors such as Hesiod and Ovid. The Orphic account of human origins. The Early Christian theme of Christ as creator/savior. 3. Greek and Roman conceptions of the afterlife. The response to the Homeric orientation in the form of the great mystery cults of Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The views of the philosophers (esp. Plato). The New Testament conception of resurrection. 4. Greek and Roman conceptions of sacrifice, the crucifixion of Christ as archetypal sacrifice and early Christian reflection upon it. 5.

<P>This course provides an introduction to aspects of women's lives in the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean: primarily Greece and Rome, but drawing occasionally on examples also from the Near East and Egypt. We will examine not only what women actually did and did not do in these societies, but also how they were perceived by their male contemporaries and what value to society they were believed to have. The course will focus on how women are reflected in the material and visual cultures, but it will also incorporate historical and literary evidence, as well. Through such a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, we will examine the complexities and ambiguities of women's lives in the ancient Mediterranean and begin to understand the roots of modern conceptions and perceptions of women in the Western world today.

<P>Cities have been features in human landscapes for nearly six thousand years. This course will explore how cities became such a dominant feature of settlement patterns in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, ca. 4,000 BCE-350 CE. Was there an &quot;Urban Revolution,&quot; and how did it start? What various physical forms did cities assume, and why did cities physically differ (or not) from each other? What functions did cities have in different cultures of the past, and what cultural value did &quot;urban&quot; life have? How do past perspectives on cities compare with contemporary ones? Working thematically and using theoretical and comparative approaches, this course will address various aspects of ancient urban space and its occupation, with each topic backed up by in-depth analysis of concrete case studies.

<P>GREK 22515. Greek Historians: Thucydides. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will read book 1 of Thucydides, his description of the run-up to the Peloponnesian War, in Greek. We will pay attention to Thucydides' style and approach to historiography, sinking our teeth into this difficult but endlessly fascinating text. Instructor(s): D. Martinez Terms Offered: Autumn. Will be offered 2020-21 Prerequisite(s): At least two years of Greek. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 22517, GREK 32515 </P>

<P>GREK 24600. Philo of Alexandria. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will read the Greek text of Philo's de opificio mundi, with other brief excerpts here and there in the Philonic corpus. Our aim will be to use this treatise to elucidate the thought and character of one of the most prolific theological writers of the first century. We will seek to understand Philo as a Greek author and the nature and origins of his style, Philo as a proponent of Platonism, and Philo as a Jew in the context of Alexandrian Judaism. We will also examine his use of the allegorical method as an exegetical tool, and its implications for pagan, Jewish and early Christian approaches to sacred texts. Equivalent Course(s): BIBL 44500, GREK 34600 </P>

<P>GREK 24718. Longinus' On the Sublime. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Composed around the first or second century C.E., Longinus' On the Sublime marks a new direction in ancient aesthetics and later had a profound influence on the aesthetics of the Romantic period and afterward. It was a watershed between viewing art as imitation and viewing it as self-expression. Great literature was now seen as producing ecstasy, not instruction; and the hearer was thought to share in the creativity of the author. We will read most of this text in Greek, with a view to understanding what is so innovative about it. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): 2 years of Greek Equivalent Course(s): GREK 34718, FNDL 24718 </P>

<P>GREK 25116. Reading Greek Literature in the Papyri. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The earliest--and often the only--witnesses for Greek literary works are the papyri. This makes their testimony of great importance for literary history and interpretation, but that testimony does not come without problems. In this course we will cover some of the concepts and techniques needed to recover the literary treasure contained in this highly complex material: from the history of book forms, the textual tradition of literary works, and the creation of the canons to more philological aspects such as editorial practice, Textkritik, and paleography. Our literary corpus will include biblical texts, paraliterary (school and magical) texts, and translations of Egyptian texts into Greek. We will work with photographs of the papyri, and every part of the course will be based on practice. As appropriate we will also work with the University of Chicago's collections of papyri. Prerequisite(s): at least two years of Greek Equivalent Course(s): GREK 35116, BIBL 36916, HCHR 36916 </P>

<P>GREK 26517. Indo-European Linguistic Paleontology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Linguistic paleontology is a method of inspecting reconstructed linguistic data (including early lexical borrowings) in order to derive information about the original geographical location (&quot;homeland&quot;), natural environment (terrain, flora, fauna), economy, and material and spiritual culture of the speakers of a protolanguage. In this course we will examine the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Indo-European and correlate it with evidence from archaeology to formulate hypotheses about PIE homeland and economic and cultural practices. Time permitting, we may apply these methods to other language families outside Indo-European as well. Equivalent Course(s): LING 31320, LING 21320, GREK 36517, CLAS 37415 </P>

A dialogue responding to Plato's Phaedrus and Gorgias, it offers simultaneously a theory of rhetoric, a claim for the importance of oratory as a form of civic engagement, and an exploration of the role of Greek culture in Roman life. In this course we will read most of the first book of De oratore in Latin and the remainder of the work in English while examining Cicero's arguments in the context of the long-running ancient battle between rhetoric and philosophy. We will also look at the dialogue as a representation of Roman aristocratic culture in the late Republic. Instructor(s): J. Zetzel Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): LATN 36118 </P>

<P>LATN 27017. Einhard. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Einhard's Life of Charlemagne combined Ciceronian rhetorical theory, the modeling of Suetonius, and personal reminiscences to create one of the best-sellers of the Middle Ages. That work has a situational logic and stylistic place among Einhard's other activities and literate creations, including letters, epigraphy, theological reflection, and hagiographical narrative. We shall consider the inspirations, styles, and goals of the courtier, biographer, and pious lay retiree, who stands emblematically as both a &quot;typical&quot; and nonpareil figure of the Carolingian Renaissance.

<H3>Comparative Human Development </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64325">Department Website: http://humdev.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The program in Comparative Human Development (CHDV) focuses on the study of persons over the course of life; on the social, cultural, biological, and psychological processes that jointly influence development; and on growth over time in different social and cultural settings. The study of human development also offers a unique lens through which we consider broad questions of the social sciences, like the processes and impacts of social change, and the interactions of biology and culture. Faculty members in Comparative Human Development with diverse backgrounds in anthropology, biology, psychology, and sociology conduct research on topics that include (but are not limited to): the social and phenomenological experience of mental illness; comparative education; the impact of socioeconomic context on growth and development; the influence of social interaction on biological functioning; the tensions inherent in living in multicultural societies; the experience and development of psychotherapists in Western and non-Western countries; and the ways in which youth in developing countries are forging new conceptions of adulthood. Given this interdisciplinary scope, the program in Comparative Human Development provides an excellent preparation for students interested in advanced postgraduate study at the frontiers of several social science disciplines, or in careers and professions that require a broad and integrated understanding of human experience and behavior—e.g., mental health, education, social work, health care, or human resource and organizational work in community or corporate settings. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>The first point of contact for undergraduates is the preceptor. Preceptors can be emailed at humdevpreceptors@lists.uchicago.edu. Additional contact information for the year-specific preceptor can be found in Contacts at the bottom of this page, along with the undergraduate chair and administrator contact information. </P>

<P>Electronic Communication </P>

<P>Upon declaring a Comparative Human Development major, undergraduates should promptly join the department undergraduate email listserv to receive important announcements. Students request to join the listserv by logging in with their CNet ID at https://lists.uchicago.edu and subscribing to humdevundergrad@listhost.uchicago.edu (humdev-undergrad@uchicago.edu). </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The requirements below are in effect as of Autumn 2017. Current CHDV majors in the Classes of 2018 or 2019 who wish to follow the previous requirements should work with the preceptor to fashion a program of study. </P>

<P>The undergraduate program in Comparative Human Development has the following components: </P>

<P>Core Courses </P>

<P>CHDV 20000 Introduction to Human Development and CHDV 20100 Human Development Research Designs in Social Sciences, a two-quarter introductory sequence in Comparative Human Development, should be completed prior to the Spring Quarter of a student’s third year. CHDV 20000 Introduction to Human Development focuses on theories of development, with particular reference to the development of the self in a social and cultural context. CHDV 20100 Human Development Research Designs in Social Sciences focuses on modes of research and inquiry in human development, including basic concepts of research design and different methods used in studying human development (e.g., ethnography, experiments, surveys, discourse analysis, narrative inquiry, and animal models). Consideration is given to the advantages and limitations of each approach in answering particular questions concerning person and culture. </P>

<P>Methods </P>

<P>Students must complete one Methods course. It may focus on qualitative or quantitative methods or may be a research methods course from a related department, such as Statistics. </P>

<P>The following are courses since 2012 that have fulfilled the Methods requirement without a petition. (Please note courses in this list may not be offered this academic year.) </P>

<P>Courses that are not on the following list may be petitioned to count for Methods (see Petitions). </P>

<P>Electives </P>

<P>All CHDV majors are required to take nine CHDV elective courses. We encourage students to take their elective courses across the four areas of Comparative Human Development, given the department's commitment to transdisciplinary scholarship. All CHDV course numbers are labeled to describe the areas in which they are most closely aligned. The four areas are the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Comparative Behavioral Biology: includes courses on the biopsychology of attachment; evolutionary social psychology; evolution of parenting; biological psychology; primate behavior and ecology; behavioral endocrinology. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Life Course Development: includes courses on social and psychological development through the life course, including courses on childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and aging; education and development; introduction to language development; the role of early experience in development; sexual and gender identity; the study of lives and families in social and cultural context. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Culture and Community: includes courses on cultural psychology; psychological anthropology; social psychology; cross-cultural child development; language, culture, and thought; language socialization; education in ethnic and cultural context; psychiatric and psychodynamic anthropology; memory and culture. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

<LBody>Mental Health and Personality: includes courses on personality theory and research; social and cultural foundations of mental and physical health; modern psychotherapies and their supporting institutions; psychology of well-being; conflict understanding and resolution; core concepts and current directions in psychopathology; emotion, mind, and rationality; body image in health and disorder; advanced concepts in psychoanalysis. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Petitions </P>

<P>Student petitions will be accepted only in very limited circumstances to request that courses not taught or cross-listed in CHDV count toward CHDV major requirements. These limited circumstances may include a relevant course offered during study abroad if a CHDV course is not available. Students may petition for one relevant course per quarter of study abroad to count toward the CHD major, but only one, barring unusual circumstances. Only university-level courses credited by the University of Chicago or study abroad may be petitioned for CHDV requirements; no other form of credit (including Advanced Placement) is allowed. Petitions should be completed using the CHDV petition form found at humdev.uchicago.edu/page/undergraduate-studies. Petitions should include a copy of the course syllabus, since the course title alone is often not sufficient for evaluating a petition. </P>

<P>BA Honors Guidelines </P>

<P>Students with qualifying GPAs may seek to graduate with honors by successfully completing a BA honors paper that reflects scholarly proficiency in an area of study within Comparative Human Development and successfully completing two required accompanying courses: the CHDV 29800 BA Honors Seminar in the Spring Quarter of their third year and CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation in the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. CHDV 29800 BA Honors Seminar can count as one of the nine elective courses required for the major. CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation may not count toward major requirements; it may be used for general elective credit only. Qualified students who wish to seek CHDV honors and who plan to study abroad should plan their travel in order to ensure they are in residence at the University of Chicago during the Spring Quarter of their third year and the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year in order to take the two courses required for BA honors. </P>

<P>The honors paper should reflect original research of an empirical, scholarly, or theoretical nature and must be rated as worthy of honors by the student’s BA Honors Committee. This committee shall consist of two University faculty members: a supervisor (who must be a CHDV faculty member or associate faculty member) and a second reader (who must be a University of Chicago faculty member or associate faculty member). The paper should be about 30 to 40 pages in length. The grade given for it will become the grade of record for the Honors Paper Preparation course (CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation). To receive departmental honors upon graduation, students (1) must have attained a cumulative overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and a major GPA higher than 3.5 by the end of the quarter prior to the quarter of graduation, and (2) must have completed a meritorious BA honors paper under the supervision of a CHDV faculty member and received a high grade on their BA honors paper. </P>

<P>Permission to undertake a BA honors paper will be granted by the CHDV undergraduate chair to students who (1) have successfully completed CHDV 29800 BA Honors Seminar and (2) have filed a properly completed BA Honors Paper Proposal Form with the departmental secretary no later than tenth week of Spring Quarter of the third year. </P>

<P>BA Honors Seminar </P>

<P>The CHDV 29800 BA Honors Seminar aims to help qualified students formulate a suitable proposal and find a CHDV faculty supervisor. Qualified students who wish to seek departmental honors must register for the CHDV 29800 BA Honors Seminar during Spring Quarter of their third year. Permission to register for CHDV 29800 BA Honors Seminar will be granted to students with a GPA that, at the end of Autumn Quarter of the third year, shows promise of meeting the standards set for honors (see above). This course must be taken for a quality grade and may be counted as one of the required major electives. This course is a pre-field course where students develop a ten-page research proposal and find both a CHDV supervisor and a second reader (who may be outside of the department). As part of the proposal, they learn to develop an academic “problem” while reviewing the necessary academic literature. They also decide on the discipline and methods (interviewing, ethnography, experimental design) they will use to tackle their research question. </P>

<P>Honors Paper Preparation Course </P>

<P>The CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation course helps students successfully complete work on their BA honors paper. In order to complete honors, students who successfully took CHDV 29800 in Spring Quarter of their third year must also register for CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation during Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. This courses is required but does not count as one of the 12 courses in the major; it may be used for general elective credit only. Students are encouraged to collect their data over the summer; then this course scaffolds the process of analyzing data (such as transcription and coding) and writing up BA papers (such as tips on describing methods and peer review). The grade assigned by the thesis supervisor on the final BA paper is retroactively assigned as the grade for this course. </P>

<P>BA Honors Paper for Dual Majors </P>

<P>In very special circumstances, students may be able to write a longer BA honors paper that meets the requirements for a dual major (with prior approval from the undergraduate program chairs in both departments).

<P>Comparative Human Development Courses </P>

<P>CHDV 20000. Introduction to Human Development. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces the study of lives in context. The nature of human development from infancy through old age is explored through theory and empirical findings from various disciplines. Readings and discussions emphasize the interrelations of biological, psychological, and sociocultural forces at different points of the life cycle. Instructor(s): E. Raikhel Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): CHDV majors or intended majors. Note(s): Required Course for Comparative Human Development Majors Equivalent Course(s): PSYC 20850 </P>

<P>CHDV 20100. Human Development Research Designs in Social Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims to expose students to a variety of examples of well-designed social research addressing questions of great interest and importance. One goal is clarify what it means to do&quot;interesting&quot; research. A second goal is to appreciate the features of good research design. A third goal is to examine the variety of research methodologies in the social sciences, including ethnography, clinical case interviewing, survey research, experimental studies of cognition and social behavior, behavior observations, longitudinal research, and model building. The general emphasis is on what might be called the aesthetics of well-designed research. Instructor(s): Mueller, Anna Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Required Course for Comparative Human Development Majors Equivalent Course(s): PSYC 21100 </P>

<P>CHDV 20305. Inequality in Urban Spaces. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The problems confronting urban schools are bound to the social, economic, and political conditions of the urban environments in which schools reside. Thus, this course will explore social, economic, and political issues, with an emphasis on issues of race and class as they have affected the distribution of equal educational opportunities in urban schools. We will focus on the ways in which family, school, and neighborhood characteristics intersect to shape the divergent outcomes of low- and middle-income children residing with any given neighborhood. Students will tackle an important issue affecting the residents and schools in one Chicago neighborhood. This course is part of the College Course Cluster: Urban Design. Instructor(s): M. Keels Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): CHDV Distribution: B; 2* Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 20305, CRES 20305, CHDV 40315 </P>

<P>CHDV 21000. Cultural Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of &quot;normal&quot; psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of &quot;culture&quot; and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning. Instructor(s): R. Shweder Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Undergraduates must be in third or fourth year.

<P>CHDV 21401. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

<P>CHDV 22350. Social Neuroscience. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Social species, by definition, create emergent organizations beyond the individual - structures ranging from dyads and families to groups and cultures. Social neuroscience is the interdisciplinary field devoted to the study of neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms, and to the study of the associations and influences between social and biological levels of organization. The course provides a valuable interdisciplinary framework for students in psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics, and comparative human development. Many aspects of social cognition will be examined, including but not limited to attachment, attraction, altruism, contagion, cooperation, competition, dominance, empathy, isolation, morality, and social decision-making. Instructor(s): J. Decety Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): NSCI 21000, ECON 21830, PSYC 22350, BIOS 24137 </P>

<P>CHDV 23204. Medical Anthropology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces students to the central concepts and methods of medical anthropology. Drawing on a number of classic and contemporary texts, we will consider both the specificity of local medical cultures and the processes which increasingly link these systems of knowledge and practice. We will study the social and political economic shaping of illness and suffering and will examine medical and healing systems-including biomedicine-as social institutions and as sources of epistemological authority. Topics covered will include the problem of belief; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; the placebo effect and contextual healing; theories of embodiment; medicalization; structural violence; modernity and the distribution of risk; the meanings and effects of new medical technologies; and global health.

<P>CHDV 23249. Animal Behavior. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces the mechanism, ecology, and evolution of behavior, primarily in nonhuman species, at the individual and group level. Topics include the genetic basis of behavior, developmental pathways, communication, physiology and behavior, foraging behavior, kin selection, mating systems and sexual selection, and the ecological and social context of behavior. A major emphasis is placed on understanding and evaluating scientific studies and their field and lab techniques. Instructor(s): S. Pruett-Jones (even years), J. Mateo (odd years) Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Three quarters of a Biological Sciences Fundamentals sequence. Note(s): CHDV Distribution: A Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 23249, PSYC 23249 </P>

<P>CHDV 23900. Introduction to Language Development. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course addresses the major issues involved in first-language acquisition. We deal with the child's production and perception of speech sounds (phonology), the acquisition of the lexicon (semantics), the comprehension and production of structured word combinations (syntax), and the ability to use language to communicate (pragmatics). Instructor(s): S. Goldin-Meadow Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 31600, LING 31600, PSYC 23200, PSYC 33200, LING 21600 </P>

<P>CHDV 26000. Social Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines social psychological theory and research that is based on both classic and contemporary contributions. Topics include conformity and deviance, the attitude-change process, social role and personality, social cognition, and political psychology. Instructor(s): W. Goldstein Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): PSYC 20600 </P>

<P>CHDV 26901. Psychology for Citizens. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will examine aspects of the psychology of judgment and decision making that are relevant to public life and citizenship. Judgment and decision making are involved when people evaluate information about electoral candidates or policy options, when they vote, and when they choose to behave in ways that affect the collective good. Topics considered in the course will include the following. (1) What is good for people? What do we know about happiness? Can/should happiness be a goal of public policy? (2) How do people evaluate information and make decisions? Why does public opinion remain so divided on so many issues? (3) How can people influence others and be influenced (e.g., by policy makers)? Beyond persuasion and coercion, what are more subtle means of influence? (4) How do individuals' behaviors affect the collective good? What do we know about pro-social behavior (e.g., altruism/charitable giving) and anti-social behavior (e.g., cheating)? (5) How do people perceive and get along with each other? What affects tolerance and intolerance? Instructor(s): W. Goldstein Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): PSYC 25901 </P>

<P>CHDV 27802. Seminar: Challenging Legends and Other Received Truths: A Socratic Practicum. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar is an experiment in honoring the skeptical intellectual tradition. That intellectual tradition, which has its home in the great universities of the world, aims to achieve accuracy and impartiality in human understanding through a principled commitment to explore the other side, even when that requires the articulation of an unpopular, politically incorrect, or against the current point of view. While it may be a matter for debate whether the intellectual virtues we associate with skepticism are at risk of being sacrificed in the academy these days, this seminar engages a social science and public policy literature that raises skeptical doubts about &quot;received wisdom&quot; on a variety of consequential fronts. Warning to prospective seminar participants: &quot;... a good university, like Socrates, will be upsetting&quot; (The University of Chicago &quot;Kalven Committee Report," November 11, 1967). Instructor(s): R. Shweder Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Open to graduate students and to 3rd and 4th year College students. Note(s): CHDV Distribution: M, M Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 37802 </P>

<P>CHDV 27860. History of Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will consist in lectures and discussion sessions about the historical and conceptual foundations of evolutionary behavioral sciences (evolutionary anthropology, evolutionary psychology, ethology, comparative behavioral biology), covering the period from the publication of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species up to the present day. Topics will include new theoretical developments, controversies, interdisciplinary expansions, and the relationships between evolutionary behavioral sciences and other disciplines in the sciences and the humanities. Instructor(s): D. Maestripieri Terms Offered: Autumn 2018 Prerequisite(s): N/A Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 37860, KNOW 27860, HIPS 27860, CHSS 37860 </P>

<P>CHDV 28301. Disability and Design. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Disability is often an afterthought, an unexpected tragedy to be mitigated, accommodated, or overcome. In cultural, political, and educational spheres, disabilities are non-normative, marginal, even invisible. This runs counter to many of our lived experiences of difference where, in fact, disabilities of all kinds are the &quot;new normal.&quot; In this interdisciplinary course, we center both the category and experience of disability. Moreover, we consider the stakes of explicitly designing for different kinds of bodies and minds. Rather than approaching disability as a problem to be accommodated, we consider the affordances that disability offers for design. This course begins by situating us in the growing discipline of Disability Studies and the activist (and intersectional) Disability Justice movement. We then move to four two-week units in specific areas where disability meets design: architecture, infrastructure, and public space; education and the classroom; economics, employment, and public policy; and aesthetics. Traversing from architecture to art, and from education to economic policy, this course asks how we can design for access. Instructor(s): M. Friedner, J. Iverson Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Third or fourth-year standing Equivalent Course(s): BPRO 28300, MUSI 25719 </P>

<P>CHDV 29700. Undergraduate Reading and Research. 100 Units. </P>

<P>CHDV 29800. BA Honors Seminar. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Required for students seeking departmental honors, this seminar is designed to help develop an honors paper project that will be approved and supervised by a HD faculty member. A course preceptor will guide students through the process of research design and proposal writing. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Consent of the undergraduate program chair. Note(s): Eligible students should plan to take the BA Honors Seminar in the Spring Quarter of their third year. </P>

<P>CHDV 29900. Honors Paper Preparation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation course helps students successfully complete work on their BA honors paper. In order to complete honors, students who successfully took CHDV 29800 in Spring Quarter of their third year must register for CHDV 29900 Honors Paper Preparation during Autumn Quarter of their fourth year, as a 13th required course. Students are encouraged to collect their data over the summer; then this course scaffolds the process of analyzing data (such as transcription and coding) and writing up BA papers (such as tips on describing methods and peer review). The grade assigned by their thesis supervisor on the final BA paper is retroactively assigned as the grade for this course.

<H3>Comparative Literature </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64326">Department Website: http://complit.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>The major in Comparative Literature leads to a BA degree and is designed to attract students who wish to pursue an interdisciplinary plan of course work focused on the study of literature as written in various languages and in various parts of the world. </P>

<P>One student might come to the University of Chicago with a strong background in languages other than English and want to work in two or more literatures (one of which can be English). Another student might have a strong interest in literary study and wish to address general, generic, and/or transnational questions that go beyond the boundaries of national literature offered in other literature departments. Or, a student might wish to pursue an in-depth study of the interrelationship of literature and culture, as well as issues that transcend the traditional demarcations of national literary history and area studies. </P>

<P>These descriptions of academic interest are not mutually exclusive. Each student will work with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to design a plan of course work that will suit his or her individual goals and that will take advantage of the rich offerings of the University. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The requirements outlined below are in effect as of Autumn Quarter 2018 and will apply to all students in the Class of 2020 and beyond. Students in the Classes of 2018 and 2019 may request to switch to the new requirements if the updated program suits their interests and fits within their graduation plans. </P>

<P>Students interested in applying to the major in Comparative Literature should review the following guidelines and consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Comparative Literature. These guidelines are to assist students in developing a balanced and cohesive interdisciplinary plan of study. </P>

<P>The major is comprised of seven literature courses selected in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, one foundational course in comparative literary theory and methodology, two courses in literary theory, methods, or special topics in Comparative Literature, and a BA project workshop that serves as a capstone to the major. </P>

<P>A student works with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to identify a primary field (four courses) and secondary field (three courses). A student wishing to work in two literatures might choose two literatures as the primary and secondary fields (note: the second literature can be English). The secondary field might be a particular national literature or a portion of such a literature (e.g., poetry, drama, novel); another discipline (e.g., mathematics, history, film, performance studies, music); or literary theory. </P>

<P>Study abroad offers an attractive means of fulfilling various aims of this program. More than half of the major requirements must be satisfied by courses bearing University of Chicago numbers. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements </P>

<P>Three foreign language courses at the intermediate level or above (See Foreign Language Requirement for 300 details) </P>

<P>Four courses in a literature other than English, one of which can be in a closely related field 400 Three courses in a secondary field, which can be literature in another language (including English), 300 another discipline (e.g., mathematics, performance studies, music), or literary theory </P>

<P>details) </P>

<P>Total Units 1400 </P>

<P>Foreign Language Requirement </P>

<P>The Comparative Literature major requires three language courses in a single language at the intermediate level or above. Students who come in with advanced proficiency in a language other than English may instead substitute three courses in a third language, at any level. Though students must demonstrate proficiency through at least the second-year sequence in a foreign language, they are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the minimum required for the major. The Department of Comparative Literature works closely with the University of Chicago Language Center and will help students achieve their individual goals in language acquisition by suggesting programs of study that will add to their language expertise as appropriate. </P>

<P>BA Project </P>

<P>The BA capstone project is to be completed in the student's last year of study. The project should be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and is supervised by a faculty member of the student's choice in Comparative Literature. It may be co-advised by a faculty member from another department. Students </P>

<P>must complete their formal application to the major by spring of third year and should identify a faculty advisor at that time. </P>

<P>One obvious choice for a BA project is a substantial essay in comparative literary study. This option should not, however, rule out other possibilities. Alternative examples are a translation from a foreign literature with accompanying commentary or a written project based on research done abroad in another language and culture relating to comparative interests. Students are urged to base their project on comparative concepts and to make use of the language proficiency that they will develop as they meet the program's requirements. Visit complit.uchicago.edu/undergraduate for more details on the BA project. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with approval from both program chairs. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Participation in the Program </P>

<P>Students should express their interest in the major as early as possible. The first step is to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to consult about a program of study. Applicants must submit an application form which consists of a list of completed courses and a list of courses in which they are currently registered. Special mention should be made of language courses or other language training that affirms a student's level of language proficiency. Each proposal will be evaluated on the basis of the interest of the student and his or her achievement in the languages needed to meet the goals of the intended course of study. Students will be notified by email of their acceptance to the program. Finally, students will need to formalize their declaration through my.uchicago.edu with the assistance of the College adviser. </P>

<P>Comparative Literature majors should demonstrate literary proficiency in a language (other than English) that is relevant to their proposed course of study (as indicated in requirement number one above). This requirement must be met at the time of application or shortly thereafter. Proficiency is measured by the completion of a second-year sequence (or above) in the language or by demonstration of an equivalent skill. Language ability is essential to work in comparative literature of whatever sort. The Department of Comparative Literature works closely with the University of Chicago Language Center and will help students achieve their individual goals in language acquisition by suggesting programs of study that will add to their language expertise as appropriate. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All courses to be used in the major must be taken for a quality grade of B– or higher, except for CMLT 29801, which is graded on a Pass/Fail basis. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To be eligible for honors in Comparative Literature, students must earn an overall cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher, and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. They must also complete a BA essay or project that is judged exceptional in intellectual and/or creative merit by the first and second readers. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students must consult on an ongoing basis with the Director of Undergraduate Studies for selection and approval of course work for the major. Students will need to regularly provide documentation of any approvals for the major to their College adviser for the necessary processing. Further advice and counseling will be available from the preceptor for the program and from the faculty member who supervises the student's BA project. </P>

<P>Comparative Literature Courses </P>

<P>CMLT 20109. Comparative Methods in the Humanities. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces models of comparative analysis across national literatures, genres, and media by focusing on poetry in different languages and cultures and in relation to other discursive and artistic forms. We will examine a wide variety of poetic and critical texts in order to explore such topics as the specificity of poetry and of poetic kinds; orality and folk, art, and popular song; poetry's relation to prose (from philosophy to autobiography to journalism); transnational imitation and translation; poetry and globalization; ekphrasis and poetry's relations to visual arts; and poetry and film. Readings will likely include poems by Sappho, Horace, Dante, Li Bai, Du Fu, Ronsard, Shakespeare, Milton, Basho, Goethe, Wordsworth, Robert Browning, and Dylan; and critical writings by Longinus, Plutarch, Montaigne, Li Zhi, Wordsworth, Auerbach, Jakobson, Adorno, Pasolini, Zumthor, Culler, and Damrosch. Instructor(s): Joshua Scodel Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 28918 </P>

<P>CMLT 23112. Trans Performativity. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will explore how these dialogues and conflicts between gender studies, queer theory, and trans studies have developed and transformed our understandings of categories like &quot;gender,&quot; &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;trans." Some guiding questions will be: how do we, and should we, conceive the materiality of the body? How do assumptions about 'nature' and the 'natural' determine how we view categories of identity, and what are the political ramifications of these determinations? Why, within certain discourses, has the fluidity of gender been promoted, while the fluidity of race remains controversial and generally unsupported? How do we account for these different receptions, and what kind of opportunities do they make available for politically engaged communities? How can we simultaneously value performative theories of gender, while also maintaining a certain stability of identity as developed within trans criticism, even when these two discourses seem in direct conflict? Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 23112, ENGL 23112 </P>

<P>CMLT 23212. Art, Ekphrasis, and Myth in Early Modern Spanish Theater. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the early modern age, the verbal had a strong visual component. Poets and playwrights utilized the sense of sight since it was the highest of the Platonic senses and a mnemonic key to lead spectators to remember vividly what they had read or heard, long before spectacle plays were in fashion. One important technique for visualization was ekphrasis, the description of an art work within a text. Often, to perform was to imitate the affects, sentiments and poses of a painting. For this purpose, playwrights such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega and Calderón often turned to the mythological canvases of the Italian Renaissance along with the portraits of great rulers and images of battle. The class will examine the uses of art onstage: mnemonic, mimetic, political, religious comic, tragic, lyric and licentious. It will also delve into different forms of ekphrasis from the notional to the dramatic and from the fragmented to the reversed. Although the course will focus on Spanish plays of the early modern period, it will also include ancient treatises by Cicero, and Pliny as well as Renaissance mnemonic treatises by Della Porta. The course will be in English. Reading knowledge of Spanish is required since plays will be read in the original. Those taking the class for credit in Spanish must write their final paper in Spanish.

<P>CMLT 24105. Letters to Zion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar centers the question: what do we mean when we describe Jewish authors and thinkers from the past as Zionist, anti-Zionist, or non-Zionist? We will approach this question by reading three correspondences: Kafka's letters to Felice Bauer, and the correspondences between Gershom Scholem and Hannah Arendt and between Paul Celan and Ilana Shmueli. In each case, the question of Zionism and of Israel looms in the background of the exchange in some way. Our key question is: can we definitively determine the position of each of these letter-writers on the question of Zionism? And do we want to? Or does the form of the correspondence rather open a possibility for a more flexible, complex account of their positions, allowing us to think of them as changing and evolving, indeed as dialogic? In addition to the letters themselves, we will read other texts by these authors and about them, as well as background reading on the letter as genre and as historical document. We will also take note of the fact that these are all exchanges that cross the gender divide and ask how the question of Zionist ideology intersects with issues of gender in Jewish history. Instructor(s): Na'ama Rokem Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): CMLT 34105, JWSC 24105 </P>

<P>CMLT 26210. Oedipus in Zion: The Oedipal Figure in Modern Hebrew Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Historians often refer to the emergence of Zionism as an &quot;Oedipal Revolution. Hence, the secular son's rebellion against his orthodox father is understood as the thrust that triggered the modern Jewish revolution. Alan Mintz aptly described the inter-generational rift between fathers and sons at the turn of the 20th century as a tragic yet inevitable consequence of modernity, underscoring the psychological difficulties and political dilemmas that haunted the sons who were &quot;banished form their father's table. This seminar will focus on the (highly androcentric) oedipal figure in literary theory and explore its prominence in modern Hebrew literature. Freud's preoccupation with the Oedipus complex at the turn of the century coincided with the emergence of a powerful oedipal narrative in modern Hebrew culture. This confluence provides a fascinating backdrop to the &quot;invention" of the Oedipus complex. We will read a variety of literary texts which rework the oedipal figure from the late 19th century to the 1980s and beyond. Instructor(s): Michael Gluzman Equivalent Course(s): CMLT 36210, JWSC 26210 </P>

<P>CMLT 26660. The Rise of the Global New Right. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course traces the intellectual genealogies of the rise of a Global New Right in relation to the contexts of late capitalist neoliberalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, as well as the rise of social media. The course will explore the intertwining political and intellectual histories of the Russian Eurasianist movement, Hungarian Jobbik, the American Traditional Workers Party, the French GRECE, Greek Golden Dawn, and others through their published essays, blogs, vlogs and social media. Perhaps most importantly, the course asks: can we use f-word (fascism) to describe this problem? In order to pose this question we will explore the aesthetic concerns of the New Right in relation to postmodern theory, and the affective politics of nationalism. This course thus frames the rise of a global new right interdisciplinary and comparatively as a historical, geopolitical and aesthetic problem. Instructor(s): Leah Feldman Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): REES 36660, SIGN 26050, CMLT 36660, ENGL 26660, ENGL 36660, REES 26660 </P>

<P>CMLT 26912. 20th Century Russian &amp; South East European Emigre Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Being alienated from myself, as painful as that may be, provides me with that exquisite distance within which perverse pleasure begins, as well as the possibility of my imagining and thinking,&quot; writes Julia Kristeva in &quot;Strangers to Ourselves,&quot; the book from which this course takes its title. The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writers struggle for breath-speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else. Join us as we explore the pain, the struggle, the failure, and the triumph of emigration and exile.

<P>CMLT 29023. Returning the Gaze: The West and the Rest. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Aware of being observed. And judged. Inferior... Abject… Angry... Proud… This course provides insight into identity dynamics between the &quot;West,&quot; as the center of economic power and self-proclaimed normative humanity, and the &quot;Rest,&quot; as the poor, backward, volatile periphery. We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The BA program in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies offers an interdisciplinary curriculum through which students can examine the histories, languages, and cultures of the racial and ethnic groups in and of themselves, in relationship to each other, and, particularly, in structural contexts of power. Focusing on genocide, slavery, conquest, confinement, immigration, and the diaspora of peoples around the globe, Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies examines the material, artistic, and literary expressions of peoples who originated in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Europe, who moved voluntarily or were forcefully bound over to the Americas and here evolved stigmatized identities, which were tied to the cultures and histories of their natal lands in complicated ways. </P>

<P>A student who obtains a BA in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies will be well prepared for admission to graduate programs in the humanities and social sciences, to professional schools in law, medicine, public health, social work, business, or international affairs, and to careers in education, journalism, politics, creative writing, and the nonprofit sector. A degree in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies offers training designed to impart fundamental skills in critical thinking, comparative analysis, social theory, research methods, and written expression. </P>

<P>Areas of specialization include: Africa Past and Present, African American Studies, Latino/a Studies, Asian American Studies, and Native American Studies. This major/minor is also available to students interested in the study of Africa in a comparative framework. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to meet the general education requirement in the humanities and/or social sciences before declaring their major. Students must meet with the student affairs administrator to discuss a plan of study as soon as they declare their major (no later than the end of Spring Quarter of their third year). Students are also required to consult with the student affairs administrator to chart their progression through their course of study. </P>

<P>A. Civilization Requirement The major requires eleven to twelve courses, depending on whether the student counts two or three civilization studies courses chosen from those listed below. The CRES civilization requirement can only be fulfilled by taking courses from those listed below (other civilization sequences may be approved by petition). Courses can be taken in any order, but they must be in the same sequence. For example, a student can take Colonizations III and then Colonizations I, but they cannot fulfill the civilization requirement by taking </P>

<P>Colonizations III and Introduction to Latin American Civilization I. If a student has counted all three civilization courses towards general education, then a CRES elective must be added. </P>

<LBody> Research Project or Essay Requirement A substantial essay or project is to be completed in the student's fourth year under the supervision of a Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies adviser, who is a member of the program's core faculty. Students must choose an essay adviser and submit a formal BA proposal to the student affairs administrator by the end of </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>their third year of study. BA essays are due on May 1 of their fourth year or by fifth week of their quarter of graduation. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the required consent of both program chairs. Students should also consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline or, if one program fails to publish a deadline, by the end of their third year. A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>C. BA Colloquium Requirement Students must attend a BA colloquium that begins with a general meeting and individual meetings during the second half of Spring Quarter of their third year and continues through Autumn, Winter, and Spring Quarters of their fourth year. They may register for CRES 29800 BA Colloquium: Theory and Methods in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies in any one of those quarters, though most majors register for it during Autumn Quarter. They submit a completed thesis during Spring Quarter of their fourth year. (Students who plan to graduate before the Spring Quarter of their fourth year will need to register for the BA Colloquium earlier and should meet with the student affairs administrator to plan an appropriate program). This course is designed to introduce students to a range of qualitative research methods and to help determine which method would fit a research project of their own design in the field of race and ethnic studies. It functions as a research workshop in </P>

<P>which students identify a research topic, develop a research question, and explore a range of methods that may or may not be appropriate for the research project. </P>

<P>D. Requirements for the Major and the Minor </P>

<P>THE MAJOR </P>

<P>Students have two ways to fulfill the elective requirements for the major: </P>

<P>Option 1 allows students to focus four courses on one specific area of specialization—Africa Past and Present, African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latina/o Studies, or Native American Studies (other diasporic communities may qualify by petition)—and a second four-course cluster drawn from a different area or four comparative courses. For example, one may choose to take four courses focused on African American Studies and choose a second four courses focused exclusively on Asian American Studies or four courses in the Comparative/General Studies category. </P>

<P>Option 2 is designed for students who wish to explore comparative race and ethnic studies primarily through a disciplinary (e.g., anthropology, English, history) or interdisciplinary program focus (e.g., gender studies, Latin American studies), or who wish to graduate with a double major in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies. Accordingly, one four-course cluster of electives must be focused on one area (Africa Past and Present, African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latina/o Studies, Native American Studies). A second cluster of four courses should fall within a specific discipline or interdisciplinary area. </P>

<P>The requirements for Options 1 and 2 are virtually identical: one or two civilization studies courses, eight electives, a BA colloquium, and a BA essay. The BA program in CRES consists of eleven to twelve courses, of which at least seven courses must be chosen from those listed or cross-listed as CRES courses. One upper-level language course may be used to meet the major requirements. The course requires approval by the student affairs administrator. </P>

<P>THE MINOR </P>

<P>The minor in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies consists of five to seven courses, depending upon whether the two civilization studies courses are taken for general education. Credit toward the minor for courses taken at any other institution must be discussed with the director of undergraduate studies in advance of registration. Language courses may not be used to fulfill the CRES minor requirements. Students must receive the student affairs administrator's approval of the minor program on a form obtained from their College adviser. This form must then be returned to their College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of their third year. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Courses taken to complete a minor are counted toward electives. </P>

<P>CRES 20701. Introduction to African Civilization I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Part one of the sequence takes a historical approach. We consider how different types of historical evidence-documentary, oral, and material-can be used to investigate processes of change and transformation in Africa from the early Iron Age through the emergence of the Atlantic world in the fifteenth century. We will investigate state formation in comparative perspective and examine case studies from the Swahili coast, the empires of Ghana and Mali, and Great Zimbabwe. The course also examines the diffusion of Islam, European contact, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Instructor(s): E.

<P>CRES 20802. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

<P>This course examines the intersection of narrative in print and film (fiction and documentary) in Southern Africa since mid-20th-century decolonization. We begin with Cry, the Beloved Country, a best seller written by South African Alan Paton while in the US, and the original film version by a Hungarian-born, British-based director (Zoltan Korda) and an American screenwriter (John Howard Lawson), which together show both the international impact of South African stories and the important elements missed by overseas audiences. We will continue with fictional and nonfictional narrative responses to apartheid and decolonization in film and in print, and examine the power and the limits of what critic Louise Bethlehem has called the &quot;rhetoric of urgency&quot; on local and international audiences. We will conclude with writing and film that grapples with the complexities of the post-apartheid world, whose challenges, from crime and corruption to AIDS and the particular problems faced by women and gender minorities, elude the heroic formulas of the anti-apartheid struggle era.

<P>CRES 22150. Contemporary African American Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the issues, actions, and arguments that comprise black politics today.Our specific task is to explore the question of how do African Americans currently engage in politics and political struggles in the United States. This analysis is rooted in a discussion of contemporary issues, including the election of the first African American president, Barack Obama, the emergence of the Movement for Black Lives, the exponential incarceration of black people, and the intersection of identities and the role black feminism in shaping the radical freedom tradition in black politics. Throughout the course we attempt to situate the politics of African Americans into the larger design we call American politics. Is there such a thing as black politics? If there is, what does it tell us more generally about American politics? Instructor(s): C. Cohen Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): PLSC 22150, LLSO 25902 </P>

<P>CRES 24601. Martin and Malcolm: Life and Belief. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the religious, social, cultural, political, and personal factors behind the two most prominent public leaders and public intellectuals emerging from the African American community in the 1950s and 1960s: Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. We review their autobiographies, domestic trends within the United States, and larger international forces operating during their times. Their life stories provide the contexts for the sharp differences and surprising commonalities in their political thought and religious beliefs. The operative question is: What can Malcolm and Martin tell us about America during one of the most dynamic periods in the nation's personality metamorphosis? We use documentary videos of each man's speeches and of the social contexts in which they lived. (B) Instructor(s): D. Hopkins Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): RLST 24601 </P>

<P>CRES 25405. Child Poverty and Chicago Schools. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This discussion- and debate-based course begins with a sociological and historical examination of child poverty, focusing on its origin, experience, and perpetuation in disadvantaged Chicago communities. Class meetings will involve debating school reform efforts, such as &quot;turnaround&quot; schools, charter schools, Promise Neighborhoods, and stepped-up teacher evaluations. Further, the barriers that have contributed to the failure of previous reform initiatives-barriers that include social isolation, violence, and the educational system itself-will be identified and analyzed in-depth.

Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 25405 </P>

<P>CRES 27502. Africans in the Early Americas. 100 Units. </P>

<P>During the era of the transatlantic slave trade, more than 350,000 Africans were forcibly trafficked to what is now the United States. The experiences of these men and women and their descendants-particularly their exploitation under a system of racialized slavery-profoundly shaped the course of US history up to and including the present day. These individuals were significant, but they were also only one part of the more than 12 million people who came from Africa to the Americas in the colonial period. Focusing on the diverse experiences of Africans and their descendants-as slaves, but also as colonizers, soldiers, revolutionaries, family members, and free men and women-this course surveys the history of Africans in the Americas from the late fifteenth through the late nineteenth century. Adopting a broad geographic and temporal perspective allows for an exploration of the evolving relationships between labor, gender, and race in North, Central, and South America, including the Spanish, French, and English Caribbean. In this course we will ask: How did the experiences of Africans in the colonial and early republican United States compare with those of Africans in other parts of early America? How might learning about and comparing the experiences of free and enslaved Africans and Afro-descended peoples in different parts of the Americas re-shape our understanding of the multiple origins, meanings, and possibilities of race and national belonging?

<P>CRES 24255. Everyday Maoism: Work, Daily Life, and Material Culture in Socialist China. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns: land and marriage reform, nationalization of industry, anti-rightist campaign, Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, etc. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, socialism was as much about material changes as about politics: about the two-story brick houses, electric lights and telephones (loushang louxia, diandeng dianhua) that the revolution had promised; about new work regimes and new consumption patterns-or, to the contrary, about the absence of such change. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the &quot;new objects&quot; of socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people's daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people's life experiences out of material objects?

<P>CRES 24706. Edo/Tokyo: Society and the City in Japan. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the cultural and cultural history of Edo/Tokyo from its origins in the early seventeenth century through circa 1945. Issues to be explored include the configuration of urban space and its transformation over time in relation to issues of status, class, and political authority; the formation of the &quot;city person&quot; as a form of identity; and the tensions between the real city of lived experience and the imagined city of art and literature. We will pay particular attention to two periods of transformation, the 1870s when the modernizing state made Tokyo its capital, and the period of reconstruction after the devastating earthquake of 1923. Assignments include a final research paper of approximately 15 to 18 pages. Instructor(s): S. Burns Equivalent Course(s): EALC 34706, CRES 34706, HIST 24706, HIST 34706, EALC 24706 </P>

<P>CRES 27303. Topics in US-Mexico Borderlands History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the history of the U.S.-Mexican borderlands, from its native past to its present, as a geographical place and as a site of contested sovereignties. It is organized around major themes in the history of the region, including indigenous and European imperialism, settler colonialism, nationalism, migration, labor, and citizenship. Special attention will also be given to the themes of cultural hybridity, transculturation, and the fluidity of social identities defined by the categories of class, ethnicity, gender, nationality, and race. The structure of this course emphasizes the interaction of historical forces across imperial, national, and cultural boundaries, highlighting the dynamism of borderlands as historical phenomena and as a method of interpreting and understanding the past. Students enrolled in this course will gain critical thinking and analytical skills as well as a broader understanding of topics in U.S. and Mexican history that continue to influence contemporary political debates. They will be encouraged to look beyond the rigid dichotomies that often divide the borderlands and investigate the full spectrum of cultural, economic, and social relationships that bring people together as well as those that push them apart. Students will also learn to look for common patterns that emerge across time and space while remaining attentive to the nuances of local identities, cultures, and histories. Instructor(s): D.

<P>CRES 27504. Racism without Race. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In early 2010 a member of staff at the Regenstein library contacted the police to report an unruly student. The police arrived at the scene and charged the student with criminal trespass and resisting arrest. The student was put in a choke hold and handcuffed before being taken to the local police station where he was held in a cell overnight.According to witnesses, the library staff member's response was unwarranted and so too were the actions taken by the police officers. Individuals later interviewed for the Chicago Maroon described the student's treatment as an instance of 'racial profiling.' How are we to make sense of this incident and others similar to it? There is strong evidence to suggest that the reactions of the authority figures involved were shaped by their attitudes toward skin color. It would seem farfetched, however, to conclude that these reactions reflected an ideology of racial differentiation or what we might call 'traditional' race ideology: the view that human beings can be classified scientifically according to race and that some races are better than, or superior to, others. Theories of race and racial difference have largely been discredited and there are no longer any official institutions, respected academics or public individuals who espouse these. How then do we explain the continued salience of skin color, and what value is there in applying terms such as 'race' and 'racism' to describe it? The following course seeks to reframe the way we go about analyzing contemporary forms of social differentiation based on skin color. It looks at skin color as a culturally recognizable sign, which, like other signs, acquires significance only within the context of a broader set of semiotic ideologies and practices. This means directing our attention to the ways in which color-as-sign takes on meaning in the world we live. Such an approach offers a conceptual framework for a comparative study of past and present forms of discrimination based on skin color while also remaining sensitive to the particularities that define these.

<P>CRES 27501. Urban Indians: Native Americans and the City. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The majority of Native Americans in the United States now live in urban areas and this has been the case for more than half a century, but discussions about cities rarely acknowledge their presence beyond (sometimes) lumping them in with catchall categories often labeled &quot;Other.&quot; In this course, students will encounter and examine the distinct experiences and contributions of Native Americans in cities, large and small, past and present. We'll look, first, at the context in which the population shift away from rural and reservation spaces took place and discuss the ways in which being/becoming &quot;urban&quot; and the process of &quot;urbanization&quot; may not be as straightforward as expected. Students will then dive into studies of the daily struggles and successes of Native American city-dwellers, with an emphasis on mid-20th-century Chicago. Readings and in-class activities will explore issues related to: housing, work, stereotypes and discrimination, cultural survival and traditionalism, physical and mental health, the rise of pan-Indianism, activism, schooling, class divisions, multi/locality, generational differences, identity and intersectionality, representation and the arts, and the very recognition or lack thereof mentioned above. The knowledge and analytic skills developed in this course will therefore serve as an uncommon window into Native American studies and urban studies, as well as broader race- and place-conscious work in the social sciences and humanities.

<P>CRES 20207. Race, Ethnicity, and Human Development. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Twenty-first century practices of relevance to education, social services, health care and public policy deserve buttressing by cultural and context linked perspectives about human development as experienced by diverse groups. Although generally unacknowledged as such post-Brown v. 1954, the conditions purported to support human development for diverse citizens remain problematic. The consequent interpretative shortcomings serve to increase human vulnerability. Specifically, given the problem of evident unacknowledged privilege for some as well as the insufficient access to resources experienced by others, the dilemma skews our interpretation of behavior, design of research, choice of theory, and determination of policy and practice. The course is based upon the premise that the study of human development is enhanced by examining the experiences of diverse groups, without one group standing as the &quot;standard&quot; against which others are compared and evaluated. Accordingly, the course provides an encompassing theoretical framework for examining the processes of human development for diverse humans while also highlighting the critical role of context and culture.

<P>CRES 27302. Gender, Sexuality, Indigenous Women in the Colonial Encounter. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is premised on the belief that the history of gender and sexuality in colonial contexts is just as crucial and revealing as other more geopolitical, military, or diplomatic topics. In this sense, laws regulating marriage or Europeans exchanging of postcards of &quot;exotic women&quot; are just as significant as land annexations or military technology. Through the quarter, we will think through not only what the history of imperialism tells us about gender and sexuality, but also what this type of analysis reveals about colonialism and empire. What was the relationship between the socio- political organization of European empires and ideologies of gender and sexuality in both colony and metropole? We will also consider intersectional questions, such as the connections between regulating intimacy and the creation of race-based imperial hierarchies. To gain historical precision in examining these more abstract or theoretical questions, we will anchor our readings and discussion around particular indigenous woman and their contexts. While the study of gender and sexuality in a colonial context has come a long way in recent years, the majority of sources for examining gender and colonialism are about white women. To push back against this absence, we will take a case study approach to consider the lives and narratives surrounding indigenous women in colonial cultures. Instructor(s): E.

<P id="LinkTarget_64329">Department Website: http://neuroscience.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Computational neuroscience is a relatively new interdisciplinary area of inquiry that is concerned with how components of animal and human nervous systems interact to produce behaviors. It relies on quantitative and modeling approaches to understand the function of the nervous system and to design human-made devices that duplicate behaviors. Course work in computational neuroscience can prepare students for graduate studies in neurobiology or psychology, in the mathematical or engineering sciences, or in areas of medicine such as neurology or psychiatry. It can lead either to traditional academic careers or to opportunities in the corporate world. </P>

<P>An undergraduate degree in computational neuroscience is not available at the University of Chicago, but a minor in computational neuroscience is offered by the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division. This minor is a good option for students who are majoring in biological sciences and are interested in mathematical approaches to biology; or for students who are majoring in computer science, mathematics, physics, psychology, or statistics and are interested in neuroscience. For details, see the Biological Sciences section in this catalog. </P>

<P>Students electing this minor must have completed, or placed out of, the equivalent of a year of collegiate-level calculus and must have completed the general education requirement for the biological sciences. </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The computer science program prepares students for careers in computer science by offering BA and BS degrees, as well as combined BA/MS and BS/MS degrees. Students who earn the BA are prepared either for graduate study in computer science or a career in industry. Students who earn the BS degree build strength in an additional field by following an approved course of study in a related area. The department also offers a minor. Furthermore, a computer science major or minor serves as an excellent foundation for work in other areas, including but not limited to mathematics, the natural sciences, social sciences, public administration, and the arts. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Both the BA and BS in computer science require fulfillment of the mathematical sciences requirement in general education by completing an approved two-quarter calculus sequence. The physical sciences requirement in general education must be satisfied by completing an approved two-quarter sequence in either chemistry or physics. Both BA and BS students take at least fourteen computer science courses chosen from an approved program. BS students also take three courses in an approved related field outside computer science. </P>

<P>Approved Programs </P>

<P>The computer science department counselor is responsible for approval of specific courses and sequences, and responds as needed to changing course offerings in our program and other programs. Students should consult the department counselor with questions about specific courses they are considering taking to meet the requirements. The department counselor maintains a website with up-to-date program details at http://majoradvising.cs.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Approved Computer Science Program </P>

<P>There is one approved general program for both the BA and BS degrees, comprised of introductory courses, a sequence in Theory, and a sequence in Programming Languages and Systems, followed by advanced electives. Students may substitute upper-level or graduate courses in similar topics for those on the list that follows with the approval of the department counselor. Students who matriculated prior to Autumn 2016 may choose to follow these requirements; otherwise they should consult the archived catalog from their year of matriculation for the degree requirements in computer science. All students who matriculated in Autumn 2016 or later should follow this program. </P>

<P>The course information in this catalog, with respect to who is teaching which course and in which quarter(s), is subject to change during the academic year. For up-to-date information on our course offerings, please consult http://course-info.cs.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Students considering a computer science major are strongly advised to register for an introductory sequence, starting either with CMSC 15100 or CMSC 16100, in their first year. Incoming students should note that while CMSC 12100 can be used as the first course in the major, it is not open to first-year students, and it is not intended as an entry point for students who already know they want to major in computer science. Students who decide to pursue a computer science major or minor after completing CMSC 12100 may continue with either CMSC 15200-15400 or CMSC 12200-12300-15400. Note that CMSC 12200 does not meet the prerequisites for CMSC 15400. </P>

When we perform a search on Google, stream content from Netflix, place an order on Amazon, or catch up on the latest comings-and-goings on Facebook, our seemingly minute requests are processed by complex systems that sometimes include hundreds of thousands of computers, connected by both local and wide area networks. Recent papers in the field of Distributed Systems have described several solutions (such as MapReduce, BigTable, Dynamo, Cassandra, etc.) for managing large-scale data and computation. However, building and using these systems pose a number of more fundamental challenges: How do we keep the system operating correctly even when individual machines fail? How do we ensure that all the machines have a consistent view of the system's state? (And how do we ensure this in the presence of failures?) How can we determine the order of events in a system where we can't assume a single global clock? Many of these fundamental problems were identified and solved over the course of several decades, starting in the 1970s. To better appreciate the challenges of recent developments in the field of Distributed Systems, this course will guide students through seminal work in Distributed Systems from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, leading up to a discussion of recent work in the field.

<H3>Creative Writing </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64331">Department Website: http://creativewriting.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>The Program in Creative Writing takes a comprehensive approach to the study of contemporary literature, criticism, and theory from a writer’s perspective, and provides rigorous training in the fundamental practices of creative writing. In our courses, students work with established poets and prose writers towards these pursuits, and both the major and minor in Creative Writing provide ample opportunities for interdisciplinary work across University departments. The program’s commitment to interdisciplinary work and academic rigor, coupled with an emphasis on teaching the elements of creative writing that underlie all genres, accounts for the program's vitality and explains why Creative Writing at Chicago is currently the largest initiative in the humanities for the College. </P>

<P>The Program in Creative Writing offers workshops and seminars in poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, as well as an increasing number of translation workshops. The major seminars—including the Technical Seminars and Fundamentals in Creative Writing—are designed to build a critical and aesthetic foundation for students working in each primary genre. Students can pursue their creative writing interests within the formal requirements of the major in Creative Writing or through a joint minor in English and Creative Writing, which is open to students outside those two major programs. Students who do not wish to pursue a formal program in Creative Writing will have access to courses that satisfy the general education requirement in the arts and open-entry &quot;beginning&quot; workshops. They may also apply for advanced workshop courses. Our workshops and technical seminars are cross-listed with a graduate number and open to students in the graduate and professional schools. </P>

<P>Major in Creative Writing </P>

<P>Students who graduate with the bachelor of arts in Creative Writing will both be skilled in writing in a major literary genre and have a theoretically informed understanding of the aesthetic, historical, social, and political context of a range of contemporary writing. Students in the major will focus their studies on a primary genre chosen from fiction, poetry, and nonfiction. </P>

<P>The organization of the major recognizes the value of workshop courses, but incorporates that model into a broader education that furthers students’ knowledge of historical and contemporary literary practice, introduces them to aesthetic and literary theory, sharpens their critical attention, and fosters their creative enthusiasm. Valuable experience with group work and peer criticism, which comes from the practices and skills central to Creative Writing pedagogy, will prepare students for success in a range of fields in the public and private sectors. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The Program in Creative Writing requires a total of 13 courses and completion of a BA thesis, as described below. Students who matriculated in 2016–17 or later may declare this major. Students planning to complete the major must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and file a worksheet with the program by the end of the Autumn Quarter of the third year of study. </P>

<P>All interested students should speak with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or the Program Manager. </P>

<P>Students contemplating a major or minor in Creative Writing may choose to take one or two Creative Writing courses toward the general education requirement in the arts. These courses will not count towards major requirements, but they do offer an opportunity to test out the program while satisfying a general education requirement. </P>

<P>One (1) Fundamentals in Creative Writing course </P>

<P>CRWR 17000 to CRWR 17999 </P>

<P>The Fundamentals in Creative Writing course is a cross-genre, one-quarter seminar to be taken by all students in the major. Every section of the course focuses on a current debate relevant to all forms of literary practice, such as mimesis, translation and appropriation, and art and the market. This course introduces students to a group of core texts from each major literary genre. The course is taught in a seminar format and will require a final paper. Fundamentals in Creative Writing is restricted to students who have declared the major, as its aims are to develop cohort solidarity, promote a culture of articulate exchange, and induct students into a reflection on practice that will serve their artistic and professional development. Students should plan to take the course as early as possible after declaring the major, ideally in the first or second quarter in the program. See Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses for additional details. </P>

<P>Two (2) Technical Seminars </P>

<P>Fiction: CRWR 20200 to CRWR 20299; Poetry: CRWR 20301 to CRWR 20399; Nonfiction: CRWR 20400 to CRWR </P>

<P>Students in the major must take two technical seminars in their primary genre of fiction, poetry, or nonfiction. The aims of the seminars are to enlarge students’ technical resources through extensive reading and analysis of contemporary literature and to provide practice-based training in technical skills. Students submit papers that address technical questions, chiefly with reference to contemporary texts. For example, poetry </P>

<P>students may write on “the line,” where fiction students write on “point of view.” These courses may also count as electives in the minor. See Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses for additional details. </P>

<P>Three (3) Advanced Workshops Fiction: CRWR 22100 to CRWR 22299; Poetry: CRWR 23100 to CRWR 23299; Nonfiction: CRWR 24001 to CRWR 24199 </P>

<P>Students in the major must complete three Advanced Workshops, at least two of which must be in the student’s primary genre. The Advanced Workshop is the characteristic pedagogical instrument of Creative Writing as an academic discipline. Workshop practice relies on an understanding of support that is dedicated to improving students’ writing, not unconditional approval. Critique is the core value and activity of the workshop, and students will practice it under the guidance of the workshop instructor. Although Advanced Workshops begin with attention to exemplary texts, they typically focus on original student work. See Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses for additional details. </P>

<P>Credit for a Beginning Workshop: Students who have completed a Beginning Workshop in their primary genre and have received a grade of B+ or above will be able to count this course as one of the required Advanced Workshops. Because students must take at least two Advanced Workshops in their primary genre, any qualifying Beginning Workshop may only serve as the third required workshop. This means that students choosing to count a Beginning Workshop towards the major will not be able to count an Advanced Workshop from a genre that is not the primary genre towards the degree. Beginning Workshops offered by other institutions will not count towards the major. Beginning Workshops are open to all students during pre-registration. </P>

<P>One (1) Literary Genre Course </P>

<P>Students are required to take one introductory Literary Genre course related to their primary genre as an introduction to key texts and debates in the history of their chosen genre. This requirement can be met by a cross-listed English course or a comparable course in another literature. Depending on the student's genre, courses like ENGL 10400 Introduction to Poetry, ENGL 10700 Introduction To Fiction: Short Story, or ENGL 11004 History of the Novel may be eligible. Specific courses that are identified as filling this requirement will be listed at creativewriting.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Three (3) Literature Courses </P>

<P>Creative Writing majors are required to take three literature courses offered by other departments. These courses can be focused on the literature of any language, but one must involve the study of literature written before the twentieth century and one must center on theory. The Director of Undergraduate Studies will offer guidance and approve all qualifying courses. Specific courses that satisfy the distribution element of this requirement will be listed at creativewriting.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Two (2) Research Background Electives </P>

<P>Students take two courses outside the Creative Writing department to support the student’s individual interests and thesis project. These courses must be selected in consultation with and approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Depending on a student's interests, courses in e.g., Cinema and Media Studies or Visual Arts might be appropriate. Others may take additional literature course work. The students must provide documentation of these approvals to their College adviser. </P>

<P>BA Thesis and Workshop </P>

<P>Students work on their BA Projects throughout their fourth year. In Spring Quarter of the third year, students will submit a signed BA proposal form to the Program Manager. During Summer Quarter, students are responsible for completing independent reading and research related to their proposed project. Early in Autumn Quarter of their fourth year, students will be assigned a graduate student preceptor, who will lead a series of mandatory colloquia over the course of the quarter. In Winter Quarter, students will continue meeting with the graduate preceptor and must also enroll in the appropriate Thesis/Major Projects Workshop in their genre (CRWR 29200 Thesis/Major Projects: Fiction, CRWR 29300 Thesis/Major Projects: Poetry, or CRWR 29400 Thesis/ Major Projects: Creative Nonfiction). </P>

<P>Students are not automatically enrolled in a workshop; they must receive the consent of the workshop instructor, who will also serve as the faculty advisor for their BA Project. Students should be aware that because of the high number of students wishing to write fiction for their BA Projects, students will not necessarily get their first choice of workshop instructor and faculty advisor. See Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses for additional details. </P>

<P>Students will work closely with their faculty advisor and with their peers in the workshops and will receive course credit as well as a final grade for the workshop. In consultation with their faculty advisor and graduate preceptor, students will revise and resubmit a near-final draft of the BA Project by the end of the second week of Spring Quarter. Students will submit the final version of their BA Project to their preceptor, faculty advisor, and the Director of Undergraduate Studies by the beginning of the fifth week of Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>Students graduating in other quarters must consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies about an appropriate timeline before the end of Autumn Quarter of the third year of study. The Winter Thesis/Major Projects Workshop is mandatory. </P>

<P>Program Honors </P>

<P>The faculty in the Program in Creative Writing will award program honors based on their assessment of the BA theses, with input from graduate student preceptors. To be eligible, students must have an overall GPA of at least 3.6 and overall GPA of 3.25. Honors will be awarded only to the most exceptional projects from a given cohort; the majority of students will not receive this designation. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students considering the major should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies as early as possible to discuss program requirements and individual plans of study. Declaration of the major must be formalized through my.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>The Program Manager and Director of Undergraduate Studies will provide guidance to students choosing courses to complete the major requirements. By Autumn Quarter of their third year, all students will be required to file a major program worksheet with the department, and the student’s final major program must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students will need to regularly provide documentation of any approvals for the major to their College advisers for the necessary processing. </P>

<P>Graduate student preceptor support will be available to students while they write BA theses and minor portfolios during their final year of study, and faculty instructors will serve as thesis advisors for the students in their winter workshops. </P>

<P>Courses outside the Department Taken for Program Credit </P>

<P>A maximum of three courses outside Creative Writing and the Department of English Language and Literature (or another literature) may count toward the total number of courses required by the major. Ordinarily, two of these courses will be Research Background Electives. Substitutions for a further course will be subject to approval, but students may not substitute non-literature courses for the Literature Course requirement. </P>

<P>For students double majoring, this means a maximum of three courses can count towards both majors (pending approval from both departments). </P>

<P>Double Majors in English Language and Literature and Creative Writing </P>

<P>When students choose a double major in Creative Writing and English Language and Literature, they may count up to four courses towards both majors. These four courses will typically include the three Literature Courses and the Literary Genre course, but in some cases one of the slots might be filled by a CRWR course (with Director of Undergraduate Studies approval). However, the two Research Background Electives required for the Creative Writing major should be taken outside of the Department of English Language and Literature. </P>

<P>This means that a maximum of four English Language and Literature courses, including the Literary Genre course, can count towards the Creative Writing major. </P>

<P>Students who are pursuing only the English Language and Literature major may count up to four CRWR courses towards the major in English as electives without a petition. However, when students are pursuing a </P>

<P>double major in English Language and Literature and Creative Writing, they must observe the shared four-course maximum, so any eligible CRWR courses beyond this cap must be counted towards English only. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students with a major in Creative Writing must receive quality grades (not P/F) in all courses counting toward the major or minor. Non-majors may take CRWR courses for P/F grading with consent of instructor. </P>

<P>Minor in English and Creative Writing </P>

<P>Students who are not English Language and Literature or Creative Writing majors may complete a minor in English and Creative Writing. Such a minor requires six courses plus a portfolio of creative work. At least two of the required courses must be Creative Writing (CRWR) workshop courses, with at least one being an Advanced Workshop. Three of the remaining required courses may be taken in either the Department of English Language and Literature (ENGL) or the Program in Creative Writing (CRWR). This may include CRWR Technical Seminars or general education courses, as long as they are not already counted toward the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>In addition, students must enroll in one of the following workshops offered during the Winter Quarter: CRWR 29200 Thesis/Major Projects: Fiction; CRWR 29300 Thesis/Major Projects: Poetry; CRWR 29400 Thesis/ Major Projects: Creative Nonfiction. Finally, students must submit a portfolio of their work (e.g., a selection of poems, one or two short stories or chapters from a novel, two or three nonfiction pieces) to the Creative Writing Program Manager by the end of the fifth week in the quarter in which they plan to graduate. Students will work with a graduate student preceptor to compile and refine their final portfolios. </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program in English and Creative Writing must meet with the program administrator for Creative Writing before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Students choose courses in consultation with the administrator. The administrator's approval for the minor program should be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser. </P>

<P>Students completing this minor will be given enrollment preference for CRWR Advanced Workshops and Thesis/Major Projects Workshops, and they must follow all relevant admission procedures described at the Creative Writing (https://creativewriting.uchicago.edu) website. For details, see Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor (1) may not be doubly counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and </P>

<P>(2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades (not P/F), and at least half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Minor to Major and Major to Minor </P>

<P>Student circumstances change, and thus a transfer between the major and minor programs may be desirable to students who begin a course of study in either program. Workshop courses (including Beginning Workshops) and one Technical Seminar may count towards the minor, but Fundamentals in Creative Writing will not. The Thesis/Major Projects Workshop will also function as a portfolio workshop for minors. Students should consult with their College adviser if considering such a transfer and must update their planned program of study with the Program Manager or Director of Undergraduate Studies in Creative Writing. </P>

<P>Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses </P>

<P>General education courses and Beginning Workshops are open to all students via the standard preregistration process. Other courses require consent, and some may require submission of work for evaluation. These courses may prioritize students in the major. Note: Students who have not formally declared the major will not receive priority in consent-based courses. Those interested in the major should see Advising (above) and meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of Autumn Quarter of third year. Students who have not yet met with the Director of Undergraduates Studies to begin a worksheet are not considered formally declared and therefore are not guaranteed priority in course enrollment. </P>

<P>Applications for consent-only courses must be received by the deadlines listed below. </P>

<P>Creative Writing courses for the general education requirement in the arts </P>

<P>These multi-genre courses are introductions to topics in Creative Writing and satisfy the general education requirement in the arts in the College. General education courses are generally taught under two headings—&quot;Reading as a Writer&quot; and &quot;Intro to Genres&quot;—and will feature class critiques of students’ creative work.

<P>Creative Writing Courses </P>

<P>CRWR 10206. Beginning Fiction Workshop. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Fiction writing is part magic and part mechanics. This course will pay homage to the magic but concentrate on how a story is built: the architecture of structure, the mechanisms of character development, the fluid dynamics of dialogue. We'll take a close look at some of the building blocks that make up fiction writing: character, dialogue, plot, point of view, and setting. We'll also read and discuss a variety of short stories, always with an eye to craft and to what you, as writers, can steal for your own work. That's right, steal. Much of this course is devoted to learning how to steal the tools of great fiction writing, then to using those tools to realize your own vision. You'll write extensively in and out of class, from weekly reading responses to writing exercises that build toward a polished piece of work. Finally, you will write a complete draft and one extensive revision of a short story or novel chapter. The last third of the course will be devoted to student workshops, where each student will turn in a draft of a story or chapter to be read and critiqued by the whole class. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,Winter Prerequisite(s): Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 30206 </P>

<P>CRWR 10306. Beginning Poetry Workshop. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of poetry in a creative writing workshop context. We will focus on a different topic each week-image, prosody, form, and so on-by reading extensively in the work of contemporary American poets and by composing our own literary exercises as well. We will also attend poetry readings and talks on poetry by visitors to our campus. The course will follow a workshop format, with peer critiques of student work and intensive readings across a spectrum of literary aesthetics. Instructor(s): Staff. Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter Prerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is necessary. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 30306 </P>

<P>CRWR 10406. Beginning Nonfiction Workshop. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A personal essay can employ a chain of events, but it's essentially a train of thought. Like thought, it's protean, able to take any shape and yet remain an essay. In this workshop you'll write two drafts of your own essai, or attempt, at the form, while line editing and critiquing your classmates' attempts. You'll also do close readings, starting with &quot;Why I Write,&quot; by George Orwell, and &quot;Why I Write,&quot; by Joan Didion. Then James Baldwin's &quot;Autobiographical Notes.&quot; Once we've had a taste of the present we'll go back four thousand years to the essay's beginnings in Babylon, following its evolution in Greece and Rome-Heraclitus, Plutarch, Seneca-then Europe: Montaigne, Max Beerbohm, Walter Benjamin, and Natalia Ginzburg, returning to contemporary English-language writers, including Adrienne Rich and Margaret Atwood, ending with Didion's &quot;Goodbye to All That," paired with Eula Biss's contemporary cover version, also titled &quot;Goodbye to All That." Instructor(s): Dan Raeburn; Staff Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,Winter Prerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 30406 </P>

<P>CRWR 12106. Intro to Genres: Science Fiction. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A monolith manifests in orbit around Jupiter, emitting a signal. A beacon? A man spontaneously discovers the ability to teleport. An evolutionary accident? The origin of human life proves to be malicious. Divine fate? Space travel is enabled by the ingestion of enormous quantities of a geriatric spice a messianic figure auspiciously learns to manipulate. A drug trip?! Among popular genres, science fiction is the riskiest conceptually and among the trickiest to master. The difference between an amazing idea and a rotten story is often slim. What makes good sci-fi work? And how best to write it? Let's put on our gravity boots and solar visors and see what we can discover. In this course, you'll read some novels (by Frank Herbert, Alfred Bester, and Ursula K. LeGuin), poetry (by Andrew Joron), a graphic novel (by Chris Ware), and screenplays (by Damon Lindelof, and Stanley Kubrick &amp; Arthur C. Clarke). And all the while, you'll try your hand at bending each other's minds with your own science fiction. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Note(s): This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>CRWR 12107. Reading as a Writer: Crime and Story. 100 Units. </P>

<P>If prostitution is the earliest profession, then crime is probably the earliest narrative engine. Crime has always been a driving force behind story, a vehicle not only of plot but of human psychology, social exploration, philosophical investigation, and just plain old suspense. There's something about the darker side of human nature that invites explorations of characters pushed to their extremes. Through analyzing the writing techniques and processes-such as point of view, scene, setting, voice, narrative structure and research methodologies-of such writers and poets as Raymond Chandler, Patricia Highsmith, Walter Mosley, Joyce Carol Oates, Denis Johnson, Carolyn Forché, CK Williams, Nami Mun, James Ellroy, and Richard Price among others, students will examine how elements of crime in story can be transformed beyond simple genre. By examining writers' choices, students will explore how they may use these techniques to develop such mechanics of writing as point of view, poetics, dramatic movement and narrative structure in their own work. Instructor(s): Augustus Rose Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Open bid through classes.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. Note(s): This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>CRWR 12109. Introduction to Genres: Wizards. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Do you believe in wizards? Are you a wizard? Then pack up your talismans, fetishes, and gamelans into the mysterious little satchel you carry at your side and get ready for some incantatory magic. We will investigate the figure of the wizard as an archetype, a literary symbol, a vehicle for fantasy, and as a commanding reality, while considering such things as A Wizard of Earthsea, the figure of Merlin, The Teachings of Don Juan, The Teachings of Ogotemmeli, Harry Potter, Aleister Crowley, the poetry of W. B. Yeats, Nathaniel Mackey, Jay Wright, and Ronald Johnson, as well as some other things too secret to reveal at present, including the nature of esotericism. Instructor(s): Peter O'Leary Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Open bid through classes.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Note(s): This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>CRWR 12127. Reading as a Writer: Hallucinations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we ask: How is historical material made--figured/disfigured by loss, desire, violence, suffering, exhaustion, death; by restlessness and the unbearable, abyssal, vertigo of living inside time? Where is the aperture of experience? The apparitions, which partition night, its many voices, bodies which are forgotten, and then remembered, why? What is the time of writing, of reading? This course goes a little back and a little forward between the two world wars, hoping to track an itinerary of history material, its incandescence, between situations of mourning and mystical experience. Students will be asked to keep a reading notebook as well as to produce weekly creative responses for class discussion. Instructor(s): Lynn Xu Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Satisfies the College Arts/Music/Drama Core requirement. </P>

<P>CRWR 12128. Reading as a Writer: The Sea. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the temporality of the sea? Its consciousness? Where does it begin? Or end? In this course, we will consider the sea both as a figure in our literary, critical, visual, political, historical, and ecological imaginations, as well as a body in itself, iridescent and gleaming at the end of the world. We will look at practices of burial at sea, the infamous &quot;wine dark sea&quot; of Homer, the Middle Passage, the hold and wake of the ship, necropolitics, the concept of sovereignty and bare life, stowaway and asylum seekers, piracy and floating armories, ecomaterialism, the post-human and alien worlds of our oceanic origins, the moon . . . and so on. Students will be asked to keep a reading notebook as well as to produce weekly creative responses for class discussion. &quot;And as you read /the sea is turning /its dark pages /turning /its dark pages&quot; (Denise Levertov, from#To The Reader). Instructor(s): Lynn Xu Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Prerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Satisfies the College Arts/Music/Drama Core requirement. </P>

<P>CRWR 17000. Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Literary Empathy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this fundamentals course, students will investigate the complicated relationship between writers, fictional characters, and readers, toward determining what place#literary#empathy#has in our conversation about contemporary literature.#James Baldwin once observed that,#&quot;You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive.&quot;#We will use weekly reading assignments including fiction, poetry, and creative non-fiction to ask questions about what Virginia Woolf described as the &quot;elimination of the ego&quot; and &quot;perpetual union with another mind&quot; that take place when we read. Students will write critical responses, creative exercises, and a final paper on a topic to be approved by the instructor. Readings include Baldwin, Bishop, Beard, Carson, Walcott,#and Woolf. Instructor(s): Rachel DeWoskin Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Students apply for consent by filling out the CW Seminar Consent Form on creativewriting.uchicago.edu. Students must meet the course application deadline specified on the website. This course is open only to students who have declared the Major in Creative Writing. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. </P>

<P>CRWR 17001. Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Testimony. 100 Units. </P>

<P>To give testimony is to bear witness and to provide evidence. To give testimony is also to draw the reader or listener into an individual point of view. In this course, we will study the first-person voice in various forms of personal testimony. Drawing from a mix of memoirs, personal essays, letters, fiction, and other first-person narratives, we will analyze the techniques and rhetorical devices used by writers, standup comedians, memoirists in transporting the listener or reader into unknowable, unfamiliar experiences. Expect to engage with texts by authors such as Franz Kafka, Patricia Lockwood, Richard Pryor, and William Maxwell. We will compose our own personal writings through creative exercises. A critical paper is also due. Instructor(s): Ling Ma Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Students apply for consent by filling out the application form on creativewriting.uchicago.edu. Students must meet the course application deadline specified on the website. This course is open only to students who have declared the Major in Creative Writing. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 37001 </P>

<P>CRWR 18200. Poetry and the Human III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This spring-quarter Arts course is related to the Humanities course &quot;Poetry and the Human&quot; and is intended as a potential sequel to its first two quarters, but can also be taken as a freestanding course. Through a combination of seminar discussions and creative writing workshop sessions, it focuses upon creative practice (form, flow, and voice) as way of approaching many of the questions raised over the Autumn and Winter terms. It considers the role of poetry in different traditions (Japanese, English, Persian, etc.) from aesthetic, philosophical, and performative angles. Students in the Poetry and the Human sequence (HUMA) will have priority registration for this course; other students may register for any remaining seats. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>CRWR 20200. Technical Seminar in Fiction: Characterization. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This reading and writing seminar will acquaint students with one of the essential tools of fiction writers: characterization. We will read primary texts by authors including Baldwin, Flaubert, Munro, and Wharton, as well as critical work by Danticat, Forester, and Vargas Llosa, toward exploring how some of literature's most famous characters are rendered. How do writers of fiction create contexts in which characters must struggle, and how does each character's conflicts reveal his or her nature? Students will complete both creative and analytical writing exercises, reading responses, and a paper that focuses on characterization in a work of fiction. Instructor(s): Rachel DeWoskin Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Students apply for consent by filling out the CW Seminar Consent Form on creativewriting.uchicago.edu. Students must meet the course application deadline specified on the website. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 40200 </P>

<P>CRWR 20201. Technical Seminar in Fiction: Auto Fiction, Essayism, Truth. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This inter-genre readings course will be of special interest to student writers interested in both fiction and creative nonfiction. We'll look at hybrid works by W.G. Sebald, Teju Cole, Rachel Cusk, and Shelia Heti and also consider writers like Kathryn Harrison, Tobias Wolff, and Gregor von Rezzori, who have addressed the same subjects in both fiction and nonfiction. Finally, we'll dip into Robert Musil's notion of &quot;essayism&quot; as a modern mode of thought and the recent debate over the &quot;lyric essay.&quot; We'll also look at journalistic and/or documentary works by Werner Herzog, Truman Capote, Tom Bissell, Katherine Boo, and Ryszard Kapuściński. By exploring the interestingly smudged line between factual and fictional texts, we'll interrogate both genre categories and ways of perceiving and presenting what's true. Instructor(s): Will Boast Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Students apply for consent by filling out the CW Seminar Consent Form on creativewriting.uchicago.edu. Students must meet the course application deadline specified on the website. Attendance on the first day is mandatory. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 40201 </P>

<P>CRWR 20302. Technical Seminar in Poetry: Units of Composition. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims to investigate, through a range of readings and writing exercises, various units of composition and the ways that they interact with each other in poems. We will study and imitate traditional formal approaches, such as the poetic foot, meter, caesuras, sprung rhythm, rhymed stanzas, and refrains. We also will study and imitate modernist and contemporary &quot;units,&quot; such as the word (approached, for example, etymologically or connotatively), the free verse line, the variable foot, vers libre, serial form, the sentence (the &quot;new&quot; sentence, but also modulations of basic syntax), the paragraph, the page, and forms of call and response. This reading intensive course will draw from a selection of mostly modern and contemporary poetry, poetics, and criticism. Students will be expected to submit weekly technical exercises, complete several short critical responses, write a longer essay, and submit a final portfolio of revised material.

<P>CRWR 20401. Technical Seminar in Nonfiction: The Synecdoche. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Every writer of personal nonfiction knows that ultimately the story isn't about them: it's about something larger, perhaps universal, and their personal story is merely a means to that end. The key to this paradox is the synecdoche, or the part that stands for the whole. It's the grain of sand that contains the universe, the one story that by implication tells other peoples' stories. When Anne Fadiman told the story of a Hmong immigrant to the United States, she told a larger story about immigration in general. So did Joan Didion, in Where I Was From; by telling the story of her family, she told the story of California, and by telling the story of California she told the story of the West and thus of America. Rian Malan did the same in My Traitor's Heart: by telling the story of his family he told the story of Apartheid, and thus of South Africa, and of our segregated world. Through weekly exercises and analytic essays you'll see how these and other writers locate the universal in their particulars, and you'll apply their examples to your own work.

<P>CRWR 21500. Advanced Translation Workshop: Prose Style. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Purple, lean, evocative, muscular, literary, exuberant, lucid, stilted, economical. These are all labels that critics and reviewers have used to characterize prose styles that call attention to themselves in distinct ways. Of course, what constitutes style not only changes over time, but also means different things in different literary traditions. How, then, do translators carry style over from one language and cultural milieu to another? And to what extent does style structure storytelling? We will explore these questions by reading a variety of modern and contemporary stylists who either write in English or translate into English, paying special attention to what stylistic devices are at work and what their implications are for narration, characterization, and world building. Further, we'll examine the range of choices that each writer and translator makes when constituting and reconstituting style, on a lexical, tonal, and syntactic scale. By pairing readings with generative exercises in stylistics and constrained writing, we will build toward the translation of a short work of contemporary fiction into English. To participate in this workshop, students should be able to comfortably read a literary text in a foreign language. Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Instructor consent required.

<P>CRWR 22113. Advanced Fiction Workshop: The Love Story. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This advanced fiction workshop will examine the ways we write about love in fiction: romantic love, familial love, unconventional love, etc.# Our basis will be the notion that love is ultimately self-knowledge, which lies at the core of all great fiction, and like self-knowledge it involves an endless and inexhaustible act of seeking.# We will read and discuss stories centered on the topic of love, this act of seeking, and we will do writing exercises that help us write compellingly, convincingly, and unsentimentally about deeply sentimental things.# Every student will also complete and workshop a full-length story that explores the idea of love on some level.# They will additionally write a significant revision of this story, which they will either present for a second workshop or turn in at the end of the quarter.# Please expect a rigorous but constructive workshop environment where being a critic and an editor is as essential as being a writer.

<P>CRWR 22118. Advanced Fiction Workshop: Constructing a Full Length Novel. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this advanced fiction workshop, students will work on novel-length projects, completing one to two polished chapters and an outline of a full novel. We will explore how to structure a book that is both propulsive and character-driven, and how to create a compelling, unique narrative voice.# Works by James Baldwin, Edith Wharton, Ha Jin, Vladimir Nabokov, and Akhil Sharma will help us consider the crucial relationship between characters and their contexts.

<P>CRWR 22119. Advanced Fiction Workshop: Music in Fiction and Improvised Composition. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This workshop-based course is suitable for any student wishing to refine and expand their understanding of how fiction gets made, and will be of particular interest to those exploring new stylistic possibilities or working in both the disciplines of prose writing and music. We'll look at the Modernists' experiments with refrain, repetition, and pure verbal music, their attempts &quot;to find out what's behind things,&quot; as Woolf put it. We'll consider literary improvisation as Ellison meant the term: the gathering of seemingly disparate materials to synthesize something wildly new. We'll explore how musicians are often allowed (or forced) to cross cultural boundaries through texts like Baldwin's &quot;This Evening, This Morning, So Soon&quot; and interviews with Wendy Carlos and Fred Hersch. We'll also look at the burgeoning field of rhythmology, and use it as a bridge to examine how music also borrows from fiction, through storytelling in song and a guest lecture from a Pulitzer-Prizenominated composer.

<P>CRWR 22121. Advanced Fiction Workshop: Young Adult Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The books and stories we read as teenagers are often some of the most influential in developing our tastes as adult readers and writers of fiction. In this advanced workshop course, we'll discuss the genre of young adult literature through evaluation of your own writing: what are its defining characteristics, and what's the difference between writing for a young adult audience versus writing books and stories about teenagers but designed for adult readers? Students should be working on book-length projects involving teenaged protagonists, no matter the intended audience; please come to the first session with either work to submit or a sense of when you'd be able to sign up for a slot. We'll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become both generous and rigorous critics, and we'll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adult readers and the books we're reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell to classic authors like S. E. Hinton and Madeleine L'Engle. Students will read at least one or two novels during the quarter as well. Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Instructor consent required.

<P>CRWR 24004. Advanced Nonfiction Workshop: Writing in Crisis. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we'll work to write about people and communities who are in crisis, on the verge of crisis, or looking back at crisis. We'll discuss reporting, interviewing, oral history, historical research, working from photography and video, and the ethical situation of the writer. We'll read works by writers such as Liu Xiaobo, Elena Poniatowska, Claudia Rankine, Rebecca Solnit, Edwidge Danticat, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Philip Gourevitch, Arundathi Roy, Leslie Marmon Silko, Rachel Carson, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, on subjects including migration, exile, prison, totalitarian regimes, dissidence, questions of reparation and reconciliation after systematic violence, and environmental activism.

<P>This course is an advanced seminar intended primarily for students writing a Creative BA or MA thesis, as well as Creative Writing Minors completing the portfolio. Because it is a thesis seminar, the course will focus on various ways of organizing larger poetic &quot;projects.&quot; We will consider the poetic sequence, the chapbook, and the poetry collection as ways of extending the practice of poetry beyond the individual lyric text. We will also problematize the notion of broad poetic &quot;projects,&quot; considering the consequences of imposing a predetermined conceptual framework on the elusive, spontaneous, and subversive act of lyric writing. Because this class is designed as a poetry workshop, your fellow students' work will be the primary text over the course of the quarter.

If space allows I'll also admit those who are working on a long piece of nonfiction on their own. It can be an extended essay, memoir, travelogue, literary journalism, or an interrelated collection thereof. It's a workshop, so come to the first day of class with your work underway and ready to submit. You'll edit your classmates' writing as diligently as you edit your own. I focus on editing because writing is, in essence, rewriting. Only by learning to edit other people's work will you gradually acquire the objectivity you need to skillfully edit your own. You'll profit not only from the advice you receive, but from the advice you learn to give. I will teach you to teach each other and thus yourselves, preparing you for the real life of the writer outside the academy.

<H3>Digital Studies of Language, Culture, and History </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64332">The minor in Digital Studies of Language, Culture, and History introduces students to computer programming and the use of cutting-edge software tools for representing, exploring, analyzing, and publishing the products of human language and culture. These products range from everyday speech and writing to historical documents and literary texts, and they encompass music and art as well as mundane objects, places, and institutions. The courses in this minor will help students not just to understand and use digital tools but to see digital computing as a cultural activity in its own right—an activity to be studied with respect to its historical development, social setting, cultural impact, and aesthetic qualities, as well as the ethical problems it creates in our increasingly digitized and networked world. This minor does not require a background in mathematics or computing but is designed for students who are majoring in the humanities or humanistic social sciences. It will also be of interest to students majoring in the sciences who want to acquire programming skills in the context of linguistic, cultural, and historical studies. </P>

<H3>East Asian Languages and Civilizations </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64333">Department Website: http://ealc.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations (EALC) offers a BA program in East Asian studies that introduces students to the traditional and modern civilizations of China, Japan, and Korea, and provides them with the opportunity to achieve a basic reading and speaking knowledge of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. This program is interdisciplinary and students may take relevant courses in both the humanities and the social sciences. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in EALC. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Before declaring their major in EALC, students must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (typically before the end of their second year) to discuss their areas of interest. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students must complete 1300 units toward an EALC major. Up to 300 of those units may be granted via petition based on the completion of a higher-level language course. No courses may be double-counted toward general education requirements or minor requirements. NOTE: The specific requirements described below will apply to students beginning with the Class of 2021. </P>

<P>Students who plan to major in EALC are strongly encouraged (but not required) to meet the general education requirement in civilization studies by taking EALC 10800-10900-11000 Introduction to the Civilizations of East Asia I-II-III. </P>

<P>Language Requirement </P>

<P>To graduate with an EALC major, students must demonstrate competency in a primary East Asian language that is equivalent to the intermediate (second-year) level of the language. Credit for 20100-20200-20300 or the equivalent is required in the major. </P>

<P>Topics in EALC </P>

<P>All students are required to take three &quot;Topics in EALC&quot; courses (EALC 10500-10799). These courses are meant to introduce students to issues in East Asian studies. </P>

<P>Electives in the Major </P>

<P>Students are required to complete seven additional courses (700 units) in the major. Up to 300 units may be additional language credit. Many students will take an additional year of their primary East Asian language or a year of a secondary East Asian language. A beginning language sequence in the primary East Asian language cannot be counted toward the major; beginning sequences are acceptable for secondary languages. This language credit must be earned by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Two quarters of Classical Chinese or Classical Japanese may count either as language or as content courses. </P>

<P>Students who complete their general education requirement in civilization studies with a sequence other than EALC 10800-10900-11000 Introduction to the Civilizations of East Asia I-II-III may take any of those courses as an elective in the major. Students may also take additional Topics in EALC courses as electives in the major. </P>

<P>A maximum of six approved courses taken while studying abroad may be counted toward program requirements by petition to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </P>

<P>Language Credit Earned by Petition </P>

<P>Students with extant proficiency who place into and successfully complete a higher-level course (i.e., 20200 or higher) may petition to receive credit for the language courses between 20100 and the University of Chicago course completed. Credits granted via this petition process may be used toward major requirements, with limits. </P>

<P>EALC 10520. Topics in EALC: Gendered Bodies in East Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An introductory course to the study of gender and sexuality in modern and contemporary East Asia, the course examines the ways in which Korea, Japan, and China have undergone the key changes during modernization during the past century. Focus is given to gendered body and its representations-visual, sound, textual, legal, artistic, and cultural traditions, both established and out-of-establishment, as students discuss issues such as identity, love, sex, family, citizenship, law, violence, war, religion, creativity, work, migration, gendered space, and politics, among others, the topics that involve the issue of embodiment in representations and display in varying degrees. Paying attention to the media specificity of the chosen texts, students will close-read and analytically and critically engage various aspects of the relationship between the substance and the medium of the selected texts. Instructor(s): K. Choi </P>

<P>EALC 10600. Topics in EALC: Ghosts &amp; the Fantastic in Literature and Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is a ghost? How and why are ghosts represented in particular forms in a particular culture at particular historical moments and how do these change as stories travel between cultures? This course will explore the complex meanings, both literal and figurative, of ghosts and the fantastic in traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tales, plays, and films . Issues to be explored include: 1) the relationship between the supernatural, gender, and sexuality; 2) the confrontation of death and mortality; 3) collective anxieties over the loss of the historical past 4) and the visualization (and exorcism) of ghosts through performance. Instructor(s): J. Zeitlin Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): This course can replace what used to be the Concentrators Seminar to fulfill a requirement as an EALC major.

<P>EALC 10603. Topics in EALC: The Chinese Classics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will explore the Chinese classics (Classics of Changes, Documents, Poetry, Spring and Autumn Annals, and the three Ritual classics) at different moments in their traditions: at the time of their first creation, at the time of their canonization as classics, at different moments throughout China's imperial history, and today. Because the Chinese classics have also been regarded as classics in both Korea and Japan, we will also consider their adaptation within those contexts. Instructor(s): E. Shaughnessy Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>EALC 10704. Topics in EALC: The Modern Short Story in East Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Why does the short story emerge as a major literary form across East Asia in the early 20th century? Which institutional, social, and political factors contributed to its diffusion? What are the main characteristics of the short story, how does it organize time and space, and how does it differ from earlier forms of short fiction? What do various authors hope to achieve by writing short stories? Has their writing changed with the rise of new media? Informed by these questions, this course explores the variety of forms that the short story takes in modern East Asia. We will read a selection of influential Chinese, Japanese, and Korean works from the early 20th century to the present, including those by Lu Xun, Shiga Naoya, Hwang Sun-wŏn, Miyamoto Yuriko, Xiao Hong, Na Hye-sŏk, Akutagawa Ryūnosuke, Hoshi Shin'ichi, Lin Bai, Han Shaogong, Yu Hua, and Murakami Haruki, along with theoretical and critical essays. Discussions will be organized around themes that allow for transregional comparisons. All readings in English translation. Instructor(s): P. Iovene Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>EALC 10705. Topics in EALC: Imagining Environment. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces students to the fiction of East Asia through the themes of nature and environment. How have writers imagined the relation between the human and the non-human in the modern era? How have they drawn on indigenous ideas and attitudes? How have they responded to global environmental change and destruction? The course surveys a variety of sources for environmental imagingings, including philosophical and religious attitudes; aesthetic practices; political ideas; and modern environmentalism. All readings are in English. Instructor(s): H. Long Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>EALC 10710. Topics in EALC: Intertwined Literatures of Postwar Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores literature that illustrates the interconnectedness of Asia in the decade following the conclusion of the Second World War. While the surrender of Japan and the onset of the Cold War contributed to the re-entrenchment of fiercely independent national literatures in Asia, national frameworks tend to obscure the ongoing links across Asia evoked in the works of many writers dealing with this period. Further, the notion of the &quot;postwar&quot; tends to disregard the ways in which war's effects continued to shape the Asian continent through Allied occupations and such widespread conflicts as the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. By putting the postwar literatures of Asia in conversation with one another, we will aim to achieve a fuller understanding of these texts that have both depicted international circulation and spread through international communities themselves. Course materials include short stories, novels, plays, reportage, and autobiographical writings from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Tibet, Mongolia, Okinawa, and North and South Korea. All readings for this course are available in English; no knowledge of any Asian language is required. Instructor(s): N. Lambrecht Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>EALC 22235. Revolutionary Romance in Socialist China. 100 Units. </P>

<P>One of the goals of the socialist revolution was to transform social relations, not only those between classes but also family and romantic relations. One of the first laws that the Chinese Communist Party issued after the founding of the People's Republic was the New Marriage Law, which banned arranged marriages, concubinage, and arrangements involving minors. 1950s cinema and literature advertised romantic love as an important achievement of the new society. At the same time, loyalty to the Party and to the collectivity were also core values that the media emphasized. In this class, we will look at how literature and cinema instructed viewers on how to select one's object of love in Revolutionary China, and how love for a romantic partner, for the party, and for the people were differently foregrounded at specific historical moments. How did ideas of romantic love change from the 1940s to the 1980s, and how did cinema contribute to promoting them? What forms of intimacy and models of attachment characterized revolutionary romance? Which kind of person constituted an ideal romantic partner? Who was to be loved, how, and why? Should one orient one's passion toward one person, many, or none? Instructor(s): P. Iovene Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): EALC 32235 </P>

<P>EALC 22451. Social and Economic Institutions of Chinese Socialism, 1949 to 1980. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The socialist period (for our purposes here, c. 1949-1990) fundamentally transformed the institutions of Chinese social and economic life. Marriage and family were redefined; rural communities were reorganized on a collective basis; private property in land and other means of production was abolished. Industrialization created a new urban working class, whose access to welfare, consumer goods, and political rights depended to a large extent on their membership in work units (danwei). Migration between city and countryside came to a halt, and rural and urban society developed in different directions. This course will focus on the concrete details of how this society functioned. How did state planning work? What was it like to work in a socialist factory? What role did money and consumption play in a planned economy? Our readings are in English, but speakers of Chinese are encouraged to use Chinese materials (first-hand sources, if they can be found) for their final papers. Instructor(s): J. Eyferth Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): HIST 34511, EALC 32451, HIST 24511 </P>

<P>EALC 23001. Censorship in East Asia: The Case of Colonial Korea. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the operation and consequences of censorship in the Japanese Empire, with focus on its effects in colonial Korea. It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities' measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship-both external and internal-and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.

<P>EALC 24201. China's Eco-Environmental Challenges and Society's Responses. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In nearly four decades of reform and opening policies, China's economic achievements have come at a high cost for its ecological environment; air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, among other problems, are facts of life for most Chinese citizens. In addition, China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and has recently acknowledged its contributions to global warming and the need for drastic mitigation of greenhouse gases. Facing these tremendous challenges, remarkable shifts in the way that Chinese society communicates and tackles these problems are occurring. This seminar will look, in particular, at relevant public debates, crucial policies, as well as popular initiatives and protest, to approach this wide topic. How is the relationship between humans/society and nature/environment conceptualized and communicated? Can we detect shifts from traditional to modern, even contemporary 'Chinese approaches'? And to what extent and how do political authorities, media, the general population and scientists in China interact in the face of the acknowledged risks that environmental pollution poses to communities, to China's (economic) development and, not least, to individual health and well-being. Basic knowledge about modern Chinese society and politics as well as Chinese reading skills are helpful, but not a strict requirement for participation in this course. Instructor(s): A.L.

<P>EALC 24202. Citizenship in China: Concepts, Practices, Dynamics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How are instances such as the arrest of Gui Minhai, a publisher and Hong Kong business owner who was born in China but has a Swedish passport, in Thailand - apparently by Chinese authorities -, and the large-scale eviction of migrant workers in Beijing due to the lack of residency permits in their own country, related? They raise questions as to how citizenship, i.e. in this case membership in a community, a country/nation state, or a social system is defined and which rights and duties it entails, as well as what are the prerequisites for obtaining and loosing it. In this class we will discuss concepts of citizenship and analyze their representations in modern Chinese society. This includes historical and conceptual-history dimensions and encompasses notions of citizenship that are pertaining to the local, national (incl. empire/civilization), and the global level. Over the course of the semester we will touch upon topics such as forms of inclusion into (and exclusion from) the emerging Chinese 'welfare' model (&quot;social citizenship&quot;), political representation and participation (&quot;political citizenship&quot;), law and rights (&quot;legal citizenship&quot;), domestic and international (im)migration, nationalism, and many more. Basic knowledge about Chinese society and politics as well as Chinese reading skills are helpful, but not a strict requirement for participation in this course. Instructor(s): A. Ahlers Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Knowledge of Chinese helpful but not required. Equivalent Course(s): EALC 34202 </P>

<P>EALC 24411. The Science of Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the modern history of literature as an object of scientific study. In particular, it introduces key moments in the conversation between quantitative methods and literary intepretation from the late-19th century to today. These include physiological theories of the novel; stylistics; book history; sociologies of reading; distant reading; and cultural analytics. At each moment we consider the intellectual contexts that encouraged dialogue between the sciences and literature; probe the theories and models by which this dialogue was framed; and consider its relevance to the practice of literary criticism today. Instructor(s): H. Long Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 34422, ENGL 24422, EALC 34411 </P>

<P>EALC 24626. Japanese Cultures of the Cold War: Literature, Film, Music. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an experiment in rethinking what has conventionally been studied and taught as &quot;postwar Japanese culture&quot; as instances of global Cold War culture. We will look at celebrated works of Japanese fiction, film and popular music from 1945 through 1990, but instead of considering them primarily in relation to the past events of World War Two, we will try to understand them in relation to the unfolding contemporary global situation of the Cold War. We will also look at English-language writing on Japan from during and after the Cold War period. Previous coursework on modern Japanese history or culture is helpful, but not required. All course readings will be in English. Instructor(s): M. Bourdaghs Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): EALC 34626 </P>

<P>EALC 25600. Gender and Modernity in Colonial Korea. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What are the salient forms, manifestations, and performances that can be discussed as aspects found at the intersection between gender experience and Korean colonial modernity? This seminar aims at identifying the characteristics of Japanese or colonially mediated modernization that Koreans experienced in the first half of the twentieth century in order to ultimately generate a broadly meaningful discussion on the texture of colonial cultural experience under its abiding colonial legacy. At the core of the class is a concern with gender. While considering the universal questions of modernized gender, gendered consciousness, and personal/private spaces, discussions will respond to the diverse interests and backgrounds of student participants so as to best facilitate comparative and theoretical discussions on colonial modernity and its postcolonial manifestations. Instructor(s): K. Choi Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): EALC 35600, GNSE 35600, GNSE 25600 </P>

<P>EALC 26800. Korean Literature, Foreign Criticism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Ever since the introduction of the modern/Western concept of &quot;literature&quot; to early twentieth-century Korea, literary production, consumption, and reproduction have gone hand in hand with the reception of the trends of &quot;criticism&quot; and &quot;theory&quot; propagated elsewhere, in the West in particular. This course examines the relationship between the ideas of &quot;indigenous&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; as embodied by Korean writers in the fields of creative writing, journalism, and academia with a view to engaging and interrogating the idea of &quot;national literature&quot; and its institutional manifestations. It further examines artistic and theoretical endeavors by Korean writers and intellectuals to critically reflect upon and move beyond the unquestioned linguistic, ideological, and ethnonational boundaries.

<P>EALC 27501. The Worlds of Honglou meng (Dream of the Red Chamber): Traditional Chinese Novel & Literary Culture. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Written by Cao Xueqin ### (?-1763), Honglou meng (Dream of the Red Chambers###) has been regarded as the greatest masterpiece of Chinese prose fiction. The novel not only displays the unprecedented usage of realistic language in portraying the quotidian life, but also shows intricate literary skills in narrative and lyricism. This class investigates the internal and external worlds of Honglou meng, and reflects on the ethics and aesthetics of novel in late imperial China. We will explore, on the one hand, literary choices that made the novel sophisticated, such as the narrative strategies, the complexity in characterization, and the high degree of intertextuality which shows the creative use of other literary genres (poetry, drama, riddle). On the other hand, reading alongside recent scholarship on material culture and gender studies, we examine the interactive relations between the novel and the fashion of exquisite domestic life in the late imperial society and answer these questions. In what ways did the fashion shape the novel text, and how such fashion affects the production and reception of the novel and influences the ways of reading? Instructor(s): N. Feng Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Open to MAPH students.All readings are in English. Students with Chinese reading ability are encouraged to read the original texts. Optional discussion sessions for learning to read the Chinese text. Equivalent Course(s): EALC 37501 </P>

<P>EALC 28010. Archaeology of Anyang: Bronzes, Inscriptions, and World Heritage. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Anyang is one of the most important archaeological sites in China. The discoveries of inscribed oracle bones, the royal cemetery, clusters of palatial structures, and industrial-scale craft production precincts have all established that the site was indeed the last capital of the Shang dynasty recorded in traditional historiography. With almost continuous excavations since the late 1920s, work at Anyang has in many ways shaped and defined Chinese archaeology and the study of Early Bronze Age China. This course intends to examine the history of research, important archaeological finds, and the role of Anyang studies in the field of Chinese archaeology. While the emphasis is on archaeological finds and the related research, this course will also attempt to define Anyang in the modern social and cultural contexts in terms of world heritage, national and local identity, and the looting and illegal trade of antiquities.

<P>EALC 28015. Archaeology of Bronze Age China. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Bronze Age&quot; in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during which bronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by the society, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. &quot;Bronze Age&quot; in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy. This course will also visit the Smart Museum, the Field Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago to take advantage of the local collections of ancient Chinese arts and archaeology. Instructor(s): Y.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The program in economics is intended to equip students with the basic tools to understand the operation of a modern economy: the origin and role of prices and markets, the allocation of goods and services, and the factors that enter into the determination of income, employment, and the price level. The specialization in data science provides training in computation and data analysis beyond the basic methods discussed in the empirical methods sequence. The specialization in business economics is organized around the fundamental economic theory and empirical methods that students interested in pursuing careers in the private sector, the non-profit sector, and the public sector (among others) will find useful in carrying out their day-to-day tasks. </P>

<P>BA in Economics, Tracks A and B </P>

<P>The program in economics can be divided into five component parts: </P>

</L>

<P>Note: The requirements described below apply to students who matriculated at the University of Chicago in the 2016– 17 academic year or later. Any possible exceptions will be noted. </P>

<P>Program Requirements, Tracks A and B </P>

<P>Fundamentals </P>

<P>Students must begin the economics major by demonstrating competence in basic calculus and principles of economics. The fundamentals sequence consists of the following courses. The first two are required; the second two are strongly recommended: </P>

<P>MATH 13300 Elementary Functions and Calculus III 100 </P>

<P>or MATH 15300 Calculus III </P>

<P>or MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III MATH 19520 Mathematical Methods for Social Sciences 100 or MATH 20400 Analysis in Rn II or MATH 20800 Honors Analysis in Rn II </P>

<P>ECON 10000 Principles of Microeconomics 100 or ECON 19800 Introduction to Microeconomics ECON 10200 Principles of Macroeconomics 100 or ECON 19900 Intro To Macroeconomics </P>

<P>Students who wish to complete the major with more rigorous mathematics may substitute MATH 20400 Analysis in Rn II for MATH 19520 Mathematical Methods for Social Sciences. </P>

<P>Calculus </P>

<P>Students who have an interest in the major should take calculus at the highest level for which they qualify. Students may complete MATH 19520 Mathematical Methods for Social Sciences prior to or concurrently with ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I. Students must not postpone completion of MATH 19520 Mathematical Methods for Social Sciences beyond concurrent registration with ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>MATH 13000s: Students must complete MATH 13300 Elementary Functions and Calculus III prior to enrolling in ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I. Students may find it useful to complete MATH 19520 Mathematical Methods for Social Sciences prior to enrolling in the Elements of Economic Analysis sequence. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>MATH 15000s: Students enrolling in the MATH 15000s sequence must complete MATH 15300 Calculus III before enrolling in ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>MATH 16000s and 16010s: Students enrolling in the MATH 16000s sequences must complete MATH 16200 Honors Calculus II or MATH 16210 Honors Calculus II (IBL) before enrolling in ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I. Enrollment in ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>requires completion or concurrent enrollment in MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III/MATH 16310 Honors </P>

<P>Calculus III (IBL) and demonstrated competency in Microeconomics (see Core Curriculum for details). </P>

<P>Students may satisfy the third quarter of calculus requirement by placement (based on the Higher-Level Math Test administered by the College prior to Orientation). In this case, students should continue their mathematics training with the highest mathematics level for which they qualify. </P>

<P>Principles of Economics </P>

<P>Students are expected to begin their study of economics with ECON 10000 Principles of Microeconomics (formerly ECON 19800 Introduction to Microeconomics) and ECON 10200 Principles of Macroeconomics (formerly ECON 19900 Intro To Macroeconomics). These courses provide a good overview of basic concepts. These two introductory courses are designed for students with limited or no prior course work in economics. While these two courses provide basic economics knowledge, they are not required in the major. Students who matriculated at the University of Chicago in 2016–17 or later may use ECON 19900 Intro To Macroeconomics to fulfill one of the economics elective requirements. </P>

<P>Students may not receive credit for both ECON 10000 Principles of Microeconomics and ECON 19800 Introduction to Microeconomics; and for both ECON 10200 Principles of Macroeconomics and ECON 19900 Intro To Macroeconomics. </P>

<P>Students are strongly encouraged to complete ECON 10200 Principles of Macroeconomics or ECON 19800 Introduction to Microeconomics prior to ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I (or ECON 20010 The Elements of Economic Analysis I Honors) and ECON 10200 Principles of Macroeconomics or ECON 19900 Intro To Macroeconomics prior to ECON 20200 The Elements of Economic Analysis III (or ECON 20210 The Elements of Economic Analysis III Honors). </P>

<P>Core Curriculum </P>

<P>The core curriculum consists of three courses. Students may use the standard or honors sequence to satisfy this requirement. The honors sequence is designed for students interested in economics research and/or use of more sophisticated mathematical models. </P>

<P>Standard Core Sequence 300 </P>

<P>ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I </P>

<P>ECON 20100 The Elements of Economic Analysis II </P>

<P>ECON 20200 The Elements of Economic Analysis III </P>

<P>or Honors Core Sequence </P>

<P>ECON 20010 The Elements of Economic Analysis I Honors </P>

<P>ECON 20110 The Elements of Economic Analysis II Honors </P>

<P>ECON 20210 The Elements of Economic Analysis III Honors </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
300</Figure>

<P>Most students begin the core curriculum in their second year. Those who wish to begin it during their first year must demonstrate competence with the fundamental skills needed in that sequence in the following ways: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must either pass the economics placement test or complete ECON 10000 Principles of Microeconomics/ECON 19800 Introduction to Microeconomics prior to starting ECON 20000 The Elements of Economic Analysis I (or ECON 20100 The Elements of Economic Analysis II). No standardized external exams (IB, AP, nor A-Levels) will substitute, and they rarely serve as sufficient preparation for the economics placement test. Note that the placement test will only be offered Monday evening of the first week of Autumn Quarter. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must satisfy the calculus requirement as discussed in Calculus. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Note: Students who are completing the previous major requirements and are on track to complete ECON 20300 Elements of Economic Analysis IV after Autumn Quarter 2017 should take ECON 23950 Economic Policy Analysis in place of ECON 20300, regardless of matriculation date. </P>

<P>Empirical Methods </P>

<P>In the modern economy, quantitative methods are highly valued skills. Students must satisfy the empirical methods component of the economics major in one of two ways, either as a three-quarter sequence or a two-quarter sequence. Note: The two-quarter sequence is only available to students who matriculated in 2016–17 or later. Those who matriculated in 2015–16 or earlier are required to take the standard three-quarter sequence. </P>

<P>Option A: The three-quarter empirical methods sequence is comprised of a course in linear algebra, a course in statistics, and a course in econometrics, and is designed for students who complete the MATH 15000s sequence or higher. This three-quarter empirical methods sequence covers the broad ranges of scope that the disciplines provide, which will be useful for further quantitative training in the major. </P>

<P>Option B: The two-quarter empirical sequence, comprised of an economics statistical methods course and a course in econometrics, is provided as an alternative for students who want to focus only on the relevant </P>

<P>materials in linear algebra and statistics that pertain to econometrics. ECON 21010 Statistical Methods in Economics teaches the fundamental methods and materials from linear algebra and statistics that are utilized in many economic applications. </P>

<P>Details about each sequence are below. We strongly encourage students to choose the highest mathematical tracks for which they are qualified. Students unsure of which sequence to choose should consult with the Undergraduate Office in the Department of Economics as well as the Department of Mathematics and Department of Statistics. </P>

<P>Option A: Three-Quarter Empirical Methods Sequence </P>

<P>In order to satisfy the empirical methods component of the economics major using a three-quarter sequence, students must complete the following courses. They must be taken in consecutive quarters, beginning with Linear Algebra and concluding with Econometrics: </P>

<P>One of the following: 100 </P>

<P>MATH 19620 Linear Algebra or STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra or MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra or MATH 20700 Honors Analysis in Rn I </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>

<P>One of the following: 100 ECON 21020 Econometrics or ECON 21030 </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
Econometrics - Honors</Figure>

<P>Total Units 300 </P>

<P>Students may not use AP Statistics credit to satisfy the statistics requirement. Students with AP credit will need to expand on their training with STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I, or STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia. Students may not earn credit for both STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications (via course enrollment or AP exam) and STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods. </P>

<P>Students who wish to pursue more advanced training in empirical methods may complete STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra or MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra or MATH 20700 Honors Analysis in Rn I; either STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I or STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia; and ECON 21030 Econometrics - Honors. </P>

<P>Option B: Two-Quarter Empirical Methods Sequence </P>

<P>Option B is available only to students who matriculated at the University of Chicago in 2016–17 and later. In order to satisfy the empirical methods component of the economics major using a two-quarter sequence, students must complete the following: </P>

<P>ECON 21010 Statistical Methods in Economics 100 ECON 21020 </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
Econometrics100</Figure>

<P>Total Units 200 </P>

<P>Students should not begin the empirical methods sequence earlier than concurrently with ECON 20100 The Elements of Economic Analysis II and should take ECON 21010 Statistical Methods in Economics and ECON 21020 Econometrics in consecutive quarters. Students must complete the empirical methods sequence by the end of third year. </P>

<P>Students with credit for both MATH 19620 Linear Algebra and STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods (or more advanced equivalents) may not also earn credit for ECON 21010 Statistical Methods in Economics. </P>

<P>Students who complete the empirical methods component of the major with just two courses (ECON 21010 Statistical Methods in Economics and ECON 21020 Econometrics) must complete an additional economics elective, as discussed in Electives. </P>

<P>Economic Policy </P>

<P>The economic policy requirement provides students the opportunity to apply methods and tools taught in the economics core sequence to analyze current issues centered around monetary and fiscal policy. Most students will complete the economic policy requirement with ECON 23950 Economic Policy Analysis, but students </P>

<P>interested in learning more formal approaches may use one of the other macroeconomics courses listed below to </P>

</Table>

<P>Students who complete more than one of the above courses may apply the additional courses to satisfy the economics elective requirements. ECON 23950 Economic Policy Analysis may not count as an economics elective. Students may not earn credit for both ECON 23950 Economic Policy Analysis and ECON 20300 Elements of Economic Analysis IV. </P>

<P>Note: Students on track to complete ECON 20300 Elements of Economic Analysis IV after Autumn Quarter 2017 should take ECON 23950 Economic Policy Analysis in place of ECON 20300, regardless of matriculation date. </P>

<P>Electives </P>

<P>All students in the economics major must complete a minimum of four additional economics courses to broaden their exposure to areas of applied economics or economic theory. Students who complete the empirical methods component with the two-quarter sequence must complete five economics electives. These courses must have a higher course number than ECON 20200 The Elements of Economic Analysis III, with a couple of exceptions: Neither ECON 21010 Statistical Methods in Economics nor ECON 21030 Econometrics - Honors nor ECON 23950 Economic Policy Analysis can be used to satisfy the economics elective requirements; students who matriculated in 2016–17 or later may use ECON 10200 Principles of Macroeconomics OR ECON 19900 Intro To Macroeconomics to satisfy one of the economics elective requirements. </P>

<P>Students may use one course (pre-approved or approved by petition) outside of the University of Chicago Department of Economics to satisfy their elective requirements. Students may apply only one of the following two exceptions to this rule: </P>

<P>Exception (A): Students who participate in a College-sponsored Study Abroad program may petition to count an additional outside course completed at the host institution to satisfy elective requirements of the major. </P>

<P>Exception (B): Students may count an additional outside course to satisfy elective requirements of the major as long as it is drawn from the list of the pre-approved electives. </P>

<P>These rules imply that at most two courses completed outside the University of Chicago Department of Economics may be used to satisfy the elective requirements of the major. For example, if a student completes two courses as part of a College-sponsored Study Abroad program, then the student has fulfilled the outside electives two-course maximum and must complete the remaining elective requirements in the Department of Economics. </P>

<P>The following are pre-approved outside electives: </P>

<P>Computer Science (only one may be used) </P>

<P>CMSC 10600 Fundamentals Of Programming-2 </P>

<P>Students wanting to appropriately plan their economics major with the courses MATH 20400 Analysis in Rn II, STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I, or STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia should consult with the Undergraduate Program Office in the Department of Economics. </P>

<P>BA in Economics with Specialization in Business Economics </P>

<P>The specialization in business economics is organized around the fundamental economic theory and empirical methods that students interested in pursuing careers in the private sector, the non-profit sector, and the public sector (among others) will find useful in carrying out their day-to-day tasks. Students who begin by following the standard economics major path have several decision points at which they can choose to specialize in business economics. Students should consult early in the first year with the Department of Economics Undergraduate Program to design a curriculum that satisfies their professional goals. </P>

<P>Students pursuing the Economics major must complete a Calculus sequence. However, it is not required for the Specialization in Business Economics. Students are still strongly urged to take Calculus to ensure sufficient quantitative understanding and competence. </P>

<P>Note that BUSN 20000-level (undergraduate-only) versions of courses offered by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (Chicago Booth) will follow some College policies regarding registration, scheduling, grading, etc. The BUSF 30000-level versions will be subject to Chicago Booth's academic and administrative policies. Consult the Chicago Booth website (https://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/taking-courses-at-booth) for details. </P>

<P>Early final grades are not given for economics graduate courses. Economics graduate courses should not be taken in the student’s graduating quarter unless the student will have completed all graduation requirements, irrespective of the economics graduate course. </P>

<P>As with the standard economics program, this specialization is divided into five component parts: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Core: The core component is designed to introduce students to the tools of basic economic analysis. These courses include fundamental course work in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and business education. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Methods: The methods component is designed to introduce students to the different toolkits on which economists rely to analyze problems in both microeconomics and macroeconomics. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Empirical Analysis: The empirical analysis component provides students with the fundamental techniques of data analysis. These courses emphasize the application of empirical methods to relevant examples and develop the essential computer skills students need to lead successful careers. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Perspectives: The perspectives requirement recognizes that successful careers require broad-based understanding of the markets and industries in which our potential majors are likely to participate. This requirement is intended to facilitate both the acquisition of sector-specific knowledge and/or job-specific skills that are likely to provide context for the student's economics and business training. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Electives: Electives from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and the Department of Economics allow students to tailor the program to their interests. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Core </P>

<P>The core component is designed to introduce students to the tools of basic economic analysis. These courses include fundamental course work in microeconomics and macroeconomics. They courses introduce theory but emphasize the application of these tools to standard problems that students are likely to encounter as they carry out their professional activities. The core component consists of three courses: </P>

<P>* BUSN 20000-level versions of these course numbers are forthcoming. </P>

<P>Methods The methods component of the major is designed to expose students to the different toolkits on which economists rely to analyze problems. These methods courses include offerings in basic price theory, game theory, and experimental methods. This component also includes course work that will be useful in macroeconomic and financial analysis. Students must complete one microeconomic methods course and one macroeconomic methods course from the lists below: </P>

<P>Empirical Analysis </P>

<P>The objective of the empirical analysis component is to ensure that students who complete the major are comfortable carrying out data analysis in various forms. This requires that students gain familiarity with basic statistics and basic econometric methods. These courses will emphasize the application of empirical methods to relevant examples and develop essential computer skills. </P>

<P>Perspectives </P>

<P>The perspectives requirement consists of one course that can come from any division in the University. This requirement recognizes that successful careers require broad-based understanding of the markets and industries in which our potential majors are likely to participate. This requirement is intended to facilitate the acquisition of sector-specific knowledge and/or job-specific skills that are likely to provide context for the economics and business training to which students will receive exposure while completing the specialization business economics. It is expected that students use this perspectives component as a stepping-stone to design a meaningful set of courses that complement their training in business economics. </P>

<P>It is important to emphasize that there are many courses across the University that students can use to satisfy the perspectives requirement. A list of courses pre-approved for this requirement may be found on the departmental website (https://economics.uchicago.edu/content/specialization-business-economics), but students may petition the Department of Economics to use other suitable courses. </P>

<P>Electives </P>

<P>Students must take five electives to complete the specialization in business economics: three from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, as defined below, and two from the University of Chicago Department of Economics. A student may, by petition, use a course from outside Chicago Booth and the Department of Economics as, at most, one business economics elective. </P>

<P>A note on professional school courses: The rules of the College allow students to use no more than four courses from professional schools to satisfy degree requirements. The specialization in business economics requires four courses taken at Chicago Booth. If a student successfully petitions to use a course from a professional school other than Chicago Booth (e.g., the Law School or the Harris School of Public Policy) in the major, then College rules require that the approved course substitute for a Chicago Booth elective. Be aware that undergraduates may enroll in a total of six professional school courses, but the last two courses would be ineligible to satisfy any undergraduate degree requirement. </P>

<P>Courses in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business </P>

<P>The courses at Chicago Booth that students can use to meet the electives requirements are categorized in eight different “bundles.” Courses in the table below with an asterisk (*) are also eligible for the Foundations of Business Education requirement; however, a course used to satisfy the core requirement in the major cannot be also counted as an elective. Students must complete four distinct Booth courses: one Foundations in Business Education and three electives. In order to expose students to different subfields in business education, the four Booth courses used to fulfill the core and elective requirements must be drawn from at least three of the thematic bundles listed below. </P>

<P>NOTE: Undergraduate (BUSN 20000-level) numbers forthcoming for all courses. BUSN 20000-level (undergraduate-only) versions of these courses will follow some College policies regarding registration, scheduling, grading, etc. The BUSF 30000-level versions will be subject to Chicago Booth's academic and administrative policies.

<P>* These courses are also eligible for the Foundations of Business Education requirement; however, a course used to satisfy the core requirement in the major cannot also be counted as an elective. Students must complete four distinct Chicago Booth courses: one Foundations of Business Education course and three electives. In order to expose students to different subfields in business education, the four Chicago Booth courses used to fulfill the core and elective requirements must be drawn from at least three of the thematic bundles listed here. </P>

<P>Students may further their business education by completing two additional Booth courses, potentially from Booth courses outside of the bundle list below (subject to the discretion of the instructor). However, per College rules, they will not count toward any degree requirements. </P>

<P>Courses in the Department of Economics </P>

<P>Students in the specialization in business economics must complete at least two electives in the Department of Economics. These may be ECON courses with numbers between 10200 and 19800, or numbers above 20200, assuming that the student has the appropriate prerequisites for the course. Note that ECON 21010, ECON 21020, ECON 21030, and ECON 23950 are exceptions to this and cannot be used to satisfy the elective requirement for the specialization in business economics. </P>

<P>* Credit may be granted by examination. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Successful completion of the economics major requires both a major GPA of 2.0 or higher and a minimum grade of C– in all courses counted for the major program. In addition, students majoring in economics must receive quality grades in all courses required as part of the major. Non-majors may take economics courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C– or higher constitute passing work. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To be considered for honors, students must meet the following requirements: (1) a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major and a GPA of 3.2 or higher overall, (2) participation in the honors workshop and sole authorship of an independent research paper on a topic in economics, and (3) a faculty sponsor's letter evaluating this independent research paper. For award of honors, the project must receive a grade of A or A–. At the beginning of the student's fourth year, the economics honors committee must have a letter from an economics faculty sponsor expressing willingness to oversee the student's writing of an independent research paper and recommending the student be admitted into the honors workshop program. Honors papers should be outgrowths of economics electives or research assistant work for the faculty sponsor. </P>

<P>Participation in the ECON 29800 Undergraduate Honors Workshop is mandatory throughout the year. Upon completion of the paper in the Spring Quarter, the student will then be retroactively registered for the course in the fourth-year quarter of the student's choosing. Plan for this retroactive registration with your College adviser. </P>

<P>The research paper, a transcript, and a recommendation letter from the faculty sponsor evaluating the independent research paper must be submitted to the undergraduate economics program office for consideration by the economics honors committee no later than the end of fourth week of the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. Students wishing to qualify for honors should (1) engage in preparatory course work in the area of interest no later than Spring Quarter of their third year and (2) consult with the program advisers no later than Winter Quarter of their third year. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program chair. Approval from both program chairs is required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Preparation for PhD Programs in Economics </P>

<P>Students preparing to pursue a PhD program in economics should complete advanced course work in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The real analysis sequence offered by the Mathematics Department, MATH 20300-20400-20500 Analysis in Rn I-II-III (or its honors variant MATH 20700-20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn I-II-III) contains material that is particularly important for economics graduate school. Students who used MATH 13300 Elementary Functions and Calculus III or MATH 15300 Calculus III to fulfill the calculus requirement will need to take MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis to transition into the real analysis sequence. Completion of this course work allows students to participate in higher level electives that may also be helpful for their chosen path of study in graduate school. </P>

<P>Completion of either STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I or STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia and either MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra or STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra will allow students to continue their training in statistics and econometrics at an advanced level. </P>

<P>Increasingly, graduate programs expect students to have sophisticated programming skills. Completion of CMSC 15100-15200 Introduction to Computer Science I-II is strongly encouraged. </P>

<P>In addition, students who are interested in pursuing graduate study are encouraged to take appropriate courses from other departments in the social sciences to obtain a well-rounded perspective of their areas of interest. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to seek research assistant jobs and may self-subscribe to the Research Assistant Jobs (https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/info/chicago_economics-researchasst) listhost to receive updates on job postings. </P>

<P>Provisional and early final grades are not given for economics graduate courses. Economics graduate courses should not be taken in the student’s graduating quarter unless the student will have completed 42 credits, not counting the economics graduate course, and all requirements for all majors." </P>

<P>It is important that such students consult early in the second year with one of the directors of the undergraduate program to design a plan of course work and research. Contact juliew@uchicago.edu for appointments. </P>

<P>Economics Courses </P>

<P>ECON 10000. Principles of Microeconomics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By way of economic theory, applications, and contemporary issues, this course treats (1) the behavior and decision making on the part of individuals, business firms, and governments; and (2) the function of costs, prices, incentives, and markets in the American economy. We discuss contemporary topics (e.g., distribution of income, the environment, education, sports, health care). This course is formerly known as Econ 19800: Introduction to Microeconomics. Students may substitute &quot;Econ 20000: The Elements of Economic Analysis I&quot; for this course in the business economics track. Instructor(s): A. Sanderson; M. Lee Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter </P>

<P>ECON 10200. Principles of Macroeconomics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By way of theory and public policy applications, this course covers current major domestic and international macroeconomic issues in the U.S. economy, including the determination of income and output, inflation, unemployment, and economic growth; money, banking, and the Federal Reserve System; federal spending, taxation, and deficits; and international trade, exchange rates, and the balance of payments. This course is formerly known as Econ 19900: Introduction to Macroeconomics. Students may substitute &quot;Econ 20200: The Elements of Economic Analysis III&quot; for this course in the business economics track. Instructor(s): A. Sanderson Terms Offered: Spring Winter </P>

<P>ECON 11020. Introduction to Econometrics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces students to the practice of econometrics by focusing on the use of multivariate regression as a tool to establish causal relations. We emphasize practical aspects and processes of empirical research: data collection, analysis, and presentation (both written and oral). The goal is for students to critically read and evaluate existing research in the form of peer reviewed journal articles. Instructor(s): Staff Prerequisite(s): ECON 21010 or STAT 23400 or STAT 24400 </P>

<P>ECON 12210. Economic History II: The Early Modern World, circa 1300-1800. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course both describes preindustrial economic life and weighs the models used to explain fundamental changes to it. We will begin by describing some of the basic structures that determined patterns of production, exchange, and consumption in a period of low and easily reversible growth. These include agricultural productivity, demographic constraints, modes of transportation, and the social structures that governed the distribution of what little surplus premodern societies produced. Turning to the sources of economic dynamism that may have contributed to later industrialization, we will first examine the growth of long-distance trade networks starting in the late fourteenth century. How were traditional economies characterized by limited movement stimulated by the circulation of people, goods, and money from afar? We will then move to a discussion of the factors leading to (or frustrating) transformational patterns of economic growth: agricultural productivity, institutions, &quot;proto-industrial&quot; production in an era of limited urban growth, and changing norms of consumption. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Economic History, from Sumer to the Global World. Instructor(s): P. Cheney &amp; K. Pomeranz Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): History Gateways are introductory courses meant to appeal to 1st- through 3rd-yr students who may not have done previous course work on the topic of the course; topics cover the globe and span the ages.

<P>ECON 19000. Economics for Everyone. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The field of economics has generated a powerful set of insights which have fundamentally shaped the modern world. Because modern economics puts such a heavy stress on mathematical rigor, the most interesting economic ideas often get pushed to the background. In this course, we will explore these big economic ideas, without the math. Our goal is to make the beauty and power of economic thinking available to everyone. We will discuss what it means to think like an economist, how you can use economic thinking to make the world a better place (or to take advantage of your friends and enemies, if you prefer), and also how sometimes thinking like an economist can get you into trouble. Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>ECON 19100. Economics for Everyone: Macro. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the big ideas in macroeconomics in a way that is enjoyable and accessible, with minimal reliance on mathematics. The goal is to provide an introduction to macroeconomic issues for people who have never before studied macroeconomics (and who might never study it again), so that they can understand and contribute to ongoing discussions in the news and on social media. We will demystify some of the major macroeconomic questions of our times: Why is there unemployment? Why are some countries poor? What's the big deal about government debt? How high should we set taxes? What gives money and stocks their value? What does the Fed do? And why did all those economists win Nobel Prizes? We will show the fun, interesting, and strange sides of macroeconomics. Instructor(s): G. Kaplan Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>ECON 19800. Introduction to Microeconomics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By way of economic theory, applications, and contemporary issues, this course treats (1) the behavior and decision making on the part of individuals, business firms, and governments; and (2) the function of costs, prices, incentives, and markets in the American economy. We discuss contemporary topics (e.g., distribution of income, the environment, education, sports, health care). Instructor(s): A. Sanderson, J. List Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring </P>

<P>ECON 19900. Intro To Macroeconomics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By way of theory and public policy applications, this course covers current major domestic and international macroeconomic issues in the U.S. economy, including the determination of income and output, inflation, unemployment, and economic growth; money, banking, and the Federal Reserve System; federal spending, taxation, and deficits; and international trade, exchange rates, and the balance of payments. Instructor(s): A. Sanderson Terms Offered: Autumn,Winter </P>

<P>ECON 20000-20100-20200-20300. The Elements of Economic Analysis I-II-III-IV. </P>

<P>ECON 20000. The Elements of Economic Analysis I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course develops the economic theory of consumer choice. This theory characterizes optimal choices for consumers given their incomes and preferences, as well as the relative prices of different goods. This course develops tools for analyzing how these optimal choices change when relative prices and consumer incomes change. Finally, this course presents several measures of consumer welfare. Students learn how to evaluate the impact of taxes and subsidies using these measures. Completion of ECON 19800 is strongly recommended of students without a prior microeconomics course. Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Prerequisite(s): MATH 13300 (with prior completion of or at least concurrent with MATH 19520), MATH 15300, or 16300. First-year students must also pass the economics placement exam or complete ECON 19800. </P>

<P>ECON 20100. The Elements of Economic Analysis II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a continuation of ECON 20000. The first part of this course discusses markets with one or a few suppliers. The second part focuses on demand and supply for factors of production and the distribution of income in the economy. This course also includes some elementary general equilibrium theory and welfare economics. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Winter Prerequisite(s): ECON 20000 or 20010 </P>

<P>ECON 20200. The Elements of Economic Analysis III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>As an introduction to macroeconomic theory and policy, this course covers the determination of aggregate demand (i.e., consumption, investment, the demand for money); aggregate supply; and the interaction between aggregate demand and supply. We also discuss economic growth, business cycle, inflation and money. Completion of ECON 19900 is strongly recommended of students without a prior macroeconomics course.

<P>ECON 26700. Economics of Education. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores economic models of the demand for and supply of different forms of schooling. The course examines the markets for primary, secondary, and post-secondary schooling. The course examines numerous public policy questions, such as the role of government in funding or subsidizing education, the design of public accountability systems, the design of systems that deliver publicly funded (and possibly provided) education, and the relationship between education markets and housing markets. Instructor(s): D. Neal Terms Offered: TBD Prerequisite(s): ECON 21020 or ECON 21030 Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 26705 </P>

<P>ECON 26800. Energy and Energy Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course shows how scientific constraints affect economic and other policy decisions regarding energy, what energy-based issues confront our society, how we may address them through both policy and scientific study, and how the policy and scientific aspects can and should interact. We address specific technologies, both those now in use and those under development, and the policy questions associated with each, as well as with more overarching aspects of energy policy that may affect several, perhaps many, technologies. Instructor(s): S. Berry, G. Tolley Terms Offered: TBD. May be offered 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): PQ: Third- or fourth-year standing.

<P>ECON 26920. Behavioral Economics and Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness? Instructor(s): J. Leitzel Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 28805 </P>

<P>ECON 27000. International Economics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course covers international economics with an emphasis on international trade. The basic theories of international trade are introduced and used to analyze welfare and distributional effects of international trade, government policies, and technology diffusion. In addition, this course also discusses the main empirical patterns of international trade and international investment. Instructor(s): F. Tintelnot Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): ECON 20100 Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 27000 </P>

<P>ECON 27700. Health Economics and Public Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores theoretical and empirical facets of the economics of health care and the industrial organization of the health care sector. The course primarily follows the approach of model-driven empirical work, combining economic modelling with experimental and observational data to test for and quantify theoretical predictions. Topics include asymmetric information, adverse selection, demand for medical care, health care externalities, regulation of health insurance markets, health care outside the US, and public and private incentives for medical research. A particular emphasis is on how government regulation and market incentives interact in generating socially relevant outcomes. Instructor(s): P. Tebaldi Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): ECON 20100 required, ECON 21020 strongly preferred </P>

<P>ECON 28060. The Economics of Organizations: An Experimental Perspective. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course offers an introduction to the experimental methodology while at the same time providing the students with up-to-date insights and findings on how to run an organization and how to manage a workforce.

Topics include the sports business; market structures and outcomes; the market for franchises; barriers to entry, rival leagues, and expansion; cooperative, competitive, and collusive behavior among participants; labor markets, productivity, and compensation of players; racial discrimination; public policies and antitrust legislation; and financing of stadiums. Instructor(s): A. Sanderson Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): ECON 20100; ECON 21020 or ECON 21030 strongly recommended </P>

<P>ECON 28600. Economic Analysis of Law. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course involves the application of the choice theory of economics to the opportunities obtainable within different legal environments. The likelihood that a person will choose to return a lost wallet, keep a promise, drive more carefully, or heed the terms in a will is partly a function of the applicable laws and regulations. Alternative rules, under the standard Law and Economics approach, are compared in terms of the economic efficiency of their subsequent outcomes. This efficiency lens of Law and Economics is applied to rules concerning property, torts, contracts, and criminal behavior. Instructor(s): J. Leitzel Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): ECON 20100 Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 28605 </P>

<P>ECON 28620. Crony Capitalism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The economic system prevailing in most of the world today differs greatly from the idealist version of free markets generally taught in economic classes. This course analyzes the role played by corporate governance, wealth inequality, regulation, the media, and the political process in general in producing these deviations. It will explain why crony capitalism prevails in most of the world and why it is becoming more entrenched also in the United States of America. The course, which requires only basic knowledge of economics, welcomes undergraduates. Grades will be determined as follows: 40% by the sum of all the homework, 30% by class participation and 30% by the final. Registration for this class concludes at the end of week 1. </P>

<P>ECON 28700. The Economics of Crime. 100 Units. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_64335">Department Website: http://english.uchicago.edu Program of Study </P>

<P>The undergraduate program in English Language and Literature provides students with the opportunity to intensively study works of literature originally written in English. Courses address fundamental questions about topics such as the status of literature within culture, the literary history of a period, the achievements of a major author, the defining characteristics of a genre, the politics of interpretation, the formal beauties of individual works, and the methods of literary scholarship and research. </P>

<P>The study of English may be pursued as preparation for graduate work in literature or other disciplines, or as a complement to general education. Students in the Department of English Language and Literature learn how to ask probing questions of a large body of material; how to formulate, analyze, and judge questions and their answers; and how to present both questions and answers in clear, cogent prose. To the end of cultivating and testing these skills, which are central to virtually any career, each course offered by the English Department stresses writing. </P>

<P>Although the main focus of the English Department is to develop reading, writing, and research skills, the value of bringing a range of disciplinary perspectives to bear on the works studied is also recognized. Besides offering a wide variety of courses in English, the English Department encourages students to integrate the intellectual concerns of other fields into their study of literature. This is done by permitting up to three courses outside the English Department to be counted as part of the major if a student can demonstrate the relevance of these courses to his or her program of study. Those interested in creative writing should see Creative Writing below. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The Department of English requires a total of 13 courses: 11 courses taken within the Department of English and two language courses beyond the College requirement or their equivalent, as well as a Cluster Statement to be submitted by the end of the third week of Spring Quarter of a student’s third year. The program presupposes the completion of the general education requirement in the humanities (or its equivalent), in which basic training is provided in the methods, problems, and disciplines of humanistic study. </P>

<P>Language Requirement </P>

<P>Because literary study is enriched by some knowledge of other cultural expressions, the major in English requires students to extend their knowledge of a language beyond the level required of all College students. All students must complete two quarters of study at the second-year level in a language other than English (or the equivalent as determined by petition). </P>

<P>NOTE: If a student has placed into a language's 20200-level course, they should take the course they have tested into. Upon completion, they can go through the Language Center (https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/ college.uchicago.edu/files/attachments/language_petition.pdf) petition process to receive back credit for the skipped intermediate-level course (20100). Students who place into a language course beyond 20200 (that is, the third course of the intermediate level, or above) and would like to discuss the possibility of petitioning for a substitute to the language requirement, should provide the Student Affairs Assistant with an official copy of their placement results and set up an appointment. </P>

<P>Alternatively, students may take two courses in an advanced computer language. As of Autumn 2013, the following course combinations may be taken to satisfy the language requirement: </P>

<P>CMSC 12100-12200 Computer Science with Applications I-II, </P>

<P>CMSC 15100-15200 Introduction to Computer Science I-II, or </P>

<P>CMSC 16100-16200 Honors Introduction to Computer Science I-II. </P>

<P>Course Distribution Requirements </P>

<P>The major in English requires at least 11 departmental courses. Students may substitute up to three courses from departments outside English with the permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Departmental courses should be distributed among the following: </P>

<P>Gateway Requirement </P>

<P>Early on, students are required to take at least one of our three introductions to a genre (fiction, poetry, or drama), all of which introduce students to techniques for formal analysis and close reading. Alternatively, one course from the &quot;Approaches to Theater&quot; sequence (ENGL 10950 Approaches to Theater </P>

<P>I: Ancient to Renaissance or ENGL 10951 Approaches to Theater II: Late 17th Century to the Present) may be taken to fulfill this requirement. NOTE: ENGL 10800 Introduction to Film Analysis does NOT satisfy the Gateway requirement and may only be used as an elective. </P>

<P>One English &quot;Introduction to&quot; a genre (poetry, fiction, drama) or &quot;Approaches to Theater" course </P>

<P>Genre Requirement </P>

<P>Because an understanding of literature demands sensitivity to various conventions and genres, students are required to take at least one course in each of the genres of fiction, poetry, and drama (one of these courses may be the gateway course above). </P>

<P>One English course in fiction </P>

<P>One English course in poetry </P>

<P>One English course in drama </P>

<P>Period Requirement </P>

<P>Reading and understanding works written in different historical periods require skills and historical information that contemporary works do not require. Students are accordingly asked to study a variety of historical periods in order to develop their abilities as readers, to discover areas of literature that they might not otherwise explore, and to develop their knowledge of literary history. To meet the period requirement in English, students should take at least one course in each of the following: </P>

<P>One English course in literature written before 1650 </P>

<P>One English course in literature written between 1650 and 1830 </P>

<P>One English course in literature written between 1830 and 1940 </P>

<P>One English course in literary or critical theory. Courses fulfilling this requirement are designated in our course listings. </P>

<P>NOTE: Many courses satisfy several requirements. For example, a gateway course could also satisfy a genre requirement, or a course on Chaucer could satisfy the genre requirement for poetry and the pre-1650 requirement. The description for each English course includes the distribution areas the course is eligible to satisfy. For details about the requirements met by specific courses, students should consult the Student Affairs Assistant. </P>

<P>Cluster Statement </P>

<P>The purpose of the Cluster Statement is to help students organize and give coherence to their individual program of study. Students will design a cluster of at least five courses that share a conceptual focus. By the end of the third week in Spring Quarter of their third year, students should submit a Cluster Worksheet and one-to-two-page statement to their departmental advisor and then the Student Affairs Assistant outlining their interests in the field and designating a “cluster” of at least five courses. Up to two of these courses may be from departments outside English. Students will design a personalized cluster that falls under one of the following four general rubrics: (1) literary and critical theory, (2) form/genre/medium, (3) literature in history, (4) literature and culture(s). Students may include Creative Writing courses within their clusters. See the English Department website (http://english.uchicago.edu/undergrad/undergrad-requirements/#Cluster) for more information. </P>

<P>Electives Electives to make up a total of 11 courses. These may include: </P>

<P>Seminars in Research and Criticism </P>

<P>These courses, limited to 15 third- and fourth-year students who have already fulfilled the department’s Gateway requirement and taken at least two further English courses, examine different topics and change from year to year. All seminars focus on the analytical, research, and bibliographic skills necessary for producing a substantial seminar paper (around 15–20 pages). They are particularly recommended for those wishing to pursue graduate studies in English, those who wish to write a strong critical BA paper, or those interested in research methods in English. </P>

<P>Makers Seminars </P>

<P>These courses culminate in a final project that can take a variety of forms beyond the research paper. These courses are limited to third- and fourth-year English majors, but non-majors may petition the instructor for admission. </P>

<P>For updated course information, visit english.uchicago.edu/courses. For required student forms, visit english.uchicago.edu/undergrad/resources. </P>

<P>BA Project </P>

<P>NOTE: English no longer offers a Creative BA option. Students interested in completing a creative BA project should instead elect the Creative Writing major. </P>

<P>The BA Project is an optional component of the English major, but students who wish to be considered for departmental honors must submit a Critical BA Project. </P>

<P>All BA writers must attend a mandatory research info session, which will be held towards the end of Spring Quarter. The session will prepare students for the preliminary work they will complete for their project during the summer before their fourth year. The student is required to work on an approved topic over the course of the fourth year of study and to submit a final version to the Director of Undergraduate Studies that has been critiqued by both a faculty advisor and a graduate student preceptor and has gone through revisions based on this feedback and guidance. </P>

<P>Students who wish to use the BA Project in English to meet the same requirement in another major should discuss their proposals with both Directors of Undergraduate Studies no later than the end of their third year. A consent form, to be signed by both departments, is available from the College advising office. It must be completed and returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>The BA Project may develop from a paper written in an earlier course or from independent research. Students who wish to complete a BA Project must submit a proposal (available on the English Department website (http://english.uchicago.edu/undergrad/resources)) by the end of Spring Quarter of their third year. On this form, they identify a faculty member who will serve as their project advisor. </P>

<P>Students work on their BA Project over three quarters. Prior to the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year, students will be assigned a graduate student preceptor who will help them develop pieces of their project and suggest revisions. Over Autumn Quarter, students will attend a series of mandatory colloquia led by the preceptors to prepare them for the upcoming quarter when the bulk of the writing occurs. In the Winter and Spring Quarters, students will continue to meet with their preceptors and will also consult with their individual faculty advisor. </P>

<P>In consultation with the faculty advisor and graduate preceptor, students submit a near-final draft of their paper by the end of week two of Spring Quarter. By the beginning of the fifth week, students submit the final version of their project to their preceptor, faculty advisor, and the Student Affairs Assistant. </P>

<P>Students may elect to register for the BA Project Preparation Course (ENGL 29900) for one quarter credit. Note that the grade for this course is on work toward the BA Project and is normally submitted in Spring Quarter even when the course has been taken in an earlier quarter. See Reading Courses for other information. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Completion of a BA Project does not guarantee a recommendation for departmental honors. For honors candidacy, a student must have at least a 3.25 grade point average overall and a 3.6 GPA in the major (grades received for transfer credit courses are not included into this calculation). </P>

<P>To be eligible for honors, a student's BA Project must be judged to be of the highest quality by the graduate student preceptor, faculty advisor, and Director of Undergraduate Studies. Honors recommendations are made to the Master of the Humanities Collegiate Division by the department and it is the Master of the Humanities Collegiate Division who makes the final decision. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements for the Major </P>

<P>The Department of English requires a total of 13 courses: 11 courses taken within the Department of English and two language courses or their equivalent, as well as a Cluster Statement to be submitted by the end of the third week of Spring Quarter of a student’s third year. By Winter Quarter of their third year, students must also meet with the Student Affairs Assistant to review their English Requirements Worksheet. </P>

<P>* The Cluster Statement must be submitted by the end of the third week of Spring Quarter of a student’s third year. This requirement is worth 000 units. See the section &quot;Cluster Statement&quot; above for details. </P>

<P>Courses Outside the Department Taken for Program Credit </P>

<P>A maximum of three courses outside the Department of English may count toward the total number of courses required by the major. Two of these may count toward the student’s &quot;cluster.&quot; The student, after discussion with the Student Affairs Assistant, may submit a petition for course approval to the Director of Undergraduate Studies before taking courses outside the English Department for credit toward the major. Such courses may be selected from related areas in the University (history, philosophy, religious studies, social sciences, etc.) or they may be taken from a study abroad program. </P>

<P>Four total Creative Writing (CRWR) courses may be counted toward the elective requirement without a petition. </P>

<P>Transfer credits for courses taken at another institution are subject to approval by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and are limited to a maximum of three courses. Transferred courses do not contribute to the student's University of Chicago grade point average for the purpose of computing an overall GPA, dean's list, or honors. NOTE: The Office of the Dean of Students in the College must approve the transfer of all courses taken at other institutions, with the exception of courses taken as part of a University-sponsored study abroad program. For details, visit the Transfer Credit page. </P>

<P>Creative Writing </P>

<P>Undergraduate students may also declare a major in Creative Writing. Students who are not majoring in English Language and Literature or Creative Writing may declare the minor in English and Creative Writing. Students interested in pursuing these options should contact the Program Coordinator for Creative Writing for further information. Please note that there is no minor solely in English. The minor in English and Creative Writing for non–English majors is the only minor available through the Department of English Language and Literature. </P>

<P>Double Majors in English Language and Literature and Creative Writing </P>

<P>When students choose a double major in Creative Writing and English Language and Literature, they may count up to four courses towards both majors. These four courses will typically include the three Literature Courses and the Literary Genre course, but in some cases one of these slots might be filled by a CRWR course (with Director of Undergraduate Studies approval). However, the two Research Background Electives required for the Creative Writing major should be taken outside of the Department of English Language and Literature. </P>

<P>This means that a maximum of four English Language and Literature courses, including the Literary Genre course, can count towards the Creative Writing major. </P>

<P>Students who are pursuing only the English Language and Literature major may count up to four CRWR courses towards the major in English as electives without a petition. However, when students are pursuing a double major in English Language and Literature and Creative Writing, they must observe the shared four-course maximum, so any eligible CRWR courses beyond this cap must be counted towards English only. </P>

<P>Minor in English and Creative Writing </P>

<P>Students who are not English Language and Literature or Creative Writing majors may complete a minor in English and Creative Writing. Such a minor requires six courses plus a portfolio of creative work. At least two of the required courses must be Creative Writing (CRWR) workshop courses, with at least one being an Advanced Workshop. Three of the remaining required courses may be taken in either the Department of English Language and Literature (ENGL) or the Program in Creative Writing (CRWR). This may include CRWR Technical Seminars or general education courses, as long as they are not already counted toward the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>In addition, students must enroll in one of the following workshops offered during the Winter Quarter: CRWR 29200 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=CRWR%2029200) Thesis/Major Projects: Fiction; CRWR 29300 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=CRWR%2029300) Thesis/Major Projects: Poetry; CRWR 29400 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=CRWR%2029400)Thesis/Major Projects: Creative Nonfiction. Finally, students must submit a portfolio of their work (e.g., a selection of poems, one or two short stories or chapters from a novel, two or three nonfiction pieces) to the Creative Writing program coordinator by the end of the fifth week in the quarter in which they plan to graduate. Students will work with a graduate student preceptor to compile and refine their final portfolios. </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program in English and Creative Writing must meet with the program administrator for Creative Writing before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Students choose courses in consultation with the administrator. The administrator's </P>

<P>approval for the minor program should be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser. </P>

<P>Students completing this minor will be given enrollment preference for CRWR Advanced Workshops and Thesis/Major Projects Workshops, and they must follow all relevant admission procedures described at the Creative Writing (https://creativewriting.uchicago.edu) website. For details, see Enrolling in Creative Writing Courses (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/creativewriting/#Enrolling%20in%20Creative%20Writing %20Courses). </P>

<P>Courses in the minor (1) may not be doubly counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and </P>

<P>(2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades (not P/F), and at least half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Minor to Major and Major to Minor </P>

<P>Student circumstances change, and thus a transfer between the major and minor programs may be desirable to students who begin a course of study in either program. Workshop courses (including Beginning Workshops) and one Technical Seminar may count towards the minor, but Fundamentals in Creative Writing will not. The Thesis/Major Projects Workshop will also function as a portfolio workshop for minors. Students should consult with their College adviser if considering such a change and must update their planned program of study with the Program Coordinator or Director of Undergraduate Studies in Creative Writing. </P>

<P>Enrollment in ENGL 29700 Reading Course or ENGL 29900 Independent BA Paper Preparation requires approval from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. They may be eligible to fulfill requirements for the major if they are taken for a quality grade (not P/F) and include a final paper assignment. No student may use more than two readings courses in the major. Critical BA writers who wish to register for ENGL 29900 Independent BA Paper Preparation must arrange for appropriate faculty supervision and obtain the permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. ENGL 29900 Independent BA Paper Preparation counts as an English elective but not as one of the courses fulfilling distribution requirements for the major. </P>

<P>NOTE: Reading courses are special research opportunities that must be justified by the quality of the proposed plan of study; they also depend upon the availability of faculty supervision. No student can expect a reading course to be arranged automatically. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students majoring in English must receive quality grades (not P/F) in all 13 courses taken to meet the requirements of the program. Non-majors may take English courses for P/F grading with consent of instructor. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to declare a major in English as early as possible, ideally before the end of their second year. Students who declare the major after their second year must notify the Student Affairs Assistant to ensure that departmental advising assignments are arranged. After declaring the major, students should arrange a meeting with the Student Affairs Assistant, who will help students fill out the English Requirements Worksheet. Students should also subscribe to the departmental email list for majors (ugradenglish@lists.uchicago.edu) (ugrad-english@lists.uchicago.edu) to ensure that they do not miss important communications from the undergraduate office. </P>

<P>Third-year students will be assigned a departmental faculty advisor. Students should meet with their faculty advisor at least twice a year to discuss their academic interests, progress in the major, and long-term career goals. The Student Affairs Assistant and Director of Undergraduate Studies are also available to assist students. Students should meet with the Student Affairs Assistant early in their final quarter to be sure they have fulfilled all requirements. </P>

<P>The London Program </P>

<P>This program, offered in Autumn Quarter, provides students with an opportunity to study British literature and history in the cultural and political capital of England in the Autumn Quarter. In the ten-week program, students take four courses, three of which are each compressed into approximately three weeks and taught in succession by Chicago faculty. The fourth, project-oriented, course is conducted at a less intensive pace. The program includes a number of field trips (e.g., Cornwall, Bath, Canterbury, Cambridge). The London program is designed for third- and fourth-year students with a strong interest and some course work in British literature and history. Applications are available on the University of Chicago's Study Abroad home page (studyabroad.uchicago.edu) and typically are due in mid–Winter Quarter. </P>

<P>English Language and Literature Courses </P>

<P>ENGL 10400. Introduction to Poetry. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course involves intensive readings in both contemporary and traditional poetry. Early on, the course emphasizes various aspects of poetic craft and technique, setting, and terminology, as well as provides extensive experience in verbal analysis. Later, emphasis is on contextual issues: referentiality, philosophical and ideological assumptions, as well as historical considerations. (Gateway, Poetry) Instructor(s): Lisa Ruddick Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>ENGL 10600. Introduction to Drama. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the unique challenges of experiencing performance through the page. Students will read plays and performances closely, taking into account not only form, character, plot, and genre, but also theatrical considerations like staging, acting, spectatorship, and historical conventions. We will also consider how various agents-playwrights, readers, directors, actors, and audiences-generate plays and give them meaning. While the course is not intended as a survey of dramatic literature or theater history, students will be introduced to a variety of essential plays from across the dramatic tradition. The course culminates in a scene project assignment that allows students put their skills of interpretation and adaptation into practice. No experience with theater is expected.

<P>ENGL 10640. Introduction to Victorian Literature: Men and Women. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will introduce the major genres of fiction and poetry produced in Victorian Britain. I have chosen texts that highlight the period's central preoccupations: gender and sexuality. A time during which the so-called Woman Question vexed politicians, commentators and activists, when marriage and motherhood were under review, and styles of masculinity contested, literature of the period presented dynamic discussions about the roles of men and women, how they might interact, and what they can do. These texts are also some of the most formally innovative of the period. Texts are likely to include Robert Browning's Men and Women (which gives us our title), Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Aurora Leigh, M E Braddon, Lady Audley's Secret, Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland, and short stories by the New Woman writer, George Egerton, and Oscar Wilde.

<P>ENGL 12520. Climate Change in Literature, Art, and Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>If meteorological data and models show us that climate change is real, art and literature explore what it means for our collective human life. This is the premise of many recent films, novels, and artworks that ask how a changing climate will affect human society. In this course, we will examine the aesthetics of climate change across media, in order to understand how narrative, image, and even sound help us witness a planetary disaster that is often imperceptible. Our approach will be comparative: what kind of story about climate change can a science fiction novel about a dystopian future tell, and how is this story different than, say, that of an art installation made of melting blocks of Arctic ice? Do different media tend to emphasize different aspects of ecological crisis? Readings and discussions will introduce students to some of the ways that humanities scholarship is contributing to climate change research. The syllabus may include Jeff VanderMeer, Annihilation (2014); Margaret Atwood, Oryx and Crake (2003); John Luther Adams, Become Ocean (2014); George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015); and Amitav Ghosh, The Great Derangement (2016).

<P>ENGL 12720. Inventing Consciousness: Literature, Philosophy, Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Consciousness is an historical achievement. As a phenomenon, consciousness probably came into being somewhere deep in evolutionary time. Yet as a concept consciousness is relatively new: the European notion of consciousness emerges only in the late seventeenth century. This course draws on the resources of literature, history, philosophy, and psychology to examine how the concept of consciousness came to possess the explanatory dominance it currently holds. We will begin by acquiring a sense of what consciousness currently means in philosophy and psychology, paying particular attention to how the Western concept differs from similar ideas in such traditions as Buddhism. After examining the pre-history of consciousness by reading such authors as William Shakespeare, we will then turn to two historical moments that were central to the concept's development. First, we will train our attention on the interplay between philosophy and literature in the late seventeenth century, reading texts by René Descartes, John Milton, Thomas Traherne, and John Locke. Second, we will focus on how, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the psychology of William James contributed to the development of &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; techniques in the novels of Henry James and Virginia Woolf. In this course, we will stress the historical contingency of this concept-consciousness has a birthdate-in order to determine the nature of a consequence that follows from this fact: the extent to which current uses of this concept are still shaped and constrained by the historical circumstances that conditioned its appearance and development.

<P>ENGL 12800. Theories of Media. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the concept of media and mediation in very broad terms, looking not only at modern technical media and mass media, but at the very idea of a medium as a means of communication, a set of institutional practices, and a habitat in which images proliferate and take on a &quot;life of their own.&quot; The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the &quot;unmediated&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot;? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of &quot;metapictures&quot; or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become &quot;mixed&quot; in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T.

<P>ENGL 13720. Thinking with Race in Medieval England. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The medieval period is often thought of as the era just before the idea of race emerged - before the Atlantic slave trade, before European colonialism, before scientific racism. At the same time, the Middle Ages have been crucial to modern phenomena of racialized nationalism and ideologies of whiteness. In recent years, medievalists have studied and debated race's significance. Acknowledging the complex and urgent status of medieval race today, this course examines some of the stories, images, ideas, and institutions of medieval England. We will test how race helps us think about the articulation and operationalization of human difference between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, especially with respect to Jews, Saracens (a term created by Christians to refer to Arabs and Muslims of varying ethnicities), and the so called &quot;monstrous races&quot; who were thought to populate the far reaches of the world. We'll ask - How did geography, religion, and history come to be corporealized, or understood as legible on the body? How did the essentialization of differences between groups act to satisfy desires, or seemingly to solve intellectual and ideological difficulties? How does &quot;thinking with race&quot; in medieval England throw new light on race and racism today? Readings will be both in Middle English and modern English translation. No previous experience with medieval literature is expected. This is a 2018-19 College Signature Course.

<P>ENGL 15107. Some Versions of Apocalypse. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The end of the world is one of the most durable of mankind's obsessions, from prophetic texts of antiquity to today's fascination with zombie plagues, environmental disaster, and nuclear winter. In this course we will explore what is both fearful and alluring about catastrophe on an unimaginable scale, as we read and view some paradigmatic apocalyptic works across a wide historical range. The course will focus on close attention to the aesthetics of individual works, locating those works in their historical contexts, and the conceptual analysis of the texts' motivating concerns. We will especially attend to the relationship between aesthetic form and the political, economic, and subjective forms that mediate catastrophe--as well as the ways that the end of things asks us to think beyond mediation. Texts include the biblical Book of Revelation, William Langland's medieval allegory Piers Plowman, Daniel Defoe's early modern chronicle of the black death A Journal of the Plague Year, Cormac McCarthy's postapocalyptic novel The Road, and both the novel and film versions of World War Z.

After having examined how Shakespeare develops and deepens the conventions of tragedy in Titus Andronicus, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra, we will turn our attention to how he complicates and even subverts these conventions in The Winter's Tale and The Tempest. Throughout, we will treat the plays as literary texts, performance prompts, and historical documents. Section attendance is required.

<P>ENGL 17950. The Declaration of Independence. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores important intellectual, political, philosophical, legal, economic, social, and religious contexts for the Declaration of Independence. We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke's Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine's Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson's drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (1650-1830, 1830-1940) This is a 2018-19 College Signature Course.

<P>ENGL 18500. American Horrors. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a survey of horror in American literature and film, with a special focus on the genre's relation to racial and sexual violence. How does horror reflect, contribute to, or intervene into structures of racism, sexism, xenophobia, and queerphobia? How do fictional texts represent or transform non-fictional horrors, from lynching to rape to police brutality? And what is the status of horror as an emotion that structures relations of power and privilege in the United States? Together, we will gain a historical perspective on the genre, for instance tracking the figure of the zombie from its birth in Haitian folklore as a projection of the horrors of slavery, through 20th century works like George Romero's film Night of the Living Dead, and into present day works including Colson Whitehead's novel Zone One. We will pay special attention to the present moment, interrogating a renaissance of horror tropes in, for instance, feminist fiction (Karen Russell and Carmen Maria Machado), television (American Horror Story and Stranger Things), and cinema (It and Get Out).

<P>ENGL 18700. Sexual Violence in America: Theory, Literature, and Activism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will consider how a spectrum of sexual violence has been represented, politicized, and theorized in the United States from the 1970s to the present. To get a handle on this vast topic, our archive will be wide-ranging, including legal statutes and court opinions on sexual harassment and pornography; fiction, poetry, and graphic novels that explore the limits of representing sexual trauma; activist discourses in pamphlets and editorials from Take Back the Night to #MeToo; and groundbreaking essays by feminist and queer theorists, especially from critical women of color. How does the meaning of sex and of power shift with different kinds of representation, theory, and activism? How have people developed a language to share experiences of violation and disrupt existing power structures? And how do people begin to imagine and build a different world whether through fiction, law, or institutions? (Theory) Instructor(s): Michael Dango Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>ENGL 19700. Image, Text, Archive. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines hybrid image-texts of the last 150 years to investigate what happens to narrative and genre when visual images become integral parts of textual composition, and what kinds of claims such texts make about memory, veracity, or objectivity. We will examine the early history of photography and image reproduction, learn to formally read images, and interrogate the relationship of photography to documentary. Our readings will include Louis Aragon's Paris Peasant (1925), André Breton's Nadja (1928), James Agee and Walker Evans's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941), Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory (1966), Michael Ondaatje's The Collected Works of Billy the Kid (1970), W.

<P>ENGL 19800. The Unincorporated: Modernism, Geography, and Race. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course investigates the centrality of notions of exclusion and exclusivity to the development of modernist literature on both sides of the Atlantic. The period of literary modernism stretching from the late-19th century to roughly the Second World War coincides with the high point of European imperial claims as well as the sedimentation of Jim Crow. We will trace the articulation of forms of belonging - and non-belonging - along the interrelated axes of space and race in modernist figures and writings ranging from Joseph Conrad, George Orwell, James Joyce, and Jean Rhys to Djuna Barnes, Aimé Césaire, Albert Camus, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Richard Wright. Our quarter will conclude with Kamal Daoud's The Meursault Investigation, a defiant recasting of Camus's 1942 The Stranger.

<P>ENGL 20149. London Program: Literature and the Environment in Eighteenth-Century Britain. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will focus on eighteenth-century literature that engages us with the nonhuman environment-with the plants, animals, and elements, the landscapes and the climates that surround and shape human life. We will range widely in genres from nature poetry and travel writing to natural history and the novel, reflecting throughout on the ways in which nature may be cultivated, improved, or imported from elsewhere </P>

<P>- not something opposed to human culture but wholly tied up with it. Together, we will ask: how do ideas of nature look different in the city, the country, or the colonies? And crucially, what might eighteenth century understandings of the relationship between human beings and the natural world have to tell us our own moment of ecological entanglement and crisis? The course will draw on the resources of London and its environs, likely to include Kew Gardens, the Natural History Museum, the Sloane House, and Tate Britain.

<P>ENGL 20150. London Program: Pagan London. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a study of literary modernism by way of its debt to Scottish anthropologist J.G. Frazer's The Golden Bough, a foundational work in the anthropology of magic, religion, purity, pollution, sacrifice, fertility, and the death and reincarnation of gods. Reading Frazer's work alongside works by William Butler Yeats, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, H.D., Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Robert Graves, Sigmund Freud, and Jane Harrison, we will examine the widespread impact of Frazer's tome, its resonance in the tumultuous war years, and the ways in which it participated in the creation of pagan, heretical, outsider, country, rural, and ethnic values in modernist London. Inasmuch as Frazer's work possessed a literary life, we will examine how its anthropology possessed by literature lives on in the works of such anthropologists as Mary Douglas and Michael Taussig. Course fieldtrips are likely to include the newly reconstructed London Mithraeum, Greenwich, and the Stonehenge monument.

<P>ENGL 20151. London from the Outside-In. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In discussing Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Edward Said writes of the Bertram estate's colonial holdings in Antigua, and the few references in the novel itself to these plantations, claiming that the novel demonstrates &quot;the avowedly complete subordination of colony to metropolis.&quot; In this course, we will explore and expand upon this idea, seeking to understand the ways in which London's cosmopolitan and prominent history depend upon England's imperial endeavors. This pursuit will also involve representations of the city &quot;from the outside," such as Samuel Selvon's The Lonely Londoners and Tayeb Salih'sSeason of Migration. Readings will be diverse in genre, style, and period, attempting to open as many related discourses as possible, as this course is aimed at developing an independent research project. Class time will be equally devoted to the readings, research techniques, and workshopping your ideas. (Theory) Instructor(s): Tim DeMay Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>ENGL 20562. Freedom and Fate in the Renaissance. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we will study theories of will and of action that held sway in the Renaissance. Is human choice governed by reason, or are our wills overruled by our own passions-or by divine grace? Can self-determination genuinely arise in political or physical systems determined by history? What does it mean to depict free choice? Questions like these shaped crucial Renaissance debates in parliaments and churches, in laboratories and in the arts. We'll examine them through both literary and philosophical texts by writers including William Shakespeare, John Donne, Thomas Hobbes, John Milton, Margaret Cavendish, and Isaac Newton.

<P>ENGL 22110. Excrement and Ecstasy: The Devotional Body in Early Modern Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This class asks why writers in the seventeenth century turn to bodily metaphor and erotic language to describe their interactions with the divine. We will investigate the materiality of the body in early modern poetry-where it is frequently depicted as in orgasmic frenzy, failing, and even producing excrement-and its involvement with religious devotional practice. Authors of focus will likely include William Shakespeare, John Donne, George Herbert, John Milton, and Margaret Cavendish.

<P>ENGL 22130. Making Scents: A Literary History of Smell. 100 Units. </P>

<P>While the visual has long been the privileged sense in literary studies, recent work has begun to explore other senses. From massive medieval farts to modern perfumes, we will consider what a focus on scent can contribute to our understanding of literature. Drawing from fiction, poetry, objects, history, and science, this course integrates an interdisciplinary approach. Primary literary texts will likely include H.D., Huysmans, Baudelaire, Burney, Shakespeare, and Chaucer. We will probably also think with perfumes, Luca Turin's The Secret of Scent, Alexandra Horowitz's Being a Dog, and Tom Tykwer's 2006 film adaptation of Patrick Süskind's Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. (Fiction, Poetry, Theory) Instructor(s): Jennifer Yida Pan Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>ENGL 22150. Luxury and Global Modernism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The desire for and consumption of luxury is central to the world-building enterprise of capitalist modernity as we understand it, from the elaboration of colonial trade routes to the emergence of the era-defining aesthetic mode known as glamor. As both the object of the primitivizing imaginary of colonial social science and the motor of excitement for the new in the modern Western city, luxury infused some of the complexities of global interconnectedness into the imagination and the arts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With readings across the literary, but also the material-cultural and social-scientific archives of Western and non-Western modernisms, this course asks how luxury might open new avenues for the study of modernism's inherently global character. Course texts will include literary works by Henry James, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy, and MP Shiel; social scientific works by Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille; visual works by Raghubir Singh, Coco Chanel, and Josephine Baker; theoretical readings from the fields of postcolonial, queer, and fashion studies. (1830-1940, Fiction, Theory) Instructor(s): Jacob Harris Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>ENGL 23170. The Beast Fable from Aesop to Zootopia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we will read collections of medieval beast fables to theorize what Geoffrey Chaucer, John Lydgate, Robert Henryson, and others found compelling about animals in various states of personification. In addition, we will look to contemporary forms of the genre to consider how this mode of storytelling continues to provoke analysis and evade interpretation. Previous work in Middle English is not required. (Pre-1650) Instructor(s): Jo Nixon Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>ENGL 23190. Eco-consciousness: Climates and Ecologies of Eighteenth-Century Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Given our present-day concerns about political climates and ecological consciousness, this course returns to the eighteenth century to analyze how writers interpreted climate and ecology back then. In the context of agricultural, industrial, and political revolutions, this class will explore how writers like Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, John Clare understood both political and ecological climates like colonialism, women's rights, class revolutions, and natural history. (Fiction, Poetry, 1650-1830, Theory) Instructor(s): Caroline Heller Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>ENGL 23400. Virginia Woolf. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Along with a number of Woolf's major works, students read theoretical and critical texts that give a sense of the range of contemporary approaches to Woolf. (1830-1940, Fiction) Instructor(s): Lisa Ruddick Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 23400, FNDL 24011 </P>

<P>ENGL 23808. Sonnets from Wyatt to Yeats and Beyond. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will trace the history and persistence of the sonnet in English poetry, but it will start with the founder of the tradition, the early Renaissance Italian poet, Francesco Petrarch, who made the form popular, and remained its model practitioner. Since the form flourished in the Renaissance (in England as in all over Europe) and was revived in the 19th century, the course will mainly be devoted to poets from those periods. Poets to be studied will include: Wyatt, Sidney, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, Hopkins, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and D. G. Rossetti. There will be a midterm and a final paper. (Poetry) Instructor(s): Richard Strier Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>ENGL 24102. The Idiot as Hero. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What strains are put on the apparatus of representation and storytelling when the protagonist is assumed to be cognitively challenged, foolish, stupid, or even idiotic? How do we make sense of idiocy? How do we interpret and evaluate what an idiot's idiocy means? What other codes -- ethical, political, ideological, sexual, etc. -- come into play when we respond aesthetically to a story about an idiot? How, and to what degree, is it possible for us to identify with the experience of being stupid? What means do writers and filmmakers do to exploit the aesthetic possibilities of idiocy (that is, the pleasures that can be derived by representing or evoking idiocy in particular ways)? Readings may include Sterne, Tristram Shandy; Wordsworth, &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot;; Flaubert, Madame Bovary. Films may include Forrest Gump; Born Yesterday; Nights of Cabiria. (Fiction) Instructor(s): Lawrence Rothfield Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>ENGL 24150. Melodrama and Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the central role melodrama has played in understandings of film and vice versa. Working carefully through select films like Bigger than Life, Letter from an Unknown Woman, and Vertigo, we'll develop an account of key cinematic concepts like camera movement and mise-en-scène. We'll also interrogate various conceptualizations of melodrama (as mode, genre, style, affect, etc.) and consider melodrama's longstanding, global appeal. (Theory) Instructor(s): Joseph Bitney Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>ENGL 24170. The Arts of Civil War. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What aesthetic strategies do art and literature employ to represent civil war in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries? In order to propose some answers, this comparative course traverses a wide range of cultural and historical contexts, moving chronologically through civil wars and revolutions in the United States, Russia, Spain, Ireland, Vietnam, Lebanon, and Syria. In doing so, we will query current debates around the relation between aesthetics and politics in critical theory, as well as pressing questions of human rights, citizenship, exile, refugee crisis, national sovereignty, and international humanitarianism. In addition to encountering artists and writers who work in a variety of different media (poetry, novels, visual art, film, etc.), we will read recent work by political theorists, philosophers, art historians, and literary critics. We will examine artists and writers such as Walt Whitman, El Lissitzky, Pablo Picasso, Etel Adnan, Lan Cao, Colm Toíbín, Claudia Rankine, Mounira Al Solh, and Ghayath Almadhoun, as well as the theoretical writings of Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, Susan Sontag, and Giorgio Agamben. Our primary task will be to investigate the dynamic ways in which art theorizes civil war.

<P>ENGL 24400. Brecht and Beyond. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Brecht is indisputably the most influential playwright in the 20th century, but his influence on film theory and practice and on cultural theory generally is also considerable. In this course we will explore the range and variety of Brecht's own theatre, from the anarchic plays of the 1920's to the agitprop Lehrstück and film esp Kühle Wampe) to the classical parable plays, as well as the work of his heirs in German theatre (Heiner Müller, Peter Weiss) and film (RW Fassbinder, Alexander Kluge), in French film (Jean-Luc Godard) and cultural theory (the Situationists and May 68), film and theatre in Britain (such as Caryl Churchill or Mike Leigh), theatre and film in Africa, from South Africa to Senegal, and if possible a film or play from the US that engages with Brechtian theory and/or practice. (Drama) Instructor(s): Loren Kruger Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): TAPS and/or Hum Core required; no first years. Equivalent Course(s): CMST 26200, CMLT 20800, TAPS 28435 </P>

<P>ENGL 25130. Ethnic Minority Poetry in the US. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is designed as a survey of the various minority traditions excluded from canonical understandings of the history of US poetry. Centered around the twentieth century yet bookended by earlier and later poetry, the course is divided into five sections: African American, Native American, Latinx, Asian American, and Jewish American. Among many others, we'll read poems by Myung Mi Kim, Amiri Baraka, Simon J. Ortiz, and Allen Ginsberg. (Poetry, Theory, 1830-1940) Instructor(s): Geronimo Sarmiento Cruz Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>ENGL 25150. Pop Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course takes for its premise that our understanding of psychological study is as fundamentally shaped by popular culture as it is by science. Using a constellation of literary, filmic and televisual, and other popular texts, we will consider how modes of psychological study, manipulation, and repair figure in the American popular imagination. Our eclectic archive will include pamphlets on psychological warfare, psychological thrillers, sitcoms, reality tv, studies on personality tests, and self-help tracts. Students will be encouraged to bring in their own examples as well. We will ask: what conception of human motivation and susceptibility, unconscious phenomena, collective feeling, or the form of &quot;the therapeutic&quot; do these texts carry? What aesthetic, formal, medial conventions or innovations can we track across our transmedial archive? (Fiction, Theory) Instructor(s): Shirl Yang Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>ENGL 25804. Signs of the Americas. 100 Units. </P>

<P>It is a common misconception that literature can happen only in the alphabet or that such non-alphabetical literatures have long ago ceased to be made. This course corrects such misconceptions by exploring modern and contemporary literatures that have been written with, or in response to, such sign-systems as pictographs, hieroglyphs, totem poles, wampum, and khipu. Focusing especially on the sign-systems of the native Americas, this class gives students a basic introduction to the mechanics of these signs, in order to discuss how these mechanics might be at play in the works of such poets, writers, and artists as Anni Albers, Simon Ortiz, Gerald Vizenor, Louise Erdrich, John Borrows, Charles Olson, Bill Reid, Robert Bringhurst, Fred Wah, Clayton Eshleman, Cy Twombly, Joaquín Torres-Garcia, Cecilia Vicuña, and others. Key questions to be asked include: how are these signs an interface for contemporary histories of nation and capital? And: how do those material histories and their identifications in race, gender, kinship, and ecology change when cast in the mechanics, tropes, and figures of these signs? As a &quot;Makers Seminar,&quot; this course will include creative alternatives to the standard analytical college paper.

<P>ENGL 25970. Alternate Reality Games: Theory and Production. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Games are one of the most prominent and influential media of our time. This experimental course explores the emerging genre of &quot;alternate reality&quot; or &quot;transmedia&quot; gaming. Throughout the quarter, we will approach new media theory through the history, aesthetics, and design of transmedia games. These games build on the narrative strategies of novels, the performative role-playing of theater, the branching techniques of electronic literature, the procedural qualities of video games, and the team dynamics of sports. Beyond the subject matter, students will design modules of an Alternate Reality Game in small groups. Students need not have a background in media or technology, but a wide-ranging imagination, interest in new media culture, or arts practice will make for a more exciting quarter.

<P>ENGL 26170. London Underground: Environment, Industry, and the Making of the English Working Class. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Examining the environmental and social forces in the period between 1780-1867, this course highlights the literary establishment's complex and often troubled relationship with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the working class from a matrix of underground networks. The course features a diverse cadre of writers and theorists such as Jane Austen, Karl Marx, and E.J. Blandford, and provides a nuanced understanding of laborers' lived, material conditions through class visits to the Coal Mine at the Museum of Science and Industry, the Special Collections archive, and interactive discussions with the People's History Museum and the Labor and Working-Class History Association.

<P>ENGL 26300. The Literature of Disgust, Rabelais to Nausea. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will survey a range of literary works which take the disgusting as their principle aesthetic focus, while also providing students with an introduction to core issues and concepts in the history of aesthetic theory, such as the beautiful and the sublime, disinterested judgment and purposive purposelessness, taste and distaste. At the same time, our readings will allow us to explore the ways in which the disgusting has historically been utilized as a way of producing socially critical literature, by representing that which a culture categorically attempts to marginalize, exclude, and expel. Readings will engage with the variety of aesthetic functions that the disgusting has been afforded throughout modern literary history, including the carnivalesque and grotesque in Rabelais and the bawdy and satirical in Swift; revolted Victorian realism and gruesome Zolaesque naturalism; and Sartre's existential nausea and Kafka's anxious repulsion; as well as Thomas Bernhard's experiments with contempt and William Burroughs' hallucinogenic inversions of pleasure and disgust.

<P>ENGL 27003. Woman/Native. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course reads works of postcolonial literature and theory in order to consider the entanglements of the figures of &quot;women&quot; and &quot;natives&quot; in colonial as well as postcolonial discourse. We will discuss topics such as the persistent feminization of the profane, degraded, and contagious bodies of colonized natives; representations of women as both the keepers and the victims of &quot;authentic&quot; native culture; the status (symbolic and otherwise) of women in anti-colonial resistance and insurgency; and the psychic pathologies (particularly nervous conditions of anxiety, hysteria, and madness) that appear repeatedly in these works as states to which women and/as natives are especially susceptible. Authors may include Ama Ata Aidoo, Hélène Cixous J.M Coetzee, Maryse Condé, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Mahasweta Devi, Assia Djebar, Frantz Fanon, Sigmund Freud, Silvia Federici, Nuruddin Farah, Bessie Head, V.S.

<P>ENGL 27600. Cinema in Africa. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines Africa in film as well as films produced in Africa. It places cinema in Sub Saharan Africa in its social, cultural, and aesthetic contexts ranging from neocolonial to postcolonial, Western to Southern Africa, documentary to fiction, art cinema to TV. We will begin with La Noire de... (1966), ground-breaking film by the &quot;father&quot; of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene, contrasted w/ a South African film, African Jim (1959) that more closely resembles African American musical film, and anti-colonial and anti apartheid films from Lionel Rogosin's Come Back Africa (1959) to Sarah Maldoror's Sambizanga, Ousmane Sembenes Camp de Thiaroye (1984), and Jean Marie Teno'ss Afrique, Je te Plumerai (1995). The rest of the course will examine cinematic representations of tensions between urban and rural, traditional and modern life, and the different implications of these tensions for men and women, Western and Southern Africa, in fiction, documentary and ethnographic film, including 21st century work where available.

<P>ENGL 28200. Narrating Migration. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Human migration is one of the most pressing global problems of our time, though it is not a new phenomenon. It has shaped societies throughout time, and the degree to which it is perceived as a &quot;problem&quot; or an &quot;opportunity" changes radically according to circumstances and ideologies. In this course, we will analyze the different ways in which migration has been perceived, understood, and experienced. We will focus on two intense episodes in the global history of migration: migration from early nineteenth-century Britain; and migration to late 20th and 21stcentury America. Our emphasis throughout will be on the ways in which migration is narrated: the stories that societies tell about the migration of themselves and others. We will cover a wide range of migration narratives, including those of creative writers and artists, and will consider them through the lenses of literary criticism, history, theory, and also artistic practice itself.

<P>ENGL 28404. Introduction to Old English. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Moððe word fræt.&quot; These are the first words of a riddle that students will learn how to read in this course. As the first part of the Medieval Research Series, this course introduces students to the Old English language, the literary history of early medieval England, and current research tools and scholarship in the field of Old English. In studying the language, we will explore its diverse and exciting body of literature, including poems of heroic violence and lament, laws, medical recipes, and humorously obscene riddles. Successful completion of the course will give students a rich sense not only of the earliest period of English literary culture, but also of the structure of the English language as it is written and spoken today. (Pre-1650) This course is the first in a two quarter Medieval Research sequence. No prior experience with Old or Middle English is required. The second course in the Medieval Research sequence (Beowulf) will be offered in the Spring Quarter. Instructor(s): Benjamin Saltzman Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 38404 </P>

<P>ENGL 28505. Beowulf. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we will read and translate Beowulf from Old English, attending closely to language, paleography, and textual cruxes. We also will examine the history of scholarship on the poem and a variety of approaches to its interpretation, guided by student interest. Over the course of the term, each student will produce a piece original scholarly research that engages with the poem and its critical tradition. (Pre-1650, Poetry) This course is the second in a two quarter Medieval Research sequence.

<P>ENGL 28650. Outsider Writing. 100 Units. </P>

<P>A kinship between poetry and mental illness is a commonplace in myth, received opinion, and literary history, whether formulated as divine inspiration or bipolar disorder. Similarly the pejorative ascription of insanity to poets has been a commonplace of literary review and criticism. 'My vocabulary did this to me' are the reputed dying words of the poet Jack Spicer who claimed to respond to dictation as though himself a radio tuning to messages. Language's dictation, however experienced, unites mental disorder and the literary arts - the pressure of language that might become unhinged. What of the reader? Aesthetic response also is both formally contained and threatens to become unhinged. This class will read 20th and 21st century works of Outsider poetry and fiction in English, and consider how best to respond. Outsider writing will be related to Outsider visual art, and to the emergent field of Outsider theory. (Theory) Instructor(s): John Wilkinson Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>ENGL 29505. Joan Didion: Reporter, Novelist, Essayist, Memoirist. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar is a reading and writing-intensive course designed to provide advanced English majors with the tools and resources necessary to propose and conduct their own literary research projects. Reading for the course will include one of Didion's novels as well as works of non-fiction in its various forms. Because the course requires historical research and considerable engagement with criticism as well as with the literature itself, it is ideally suited for students interested in developing the skills necessary to write a B.A. Honors paper or considering graduate work in English. The course will culminate in a substantial critical paper of your own design. This is Seminar in Research and Criticism intended for English majors. Instructor(s): Deborah Nelson Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): This course is limited to 15 third- and fourth-year students who have already fulfilled the Department’s Gateway requirement and taken at least two further English courses. </P>

<P>ENGL 29705. Incarcerated Life. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The United States today is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, one in which millions of Americans are currently warehoused within, or have passed through, carceral institutions. Many scholars locate the emergence of this punitive turn in the 1970s, and with good reason: the landscape of penality and confinement looks much different in earlier historical periods. Turning to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this course will explore literary, philosophical, and pragmatic engagements with the prison across the British Empire and in the postcolonial United States. By tracing the particular fears and fantasies that grouped around institutions of confinement, we will explore the logic by which an institution once marginal to social life has become so central to society that incarceration is now a conventional form of life. This course will involve a robust research component, culminating in a final paper; while this course is rooted in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, students will be welcome to pursue research on contemporary regimes of incarceration. Our theoretical readings will include Michel Foucault, Angela Davis, and Ruth Wilson Gilmore. Our archive of literary, philosophical, and practical texts will include the Newgate Calendar, Cesare Beccaria, Oliver Goldsmith, John Gay, Jeremy Bentham, James Williams, Harriet Jacobs, and Austin Reed. (1830-1940) This is Seminar in Research and Criticism intended for English majors.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Department of the Geophysical Sciences offers a BS degree in Environmental Science. The program is intended for students whose interests fall at the intersection of biology, chemistry, and earth sciences, and is designed to prepare them to enter a variety of interdisciplinary fields in the environmental sciences, including the interface of environmental science and public policy. Students are given the opportunity to study such topics as the biogeochemical cycles, environmental chemistry, microbiology, ecology, the chemistry and dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, climate change, and environmentally relevant aspects of economics and policy. Students are encouraged to participate in the Semester in Environmental Science at the Marine Biological Laboratory, and undergraduate research is also strongly encouraged. </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>• four courses designated ENSC or GEOS • one course in Statistics, and two more in any of Mathematics, Statistics, or Computing • one to three courses in Social Science/Public Policy </P>

<P>Candidates for the BS in Environmental Science complete a year of chemistry, a year of mathematics (including Calculus I-II), and a year of biology (ENSC 24400 Ecology and Conservation,GEOS 13900 Biological Evolution and BIOS 20198 Biodiversity), as well as PHYS 13100 Mechanics or the equivalent. (Note that some advanced chemistry courses require further physics as a prerequisite.) </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to begin discipline-specific courses as early as possible. Required disciplinary courses include ENSC 13300 The Atmosphere, ENSC 23800 Global Biogeochemical Cycles, and ENSC 23900 Environmental Chemistry. (Note that ENSC 23800 Global Biogeochemical Cycles is typically offered every other year.) Of ENSC/GEOS science electives, one can be a field course, and one may be ENSC 29700 Reading and Research in Environmental Science. Students participating in the Semester in Environmental Science receive credit for four courses in environmental science, two of which can be used to substitute for ENSC 24400 Ecology and Conservation and ENSC 23900 Environmental Chemistry. </P>

<P>The major is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate students whose primary interests cover various aspects of environmental science. Sample course schedules below give examples of course plans appropriate to students focusing on climatology, conservation, and biogeochemistry. Students with a focus on policy questions may take up to three courses in social science/public policy. These courses are available through undergraduate programs in Economics, Public Policy Studies, and Environmental and Urban Studies, or through the Harris School of Public Policy (http://harris.uchicago.edu). </P>

<P>Because analysis of data and mathematical modeling are fundamental to environmental science, the major requires six courses in quantitative methods: a year of mathematics, one course in statistics, and two additional courses in mathematics, statistics, or computing. </P>

<P>Note that while students taking calculus through the more introductory MATH 13000s sequence are encouraged to complete the third quarter of calculus, MATH 13300 Elementary Functions and Calculus III, in the higher tracks Calculus III (e.g., MATH 15300 Calculus III) is not specifically required or recommended, as the first two courses offer a sufficiently comprehensive calculus training for students to move on to other courses. Depending on the choice of electives, students may credit as many as nine Mathematics/Statistics/Computing courses toward the major. </P>

<H6>Semester in Environmental Science/MBL </H6>

<P>The following courses are the College designations for the Semester in Environmental Science that is taught at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. One quarter at MBL counts for four courses: ENSC 23820, ENSC 24100, ENSC 29800, and an elective of ENSC 24200, ENSC 24300, or ENSC 28100. Admission to the Semester in Environmental Science program is by application, which must be received by the MBL generally in March of the year preceding the start of the semester. Admissions decisions will generally be sent in April. Note that these courses start at the beginning of September, typically four weeks prior to the start of the College’s Autumn Quarter and are completed by the end of Autumn Quarter. More information on the course content and the application process, and deadlines can be found at college.uchicago.edu/academics/ semester-environmental-science-ses. Students participating in the Semester in Environmental Science receive credit for four courses in environmental science, two of which can be used to substitute for ENSC 24400 Ecology and Conservation and ENSC 23900 Environmental Chemistry. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students majoring in Environmental Science must receive quality grades in all courses taken to meet requirements in the major. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>The BS degree with honors is awarded to students who meet the following requirements: (1) a GPA of </P>

<P>3.25 or higher in the major and of 3.0 or higher overall; (2) completion of a paper based on original research, supervised and approved by a faculty member in geophysical sciences; (3) an oral presentation of the thesis research. All theses will be examined by the supervisor and a second reader from the faculty. Manuscript drafts will generally be due in the sixth week of the quarter in which the student will graduate (fifth week in Summer Quarter), and final manuscripts and oral presentations in the eighth week (seventh week in Summer Quarter). </P>

<P>Students are strongly encouraged to reach out to potential faculty supervisors no later than their third year, since theses generally arise out of research projects already begun with faculty members. When a thesis topic is determined, students should notify the undergraduate adviser of their intent to complete a thesis and confirm their eligibility. ENSC 29700 Reading and Research in Environmental Science can be devoted to the preparation of the required paper; however, students using this course to meet a requirement in the major must take it for a quality grade. </P>

<P>Students who wish to submit a single paper to meet the honors requirement in Environmental Science and the BA paper requirement in another major should discuss their proposals with the undergraduate advisers from both programs no later than the end of third year. Certain requirements must be met. A consent form, to be signed by the undergraduate advisers, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Sample BS Programs </P>

<P>Each student will design an individual plan of course work, choosing from a wide range of selections that take advantage of rich offerings from a variety of subdisciplines. The sample programs that appear below are merely for the purpose of illustration; many other variations would be possible. NOTE: Courses that meet general education requirements and are required for the major are not listed. </P>

<P>ENSC 13300. The Atmosphere. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces the physics, chemistry, and phenomenology of the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis on the fundamental science that underlies atmospheric behavior and climate. Topics include (1) atmospheric composition, evolution, and structure; (2) solar and terrestrial radiation in the atmospheric energy balance; (3) the role of water in determining atmospheric structure; and (4) wind systems, including the global circulation, and weather systems. Instructor(s): D. Abbot Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): MATH 13100-MATH 13200 Equivalent Course(s): GEOS 13300, ENST 13300 </P>

<P>ENSC 13400. Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course presents the science behind the forecast of global warming to enable the student to evaluate the likelihood and potential severity of anthropogenic climate change in the coming centuries. It includes an overview of the physics of the greenhouse effect, including comparisons with Venus and Mars; an overview of the carbon cycle in its role as a global thermostat; predictions and reliability of climate model forecasts of the greenhouse world.

Abbot Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Prerequisite(s): Some knowledge of chemistry or physics helpful. Equivalent Course(s): PHSC 13400, GEOS 13400, ENST 12300 </P>

<P>ENSC 20209. An Environmental History of Africa, 1800-2016. 100 Units. </P>

<P>For much of the twentieth century the African environment has been a story of decline and degradation-a narrative of how Africans have consistently destroyed their pristine environments. Images of soil erosion, desiccation, deforestation, and famines have, in part, shaped Western perceptions of Africa. This course will consider an alternative perspective of Africa's environment by focusing on the dynamic and complex processes of environmental change from the precolonial period to the present. We will draw on historical texts, novels, and films from multiple regions on the continent to explore how Africans understood, exploited, and managed their natural environments. By adopting an African &quot;point of view,&quot; this course will attempt to address some of the grave misconceptions that have lead so many to believe that Africa was and continues to be a &quot;Dark Continent." Students will be encouraged to think critically about the meaning of &quot;environmental crisis&quot; and how that trope has served various political and cultural projects over time. But we will also seriously consider the ways in which human beings have taxed natural resources in ways that have produced profound short- and long-term consequences. Equivalent Course(s): HIST 20209 </P>

<P>ENSC 21100. Energy: Science, Technology, and Human Usage. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course covers the technologies by which humans appropriate energy for industrial and societal use, from steam turbines to internal combustion engines to photovoltaics. We also discuss the physics and economics of the resulting human energy system: fuel sources and relationship to energy flows in the Earth system; and modeling and simulation of energy production and use. Our goal is to provide a technical foundation for students interested in careers in the energy industry or in energy policy. Field trips required to major energy converters (e.g., coal-fired and nuclear power plants, oil refinery, biogas digester) and users (e.g., steel, fertilizer production). This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Climate Change, Culture and Society. Instructor(s): E.

<P>As of academic year 2017–18 the Environmental Studies major has become the Environmental and Urban Studies major. This title reflects the addition of a third thematic track, focused on human interaction with place, space, and the built environment in urban regions. </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The program encourages interdisciplinary approaches to the complex entanglements and intersections of urbanism, environment, and humans by incorporating frameworks, theories, models and methods from the humanities and social and natural sciences. Students can choose to focus on one of following three tracks: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Environmental Economics and Policy Track </LBody>

<LBody>Urban Environment Track </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Environmental and Urban Studies with an emphasis on one of these tracks. Requirements for the minor follow the description of the major. </P>

<P>Note: The BS in Environmental Science that is offered by the Department of Geophysical Sciences may be more appropriate for students who intend to pursue postgraduate studies or professional careers in the natural sciences. Students who matriculated before July 2006 and have questions about Environmental Studies courses that they have already taken should contact the program director of Environmental and Urban Studies, Sabina Shaikh (773.834.4405, sabina@uchicago.edu (sabina@uchicago.edu)), to devise their program of study. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students in the Class of 2020 and beyond will follow new requirements for the Environmental and Urban Studies major, described below. Students in the Class of 2019 can continue under the earlier Environmental Studies requirements and receive the old major name on their transcript, but may opt into the Environmental and Urban Studies major by completing the updated requirements. These students may request to switch to the updated Environmental and Urban Studies major requirements, if they align with the student’s interests and fit within the student’s graduation plan. </P>

<P>Students in the major must complete thirteen courses: </P>

<P>Environmental and Urban Studies Core Sequence </P>

<P>Students are required to take the two-course core sequence in Environmental and Urban Studies (ENST 21201 Human Impact on the Environment-ENST 21301 Making the Natural World: Foundations of Human Ecology). These courses provide an overview of contemporary environmental issues and the theoretical and empirical approaches used to understand and address them. </P>

<P>Thematic Tracks in Environmental and Urban Studies </P>

<P>Students complete a total of six courses: four courses within the track they have selected as their area of emphasis and two complementary courses from one of the remaining tracks. Lists of approved courses can be found on the department’s website. </P>

<P>BA Thesis </P>

<P>Students are expected to develop significant independent research projects in close consultation with their preceptor and faculty adviser. In consultation with Environmental and Urban Studies preceptors, students prepare a topic page that is due eighth week of Spring Quarter in their third year. At this time, students are also required to secure a faculty adviser. The thesis adviser may be chosen from among the faculty teaching in Environmental and Urban Studies and related fields. The preceptor serves as a second reader on all theses. Where appropriate, outside scholars, scientists, or policy experts may be added as additional readers with the approval of the program director. </P>

<P>In Autumn Quarter of their fourth year, students register for ENST 29801 BA Colloquium I, which is designed to teach research skills and more generally to aid the research and writing process. The final version of the BA thesis is due by the second Friday of the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. Students wishing to build additional time for research or writing into their schedules may speak with their thesis adviser about potentially taking ENST 29900 B. A. Thesis (Reading and Research). </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program director. Approval from both program directors is required. Students should consult with the directors by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by the directors, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student’s year of graduation. </P>

<P>Internship or Field Studies Program </P>

<P>In addition to course work, students will be required to participate in an approved internship or field studies program with significant links to their program of study. Completion of the Chicago Studies Certificate Program will satisfy this requirement. See below for details. </P>

<P>ENST 12520. Climate Change in Literature, Art, and Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>If meteorological data and models show us that climate change is real, art and literature explore what it means for our collective human life. This is the premise of many recent films, novels, and artworks that ask how a changing climate will affect human society. In this course, we will examine the aesthetics of climate change across media, in order to understand how narrative, image, and even sound help us witness a planetary disaster that is often imperceptible. Our approach will be comparative: what kind of story about climate change can a science fiction novel about a dystopian future tell, and how is this story different than, say, that of an art installation made of melting blocks of Arctic ice? Do different media tend to emphasize different aspects of ecological crisis? Readings and discussions will introduce students to some of the ways that humanities scholarship is contributing to climate change research. The syllabus may include Jeff VanderMeer, Annihilation (2014); Margaret Atwood, Oryx and Crake (2003); John Luther Adams, Become Ocean (2014); George Miller, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015); and Amitav Ghosh, The Great Derangement (2016).

<P>ENST 20540. The Chicago Climate Change &amp; Culture Institute-I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Climate change is arguably the greatest environmental, political and cultural challenge of our times. We are already beginning to feel its impacts in changing weather patterns and rising temperatures. In the years to come, Earth scientists tell us that climate change will impact every human being on the planet. We need to become informed and engaged about what awaits us and what we can do to avoid worst - case scenarios. This 3 - week intensive course of study focuses on three key questions: Why did climate change happen? How is it impacting different communities across the world? What can be done to prepare the world for a more environmentally secure future? The 4CI program features lectures by leading experts on climate change from the Social Sciences, Earth Sciences, Humanities, Art and Architecture. Seminar discussions and site visits to a variety of local initiatives working toward clean energy and sustainability goals round out the program. 4CI will give you the answers you want about climate change and the tools you need to start making a positive difference, whether that is on your campus, in your community or at your workplace. The program leverages the intellectual resources of one of the world's most prestigious research universities and will aquaint you with a city that proudly stands on the cutting edge of sustainable urbanism.

<P>ENST 21500. Environmental Justice. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The effects of environmental pollution are not evenly distributed and are more likely to be experienced by low-income and minority communities. The location of toxic waste sites (both manufacturing plants and dump sites), the persistence of brownfields locations, and a lack of parks and open space are some of the conditions that have led to an ongoing effort to expand the focus of environmental advocacy to the pursuit of equitable and just outcomes in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This course will examine the history of the environmental justice, the efforts to pursue more equitable outcomes, and the prospect for such efforts in the face of global challenges such as climate change. The course will include class visits to sites in Chicago where environmental justice efforts are being undertaken as well as speakers from environmental justice organizations. Instructor(s): Raymond Lodato Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 21501 </P>

<P>ENST 22209. Philosophies of Environmentalism and Sustainability. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Many of the toughest ethical and political challenges confronting the world today are related to environmental issues: for example, climate change, loss of biodiversity, the unsustainable use of natural resources, pollution, and other threats to the well-being of both present and future generations. Using both classic and contemporary works, this course will highlight some of the fundamental and unavoidable philosophical questions presented by such environmental issues. Can a plausible philosophical account of justice for future generations be developed? What counts as the ethical treatment of non-human animals? What do the terms &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;wilderness" mean, and can natural environments as such have moral and/or legal standing? What fundamental ethical and political perspectives inform such positions as ecofeminism, the &quot;Land Ethic,&quot; political ecology, ecojustice, and deep ecology? And does the environmental crisis confronting the world today demand new forms of ethical and political philosophizing and practice? Are we in the Anthropocene? Is &quot;adaptation&quot; the best strategy at this historical juncture? Field trips, guest speakers, and special projects will help us philosophize about the fate of the earth by connecting the local and the global. (A) Instructor(s): B.

<P>ENST 22506. The Natures of the Factory Farm. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course looks at the culture, technology, politics, and ecology of industrial agriculture through the lens of the animal-based &quot;factory&quot; farm. Over the quarter we will trace key steps along the process of manufacturing industrialized animals from life to death in order to think about the factory farm's logic, value, and consequences for rural environments (primarily) within the United States. By emphasizing the historical and cultural conditions of possibility that enable the modern-day factory farm, this course illustrates how mass-producing life forms is more than just a matter of technology, profit-making, or necessity. Instead, we will see how legal definitions of the &quot;farm&quot; versus the &quot;factory,&quot; ideological notions of animal (and human) &quot;nature,&quot; labor law, animal confinement, and the corporate ownership of genetic breeds contribute to its growing ascendancy as a global norm of animal production. But the factory farm has also led to new ideals for rural life that go far beyond classic forms of American agrarianism. As such, we will look to a series of case studies that take up the ecological politics of heritage-breed animals, raw milk production, and recent (Europe-based) projects that try to redeem certain elements of industrial agriculture. Along the way, students will receive an introduction to the analysis of food chains, applied ethology, animal studies, agrarian studies, and rural environmental politics. Instructor(s): A.

<P>ENST 23640. Fruited Plains and Scarred Mountains: The Environmental History of Work in the United States. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Ask most people to name an ecosystem, and they'll probably talk about mountains, beaches, plains, or forests. But most of us spend nearly a third of our adult lives in another ecosystem we often don't think about: our workplace. In fact, one of the most common ways humans interact with the environment in our modern world is by working-from farming and mining to housekeeping and coding. This course will examine the environmental history of work in the United States from the colonial era to the present through lectures, discussion, and other forms of active learning. We will cover a range of topics including racialized and gendered labors, the work of empire, energy workplaces, industrialization, agriculture, the information revolution, and climate adaptation. By engaging this history, we will also consider broader interdisciplinary questions: how should environmental concerns shape labor policy and organizing? What workplace considerations must be incorporated into the development of climate adaptation strategies and just transition programs? Why do the stories that we tell ourselves about the meaning of work matter for climate justice? What is the future of work in a climate-changed world?

<P>ENST 23650. Revolutionizing Agriculture: Early Modern Technologies for the New Millennium. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Based on a wave of sustainable and organic farming technologies that have reinvented early modern growing practices, this course integrates USDA reports and modern field and lab studies into the historiography of The British Agricultural Revolution. Not all historical technologies were sustainable, and this course relies upon modern agronomy to evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of the farming improvements that defined the British Agricultural Revolution. We similarly explore primary historical sources and historiography to better understand the environmental limits of the technologies used by organic and sustainable farmers today. By bringing the science and history into discourse, we will take a critical look at the British Agricultural Revolution, which is thought to have facilitated the Industrial Revolution by accumulating capital for investment and by allowing England to feed a growing urban population and manufacturing sector without a significant increase in arable acres. We know that yields per acre per worker did increase, but this is the only aspect of the story that remains unquestioned. Some agricultural improvement technologies, like light plowing and enclosure, caused catastrophic environmental harms that ultimately lowered yields over time. Other technologies like The Norfolk Rotation may have had small and gradual impacts over time and cannot be easily correlated with increases in yields on a site-by-site basis in the historical literature or in modern field trials. Other early modern technologies have proven to be more beneficial than previously thought. How can a better understanding of this history inform farming practices today?

<P>ENST 24201. China's Eco-Environmental Challenges and Society's Responses. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In nearly four decades of reform and opening policies, China's economic achievements have come at a high cost for its ecological environment; air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, among other problems, are facts of life for most Chinese citizens. In addition, China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and has recently acknowledged its contributions to global warming and the need for drastic mitigation of greenhouse gases. Facing these tremendous challenges, remarkable shifts in the way that Chinese society communicates and tackles these problems are occurring. This seminar will look, in particular, at relevant public debates, crucial policies, as well as popular initiatives and protest, to approach this wide topic. How is the relationship between humans/society and nature/environment conceptualized and communicated? Can we detect shifts from traditional to modern, even contemporary 'Chinese approaches'? And to what extent and how do political authorities, media, the general population and scientists in China interact in the face of the acknowledged risks that environmental pollution poses to communities, to China's (economic) development and, not least, to individual health and well-being. Basic knowledge about modern Chinese society and politics as well as Chinese reading skills are helpful, but not a strict requirement for participation in this course. Instructor(s): A.L.

<P>ENST 24600. Introduction to Urban Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a grand tour of conceptual frameworks, general phenomena, emerging data and policy applications that define a growing scientific integrated understanding of cities and urbanization. It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses. We will show how issues of inequality also have consequences at more macroscopic levels and derive the general features of population and economic growth for systems of cities and nations.

<P>ENST 24756. Exploring the Resilient City. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In recent years, sub-national units of government have enacted meaningful policy plans in the wake of the ongoing failure of the international community to address global climate change. Cities in particular have shaped their plans to address the now-inevitable effects of climate change by adopting policies that emphasize resilience and environmental protection, without sacrificing economic growth, and with attention to the ongoing challenges of poverty and inequality. This course will take a comparative look at the policies adopted by cities on an international basis, while defining what it means to be a resilient city and how much the built environment can be adjusted to limit the environmental impact of densely populated metropolises. It will also consider what impact citizen activism and input had upon the shape of each plan and the direction that its policies took. Students will also be asked to consider what might be missing from each plan and how each plan could be improved to foster greater resiliency. Instructor(s): R.

<P>Innovation. Prosperity. Democracy. Diversity. Cities long have been lauded as unique incubators of these social features. In contrast to the national level, the smaller scale and dense diversity of cities is thought to encourage the development of civic solutions that work for the many. But cities are inhabited by distinct groups of people with divergent interests and varied beliefs about how to address countless urban issues, such as creating jobs, delivering education, ensuring safe neighborhoods, promoting environmental sustainability, and taking care of the vulnerable. Many groups and organizations have an interest in the outcomes of these processes. Some take action to try to shape them to their own advantage, while others have few chances to make themselves heard. This course examines dynamics of interest representation, decision-making, and inclusion/exclusion in the contemporary city, drawing insights from multiple disciplines and substantive domains.

<P>ENST 25114. Natural History and Empire, circa 1500-1800. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will examine natural history-broadly defined as a systematic, observational body of knowledge devoted to describing and understanding the physical world of plants, animals, natural environments, and (sometimes) people-in the context of European imperial expansion during the early modern era. Natural history was upended by the first European encounters with the New World. The encounter with these new lands exposed Europeans for the first time to unknown flora and fauna, which required acute empirical observation, collection, cataloguing, and circulation between periphery and metropole in order to understand their properties and determine their usefulness. As the Spanish, Portuguese, British, French, and Dutch competed with one another to establish overseas trade and military networks in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, they also competed over and shared information on natural resources. The course will combine lecture and discussion and mix primary source readings on natural history in the early modern world with modern historical writings. Though the readings skew a bit toward Britain and the British Atlantic world, every effort has been made to include texts and topics from multiple European and colonial locales. Topics and themes will include early modern sources of natural history from antiquity and their (re)interpretation in imperial context; early modern collecting cultures and cabinets of curiosities; Linnaeus and the origins of Equivalent Course(s): HIST 25114, HIPS 25114 </P>

<P>ENST 27201. Food Security and Agriculture: Calumet. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Do you know where your next meal will come from? Many people around the world, and even close to home, do not. The Food and Agricultural Organization explains that food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food security is thus a complex issue involving aspects of food production and distribution, poverty, buying power, and social networks, and cultural choice. In this course we use the Calumet region as a case study to examine some aspects of the food security debate, especially the basic conceptual divide between the framework of food security, as defined by international organizations above, and the more grass-roots notion of food sovereignty. Though we will aim for an overview of the issues, we focus this quarter more specifically on issues of agriculture and the food system, including urban agriculture, permaculture, and other challenges to the dominant industrial model. In a region with significant economic distress and area of &quot;food desert,&quot; the Calumet presents examples of both challenge and response to this critical topic. Instructor(s): K.

<P>ENST 27300. Freshwater Ecosystems of the Calumet Region. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Calumet region contains a wide range of important freshwater ecosystems. The Great Lakes are possibly the world's most valuable freshwater ecosystem, while the Kankakee marshes previously supported a massive diversity and abundance of waterfowl and other native species. Since European colonization most of the marshes of the Calumet region have been drained for agriculture, urbanization, or to create new land for industry. All remaining freshwater ecosystems in the Calumet region, including Lake Michigan, have been affected by invasive species, chemical pollution, overfishing, and numerous other factors. This course examines the history of impacts on the extent and functioning of freshwater ecosystems in the Calumet region. Particular attention is paid to the pre-European state of Calumet freshwaters, the impacts of land-use change and invasive species, and the prospects for restoration. The entire course is framed within the context of the economic conditions that allowed freshwater habitats in the Calumet region to be so strongly modified and how current economic conditions affect the likely future of these ecosystems.

<H3>Fundamentals: Issues and Texts </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64338">Department Website: http://fundamentals.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>About Fundamentals </P>

<P>The Fundamentals program enables students to concentrate on fundamental questions by reading classic texts that articulate and speak to these questions. It seeks to foster precise and thoughtful pursuit of basic questions by means of (1) rigorous training in the interpretation of important texts, supported by (2) extensive training in at least one foreign language, and by (3) the acquisition of the knowledge, approaches, and skills of conventional disciplines: historical, religious, literary, scientific, political, and philosophical. </P>

<P>Rationale </P>

<P>A richly informed question or concern formulated by each student guides the reading of texts. Classic texts are also informed by such questions; for example, Socrates asks: What is virtue? What is the good? What is justice? Aristotle and Cicero explore the relation of civic friendship to society. Freud asks: What is happiness? Can humans be happy? Milton investigates how poetic vocation may be related to political responsibility. Students who are engaged by these questions and others like them, and who find them both basic and urgent, may wish to continue to explore them more thoroughly and deeply within the structure of the program which provides the wherewithal to address them on a high level. </P>

<P>That wherewithal is to be found in the fundamental or classic texts (historical, religious, literary, scientific, political, and philosophical) in which the great writers articulate and examine questions in different and competing ways. These books illuminate the persisting questions and speak to contemporary concerns because they are both the originators and exacting critics of our current opinions. These texts serve as colleagues who challenge us to think that something else might actually be the case than what we already think. The most important questions may, at bottom, be the most contested, and those most susceptible to, and most requiring, sustained, probing engagement. </P>

<P>This program emphasizes the firsthand experience and knowledge of major texts, read and reread and reread again. Because they are difficult and complex, only a small number of such works can be studied. Yet the program proposes that intensively studying a profound work and incorporating it into one's thought and imagination prepares one for reading any important book or reflecting on any important issue. Read rapidly, such books are merely assimilated into preexisting experience and opinions; read intensively, they can transform and deepen experience and thought. </P>

<P>Studying fundamental texts is, by itself, not enough. Even to understand the texts themselves, supporting studies and training are necessary: a solid foundation in at least one foreign language and in disciplines and subject matters pertinent to the main questions of students are essential parts of the major. Students benefit from knowledge of the historical contexts out of which certain problems emerged or in which authors wrote; knowledge of specific subject matters and methods; knowledge of the language in which a text was originally written, as well as an understanding of the shape a given language imparts to a given author; fundamental skills of analysis, gathering evidence, reasoning, and criticism; different approaches and perspectives of conventional disciplines. All these are integral parts of the educational task. </P>

<P>Individual Program Design </P>

<P>Genuine questions cannot be assigned to a student; they must arise from within. For this reason, a set curriculum is not imposed upon students. Each student's course of study must answer to his or her interests and concerns, and must begin from a distinctive concern. One student may be exercised about questions of science and religion; another about freedom and determinism; another about friendship and conversation; another by prudence, romance, and marriage; a fifth about distributive justice. Through close work with a suitably chosen faculty adviser, a student determines texts, text and author courses, and supporting courses as appropriate to address the student's Fundamentals question. Beginning with a student's questions and interests does not, however, imply an absence of standards or rigor; this program is most demanding. </P>

<P>Activities of Graduates </P>

<P>The Fundamentals program serves the purposes of liberal education, regarded as an end in itself, and offers no specific pre-professional training; yet Fundamentals graduates have successfully prepared for careers in the professions and in scholarship. Some are now pursuing work in law, medicine, journalism, ministry, government service, business, veterinary medicine, and secondary school teaching. Others have gone on to graduate schools in numerous fields, including classics, English, comparative literature, Slavic, history, philosophy, social thought, theology, religious studies, clinical psychology, political science, development economics, mathematics, film studies, and education. </P>

<P>Faculty </P>

<P>The faculty of the Fundamentals program comprises humanists and social scientists, representing interests and competencies in both the East and the West and scholarship in matters ancient and modern. This diversity and pluralism exists within a common agreement about the primacy of fundamental questions and the centrality of important books and reading them well. The intention is for the students to see and work with a variety of </P>

<P>scholars presenting their approaches to and understanding of books that they love, that they know well, and that are central to their ongoing concerns. </P>

<P>Application to the Program </P>

<P>Students should apply in Spring Quarter of their first year to enter the program in their second year; the goals and requirements of the program are best met if students spend three years in the major. Students are interviewed and counseled in order to discover whether or not their interests and intellectual commitments would be best served by this program. Admissions are decided on the basis of the application statement, interviews, and previous academic performance. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The Fundamentals program comprises (a) 13 courses, (b) the Junior Paper, and (c) the Senior Exam, for a total of 1500 units. </P>

<P>A. Course Work </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Gateway Course (1 course) (Autumn Quarter or Winter Quarter): This course is specifically designed for the incoming cohort of Fundamentals students and is a mandatory part of the program. It is devoted to the close reading of one or two texts or the works of a single author, chosen because they raise challenging questions and present important and competing answers. Through this course, students will study a variety of ways in which a text can respond to their concerns and can compel consideration of its own questions. </LBody>
</LI>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Text/Author Courses (7 courses). The seven Text/Author courses are devoted to the study of one or two particular texts or the work of a particular author. Text/Author courses are generally cross-listed as FNDL courses in Class Search (http://registrar.uchicago.edu/classes); if a relevant course is not cross-listed, the student should contact the coordinator to see if it can be counted towards the major. In years when the Gateway Course is offered in Autumn Quarter, entering students are required to take at least one Text/ Author course in Winter Quarter; in years when the Gateway Course is offered in Winter Quarter, entering students are expected to take at least one Text/Author course in Autumn Quarter. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>The Text/Author Courses and the Gateway Course—eight courses total—give each student the opportunity to develop a list of six texts that will become the basis of his or her Senior Exam (see below). This list should contain works in the area of the student's primary interest that examine that interest from diverse perspectives. One of the six must be studied in an original language other than English, the same language in which the student establishes competency (any exceptions must be approved by the chair). </LI>
</L>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Supporting Courses (4 courses). These are courses that complement the student's program, providing historical context, theoretical and methodological training, or other complements. They do not have to be listed as FNDL to satisfy this requirement, but they must be explicitly identified as supporting courses in consultation with the student's adviser. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Foreign Language (1 course). Students in the program are expected to achieve a level of proficiency in a foreign language sufficient to enable them to study in the original language (other than English) one of the texts on their examination list. Such training ordinarily requires two years of formal language instruction or its equivalent. The third quarter of the second year of the language is counted toward the major. In addition, students are required to take a course where they study a text in that language; the instructor of the course may be asked to provide an evaluation of the student's linguistic proficiency on the basis of this work. Students and instructors should work closely together in determining how the student will demonstrate compentency in the language. As the achievement of proficiency may differ vis-à-vis length of study from language to language, it may prove harder for students of some languages to read a text in its entirety even after completing two years of instruction. Any students who believe that their language is so difficult that doing so is unrealistic may petition to have the requirement met by reading a clearly marked-out portion of the text—perhaps a chapter or two, or series of smaller sections. To be considered, the petition must set out a clear plan and must be signed by the instructor of the text in question. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>B. The Junior Paper In the Winter or Spring Quarter of their junior year, students write an extended essay called the Junior Paper. This project provides the opportunity for students to originate and formulate a serious inquiry into an important issue arising out of their work and to pursue the inquiry extensively and in depth in a paper of about twenty to twenty-five pages (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 words). At every stage in the preparation of the paper, students work closely with their Fundamentals faculty adviser. Students register in the independent study course FNDL 29901 in the quarter in which they write the paper; they are also expected to participate in the Junior Paper Colloquium </P>

<P>that takes place in the Winter Quarter. Acceptance of a successful Junior Paper is a prerequisite for admission to the senior year of the program. </P>

<P>C. The Senior Exam At the end of Week Six in the Spring Quarter of their senior year, students are examined on six texts they have studied in the context of their Text/Author courses and approved independent study courses. Preparation </P>

<P>for this examination allows students to review and integrate their full course of study. During a three-day period, students write two substantial essays on questions designed for them by the associated faculty. The examination </P>

<P>has a pedagogical intention, more than a qualifying one; its purpose is to allow students to demonstrate how they have related and integrated their questions, texts, and disciplinary studies. To take the exam, students register in FNDL 29902 in the Spring Quarter (or, with the consent of the chair, in the Autumn or Winter Quarters </P>

<P>FNDL 21908. Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will offer a close reading of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, one of the great works of ethics. Among the topics to be considered are: What is a good life? What is ethics? What is the relation between ethics and having a good life? What is it for reason to be practical? What is human excellence? What is the non-rational part of the human psyche like? How does it ever come to listen to reason? What is human happiness? What is the place of thought and of action in the happy life? (A) Instructor(s): J. Lear; G. Richardson Lear Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): This course is intended for Philosophy majors and for Fundamentals majors. Otherwise please seek permission to enroll.

<P>FNDL 22001. Foucault and The History of Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course centers on a close reading of the first volume of Michel Foucault's &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, with some attention to his writings on the history of ancient conceptualizations of sex. How should a history of sexuality take into account scientific theories, social relations of power, and different experiences of the self? We discuss the contrasting descriptions and conceptions of sexual behavior before and after the emergence of a science of sexuality. Other writers influenced by and critical of Foucault are also discussed. Instructor(s): A. Davidson Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): One prior philosophy course is strongly recommended. Equivalent Course(s): HIPS 24300, KNOW 27002, CMLT 25001, PHIL 24800, GNSE 23100 </P>

<P>FNDL 23008. Montesquieu's &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; 100 Units. </P>

<P>From its publication in 1748, &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; has been interpreted, among other things, as a foundational work of method in historical jurisprudence; a pæan to the English constitution and an inspiration for that of the future United States; a precocious call for penal reform and the abolition of slavery; a monument to the Enlightenment's capacity for cultural relativism that laid the groundwork for the discipline of sociology; a historical treatise on the rise of globalized commerce and its political effects in Europe; and a manifesto for a reactionary feudal aristocracy. We will read &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; with attention to these and other possible interpretations. This course is mainly an exercise in close reading, but we will also think about the contexts for the writing and reception of this landmark work of Enlightenment social and political thought. Instructor(s): P. Cheney Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Completion of one of these Core sequences: &quot;Classics of Social and Political Thought,&quot; &quot;Power, Identity, Resistance&quot; or &quot;Self, Culture, and Society."

<P>This course will involve a close reading of Michael Walzer's classic text on the ethics of war and his constructive account of the just-war tradition. Among the topics to be addressed are: moral relativism, human rights, and the ethics of various cases, e.g., terrorism, interventions, war crimes, blockades, assassinations, guerrilla warfare, reprisals, pre-emptive warfare, and nuclear deterrence. Relevant now no less than when it was first published in 1977, Walzer's work raises basic questions about the rights of nations and their moral obligations to their citizens and to others during times of war. Instructor(s): Richard B. Miller Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): RLST 24110 </P>

<P>Winter Quarter </P>

<P>FNDL 21404. Shakespeare II: Tragedies and Romances. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores mainly major plays representing the genres of tragedy and romance; most (but not all) date from the latter half of Shakespeare's career. After having examined how Shakespeare develops and deepens the conventions of tragedy in Titus Andronicus, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra, we will turn our attention to how he complicates and even subverts these conventions in The Winter's Tale and The Tempest. Throughout, we will treat the plays as literary texts, performance prompts, and historical documents. Section attendance is required. This course is part of the College Course Cluster, The Renaissance. (Pre-1650, Drama) Instructor(s): Ellen MacKay Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 16600, TAPS 28406 </P>

<P>FNDL 21804. Dante's Divine Comedy-3: Paradiso. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An in-depth study of the third cantica of Dante's masterpiece, considered the most difficult but in many ways also the most innovative. Read alongside his scientific treatise the Convivio and his political manifesto the Monarchia. Instructor(s): H. J. Steinberg Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Completion of the previous courses in the sequence not required, but students should familiarize themselves with the Inferno and the Purgatorio before the first day of class.

<P>FNDL 24011. Virginia Woolf. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Along with a number of Woolf's major works, students read theoretical and critical texts that give a sense of the range of contemporary approaches to Woolf. (1830-1940, Fiction) Instructor(s): Lisa Ruddick Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 23400, ENGL 23400 </P>

<P>FNDL 24718. Longinus' On the Sublime. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Composed around the first or second century C.E., Longinus' On the Sublime marks a new direction in ancient aesthetics and later had a profound influence on the aesthetics of the Romantic period and afterward. It was a watershed between viewing art as imitation and viewing it as self-expression. Great literature was now seen as producing ecstasy, not instruction; and the hearer was thought to share in the creativity of the author. We will read most of this text in Greek, with a view to understanding what is so innovative about it. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): 2 years of Greek Equivalent Course(s): GREK 34718, GREK 24718 </P>

<P>FNDL 24918. Early Traveling Writing: Pausanias in Roman Greece. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Through a close reading of Pausanias, who wrote his Description of Greece during the Roman imperial period, this course explores ancient forms of travel writing and associated interests in the places, peoples, myths, ruins, and material objects of the Mediterranean world. Moving from the apparent ethnographic lens of earlier Greek literature to Roman imperialist expeditions, readings and discussions will examine the sociopolitical contexts out of which Pausanias emerged as a literary author, and his legacies in and relationship to the wide array of genres of modern travel writing, from Lewis and Clark to John Steinbeck. Key topics will include: movement through space, tourism, nature, landscape, town and country, sites and spectacles, myth, ritual, and acts of remembering and forgetting. Instructor(s): C. Kearns Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ANCM 34918, CLCV 24918, CLAS 34918 </P>

<P>FNDL 25700. Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales. 100 Units. </P>

<P>FNDL 27301. Weimar Political Theology: Schmitt and Strauss. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is devoted to the idea of &quot;political theology&quot; that developed during the interwar period in twentieth-century Central Europe, specifically Germany's Weimar Republic. The course's agenda is set by Carl Schmitt, who claimed that both serious intellectual endeavors and political authority require extra-rational and transcendent foundations. Along with Schmitt's works from the period, such as Political Theology and the Concept of the Political, we read and discuss the related writings of perhaps his greatest interlocutor, Leo Strauss. Instructor(s): J. McCormick Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Consent of instructor. Equivalent Course(s): PLSC 37301, PLSC 27301 </P>

<P>FNDL 27950. The Declaration of Independence. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores important intellectual, political, philosophical, legal, economic, social, and religious contexts for the Declaration of Independence. We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke's Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine's Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson's drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (1650-1830, 1830-1940) This is a 2018-19 College Signature Course. Instructor(s): Eric Slauter Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): HMRT 17950, LLSO 27950, HIST 17604, ENGL 17950, SIGN 26039 </P>

<P>FNDL 28401. Pasolini. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines each aspect of Pasolini's artistic production according to the most recent literary and cultural theories, including Gender Studies. We shall analyze his poetry (in particular &quot;Le Ceneri di Gramsci&quot; and &quot;Poesie informa di rosa&quot;), some of his novels (&quot;Ragazzi di vita,&quot; &quot;Una vita violenta,&quot; &quot;Teorema,&quot; &quot;Petrolio&quot;), and his numerous essays on the relationship between standard Italian and dialects, semiotics and cinema, and the role of intellectuals in contemporary Western culture. We shall also discuss the following films: &quot;Accattone,&quot; &quot;La ricotta," &quot;Edipo Re,&quot; &quot;Teorema,&quot; and &quot;Salo&quot;. Instructor(s): A. Maggi Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): ITAL 28400, ITAL 38400, CMST 23500, GNSE 28600, CMST 33500 </P>

<P>FNDL 21300. James Joyce: Ulysses. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course considers themes that include the problems of exile, homelessness, and nationality; the mysteries of paternity and maternity; the meaning of the Return; Joyce's epistemology and his use of dream, fantasy, and hallucinations; and Joyce's experimentation with and use of language. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 21301 </P>

<P>FNDL 21403. Shakespeare I: Histories and Comedies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore a selection of seven or eight plays representing Shakespeare's youthful genres of Comedy and History. We will consider how each play fits, or doesn't fit, within organizing dichotomies like playhouse versus print, popular versus elite, and early versus late. We will also consider how terms that structure our encounter with Shakespeare both form and deform his work, leaving us to ask, Can we do better? This course is part of the College Course Cluster, The Renaissance. Instructor(s): David Simon Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 16500, TAPS 28405 </P>

<P>FNDL 23405. Boethius: Consolation of Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Consolation of Philosophy, which Boethius wrote in prison after a life of study and public service, offers a view on Roman politics and culture after Rome ceased to be an imperial capital. The Consolation is also a poignant testament from a man divided between Christianity and philosophy. About 70 pages of the text are read in Latin, and all of it in English. Secondary readings provide historical and religious context for the early sixth century AD. Instructor(s): P. White Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Latin 20300 or equivalent Equivalent Course(s): LATN 33400, LATN 23400 </P>

<P>FNDL 25220. Pour une sociologie de Rabelais. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Nous aborderons l'œuvre de Rabelais à partir d'une lecture contextuelle de Gargantua et Pantagruel (les deux romans que nous lirons dans ce sours). Le but de ce cours est de présenter le contexte social, politique, économique et religieux de la première moitié du XVIe siècle en reliant les thèmes choisis (guerre, genre, utopie, éducation, amitié, écocomie, etc.), à des problèmes plus modernes. Car Rabelais nous permet aussi d'adresser les grands thèmes de la société française et occidentale contemporaine. Nous étudierons ainsi l'écriture du corps, l'organisation sociale de l'Ancien régime, les premières théories économiques, la découverte du Nouveau Monde et l'exploration de l'altérité. Nous lirons deux romans de Rabelais: Gargantua et Pantagruel. Instructor(s): P. Desan Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): FREN 20300 Note(s): Taught in French.

<P>FNDL 25331. Beauvoir: The Second Sex. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In 1949, Simone de Beauvoir's Le Deuxième Sexe took up the old question of sexual difference; it was never the same question again. Her attention to the situation and &quot;situatedness&quot; of women resulted in new ways of thinking about freedom, destiny, reciprocity, and subjectivity; it brought literature, autobiography, and cultural studies into philosophical reflection; and it contributed significantly to twentieth century transformations of women's social, political, and cultural situations. We will engage a close reading of The Second Sex in English translation and with some reference to the original French. Instructor(s): K. Culp Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 25302 </P>

<P>FNDL 28102. Machiavelli's Political Thought. 100 Units. </P>

Readings include The Prince, Discourses on Livy's History of Rome, selections from the Florentine Histories, and Machiavelli's proposal for reforming Florence's republic, &quot;Discourses on Florentine Affairs.&quot; Topics include the relationship between the person and the polity; the compatibility of moral and political virtue; the utility of class conflict; the advantages of mixed institutions; the principles of self-government, deliberation, and participation; the meaning of liberty; and the question of military conquest. Instructor(s): J. McCormick Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): PLSC 52316, LLSO 28233, PLSC 27216 </P>

<P>Possible Supporting Courses </P>

<P>Supporting Courses are intended to provide further methodological training, historical context, and conceptual frameworks to enrich the student's engagement with the texts, topics, and ideas relevant to his or her project; the selection of such courses will therefore vary considerably from person to person. The list below is a selection of what Fundamentals students might consider as their Supporting Courses, but it is by no means an exhaustive or prescriptive list. Students are encouraged to make a habit of reading the catalogs of other relevant departments and to comb through Class Search (https://coursesearch.uchicago.edu) to locate courses that speak to their interests. The program coordinator and the student's advisers are also valuable resources to consult when planning out the academic year. </P>

Gender and Sexuality Studies allows undergraduates the opportunity to shape a disciplinary or interdisciplinary plan of study focused on gender and sexuality. The plan of study, designed with the assistance of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, can take the form of a gender or sexuality track in a traditional academic discipline, interdisciplinary work on a gender- and/or sexuality-related topic, or a combination thereof. Students can thus create a cluster of courses linked by their attention to gender or sexuality as an object of study or by their use of gender/sexuality categories to investigate topics in sexuality, social life, science, politics and culture, literature and the arts, or systems of thought. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Gender and Sexuality Studies. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>All Gender and Sexuality Studies majors are advised, but not required, to take GNSE 15002-15003 Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations I-II to fulfill their general education requirement in civilization studies. They may fulfill this general education requirement with another sequence and count GNSE 15002-15003 in the major. In some cases students can petition to waive this requirement. </P>

<P>The major requires eleven courses, a BA Essay Seminar, and a BA research project or essay that can count as a thirteenth course. The Center for Gender Studies recognizes two main paths by which students might develop an undergraduate concentration. Path A is for students whose central interest lies in the interdisciplinary study of gender and sexuality; it is designed to provide students with a range of conceptual and historical resources to pursue such study with creativity and rigor. Path B is for students whose interest in gender and sexuality is primarily organized around a specific other discipline or field such as History, English, or Political Science; it is designed to provide students with the conceptual and methodological resources to pursue Gender and Sexuality Studies within such a field. Within those goals, each path is meant to provide students with the opportunity to design a course of study tailored to their particular interests. Each path consists of one theory course, GNSE 10310 Theories of Gender and Sexuality or an approved substitute; a group of ten electives chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Student Affairs Administrator; a BA Essay seminar for fourth-year students; and a BA paper written under the supervision of an appropriate faculty member. </P>

<P>Path A: The course GNSE 10310 Theories of Gender and Sexuality or an approved substitute and ten electives, which must meet the following chronological, geographical, and methodological distribution guidelines: at least one course with a main chronological focus that is pre-1900 and at least one course with a main chronological focus that is post-1900; at least one course with a main focus that is North America or Europe and at least one course with a main focus that is Latin America, Africa, or Asia; at least two courses in the Humanities and at least two courses in the Social Sciences. Any given course may fulfill more than one distribution requirement; for instance, a course on gender in Shakespeare would count as fulfilling one course requirement in pre-1900, Europe, and Humanities. </P>

<P>Path B: The course GNSE 10310 Theories of Gender and Sexuality or an approved substitute and ten elective courses, five or six of which should be primary courses and four or five of which should be supporting courses. Courses in the primary field focus on gender and/or sexuality in a single discipline or in closely related disciplines and develop a gender track within that discipline. Supporting field courses provide training in the methodological, technical, or scholarly skills needed to pursue research in the student's primary field. </P>

<P>Research Project or Essay </P>

<P>A substantial essay or project is to be completed in the student's fourth year under the supervision of a Gender Studies Adviser who is a member of the Gender and Sexuality Studies Affiliated Faculty in the student's primary field of interest. Students must submit the essay by May 1 of their fourth year or by fifth week of their quarter of graduation. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program chair. Approval from both program chairs is required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>It is recommended, but not required, that students who minor in Gender and Sexuality Studies take GNSE 15002-15003 Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations I-II to fulfill their general education requirement. Students who elect the minor program in Gender and Sexuality Studies must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Students choose courses in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. The chair's approval for the minor program should be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and at least four of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Nonmajors are encouraged to use the lists of faculty and course offerings as resources for the purpose of designing programs within disciplines, as an aid for the allocation of electives, or for the pursuit of a BA project. For further work in Gender and Sexuality Studies, students are encouraged to investigate other courses taught by resource faculty.

<P>Gender and Sexuality Studies Courses </P>

<P>GNSE 10310. Theories of Gender and Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is a one-quarter, seminar-style introductory course for undergraduates. Its aim is triple: to engage scenes and concepts central to the interdisciplinary study of gender and sexuality; to provide familiarity with key theoretical anchors for that study; and to provide skills for deriving the theoretical bases of any kind of method. Students will produce descriptive, argumentative, and experimental engagements with theory and its scenes as the quarter progresses. Prior course experience in gender/sexuality studies (by way of the general education civilization studies courses or other course work) is strongly advised. Instructor(s): L. Berlant, K. Schilt Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 20231, ENGL 10310 </P>

<P>GNSE 11002. Medieval Masculinity. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will introduce students to concepts of masculinity in the Middle Ages, especially in the period between approximately 1000 and 1500 CE. Special attention will be paid to medieval notions of honor and to the roles that knighthood, chivalry, and monasticism played in promoting (often contradictory) masculine ideals. The course has two main goals. First, to assess and discuss recent scholarly debates and arguments about medieval masculinity. Second, to read closely a variety of medieval sources-including Arthurian literature, chronicles of the Crusades, biographical texts, and monastic histories-in order to develop new perspectives on masculinity during the Middle Ages. Instructor(s): J. Lyon Terms Offered: TBD Equivalent Course(s): HIST 33516, HIST 23516, GNSE 31002 </P>

<P>GNSE 11009. Problems in the Study of Gender and Sexuality: The Big Issues. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will address contemporary major issues in feminist and queer theory. Instructor(s): Linda Zerilli, Amanda Blair Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>GNSE 11010. Feminism: The Big Issues. 100 Units. </P>

<P>We will examine major recent issues in feminist thought. Instructor(s): Linda Zerilli </P>

<P>GNSE 15002-15003. Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations I-II. </P>

<P>This two-quarter sequence aims to expand students’ exposure to an array of texts—theoretical, historical, religious, literary, visual—that address the fundamental place of gender and sexuality in the social, political, and cultural creations of different civilizations. This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P>GNSE 15002. Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The first quarter offers a theoretical framing unit that introduces concepts in feminist, gender, and queer theory, as well as two thematic clusters, &quot;Kinship&quot; and &quot;Creativity and Cultural Knowledge.&quot; The &quot;Kinship" cluster includes readings on such topics as marriage, sex and anti-sex, love and anti-love, and reproduction. The &quot;Creativity and Cultural Knowledge&quot; cluster addresses the themes of authorship and authority, fighting and constructing the canon, and the debates over the influence of &quot;difference&quot; on cultural forms. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P>GNSE 15003. Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Three thematic clusters make up the second quarter. &quot;Politics&quot; focuses on texts related to activism/ movement politics and women's rights as human rights and the question of universalism. &quot;Religion" contextualizes gender and sexuality through examinations of a variety of religious laws and teachings, religious practices, and religious communities. &quot;Economics&quot; looks at slavery, domestic service, prostitution as labor, consumption, and the gendering of labor in contemporary capitalism. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): GNSE 15002 Note(s): This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P>GNSE 21001. Cultural Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of &quot;normal&quot; psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of &quot;culture&quot; and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning. Instructor(s): R. Shweder Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Undergraduates must be in third or fourth year.

<P>GNSE 21400. Advanced Theories of Gender and Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Zerilli: This course examines contemporary theories of sexuality, culture, and society. We then situate these theories in global and historical perspectives. Topics and issues are explored through theoretical, ethnographic, and popular film and video texts. Simon: Our itinerary in this coursewill be interdisciplinary, ranging from political theory to science studies. Topics for discussion will likely include: the gendering of reason and passion in the history of philosophy; the power, persistence, and flexibility of norms; the relationship between eros and other forms of desire; the division of labor and other economic tributaries to gendered experience; openings for and challenges to the political aspirations of sexual (and other) minorities; and the pressures exerted by technology on erotic life. Students will engage key concepts in the field, and will be encouraged to experiment with new ones. Instructor(s): L. Zerilli Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Completion of GNSE 10100-10200 and GNSE 28505 or 28605 or permission of instructor.

<P>GNSE 21500. Darwinian Health. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will use an evolutionary, rather than clinical, approach to understanding why we get sick. In particular, we will consider how health issues such as menstruation, senescence, pregnancy sickness, menopause, and diseases can be considered adaptations rather than pathologies. We will also discuss how our rapidly changing environments can reduce the benefits of these adaptations. Instructor(s): J. Mateo Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Permission of instructor only. Note(s): CHDV Distribution: A Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 21500, HIPS 22401 </P>

<P>GNSE 22904. Theories of Sexual Violence in American Culture. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 26910 </P>

<P>GNSE 22905. Gendering Privacy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Interest in privacy has surged in recent decades in light of the emergence of Big Data, the rise of increasingly sophisticated methods of surveillance, and the ubiquity of networked social media in everyday life. Yet privacy remains a notoriously slippery concept to pin down-across disciplines, privacy has been conceptualized variously as a legal right, a psychological state of being, a set of preferences, and a boundary-making process. In this course, we take a sociological approach to privacy, starting with the notion that privacy is at once a decidedly &quot;micro&quot; individual phenomenon and at the same time a product of &quot;macro&quot; social-structural forces. Thus, while privacy preferences can vary from person to person, the capacity to achieve privacy is shaped by social position (e.g., race, class, gender, etc.). In this course, we focus specifically on how women and men experience possibilities for privacy and how these experiences are shaped by their racial and class location. We will draw on a range of theoretical perspectives, including feminist theory, critical legal theory, and critical race theory to examine privacy through the lens of social inequality. Empirically, we will investigate how the twin systems of welfare and criminal justice present challenges to privacy for men and women living in poverty. The main questions guiding our inquiry include: Who gets to have privacy (and who doesn't), why, and at what costs? Instructor(s): C. Hughes Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>GNSE 23100. Foucault and The History of Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course centers on a close reading of the first volume of Michel Foucault's &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, with some attention to his writings on the history of ancient conceptualizations of sex. How should a history of sexuality take into account scientific theories, social relations of power, and different experiences of the self? We discuss the contrasting descriptions and conceptions of sexual behavior before and after the emergence of a science of sexuality. Other writers influenced by and critical of Foucault are also discussed. Instructor(s): A. Davidson Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): One prior philosophy course is strongly recommended. Equivalent Course(s): HIPS 24300, KNOW 27002, CMLT 25001, PHIL 24800, FNDL 22001 </P>

<P>Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 21403, RLST 21312 </P>

<P>GNSE 23104. Gender, Sexuality, and Islamic Traditions. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the discourses surrounding gender and sexuality in the Islamic tradition, from the early Islamic period to the present day. The course will focus on two particular themes: (1) Islamic traditions of thought on issues of gender and sexuality, and (2) The transformations that have altered the space in which these discourses take place today in the Western academy. In each class, we will focus our readings and responses through discussion questions. In this interdisciplinary course, the instructors will compare and contrast their perspectives of classical Islamic studies, text criticism, and legal theory with feminist studies, postcolonial and critical theory, and the anthropology of religion. Instructor(s): T. Gutmann, M. Sheibani Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): NEHC 23104, RLST 28012 </P>

<P>GNSE 23603. Grace, Love, and Pleasure. Painting in Eighteenth Century France. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The easing of political life and the relaxation of private morals which came to characterize the long reign of Louis XV (1715-1774) was mirrored by the development of a new conception of art, an art more intimate, decorative, generally amorous, and often erotic. It is these last two related dimensions which are the basis of a new visual aesthetic which constitutes the subject matter of this course. Through the exploration of contemporary novels and theater, as well as contemporary critical and philosophical writings, we will demonstrate how both the sensual and the erotic become essential components of the century's cultural ethos. Artistic subjects, the mechanisms to represent them, their metaphorical stakes, and their phenomenological effects on the beholder will therefore be considered as the expression of a particular historical and ideological context. It is in this context that love became the symbol of a king who privileged peace against war, and where emotional pleasure triumphed over moralizing values and asserted itself as a new aesthetic category. Instructor(s): S. Caviglia-Brunel Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Students who take this course for French credit must do the readings and assignments in French. Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 33603, ARTH 23603, FREN 36303, TAPS 26303, FREN 26303, ARTH 33603 </P>

<P>GNSE 28604. Law &amp; Social Movements in Modern America. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course traces and examines the relationship of law and social movements in the United States since 1865. We examine how lawyers and ordinary citizens have used the law to support the expansion of social, political, and economic rights in America. We also look at how the state and civic organizations have shaped and deployed law to criminalize the strategies of social reform movements and stifle dissent. Instructor(s): J. Dailey Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): HIST 28604, HMRT 28604, LLSO 28604 </P>

<P>GNSE 29600. Feminist Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course is an introduction to the major varieties of philosophical feminism. After studying some key historical texts in the Western tradition (Wollstonecraft, Rousseau, J. S. Mill), we examine four types of contemporary philosophical feminism: Liberal Feminism (Susan Moller Okin, Martha Nussbaum), Radical Feminism (Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin), Difference Feminism (Carol Gilligan, Annette Baier, Nel Noddings), and Postmodern &quot;Queer&quot; Gender Theory and trans femism (Judith Butler, Michael Warner and others). After studying each of these approaches, we will focus on political and ethical problems of contemporary international feminism, asking how well each of the approaches addresses these problems.

<P>GEOG 20273. Urban Spatial Archaeology I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Space and time are fundamental concepts in urban spatial science. In this course, students will gain substantive and technical knowledge on how to analyze space and time through the tools of urban spatial archaeology. Specifically, this course will introduce students to various historical data sources on Chicago and New Orleans to digitize, then conduct a spatial historical analysis of any topic of their choice. By taking a historical approach to the study of time and space, students will walk away from the course with (1) ways to conceptualize time and space when studying urban issues, and (2) skills for designing a project to empirically demonstrate the workings of time and space in the real world. At the end of this course, students will be expected to have produced a historical dataset for a research paper that will be completed in the next course sequence. Instructor(s): R. Vargas Terms Offered: Winter. Cancelled - Not offered in 2018/19 Prerequisite(s): GEOG 20500 and GEOG 28201 Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 20273, GEOG 30273, SOCI 30273 </P>

<P>GEOG 20274. Urban Spatial Archaeology II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course builds off Urban Spatial Archaeology I, by focusing on more specific ways to apply the concepts of space and time to contemporary urban research issues. Students will also learn methods for analyzing the data they chose to digitize in the previous quarter, which will culminate in a research paper on a topic of their choosing. Students will walk away from this course with a deeper understanding of how researchers and policy makers think of space and time with respect to a particular urban issue. In addition, students will have produced a research paper and data visualization that would critique the ways researchers have traditionally conceptualized time and space. Instructor(s): R.

<P>GEOG 24600. Introduction to Urban Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a grand tour of conceptual frameworks, general phenomena, emerging data and policy applications that define a growing scientific integrated understanding of cities and urbanization. It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses. We will show how issues of inequality also have consequences at more macroscopic levels and derive the general features of population and economic growth for systems of cities and nations.

<P>GEOG 26400. Frontiers and Borders in South Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sometimes the frontline of empires and nation-states, sometimes neglected or inaccessible, peripheral spaces are often of core concern to the central state. The aim of this upper-level undergraduate seminar is to examine the history of borders, borderlands, and frontiers as political and social concepts and as produced spaces. We will examine an array of case studies in addition to more theoretical scholarship that spans the disciplines of history, environmental studies, political science, anthropology, and geography. While using South Asia (itself a rather recently invented &quot;area&quot;) as the primary geographic and historical focus this course will not be bound exclusively to it. The first goal of the course is to explore the evolution of key concepts such as space, territory, frontier, and borders/borderlands. The second goal is to develop methods for analyzing subjects that are simultaneously physical spaces and political, social, and historical ideas. Finally, it seeks to introduce students to areas that often fall beyond the penumbra of historical surveys centered on the nation-state. No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Department of the Geophysical Sciences (GEOS) offers unique programs of study in the earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences. Topics include the physics, chemistry, and dynamics of the atmosphere, oceans, and ice sheets; past and present climate change; the origin and history of the Earth, moon, and meteorites; properties of the deep interior of the Earth and the dynamics of crustal movements; and the evolution and geography of life and the Earth's surface environments through geologic time. These multidisciplinary topics require an integrated approach founded on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. </P>

<P>Both the BA and BS programs prepare students for careers that draw upon the earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences. However, the BS degree provides a more focused and intensive program of study for students who intend to pursue graduate work in these disciplines. The BA degree also offers thorough study in the geophysical sciences, but it provides a wide opportunity for elective freedom to pursue interdisciplinary interests, such as environmental policy, law, medicine, business, and precollege education. </P>

<P>Candidates for the BS in Geophysical Sciences complete a year of chemistry, a year of physics, a year of mathematics (including Calculus I-II), and a year of biology and BIOS 20198 Biodiversity). </P>

<P>The requirement for the third quarter of mathematics may be satisfied by either completing the calculus sequence (recommended for students taking the more introductory MATH 13000s sequence but not specifically required or recommended for the higher tracks such as MATH 15000s, as the first two quarters offer a sufficiently comprehensive calculus training for students to move on to other courses) or taking one of the designated mathematical methods courses instead. In addition, students must complete two elective courses from Computational Sciences (List 2). The requirements are structured to allow and encourage students to complete sequences that extend through the study of differential equations. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to begin discipline-specific courses as early as possible. Required disciplinary courses include GEOS 13100 Physical Geology, GEOS 13200 Earth History, and GEOS 13300 The Atmosphere, which is the introductory sequence. With prior consent of the departmental counselor, students with the appropriate background may substitute a 20000-level course, which may be taken during or after the third year. </P>

<P>A minimum of eight additional 20000-level science courses are required. At least four must be GEOS courses from List 1. Up to three may be chosen from other science courses in List 1. Up to two may be chosen from Computational Sciences (List 2). One may be a field course. One may be GEOS 29700 Reading and Research in the Geophysical Sciences. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students majoring in geophysical sciences must receive quality grades in all courses taken to meet requirements in the major. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>The BA or BS degree with honors is awarded to students who meet the following requirements: (1) a GPA of 3.25 or higher in the major and of 3.0 or higher overall; (2) completion of a paper based on original research, supervised and approved by a faculty member in geophysical sciences; (3) an oral presentation of the thesis research. All theses will be examined by the supervisor and a second reader from the faculty. Manuscript drafts will generally be due in the sixth week of the quarter in which the student will graduate (fifth week in Summer Quarter), and final manuscripts and oral presentations in the eighth week (seventh week in Summer Quarter). </P>

<P>Students are strongly encouraged to reach out to potential faculty supervisors no later than their third year, since theses generally arise out of research projects already begun with faculty members. When a thesis topic is determined, students should notify the undergraduate adviser of their intent to complete a thesis and confirm their eligibility. GEOS 29700 Reading and Research in the Geophysical Sciences can be devoted to the preparation of the required paper; however, students using this course to meet a requirement in the major must take it for a quality grade. </P>

<P>Students who wish to submit a single paper to meet the honors requirement in geophysical sciences and the BA paper requirement in another major should discuss their proposals with the undergraduate advisers from both programs no later than the end of third year. Certain requirements must be met. A consent form, to be signed by the undergraduate advisers, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Sample BS Programs </P>

<P>Each student will design an individual plan of course work, choosing from a wide range of selections that take advantage of rich offerings from a variety of subdisciplines. The sample programs that appear below are merely for the purpose of illustration; many other variations would be possible. NOTE: Courses that meet general education requirements and are required for the major are not listed. </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The program for the BA degree in Germanic Studies is intended to provide students with a wide ranging and highly personalized introduction to the language, literature, and culture of German-speaking countries and to various methods of approaching and examining these areas. It is designed to be complemented by other areas of study (e.g., anthropology, art history, comparative literature, economics, film studies, history, philosophy, political science, sociology). </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Germanic Studies. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students majoring in Germanic Studies typically register for six German language courses at the second-year level and above, plus six courses in German literature and culture, including three literature or culture courses taken in German, and GRMN 29900 BA Paper. With prior approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), students may count up to three relevant German-oriented courses from other departments in the humanities or social sciences toward the requirements of the major in Germanic Studies. Students must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss a plan of study as soon as they declare their major and no later than the end of Spring Quarter of their third year. Students must have their programs approved by the DUS before the end of their third year. </P>

<P>BA Paper </P>

<P>The BA paper typically is a research paper of a minimum of twenty-five pages. While the paper may be written in either English or German, it must include a bibliography that makes ample use of German-language sources. Students must submit a proposal for their BA paper to their faculty adviser by the beginning of the eighth week of Autumn Quarter in their senior year. A first draft of the paper is due on the first day of Spring Quarter, and the completed paper must be submitted by the beginning of the sixth week of Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>Germanic Studies will accept a paper or project used to meet the BA requirement in another major, under the condition that original German sources are used. Students should consult with both chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>GRMN 22312. Reforming Religious Media: Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Protestant Reformation began with a carefully orchestrated media event, when Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the door of a church in Wittenberg. Concurrently, he resorted to the still new medium of print to disseminate more widely his scathing critique of the Catholic Church's use of indulgences to communicate God's grace. This was only the beginning of Luther's sweeping attack on the Church's role as the sole mediator of salvation. No religious medium or communicational practice remained unquestioned, resulting in their comprehensive reform. Soon other reformers joined in, pushing the critique even further by questioning the need and validity of all religious mediation. Approaching the Protestant Reformation as a reform of religious media, this lecture course will give particular attention to the congenial alliance between Martin Luther's religious message and the emerging technology of the printing press, the role of Scripture in legitimating Protestant theologies of communication, controversies around particular religious media like images or the eucharist, and the role of direct inspiration in radical reformers. This course will be taught in lecture format. Instructor(s): Christopher Wild Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>GRMN 25005. The Pleasure of Literature: The Novella. 100 Units. </P>

<P>According to Ian McEwan, the novella is &quot;the perfect form of prose fiction. It is the beautiful daughter of a rambling, bloated, ill-shaven giant&quot; (i.e., the novel.) This course introduces students to the short prose form of the German novella from Romanticism to the present. We will use the genre of the novella to explore the many pleasures of reading literature, among which storytelling features prominently. What kind of storytelling happens in a novella? Where does the pleasure of reading stem from? How can we think the relationship between pleasure and literature? How do developments in new media and new modes of reading affect our pleasure? How can we compare our literary gratification to other types of readerly gratification such as those coming from news articles, blog entries, and other short forms (aphorisms, magazine articles) - or, for that matter, the &quot;reading&quot; of images? Might the pleasure of literature also point to its utility? Readings include: Boccaccio, Goethe, Hoffmann, Kleist, Keller, Büchner, Schnitzler, M. Walser, and others, alongside some scientific articles (e.g., cognitive neuroscience) and theoretical texts. Instructor(s): Margareta Ingrid Christian Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): This course will be taught in German. Equivalent Course(s): GRMN 35005 </P>

<P>GRMN 28150. Pragmatist Aesthetics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An inquiry into pragmatism's relationship with philosophical aesthetics. The emphasis is on aesthetic action, making of the self and of the human form. Authors include Emerson, Nietzsche, Dewey, Heidegger, Rorty. Instructor(s): Florian Klinger Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): For undergraduates, consent of instructor required. Equivalent Course(s): GRMN 38150 </P>

<P>GRMN 28500. Comparative Fairy Tales. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How do we account for the allure of fairy tales? For some, fairy tales count as sacred tales meant to enchant rather than edify. For others, they are cautionary tales, replete with obvious moral lessons. For the purposes of the course, we will assume that these critics are correct in their contention that fairy tales contain essential underlying meanings. We will conduct our own readings of fairy tales from the German Brothers Grimm, the Norwegians, Asbjørnsen and Moe and the Dane, Hans Christian Andersen, relying on our own critical skills as well as selected secondary readings.

<P>According to Ian McEwan, the novella is &quot;the perfect form of prose fiction. It is the beautiful daughter of a rambling, bloated, ill-shaven giant&quot; (i.e., the novel.) This course introduces students to the short prose form of the German novella from Romanticism to the present. We will use the genre of the novella to explore the many pleasures of reading literature, among which storytelling features prominently. What kind of storytelling happens in a novella? Where does the pleasure of reading stem from? How can we think the relationship between pleasure and literature? How do developments in new media and new modes of reading affect our pleasure? How can we compare our literary gratification to other types of readerly gratification such as those coming from news articles, blog entries, and other short forms (aphorisms, magazine articles) - or, for that matter, the &quot;reading&quot; of images? Might the pleasure of literature also point to its utility? Readings include: Boccaccio, Goethe, Hoffmann, Kleist, Keller, Büchner, Schnitzler, M. Walser, and others, alongside some scientific articles (e.g., cognitive neuroscience) and theoretical texts.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Global Studies major is an interdisciplinary major concerned with the interconnected and interdependent nature of the contemporary world. Its main task is to understand how sites, objects, and concepts contribute to worldwide connections, from ecological concerns to human rights campaigns. Students majoring in Global Studies will take courses throughout the College, often with particular interests in Anthropology, Environmental Studies, History, or a specific regional study. </P>

<P>Instead of beginning with “global” and “local,&quot; the typical categories of globalization studies, the Global Studies program contends that the distinctions between sites and trends, between objects far and near, and between the cosmopolitan and the vernacular emerge from empirical studies. Students are encouraged to exercise close attention to mundane practices, everyday materialities, and lived experiences. With a good grounding in case studies, students in the program are expected to be able to reflect upon the implications of their research interests, both inside and outside the classroom. Students carry these interests on to a variety of careers and professional opportunities following graduation. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students must complete a total of 13 courses (including one approved elective and two BA seminars), a research activity, and a language requirement, broken down in the following manner: </P>

<P>Introductory Courses (2 courses) </P>

<P>All students are required to take the two-quarter introductory sequence to the major, GLST 23101-23102 Global Studies I-II. These courses are offered annually and in sequence in the Autumn and Winter Quarters. Students are expected to complete the sequence in their second year, if possible, especially if they plan to study abroad during their third year. </P>

<P>Thematic Tracks (8 courses) </P>

<P>The body of the major (eight courses in all) is comprised of courses selected from four overlapping thematic tracks of study. Students will select two tracks, a primary and a secondary one, and complete five courses in the former and three in the latter. The selection of the primary and secondary tracks should be linked to the student’s BA research interests. The tracks are outlined below with sample classes that might fall within each category, but more detailed information about these tracks may be found on the Global Studies website (http:// globalstudies.uchicago.edu). </P>

<P>Bodies and Nature </P>

<P>This track focuses on bodily nature (broadly construed) and ecological relationships. Particular attention is paid to environmental and health-related topics, and not always with a focus on human beings. Themes could range from sustainability, ecotourism, and pandemics to modern beauty practices, health movements, and animal studies. </P>

<P>BIOS 13140 The Public and Private Lives of Insects GRMN 24416 Biocentrism: The Concept of Life in German Literature and Art ANTH 28210 Colonial Ecologies </P>

<P>Knowledge and Practice </P>

<P>This track focuses on the production and circulation of knowledge, with an eye towards how that process is situated. Often there will be a science and technology component, but other times habitual/ instinctual know-how will be highlighted. Themes could range from regulatory standards, countercultural movements, and cultural artifacts to consumer politics and media studies. </P>

<P>HIST 24206 Medicine and Culture in Modern East Asia ENGL 29202 Objects, Things, and Other Things SOCI 20208 Internet and Society </P>

<P>Cultures at Work </P>

<P>This track focuses on the entanglements of culture, economics, and politics. It focuses on cultural production, often of a physical nature, as well as cultural modes of reception. Themes could range from global brands, sweatshops, and rituals of food production/consumption to gaming and consumer politics. Much of “everyday life” would also apply. </P>

<P>ANTH 21725 Mass Mediated Society and Japan GLST 24101 Paperwork ECON 22650 Creativity </P>

<P>Governance and Affiliations </P>

<P>This track focuses on politics and claims to authority within power relations. It tries to stand a middle ground between extremes of privileging nation-states and solely valuing micro-sites of governance. </P>

<P>Themes could range from UN agencies to online protests, humanitarian intervention to surveillance and </P>

<P>corporate governance. </P>

<P>CRES 22150 Contemporary African American Politics PLSC 27016 Popular Culture, Art, and Autocracy PLSC 29500 Drugs, Guns, and Money: The Politics of Criminal Conflict </P>

<P>Elective (1 course) Students will select one elective course to further their BA research, often late in their third or early in their fourth year. This course should be chosen after discussion with the program administrator, and can include: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A regional studies course that furthers the student's cultural and historical knowledge in their BA research topic </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A research methodology course (e.g., ANTH 21420 Ethnographic Methods) that will equip the student for better collection of primary source materials </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>An introductory course in another major that has a direct connection to the BA research topic </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A language course that will help the student read texts or interact with persons pertaining to their BA research topic </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>These options are not exhaustive and should only be used as guiding ideas for the elective requirement. Students should seek program approval for their choice of elective course before registering, and the elective should be completed before the Winter Quarter of the student's fourth year. </P>

<P>Research Activity Requirement Students will be expected to complete a structured activity or program exploring global issues related to their intended BA project, often in an international setting. </P>

<P>This major activity might be: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>An internship (academic year or summer) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Select study abroad programs, often through the Study Abroad office </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A volunteer opportunity </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A well-defined field research project </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students should work with the program administrator to identify appropriate opportunities and should have their activity approved ahead of the experience itself. Most activities should last no less than six weeks, though intensive programs with shorter durations may be considered. </P>

<P>The research activity should be linked to the student’s BA thesis and serve as an introduction to that topic. International experiences are encouraged for the completion of this requirement, but the requirement may be met with domestic projects dealing with global issues (for example, an internship with a domestic NGO). </P>

<P>BA Seminars and Thesis (2 courses) Students are required to take the two-quarter BA seminar (GLST 29800 BA Thesis Seminar I and GLST 29801 BA Thesis Seminar II) in Autumn and Winter Quarters of their fourth year. The first BA deadline occurs during the Spring Quarter of a student’s third year. At that time, students must have submitted a topic proposal, secured a faculty reader, and completed a faculty reader form. The final version of the BA thesis is due by the second Friday of the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. Successful completion of the thesis requires a passing grade from the faculty reader. </P>

<P>The Global Studies major thesis must be clearly organized around a contemporary global issue. Students may double-major, but double-majoring with another program that also requires a BA thesis would entail (a) the second major's program accepting the Global Studies thesis as fulfilling that program's BA requirements or (b) the student completing an additional BA thesis for the second major. </P>

<P>Regardless of the requirements of the second major, Global Studies majors are required to complete both quarters of the fourth-year BA seminar. Thesis seminars from other major programs will not count toward the Global Studies BA Thesis Seminar requirement. </P>

<P>Foreign Language Requirement </P>

<P>The Global Studies language requirement can be completed in two ways: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students may complete the equivalent of a seventh quarter of language study in a single language. Credit for the seventh and final quarter of the language must be earned by University of Chicago course registration. If the final term of study in a foreign language focuses on cultural studies, it may be used in an appropriate primary or secondary thematic track, as outlined above. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students may obtain an Advanced Language Proficiency Certificate, which is documentation of advanced functional ability in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. For details, visit the College's Advanced Language Proficiency (http://college.uchicago.edu/academics-advising/academic-opportunities/ advanced-language-proficiency) page. </LBody>

<P>GLST 23403. Borders, (Im)mobilities and Human Rights. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the human cost of border control? To what extent do individuals possess the right to move to other states? How do different states with large populations of refugees and asylum seekers develop and enforce migration policies, and what do the differences in these policies reveal about the social histories and futures of these states? To address these questions, we will consider how borders, institutions, and categories of migrant groups mutually shape one another. We will explore the interrelationships between categories of migration-forced, economic, regular, and irregular-in order to understand the multiple and unequal forms of mobility experienced by those who inhabit these categories. By utilizing a framework of human rights, this course will investigate how contemporary issues in migration-such as border management, illicit movement, and the fuzzy distinction between forced and economic migration-raise and reopen debates concerning the management of difference. We will draw on the work of anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers, as well as journalists, legal, and medical professionals. Our readings each week will include a mix of conceptual, ethnographic, long-form journalism, and policy texts. When possible, we will also invite representatives from different Chicago-based organizations that promote and protect the rights of people in various situations of migration to come to our class to discuss their work.

<P>GLST 24110. In the Beginning&quot;: Origin Stories in Science and Religion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the origin of the universe? What is the origin of humanity? These questions have generated a plethora of answers, many of which fall within domains of what we now consider to be science and religion. However, as we will see through our readings, these two categories are hard to define; classifications often overlap, and science and religion intertwine throughout history and until today. What do we call &quot;myth,&quot; and what do we term &quot;theory&quot;? In this class, we will focus on not only the cultural embeddedness of religious and scientific narratives, but also the cultural implications of these texts. The course begins with origin stories and asks students to consider their power in shaping our world and perspectives, focusing on the ethical dimensions and implications of these narratives. What kind of relationships do we imagine among human beings, and between human and nonhuman beings in this world, given particular origin stories as our starting point? Finally, in relation to this goal of interrogating the ethical import of origin narratives, this course will close by asking whether we can imagine other kinds of origin stories (such as in the genre of science fiction), and what implications these imaginal narratives hold. Instructor(s): Sartell, Elizabeth Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): RLST 28110 </P>

<P>GLST 24111. Medical Knowledge in the Islamicate World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Drawing on Marshall Hodgson's term 'Islamicate' this course follows medical knowledge as a cultural and political object as it travels through various iterations across and between dynastic and modern colonial imperial formations. For students of Islamic studies, the course suggests how medical knowledge can be a point of departure for illuminating intellectual, social and political history. For students of globalization, it situates that phenomenon's association with the space-time compressions of capitalism within a longer genealogy of migrations and knowledge exchanges. The course asks students to engage with several fundamental questions: Why was the medical knowledge produced in Greek antiquity absorbed and transformed by the Islamicate world? How did this medical knowledge change in translation between languages and across regionally specific cultural assemblages? How might close attention to the historically situated practices of medical knowledge production disrupt an essentialist understanding of 'Islamic culture'? Ultimately, the central aim of this course is to urge students to think more deeply about the methods and sources for understanding the entangled histories of the Islamicate world. Instructor(s): Datoo, Sabrina Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>GLST 24112. Global Food. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Do you know where the food you had for breakfast this morning came from? Who produced it? Where it was made? How far it travelled to make its way to your table? This class begins from the observation that the everyday act of eating is often a global practice in contemporary societies. From the international circulation of mega-brands like Coca-Cola, to the migrant labor that harvests much of America's fresh produce, food provides a vantage-point for examining global connections. These connections are often produced through food: such as eating foreign cuisines, or receiving the international distribution of humanitarian food aid. Taking food as its central object, this class examines issues of the 'global' related to labor, political economy, biotechnology, humanitarian aid, nutrition science, brands and marketing, as well as everyday consumption and meaning-making. We will ask questions about the global politics of food, such as: How are global conditions of food production structured and organized? How do people make sense of global commodities within their own social worlds, and how do they use them to imagine connections with distant others? How are scientific concepts of nutrition and obesity made to circulate globally, and what impact do these ideas have in the places where they are exported? How do people imagine culture in relation to food, and what meanings is food given in contexts of cosmopolitanism and diaspora? Instructor(s): Butler, Ella Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>GLST 25310. Extinction, Disaster, Dystopia: Environment and Ecology in the Indian Subcontinent. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims to provide students an overview of key environmental and ecological issues in the Indian subcontinent. How have the unique precolonial, colonial, regional and national histories of this region shaped the peculiar nature of environmental issues? We will consider three major concepts-&quot;extinction&quot;, &quot;disaster&quot; and &quot;dystopia&quot; to see how they can be used to frame issues of environmental and ecological concern. Each concept will act as a framing device for issues such as conservation and preservation of wildlife, erasure of adivasi (first dwellers) ways of life, environmental justice, water scarcity and climate change. The course will aim to develop students' ability to assess the specificity of these concepts in different disciplines. For example: What methods and sources will an environmental historian use to write about wildlife? How does this differ from the approach an ecologist or literary writer might take? Students will analyze various media: both literary and visual, such as autobiographies of shikaris (hunters), graphic novels, photographs, documentary films, ethnographic accounts and environmental history.

<P>GLST 26804. Frontiers and Borders in South Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sometimes the frontline of empires and nation-states, sometimes neglected or inaccessible, peripheral spaces are often of core concern to the central state. The aim of this upper-level undergraduate seminar is to examine the history of borders, borderlands, and frontiers as political and social concepts and as produced spaces. We will examine an array of case studies in addition to more theoretical scholarship that spans the disciplines of history, environmental studies, political science, anthropology, and geography. While using South Asia (itself a rather recently invented &quot;area&quot;) as the primary geographic and historical focus this course will not be bound exclusively to it. The first goal of the course is to explore the evolution of key concepts such as space, territory, frontier, and borders/borderlands. The second goal is to develop methods for analyzing subjects that are simultaneously physical spaces and political, social, and historical ideas. Finally, it seeks to introduce students to areas that often fall beyond the penumbra of historical surveys centered on the nation-state. No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed. Weekly readings will average 150 pages. Note: No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed. Equivalent Course(s): GEOG 26400, SALC 26804, HIST 26804 </P>

<P>GLST 27702. About Nature: From Science to Sense. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Consider mushrooms,&quot; Anna Tsing (2012) suggests to those who are curious about human nature and she points to the relational and biological diversity found at the unruly edges of the global empire-the governmentalized, politicized, commoditized culture nature of capitalism. This class follows the suit, tracking the scent of what evidently remains, thrives, withdraws, overwhelms, and inspires wonder in the guises of the natural, wild, organic, or awesome. Instructor(s): L. Jasarevic Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): INST 27702, ANTH 25117 </P>

<P>GLST 27703. Earthbound Metaphysics: Speculations on Earths and Heavens. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Social thought has recently reopened the subject matter of the &quot;world&quot;: what is it made of, how does it hold together, who and what inhabits it? Proposals and inquiries generated in response are as imaginative as they are self-consciously urgent: written on the crest of the global ecological disaster, from within the zones of disturbance or the sites of extreme intervention into the living matter and forms of life, contemplating the end of the world and possibilities of extinction, redemption, cohabitation, or &quot;collateral survival&quot; (Tsing 2015). All are variously political. Foregrounding the plurality of the material worlds and lived worldviews on the one hand, and of the shared historical predicament on the other, social thinkers question universal values and conceivable relations, and search for alternate forms of grasping, engaging, and representing the pluriverse. This course goes along with such interests in the &quot;worlds&quot; and collects a number of compelling, contemporary texts that are variously oriented towards cosmopolitics, &quot;minimalist metaphysics,&quot; &quot;new materialisms,&quot; speculative realisms, ecotheology, and multispecies coexistence. Readings will stretch out to examine some classic ethnographic texts and past theoretical excursions into the perennial problem of how to know and tell the unfamiliar, native, worlds, which are swept by, mingling with, or standing out in the more globalizing trends of capitalist, scientific, and secular materialism. Equivalent Course(s): ANTH 25118 </P>

<P>GLST 29524. Approaches to World History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is world history? This seemingly simple question is a source of great debate, such as the heated responses to the College Board's recent decision to cut material prior to 1450 from AP World History. How we answer it says a great deal about how we view the world and history generally. This course introduces answers to this question by previous scholars and challenges students to assess how these answers relate to their own education and intellectual interests at the University of Chicago. We will touch on major approaches and trends in the growing field of world history, including civilizational studies, the &quot;great divergence&quot; or &quot;rise of the West,&quot; world-systems theory, environmental history, &quot;big history,&quot; and the study of specific people, places, and objects in the context of world history. Students will leave with a solid grounding in one of the most vibrant and contentious fields of history today and a better understanding of the diversity of ways to situate historical narratives and current events into a global perspective.

<P>GLST 29525. The Global Life of Things. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is a commodity? And can we read capitalism's global history through the commodity form? This course will investigate how historians and anthropologists have studied commodities and commodification to account for the environmental, social, and cultural developments of capitalism over the last four centuries. We will begin by considering canonical theoretical approaches, including Marx, Polanyi, and Appadurai. Readings will then be based around case studies of, among other things, land, cotton, and slavery; sugar, guano, and mushrooms. Readings will span from the early modern Atlantic World through to the nineteenth-century Pacific, the twentieth-century Middle East, and the United States and Japan in the present day. The course should appeal to students pursuing studies of the early modern Atlantic world, economic history, or environmental history. Instructor(s): O.

<P>GLST 29610. Cultures and Politics of Water. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course investigates the relationship between water, culture, and society in the global past. Instead of studying water from the natural science perspective, it places the cultural and political aspects of water at the center of the analysis, and posits the need for a long-term understanding of our contemporary water problems in a global context. The seminar draws on much empirical literature on the cultural and political dimensions of water in local contexts, and aims to relate them through the concept of globalization.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>For decades the University of Chicago has been a leader in the study of history, through its pioneering civilization studies programs, its intensive research-based undergraduate curriculum, and its training of academic historians as both researchers and teachers. Majoring in history not only enables you to become a consumer of academic knowledge, it also prepares you to become a producer of knowledge. Undergraduate history courses first train you to explore large-scale social, cultural, and political processes by defining concrete, researchable questions. Subsequently, as a history major, you are taught how to locate the primary and secondary sources necessary to develop answers to these questions. Finally, faculty assist you in transforming your research into historical arguments that shed light on the multiple ways in which our world, our very reality, has transformed over time. History is excellent preparation for a wide field of endeavors—from law, government, and public policy to the arts and business. </P>

<P>Students interested in a history major should consult the associate director before the end of their second year; it is, however, possible to join the major as a third-year student. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>In addition to the civilization sequences, students can choose from more than eighty history courses that are offered each year to undergraduates. Some of these are introductory lectures (&quot;Gateway courses&quot;), others are small seminars devoted to the intense study of a particular historical moment, theme, or event. Students must take twelve courses for the history major, one of which must be a history colloquium (HIST 29600s). </P>

<P>History majors have the option of pursuing one of two tracks: the Regular Track or the Research Track. Students in the Research Track complete a BA thesis during two BA seminars HIST 29801-29802 BA Thesis Seminar I-II. Students in the Regular Track take two elective courses in lieu of the BA seminars. Students wishing to pursue the Research Track must officially declare their intention to do so with the associate director by sixth week of Winter Quarter during their third year. Only students in the Research Track are eligible for honors. </P>

<P>Courses without a &quot;HIST&quot; number may be used only with departmental permission; students should submit a petition to the associate director to have them considered (see Petitioning for Outside Credit below). Students may use one civilization sequence (up to three courses in the same sequence) to count toward history major requirements, but only if these courses are not also being used to count toward general education requirements. </P>

<P>Major Field </P>

<P>Students in both the Research Track and the Regular Track are required to take six courses in, or directly related to, their chosen main field. Students construct the main field and choose their other courses in close consultation with the associate director, subject to final approval by the faculty chair of the Undergraduate Studies Committee. </P>

<P>The major field is usually defined by time and space. Examples are nineteenth- or twentieth-century US history, colonial Africa, the Atlantic world in the early modern or modern period, ancient Greece, or medieval Europe. Thematic major fields are also possible; for example, African American, Jewish, or gender history. Major fields may also be methodologically defined: for example, intellectual, economic, gender, political, or urban history. Students pursuing a major field in urban history, for example, might take courses ranging from &quot;Jewish Spaces and Places: Imagined and Real&quot; to &quot;Cities from Scratch: The History of Urban Latin America&quot;; a focus on economic history might include &quot;Economic Change in China&quot; and &quot;The History of US Capitalism.&quot; In the case of thematically or methodologically defined major fields, it is particularly important to consult closely with the associate director to ensure coherence. </P>

<P>Electives </P>

<P>In addition to the six courses in the main field, students must also take a number of elective courses. Students pursuing the Regular Track take six electives, while students pursuing the Research Track take four electives and complete the major with two seminars for the BA thesis (See Research Track below). Electives should complement the main field, extend the range of your historical awareness, and explore varying approaches to historical analysis and interpretation. You are encouraged to take courses that introduce significant civilizational or chronological breadth into your studies, or a different methodology or theme than you are studying in your major field. </P>

<P>Research Colloquium (HIST 29600s) </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in history must take at least one history colloquium (HIST 29600s), though they are welcome to take more than one. Depending on the topic, the colloquium may count as one of the six courses comprising the student's major field or as one of the history electives, depending on the relevance of the colloquium to the student's major field. Students interested in pursuing the Research Track should take a colloquium prior to Spring Quarter of their third year, while those pursuing the Regular Track can take a </P>

<P>colloquium at any point prior to graduation. The colloquia are offered on a variety of topics each year and enable advanced College students to pursue research projects. </P>

<P>These courses expose students to the methods and practice of historical research and writing. Students are required to compose an original research paper that is at least fifteen pages in length. For students who are planning to begin graduate study the year following graduation, the colloquium provides them with the opportunity to produce a writing sample based on primary sources that they can use for their applications. </P>

<P>Research Track </P>

<P>Students admitted to the Research Track are required to complete twelve courses for the major: six in a major field, four electives, and two BA seminars. The research colloquium may count toward either the major field or the elective field requirement. Students planning to pursue graduate study in history or those wishing to go into a research-intensive career, such as journalism, law, or policy analysis, are encouraged to pursue the Research Track. </P>

<P>Application to Research Track </P>

<P>Students wishing to pursue the Research Track must submit a major form indicating their plans as well as a short description of their proposed BA thesis topic to the associate director by sixth week of Winter Quarter during their third year. With the approval of the faculty chair of the Undergraduate Studies Committee, the committee places students into a Spring Quarter BA thesis seminar before the end of Winter Quarter. In the seminar students develop a research proposal, which they submit at the end of Spring Quarter. The committee also assigns each student a BA thesis advisor from among the Department of History's faculty. </P>

<P>BA Thesis Seminars (HIST 29801 and 29802) </P>

<P>Students pursuing the Research Track are required to complete a BA thesis and the two BA thesis seminars. The BA thesis is a three-quarter-long research project in which students develop a significant and original interpretation of a historical issue of their choosing. Theses are the culmination of the history program and range from forty to sixty pages in length. The BA thesis seminars assist students in formulating approaches and developing their research and writing skills, while providing a forum for group discussion and critiques. </P>

<P>Students formally register for two quarters, during the Spring Quarter of their third year (HIST 29801 BA Thesis Seminar I) and Winter Quarter of their fourth year (HIST 29802 BA Thesis Seminar II), though they are also expected to be actively engaged during the intervening Autumn Quarter. Students who are out of residence in Spring Quarter of their third year, take BA Seminar I in Autumn Quarter of their fourth year (see Study Abroad below). BA Thesis Seminar I meets weekly in the Spring Quarter of the third year, but only every other week during the autumn and winter terms of the fourth year. Throughout the period of researching and writing the thesis, students benefit from the company of their peers and the guidance of their preceptor, who is an advanced history graduate student, serves as the seminar instructor, and is the second reader of the thesis. You must receive a B grade in BA Seminar I to continue in the research track and enroll in BA Seminar II. </P>

<P>BA Thesis </P>

<P>The deadline for submission of the BA thesis is the second Friday of Spring Quarter. Students who wish to complete their papers in a quarter other than Spring Quarter must petition the department through the associate director. Students graduating in a quarter other than Spring Quarter must turn in their theses by Friday of seventh week of their final quarter. When circumstances justify it, the department establishes individual deadlines and procedures. </P>

<P>With approval from the undergraduate faculty chairs in two departments, history students may be able to write a BA thesis that meets requirements for a dual major. Students must consult with both chairs before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year. A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Students are eligible to apply for research funding for summer research from the Department of History and the PRISM (Planning Resources and Involvement for Students in the Majors) program. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of funding that is available for language study abroad through the Foreign Language Acquisition Grant (FLAG) program. For details on available funding, students should consult the associate director. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Students pursuing the Research Track who have done exceptionally well in their course work and have written an outstanding BA thesis are recommended for honors. Candidates must have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher and a GPA of 3.7 or higher in the twelve courses counting towards the major. Readers submit BA theses for departmental honors that they judge to be of particular distinction. If the department concurs, the student is awarded honors. Students who fail to meet the deadline for submission of the BA thesis are not eligible for honors consideration. </P>

<P>Reading and Research Courses </P>

<P>Students interested in pursuing a program of study that cannot be met by means of regular courses have the option of devising a reading and research course (HIST 29700 Readings in History) that is taken individually and supervised by a member of the Department of History faculty. Such a course requires the approval of the associate director and the prior consent of the instructor with whom the student would like to study. Note: Enrollment in HIST 29700 is open only to students who are doing independent study that is not related to the research or writing of the BA thesis. As a general rule, only one reading and research course can be counted towards the history major. </P>

<P>Petitioning for Outside Credit </P>

<P>The Department of History offers a wide variety of courses each quarter, and majors are strongly encouraged to take history courses to fulfill the requirements of the major. In some instances, courses that originate outside the department can be used to fulfill the course requirements of the major. To receive history credit for nondepartmental courses, you must petition the Undergraduate Studies Committee for approval. A few things to keep in mind: </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Courses counting towards the history major are normally taken for quality grades. The History Research Colloquium (HIST 29600s), HIST 29801 BA Thesis Seminar I, and HIST 29802 BA Thesis Seminar II must be taken for quality grades. In exceptional circumstances, students who are majoring in history may petition to allow a course taken for a pass/fail grade to count towards the requirements of the major. Students wishing to do so should consult with the associate director. A pass grade is to be given only for work of C– quality or higher. Students should also consult with their College adviser about the appropriateness of pass/fail grading options in their larger program of study. </P>

<P>Minor in History </P>

<P>Students specializing in all disciplines are welcome to minor in history. Majors in such fields as international studies, political science, public policy, economics, and philosophy find that a history minor complements their major by providing a historical understanding of social, cultural, political, and economic issues, while those majoring in such disciplines as mathematics and the sciences use the minor to explore a different area of interest and to develop their humanistic understanding of the world. Students may choose to take courses in a variety of </P>

<P>fields, time periods, and thematic topics, with the aim of developing a broad understanding of historical change across time and space, or they may choose to focus specifically on a more narrowly defined field of interest. </P>

<P>Students wishing to pursue the minor should contact the associate director and complete the minor declaration form no later than the end of the third year. The associate director's approval for the minor program should be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser. </P>

<P>Requirements </P>

<P>The history minor requires a total of six courses chosen in consultation with the associate director. Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors; (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements; (3) may not be petitioned in from other departments; (4) must be taken for quality grades; and (5) must consist of more than half of the courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Course Numbering </P>

<P>History courses numbered 10000 to 29999 are intended primarily for College students; 10000-level courses are introductory. Some 20000-level courses have 30000-level equivalents when they are open to graduate students. To register for 20000/30000 cross-listed courses, undergraduates must use the undergraduate number (20000). History courses numbered 40000 to 49999 are intended primarily for graduate students, but are open to advanced College students with the consent of the instructor. Undergraduates registered for 40000-level courses are held to the graduate-level requirements. </P>

<P>Double Major </P>

<P>Students planning to double major in history and another discipline are encouraged to do so, with the following stipulations: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Double counting: Courses that are cross-listed with another department may be used for both majors. </LBody>

<LBody>BA thesis and seminar: Double majors pursuing the Research Track must fulfill the requirements pertaining to the BA thesis, including taking part in the BA seminar. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Study Abroad </P>

<P>The Department of History strongly supports study abroad. We have arranged the course work requirement to make that possible, but a little prior planning is required, especially for those pursuing the Research Track. If at all possible, it is best to study abroad during Autumn and/or Winter Quarters of the third year. However, if a full-year study abroad experience is desired, that is still compatible with the Research Track history major. One section of the BA seminar (combining requirements of BA Seminar I and II in an accelerated manner) meets in Autumn Quarter to accommodate fourth-year students who have been abroad third year; these students register for BA Seminar II with the rest of their third-year cohort. All Research Track history majors are required to be on campus for Autumn and Winter Quarters of their fourth year in order to complete the BA thesis. </P>

<P>History Courses </P>

<P>HIST 10101-10102-10103. Introduction to African Civilization I-II-III. </P>

<P>Introduction to African Civilization introduces students to African history in a three-quarter sequence. Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P>HIST 10101. Introduction to African Civilization I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Part one of the sequence takes a historical approach. We consider how different types of historical evidence-</P>

<P>documentary, oral, and material-can be used to investigate processes of change and transformation in </P>

<P>Africa from the early Iron Age through the emergence of the Atlantic world in the fifteenth century. We will </P>

<P>investigate state formation in comparative perspective and examine case studies from the Swahili coast, </P>

<P>the empires of Ghana and Mali, and Great Zimbabwe. The course also examines the diffusion of Islam, </P>

<P>European contact, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade. </P>

<P>HIST 10102. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

<P>HIST 12001. Medieval History: Theories &amp; Methods. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will introduce students to research methods and historical theories that are central to the field of medieval European history (500-1500 AD). The first section of the course is designed to give students a grounding in some of the most important historical narratives (political, social, economic, religious, intellectual, cultural) about the medieval period. Students will then spend the middle weeks of the quarter exploring the different types of original sources (written and non-written) that historians use to conduct research on the Middle Ages. This section of the course will include class time at the Regenstein Library's Special Collections Research Center. In the final weeks, we will concentrate on some of the scholarly debates that have shaped the modern field of medieval history. Grades will be determined on the basis of a midterm exam, a final exam, two short papers, and classroom discussion. Instructor(s): J.

<P>HIST 12700-12800. Music in Western Civilization I-II. </P>

<P>This two-quarter sequence explores musical works of broad cultural significance in Western civilization. We study pieces not only from the standpoint of musical style but also through the lenses of politics, intellectual history, economics, gender, cultural studies, and so on. Readings are taken both from our music textbook and from the writings of a number of figures such as St. Benedict of Nursia and Martin Luther.

<P>HIST 13001-13002-13003. History of European Civilization I-II-III. </P>

<P>History of European Civilization is a two-quarter sequence designed to use close readings of primary sources to enrich our understanding of Europeans of the past. As we examine the variety of their experiences, we will often call into question what we mean in the first place by “Europe” and “civilization.” Rather than providing a narrative of high politics, the sequence will emphasize the contested geographic, religious, social, and racial boundaries that have defined and redefined Europe and its people over the centuries. We will read and discuss sources covering the period from the early Middle Ages to the present, from a variety of genres: saga, biography, personal letters, property records, political treatises, memoirs, and government documents, to name only a few. Individual instructors may choose different sources and highlight different aspects of European civilization, but some of the most important readings will be the same in all sections. The two-quarter sequence may also be supplemented by a third quarter, in which students will have the opportunity to explore in greater depth a particular topic in the history of European civilization.

<P>History of European Civilization is a two-quarter sequence designed to use close readings of primary sources to enrich our understanding of Europeans of the past. As we examine the variety of their experiences, we will often call into question what we mean in the first place by &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;civilization." Rather than providing a narrative of high politics, the sequence will emphasize the contested geographic, religious, social, and racial boundaries that have defined and redefined Europe and its people over the centuries. We will read and discuss sources covering the period from the early Middle Ages to the present, from a variety of genres: saga, biography, personal letters, property records, political treatises, memoirs, and government documents, to name only a few. Individual instructors may choose different sources and highlight different aspects of European civilization, but some of the most important readings will be the same in all sections. The two-quarter sequence may also be supplemented by a third quarter, in which students will have the opportunity to explore in greater depth a particular topic in the history of European civilization. This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. Instructor(s): J. Niermeier-Dohoney, A. Palmer, Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Winter Prerequisite(s): Students must take a minimum of two quarters of Civ. to fulfill general education requirement; register for same section each quarter. </P>

<P>HIST 13803. The Soviet Union. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature. In the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation--from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab--will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; Stalinism, its origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.

<P>HIST 17400. Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course addresses one of the great transformations in Western history. During the period from the early sixteenth century to the late seventeenth, European understandings of the natural world - and ways of achieving such understandings - underwent a series of radical and far-reaching transformations. The process affected every aspect of life as it was then lived, and as it has been lived since. It is often called the Scientific Revolution. Many people think that it was the central process in the development of modern culture itself. Instructor(s): A. Johns Terms Offered: TBD Note(s): Not Offered in 2018-2019 academic year.

<P>HIST 17502. Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course is organized around a series of broad questions about science. These questions are addressed by means of examples drawn from both the past and the present. The historical cases arise in chronological sequence, ranging from the development of experimental methods in the late seventeenth century to the advent of biotechnology in the modern era. They furnish a selective set of materials for a history of scientific practice. Their other purpose here, however, is to highlight the depth and importance of many problems still confronting the world of science today - problems that are cultural as well as scientific, and that demand of us an understanding of what science is and how it works.

<P>HIST 17503. Sci/Cult/Soc in Western Civilization III - The History of Medicine Part II: 1900 -Present. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Full course title: Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization III: History of Medicine 2. This three-quarter sequence focuses on the origins and development of science in the West. The twentieth century is sometimes called the &quot;golden age&quot; of medicine: a period in which medicine broke free of tradition and combined with science to provide powerful new ways of understanding disease, and spectacular new technologies for fighting sickness. Along with amelioration of suffering, however, came new diseases, new medical systems, and new ways of thinking about the relationship between medical bodies, political bodies, and the nature and scope of human misery. This course examines some of the many transformations of (predominantly Euro-American) medicine in the twentieth century, looking not only at advances in medical knowledge and technologies, but also at the social, political, moral and affective ramifications of new ways of thinking about the promise - and perils of (bio)medical practice.

<P>HIST 17704. The Old History of Capitalism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the relationship between race and capitalism? This course introduces students to the concept of &quot;racial capitalism,&quot; which rejects treatments of race as external to a purely economic project and counters the idea that racism is an externality, acultural overflow, or an aberration from the so-called real workings of capitalism. Spanning the colonization of North America to the era of mass incarceration, topics include the slave trade, indigenous dispossession, antebellum slavery, the Mexican-American War, &quot;new imperialism,&quot; the welfare state, and civil rights.

<P>HIST 18101. Democracy in America? 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the unlikely career of democracy in US history. Throughout its past, the United States has been defined by endless and unpredictable struggles to establish and extend self-government of one kind or another--even as those struggles have encountered great resistance and relied on the exclusion or subordination of some portion of society to underwrite expanding freedom and equality for those enjoying the fullest benefits of citizenship. American democracy has also relied on a conceptual separation between state and society that has necessarily broken down in practice, as political institutions produced and sustained economic forms like slavery or the corporation, social arrangements like the family, and cultural values such as freedom--even as private interests worked their reciprocal influence over public institutions. Over the course of the quarter we will explore this contested history of democracy in America through a close reading of classic texts (including Tocqueville's famous study), contextualized by the most current historical scholarship. Small, incremental writing assignments and individual presentations will culminate in a final essay that can emphasize philosophical/theoretical or historical/empirical questions according to students' interests. Students will also have the option of conducting their own original research to satisfy some portion of the course work, which may lead to subsequent internship opportunities with relevant faculty.

<P>HIST 19402. Economic History II: The Early Modern World, circa 1300-1800. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course both describes preindustrial economic life and weighs the models used to explain fundamental changes to it. We will begin by describing some of the basic structures that determined patterns of production, exchange, and consumption in a period of low and easily reversible growth. These include agricultural productivity, demographic constraints, modes of transportation, and the social structures that governed the distribution of what little surplus premodern societies produced. Turning to the sources of economic dynamism that may have contributed to later industrialization, we will first examine the growth of long-distance trade networks starting in the late fourteenth century. How were traditional economies characterized by limited movement stimulated by the circulation of people, goods, and money from afar? We will then move to a discussion of the factors leading to (or frustrating) transformational patterns of economic growth: agricultural productivity, institutions, &quot;proto-industrial&quot; production in an era of limited urban growth, and changing norms of consumption. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Economic History, from Sumer to the Global World. Instructor(s): P. Cheney &amp; K.

<P>HIST 20111. History of Death. 100 Units. </P>

<P>From the treatment of mortal remains to the built environment of cemeteries, tombs, and memorials, the dead have always played a role in the lives of the living. This course examines how beliefs and practices surrounding death have been a source of meaning making for individuals, institutions, religious communities, and modern nations. It will ask students to consider how examining death makes it possible to better understand the values and concerns of societies across time and space. This course will consider case studies from Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, North America, Europe, and Asia, from the Middle Ages to the Vietnam War. It introduces students to the methods and debates that animate the historical study of death-coming from histories of the body, social history, and the study of slavery-and ends by asking the question: &quot;Is it possible to have a global history of death?"

<P>HIST 20210. History Lab: Migration and Mobility in Human History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This Making History course will explore different episodes of human mobility. We will study forced and voluntary migrations by considering the earliest movements of people out of Africa, the transatlantic slave trade, the displacements in Europe produced by World War II, and the current flows of people from Africa and the Middle East across the Mediterranean. These wide-ranging topics necessarily demand that students use a variety of primary sources and methodologies; assigned readings will thus be supplemented by documentaries, audio recordings, artistic renditions, and material culture. For their final project students will be required to work individually or in teams to investigate an example of human migration. Student may present the results of this research as a formal academic essay, may create a website or video, or use some other medium. Instructor(s): E.

<P>HIST 21903. Medieval Christian Mythology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Heaven and hell, angels and demons, the Virgin Mary and the devil battling over the state of human souls, the world on the edge of apocalypse awaiting the coming of the Judge and the resurrection of the dead, the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood, the great adventures of the saints. As Rudolf Bultmann put it in his summary of the &quot;world picture&quot; of the New Testament, &quot;all of this is mythological talk," arguably unnecessary for Christian theology. And yet, without its mythology, much of Christianity becomes incomprehensible as a religious or symbolic system. This course is intended as an introduction to the stories that medieval Christians told about God, his Mother, the angels, and the saints, along with the place of the sacraments and miracles in the world picture of the medieval church. Sources will range from Hugh of St. Victor's summa on the sacraments to Hildegard of Bingen's visionary &quot;Scivias,&quot; the Pseudo-Bonaventuran &quot;Meditations on the Life of Christ,&quot; and Jacobus de Voragine's &quot;Golden Legend,&quot; along with handbooks on summoning angels and cycles of mystery plays.

<P>HIST 22102. Medieval Travelers. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Why did Europeans respond as they did to the opportunities opened to them with Columbus's discovery of a &quot;new world&quot; in the late fifteenth century? What precedents and preconceptions did they have for their encounter with this &quot;new world&quot;? This course seeks to answer these questions by looking to the accounts of those who traveled both within and beyond Europe, in fact and in imagination, during the centuries preceding Columbus's voyage. Its argument will be that to understand what Columbus and his contemporaries found when they arrived in the &quot;new world,&quot; we must first understand what they thought they were looking for--and that what they were looking for is not necessarily what we might expect. The course gives students the opportunity to write a significant research paper, written in the character of a medieval traveler, whether a merchant, pilgrim, crusader, missionary, geographer, or conquistador.

<P>HIST 22203. The Holy Roman Empire, 800-1500. 100 Units. </P>

<P>During the first seven centuries of its existence the Holy Roman Empire emerged as one of the most politically and culturally heterogeneous states in all of Europe. A vast expanse of central Europe that is today divided among more than a dozen nations was ruled, at least in theory, by the emperors during the central and late Middle Ages. The purpose of this course is to trace some of the major developments in imperial history between 800 (Charlemagne's coronation as emperor) and the early sixteenth century. Topics will include the changing nature of imperial authority from the Carolingians to the Habsburgs, the Church's and the nobility's establishment of quasi-independent lordships inside imperial territory, papal-imperial relations, and the eastward expansion of the empire.

<P>HIST 22610. Paris and the French Revolution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The French Revolution is one of the defining moments of modern world history. This course will explore the mix of social, political, and cultural factors which caused its outbreak in 1789 and go on to consider the overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy in 1792, the drift towards state-driven Terror in 1793-94, and the ensuing failure to achieve political stability down to the advent of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. We will view these epochal changes through the prism of France's capital city. Paris shaped the revolution in many ways, but the revolution also reshaped Paris. The urbane city of European enlightenment acquired new identities as democratic hub from 1789 and as site of popular democracy after 1793-94. In addition, the revolution generated new ways of thinking about urban living and remodelling the city for the modern age. A wide range of primary sources will be used, including visual sources (notably paintings, political cartoons and caricatures, and maps). Instructor(s): C. Jones Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Students taking FREN 22619/32619 must read French texts in French. Equivalent Course(s): HIST 32610, FREN 22619, FREN 32619 </P>

<P>HIST 23008. Montesquieu's &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; 100 Units. </P>

<P>From its publication in 1748, &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; has been interpreted, among other things, as a foundational work of method in historical jurisprudence; a pæan to the English constitution and an inspiration for that of the future United States; a precocious call for penal reform and the abolition of slavery; a monument to the Enlightenment's capacity for cultural relativism that laid the groundwork for the discipline of sociology; a historical treatise on the rise of globalized commerce and its political effects in Europe; and a manifesto for a reactionary feudal aristocracy. We will read &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; with attention to these and other possible interpretations. This course is mainly an exercise in close reading, but we will also think about the contexts for the writing and reception of this landmark work of Enlightenment social and political thought.

<P>HIST 23610. Modern German History I, 1740-1866. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is German history before the foundation of the German state? This course introduces students to a broad perspective on this question, taking up the monumental shifts in borders, citizenship, social hierarchies, economic development, and political orientation from the War of Austrian Succession to the Austro-Prussian War. While the course will focus on the cultural, social, political, and intellectual histories of these transformations in the kleindeutsch states, we will be concerned throughout with the larger Habsburg empire and with Germans' place in the world as we consider the relationship of the German lands to eastern and western Europe and German participation in international commerce, imperial networks, and global migration.

<P>HIST 25425. Censorship, Info Control, &amp; Revolutions in Info Technology from the Printing Press to the Internet. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The digital revolution is triggering a wave of new information control efforts and censorship attempts, ranging from monopolistic copyright laws to the &quot;Great Firewall&quot; of China. The print revolution after 1450 was a moment like our own, when the explosive dissemination of a new information technology triggered a wave of information control efforts. Many of today's attempts at information control closely parallel early responses to the printing press, so the premodern case gives us centuries of data showing how diverse attempts to control or censors information variously incentivized, discouraged, curated, silenced, commodified, or nurtured art, thought, and science. This unique course is part of a collaborative research project funded by the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and is co-organized with digital information expert Cory Doctorow. The course will bring pairs of experts working on the print and digital revolutions to campus to discuss parallels between their research with the class. Classes will be open to the public, filmed, and shared on the Internet to create an international public conversation. This is also a Department of History &quot;Making History&quot; course: rather than writing traditional papers, students will create web resources and publications (print and digital) to contribute to the ongoing collaborative research project.

<P>HIST 26129. Paris Noir: African American Refuge in the City of Light. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the phenomenal history of Paris as a place of refuge for people of African descent, focusing especially on black Americans during the middle decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the years when the US Jim Crow regime was being consolidated and continuing through the era of the civil rights movement, when that regime was being contested, black Americans considered Paris a place of refuge. Novelists, musicians, and sports and political figures all found opportunity for creativity and freedom of expression in the &quot;city of light,&quot; notwithstanding the fact that France had itself been one of the principal slave powers in the Americas and remained a major colonial empire--all of which complicated its image of racial liberalism. How both French people and African American sojourners negotiated that apparent contradiction will be the principal issues addressed in course readings and discussions, which will focus on political activists like W .E. B. Du Bois and Black Panther member Elaine Brown; literary figures like Richard Wright and James Baldwin; and sports and entertainment personalities like Jack Johnson and Josephine Baker. Course readings will be a mix of primary and secondary sources, including James Baldwin, &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;; Richard Wright, &quot;I Choose Exile&quot;; Hazel Rowley, &quot;Richard Wright: The Life and Times&quot;; Tyler Stovall, &quot;Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light&quot;; Brent Hayes Edwards, &quot;The Practice of Diaspora&quot;; James Campbell, Instructor(s): T.

<P>HIST 26516. The United States and Latin America, a History from 1840s to Trump. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Over the second half of the twentieth century, it became a cliché that the United States was an empire and that the so-called Latin America was its backyard, the region where the empire paraded, with largesse, its mighty will. And yet, on one hand, over the last 150 years both the United States and &quot;Latin America&quot; have had variegated forms of interactions, which cannot be easily characterized as one single historical constant; on the other, in today's world the question seems unavoidable: is &quot;Latin America&quot; still a homogenous unique region with which the United States interacts collectively in the same ways whether in political, economic, or military terms? Making use of historical analysis in tandem with constant discussions of current events in the United States and &quot;Latin America,&quot; the course seeks to invite students to add a disciplined historical imagination to the historian/ political scientist/analyst toolbox. The course will consist of lectures, student presentations, and class discussions. Each student will be required to introduce readings in class at least once, depending on the number of students. In addition, there will be two take-home essays over the semester. The essay questions will be distributed a week in advance of the due dates. Instructor(s): M.

We will read fiction, autobiography, and history (including meditations on how to write history). Main themes of the course include the difference between historical scholarship and writing history in fictional form; the role of the author in each and consideration of the interstitial space of autobiography; the question of authorial authenticity; and the tension between contemporary demands for truthfulness and the rejection of &quot;truth."

<P>HIST 27508. Conspiracy Theory in American History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines conspiracy theories in American history--and some actual conspiracies--ranging from the seventeenth century to the 1990s. The alleged conspiracies that we will study include slave uprisings, monarchical plots against liberty, Catholic secret agents, Freemasons and other secret societies, the abolitionist movement and the Southern &quot;Slave Power,&quot; the JFK assassination, and the modern fascination with UFOs, among others. What ties these diverse topics together is a sense that hidden forces are pulling the strings behind the scenes, exercising power in secret to control the course of events, invariably with sinister agendas. We will examine these conspiracy theories not to prove or disprove them, but to understand how such beliefs come about, why they become popular, and how even paranoid fantasies can exert a decisive influence on culture and politics in America.

<P>HIST 28607. War, Diplomacy, and Empire in US History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>World politics have profoundly shaped the United States from its colonial origins to the war on terror. Yet only recently have US historians made a sustained effort to relate the foreign relations of the country to its domestic history. For a century and a half prior to independence, empire, trade, great-power politics, and violent conflict with Native Americans formed the large structures of power and meaning within which colonists pursued their everyday lives. In violently repudiating the claims of the British Empire, the revolutionaries commenced a political tradition that sought to avoid the perils of great-power statecraft for roughly the next century and a half. Yet even as it lent a distinctive cast to US politics and society, this pursuit of exceptionalism had to reckon with the requirements of state power and geopolitics from the Civil War onward. With its sudden embrace of great-power politics and the &quot;rise to globalism&quot; from WWII onward the United States became increasingly like the European societies it had repudiated at the founding, even as its exceptional military and economic power set it apart as a &quot;unipolar power&quot; by the turn of the millennium. To understand these developments in depth students will write two modest-length &quot;deep-dive&quot; analytical essays and three brief reports on targeted expeditions into primary materials, while reading broadly across the historiography of the new diplomatic and international history.

<P>HIST 29324. Slavery and Capitalism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course examines how the interrelated transnational forces of slavery and capitalism shaped our modern world from the 1400s to the present. We will examine the history of this relationship and the living legacy of that history in the narratives of everyday people. Are recent frameworks theorizing a global hegemonic system of &quot;slavery and racial capitalism&quot; really our ultimate horizon? Are there any redemptive possibilities in older renderings committed to a more distinctive and disaggregated parsing of slavery and capitalism? Critical to approaching these questions are how people of African descent have themselves remembered slavery, experienced capitalism, and marshalled those memories in the service of emancipatory political movements. As such this course will focus on primary documents that give voice to enslaved peoples as well as secondary literature written by black historians attempting to shape international thought on this question. The ultimate aim is a wider understanding of the rise of Western modernity and how peoples of the African diaspora navigated and, at times, contested its consequences. Instructor(s): G. Mount Prerequisite(s): Prior undergraduate course on the African diaspora. Equivalent Course(s): CRES 29324 </P>

<P>HIST 29325. A Transnational History of Reparative Justice. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In light of recent revelations tying the University of Chicago to slavery, this course will explore the long history of reparations as a global, national, and local set of questions. How does a given polity go about repairing the un-repairable and forgiving the unforgivable? Are the discursive norms of reparations irredeemably bound to our current conceptualizations of politics, governance, private-property rights, individualism, and the law or can reparations, and how we talk about them, serve as a means of reimagining these categories? How might the practice and performance of reparations actually be structured to foster both intra-group and inter-group unity while avoiding a potentially divisive backlash? Beginning with ancient forms of restorative justice and proceeding briskly into more recent attempts at truth and reconciliation, this course aims to take a transnational and comparative approach to exploring the history of reparations from an interdisciplinary perspective. The ultimate aim is a greater understanding of the possibilities of reparations as they relate to slavery, Jim Crow, and post-1968 discrimination against people of African descent in the United States, which constitutes the second half of this course.

Topics will include the Mona Lisa and Renaissance portraiture; early modern identity and identity documents; the discipline of physiognomy; Johann Kaspar Lavater and the makings of racial science; the impact of photography; Alphonse Bertillon and the &quot;mug shot&quot;; smiles in advertisements; biometrics to facial recognition technologies; and the art and science of the selfie. The course will draw on specialized readings from secondary literature alongside a wide range of literary and visual primary sources, including scientific texts, paintings, drawings, identity documents, photographs, advertisements, cosmetics, and prosthetic parts.

<P>HIST 29413. The Politics of Memory in Modern France. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Most of a nation's past is forgotten, and even momentous, heroic, or villainous events fade from memory within a generation or two. Governments, organized groups, and individuals often do not agree about what should be remembered and what forgotten, nor is there consensus concerning appropriate forms of and audiences for commemoration. Does everyone see commemorations the same? How effective is naming of a street sign or a métro stop? Do people see statues or just walk past? Is it legitimate to shock with graphic representations of violence? What memorial work do histories, novels, poems, films, and museums do? We will analyze French, starting with the heart of state commemoration-the Pantheon-where those deemed of the highest national service are interred. Next, we focus on revolution, such as the Place de la Bastille column, the Mur des Fédérés, or the Sorbonne amphitheater, occupied in 1968. Regarding WW2, while the government and civil society accepted responsibility for the deportation and murder of some 76,000 Jews quite late. There are now, however, numerous monuments to their lives and deaths across Paris. Concerning France's imperial past, we will focus on debates over remembering metropolitan France's long and fraught relationship with North Africa and North Africans. Our approach will be multidisciplinary: secondary readings will be drawn from anthropology, sociology, and history, and primary sources will include poetry, novels, memoirs, film, and site visits.

<P>What is a commodity? And can we read capitalism's global history through the commodity form? This course will investigate how historians and anthropologists have studied commodities and commodification to account for the environmental, social, and cultural developments of capitalism over the last four centuries. We will begin by considering canonical theoretical approaches, including Marx, Polanyi, and Appadurai. Readings will then be based around case studies of, among other things, land, cotton, and slavery; sugar, guano, and mushrooms. Readings will span from the early modern Atlantic World through to the nineteenth-century Pacific, the twentieth-century Middle East, and the United States and Japan in the present day.

<P>From the Regulators to Rambo, the vigilante has played a leading role in the history and culture of the United States. This junior colloquium traces a long history of the American vigilante as a character, as well as episodes of vigilante violence from early America to the present. We will focus on the questions central to this history: What is the relationship between the vigilante and the state? Where can we draw distinctions between vigilantism, terrorism, and rebellion? How has the vigilante contributed to nation-building? We will also explore the predominance of the vigilante in popular culture, focusing on figures such as Jesse James, Dirty Harry, Machete, the Punisher, superheroes, the movies of John Wayne, and the lyrics of Toby Keith. Students will write substantial final papers based on primary sources that explore one element of this discussion. Instructor(s): K.

Conceptualizing housing as more than a place where people live, we address the ways in which shelter is bound up with race, gender, labor, law, consumption, and immigration. Topics include company towns, homelessness, redlining, public housing, suburbanization, and gentrification. This course exposes students to the methodologies of writing history (social, architectural, intellectual, cultural, and political economy). We will also engage with historical documents such as maps, magazines, census records, congressional documents, rental listings, music, and films.

<P>According to Hank V. Savitch and Paul Kantor, &quot;cities are the crucibles through which radical experiments become convention. They are concentrated environments in which people adapt and their resilience is tested. They are the world's incubators of innovation-made possible by critical mass, diversity, and rich interaction." This undergraduate research colloquium will explore American cities and their influence on United States history, with an emphasis on the nineteenth century. We will discuss a range of secondary historical monographs and will examine primary sources, including print culture, material objects, images, architecture, and the built environment. Requirements include careful reading, active and thoughtful participation, and a fifteen-page work of original research that will be presented in class. Instructor(s): A. Lippert Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Priority registration is given to History majors; consent of instructor </P>

<P>HIST 29677. History Colloquium: Religion and History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The study of religion presents an enormous challenge to the historian. On the one hand, religious beliefs typically posit a reality beyond that accessible to the tools of analysis employed by most historians; on the other, such beliefs and their associated practices have given shape and purpose to human society and psyches throughout human history, making them one of the most important drivers of human thought and behavior. In this colloquium, we will wrestle with the question of how, as historians, it is possible to make sense of the role of religion in history. We will explore different methodologies for thinking about religion and test them with specific examples of belief and practice across various religious traditions. To ensure a variety of perspectives, students will be able to choose the tradition they want to focus on for their class presentations and final projects. Instructor(s): R. Fulton Brown Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Priority registration is given to History majors. </P>

<P>HIST 29678. History Colloquium: Medicine and Society. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How does medical knowledge change? How do medical practices transform over time? What factors influence the ways in which doctors and patients--and scientists, artists, politicians, legislators, activists, and educators, among others--understand matters of health and disease, of proper and improper interventions, of the rights of individuals and the needs of communities? This course treats these questions as a starting point for exploring the interactions of medicine and society from 1800 to the present. Through a combination of primary and secondary sources we will examine changing causes of morbidity and mortality, the development of new medical technologies and infrastructures, shifting patterns of disease and shifting ideas about bodies, and debates about health care policy, among other topics. Students will be expected to conduct original research and produce an original research paper of fifteen to twenty pages. Instructor(s): M.

<P id="LinkTarget_64345">Program of Study </P>

<P>The BA program in the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine (HIPS) is designed for College students interested in studying science in terms of its historical development, conceptual structure, and social role. Students in the program must do sufficient work in one or more sciences to acquire a sound foundation for studying the nature of science. After securing this basis, they are expected to gain an understanding of how science arose, as well as how the content of scientific thought has changed and is changing, because of both its own internal dynamic and its interaction with the larger society in which it is embedded. </P>

<P>The HIPS program is designed to make possible the study of a wide range of social, historical, and conceptual issues relating to science. Students completing the program follow a number of different careers. Some pursue graduate study in the history and philosophy of science or in some field of science. Others find the program valuable preparation for the study of medicine, law, public policy, or science journalism. More generally, the goal of the program is to provide students with a sound basis on which to interpret and evaluate science and science policy. Some students choose to construct a degree program combining the requirements for the HIPS major with those for a major in the physical or biological sciences. Others, having met the HIPS program requirements, use electives to broaden their liberal arts education. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in HIPS. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>HIPS Sponsor </P>

<P>The Morris Fishbein Center for the History of Science and Medicine sponsors the HIPS program. Further information can be obtained in the center's office (SS 207) and at fishbein.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Elements of the Curriculum. The curriculum of the program contains five principal elements: </P>

<P>1. The Foundation. All students must: </P>

<P>a. complete an approved sequence that fulfills the biological sciences general education requirement; </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>b.</Lbl>

<LBody> complete the general education requirement in the physical sciences with a physics sequence (PHYS 12100-12200 General Physics I-II or equivalent) or a chemistry sequence (CHEM 11100-11200 Comprehensive General Chemistry I-II, CHEM 10100 Introductory General Chemistry I and CHEM 10200 Introductory General Chemistry II, or equivalent), or have earned a score of 5 on the AP Chemistry or Physics test or a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Physics C Mechanics and E&amp;M test; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c.</Lbl>

<LBody> complete a calculus sequence (MATH 13100-13200 Elementary Functions and Calculus I-II or higher), or have earned a score of 5 on the AP Calculus BC test; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d.</Lbl>

<LBody> complete three courses on the origins and development of science in the West: one course in each of the following three chronological periods: ancient (numbered HIPS 17300–17310), early modern (HIPS 17400–17410), and modern (HIPS 17500–17510). </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>2.</Lbl>

<LBody> Advanced Science. In addition to the science courses typically taken as part of the general education requirements, students are expected to take three courses in science, social sciences, or mathematics beyond the introductory level. They select these advanced courses according to their special aims, their area of concentration, and the subject of their bachelor's thesis. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.</Lbl>

<LBody> Areas of Concentration. All students in the program determine an area of concentration in the anthropology, ethics, history, philosophy, or sociology of science and medicine. In consultation with the program director and their program adviser, students select five courses to constitute this concentration area. For example, some students may be particularly interested in the intellectual and social interactions between changing scientific knowledge and institutions, on the one hand, and evolving social institutions, on the other; a second group may be concerned with either epistemological issues related to the growth of science or moral and political problems attending the employment of technology; and a third group may wish to emphasize the study of science as a social or cultural activity. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4.</Lbl>

<LBody> Tutorials. Students are required to take two tutorial courses; this is typically done early in their program. With a specific focus that changes each year, these tutorials are small classes (from three to ten students) that emphasize discussion and writing. An updated list of courses is available in the HIPS office (SS 207) or at registrar.uchicago.edu/classes. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5.</Lbl>

<LBody> Bachelor's Thesis and Junior Seminar. Third-year students enroll in a designated one-quarter seminar (HIPS 29800 Junior Seminar: My Favorite Readings in the History and Philosophy of Science) that deals with </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>general aspects of history, philosophy, and social studies of science and medicine. In Spring Quarter of their third year, students must discuss their proposal for their bachelor's thesis with the program director. In consultation with the program director, students then sign up for a reading and research course (HIPS 29700 Readings and Research in History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine) with an appropriate faculty member. In their fourth year, this research course should lead to a bachelor's thesis (HIPS 29900 Bachelor's Thesis) that integrates each student's academic studies, bringing them to bear on a significant question related to some historical, conceptual, ethical, or social aspect of science. Fourth-year students also enroll in a two-quarter HIPS 29810 Bachelor's Thesis Workshop, which is comprised of meetings that focus on organizing, researching, </P>

<P>HIPS 14903. History of Information. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Information&quot; in all its forms is perhaps the defining phenomenon of our age. But although we tend to think of it as something distinctively modern, in fact it came into being through a long history of thought, practice, and technology. This course will therefore suggest how to think historically about information. Using examples that range from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century, we shall explore how different societies have conceptualized the subject and how they have sought to control it. We shall address how information has been collected, classified, circulated, contested, and destroyed. The aim is to provide a different kind of understanding of information practices--one that can be put to use in other historical inquiries, as well as casting an unfamiliar light on our own everyday lives. Instructor(s): A. Johns Note(s): History Gateways are introductory courses meant to appeal to 1st- through 3rd-yr students who may not have done previous course work on the topic of the course; topics cover the globe and span the ages.

<P>HIPS 17300–17310, HIPS 17400–17410, HIPS 17500–17510 </P>

<P>These courses focus on the origins and development of science in the West. They aim to trace the evolution of the biological, psychological, natural, and mathematical sciences as they emerge from the culture and social matrix of their periods and, in turn, affect culture and social. In order to satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies, students must take a course in two or three of the following chronological periods: ancient (numbered HIPS 17300-17310), early modern (HIPS 17400-17410), and modern (HIPS 17500-17510). Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required. Only one course per category may count toward the requirement unless special approval is granted. </P>

<P>HIPS 17300. Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This undergraduate core course represents the first quarter of the Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization sequence. Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required. This quarter will focus on aspects of ancient Greek and Roman intellectual history, their perceived continuities or discontinuities with modern definitions and practices of science, and how they were shaped by the cultures, politics, and aesthetics of their day. Topics surveyed include history-writing and ancient science, the cosmos, medicine and biology, meteorology, ethnography and physiognomics, arithmetic and geometry, mechanics, taxonomy, optics, astronomy, and mechanical computing.

<P>HIPS 17400. Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course addresses one of the great transformations in Western history. During the period from the early sixteenth century to the late seventeenth, European understandings of the natural world - and ways of achieving such understandings - underwent a series of radical and far-reaching transformations. The process affected every aspect of life as it was then lived, and as it has been lived since. It is often called the Scientific Revolution. Many people think that it was the central process in the development of modern culture itself. Instructor(s): A. Johns Terms Offered: TBD Note(s): Not Offered in 2018-2019 academic year.

<P>Section 1, offered by Robert J. Richards - &quot;Renaissance &amp; Enlightenment.&quot; This lecture-discussion course examines the development science and scientific philosophy from the mid-fifteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. The considerations begin with the recovery of an ancient knowledge in the works of Leonardo, Vesalius, Harvey, and Copernicus. Thereafter the course will focus on Enlightenment science, as represented by Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Hume. The course will culminate with the work of Darwin, who utilized traditional concepts to inaugurate modern science. For each class, the instructor will provide a short introductory lecture on the texts, and then open discussion to pursue with students the unexpected accomplishments of the authors under scrutiny. Section 2, offered by Margaret Carlyle - &quot;Revolutions in Astronomy &amp; Anatomy.&quot; This course explores scientific developments in Western Europe from the sixteenth-century Scientific Revolution to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. During this period, European understandings of the natural world-and ways of achieving such understandings-underwent a series of radical and far-reaching transformations that are often called the Scientific Revolution.

<P>Full course title: Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization III: Medicine since the Renaissance. This course is an examination of various themes in the history of medicine in Western Europe and America since the Renaissance. Topics include key developments of medical theory (e.g., the circulation of the blood and germ theory), relations between doctors and patients, rivalries between different kinds of healers and therapists, and the development of the hospital and laboratory medicine.

<P>HIPS 17502. Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization III. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course is organized around a series of broad questions about science. These questions are addressed by means of examples drawn from both the past and the present. The historical cases arise in chronological sequence, ranging from the development of experimental methods in the late seventeenth century to the advent of biotechnology in the modern era. They furnish a selective set of materials for a history of scientific practice. Their other purpose here, however, is to highlight the depth and importance of many problems still confronting the world of science today - problems that are cultural as well as scientific, and that demand of us an understanding of what science is and how it works.

<P>HIPS 17503. Sci/Cult/Soc in Western Civilization III - The History of Medicine Part II: 1900 -Present. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Full course title: Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization III: History of Medicine 2. This three-quarter sequence focuses on the origins and development of science in the West. The twentieth century is sometimes called the &quot;golden age&quot; of medicine: a period in which medicine broke free of tradition and combined with science to provide powerful new ways of understanding disease, and spectacular new technologies for fighting sickness. Along with amelioration of suffering, however, came new diseases, new medical systems, and new ways of thinking about the relationship between medical bodies, political bodies, and the nature and scope of human misery. This course examines some of the many transformations of (predominantly Euro-American) medicine in the twentieth century, looking not only at advances in medical knowledge and technologies, but also at the social, political, moral and affective ramifications of new ways of thinking about the promise - and perils of (bio)medical practice.

<P>HIPS 20003. Discovering Anthropology: Reading Race. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Before and since Anthropology became a discrete scientific field of study, questions about the biological reality, potential utility and misuse of the concept of race in Homo sapiens have been debated. We will read and discuss a sample of writings by 18th, 19th, and 20th century and contemporary authors who attempted to define human races and those who have promoted or debunked the utility of the concept of race with special attention to it role in retarding social progress, and the extermination and exploitation of some populations and individuals.

<P>HIPS 20401. Philosophy of Mind. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is a survey of some of the central questions in the philosophy of mind. These questions include: What is consciousness? How can mental states represent things in the world? How do our minds relate to our bodies? Do we have free will? Can we blame someone for the beliefs or desires she has? What are the emotions? To help us with these questions, we will focus on 20th-century analytic work (by Putnam, Nagel, Searle, Jackson, Dennett, Chalmers, Block, Dretske, and others), but we will also read important historical texts on the nature of the mind by Aristotle, Descartes, and Hume.

<P>An introduction to the concepts and principles of symbolic logic. We learn the syntax and semantics of truth-functional and first-order quantificational logic, and apply the resultant conceptual framework to the analysis of valid and invalid arguments, the structure of formal languages, and logical relations among sentences of ordinary discourse. Occasionally we will venture into topics in philosophy of language and philosophical logic, but our primary focus is on acquiring a facility with symbolic logic as such. Instructor(s): K.

<P>HIPS 20905. Advanced Logic. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Since Russell's discovery of the inconsistency of Frege's foundation for mathematics, much of logic has resolved around the question of to what extent we can or cannot prove the consistency of the basic principles with which we reason. This course will explore two main efforts in this direction. We will first look at proof-theoretic efforts towards demonstrating the consistency of various foundational systems, discussing the virtues and limitations of this approach. We will then closely examine Godel's theorems, which are famous for demonstrating limits on the extent to which we can formulate consistency proofs. Much has been written on the implications of Godel's theorems, and we will spend some time trying to carefully separate what they really entail from what they do not entail. Assessment will be by regular homework sets. Intermediate logic or prior equivalent required. (II) and (B). Instructor(s): K.

<P>HIPS 21407. The Vocation of a Scientist. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Max Weber wrote that to be a scientist one needed a &quot;strange intoxication&quot; with scientific work and a &quot;passionate devotion&quot; to research as a calling. And yet, such passion seemed to conflict with the ideal of value-neutral inquiry. This class considers the vocation of science since the turn of the twentieth century. What political, economic, and cultural forces have shaped scientific professions in the United States? How are scientists represented in public culture? How was American science experienced during the colonization of the Philippines? By exploring these questions, this class will examine the values and norms that make science into a meaningful vocation. Equivalent Course(s): ANTH 22129, KNOW 21407 </P>

<P>HIPS 21408. History of Medicine. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course surveys the history of medicine from the medieval period to the present. How did medicine emerge as a defined body of knowledge? To what extent do diseases and disorders have an independent existence, and to what extent are they cultural constructs? How have social mores-particularly those related to religion, class, nationality, race, and gender-influenced the ways in which health was and is understood and maintained, and illness treated? What does it mean to practice medicine ethically, and how has that changed over time? Topics include the emergence and evolution of the medical profession, the history of medical research and method, the interpretation and treatment of the unhealthy and healthy alike, eugenics, euthanasia, the quest for immortality, and the changing relationship between technology and disease.

<P>HIPS 21409. History of Extraterrestrial Life. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In 2014, the Vatican Radio made a splash when it reported that the pontiff, Pope Francis, condoned the baptism of extraterrestrials-if they so desired it. &quot;Who are we to close doors?&quot; he asked rhetorically. It was both a metaphor for spiritual inclusion and an accurate representation of the modern Vatican's position on the possibilities of modern astrobiology and the search for extrasolar planets, fields whose rapid growth over the past two decades make serious consideration of extraterrestrial life seem like a uniquely modern phenomena. Its history, however, is in fact many centuries old. In this course we will examine the development of beliefs concerning life in the universe from the sixteenth century to the present. How did historical actors understand the nature, abilities, and location of extraterrestrial life, and its relationship to man and god? We will analyze connections between these beliefs and contemporary political, social, scientific, and religious developments. These include the role of the plurality of worlds in the debates over heliocentrism, its impact and application in the context of deism and social and political freethought, its literary and artistic depictions and use as a tool of satire and social commentary, its influence on natural philosophy, its decline and the subsequent rise of alien conspiracists and their critics, and how and why conceptions of the extraplanetary other took a dark and sinister turn toward the early-to-mid twentieth century.

<P>HIPS 21410. Politics of Technoscience in Africa. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Euro-American discourse has often portrayed Africa as either a place without science and technology or as the home of deep and ancient wisdom. European imperialists used the alleged absence of science and technology as a justification for colonialism while pharmaceutical companies sought out African knowledge about healing plants. In addition to their practical applications, science and technology carry significant symbolic weight in discussions about Africa. In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation? How have independent African governments dealt with the imperial legacies of science? From the interpretation of archaeological ruins to the design of new medical technologies, this class will examine science and technology as political practice in Africa.

<P>HIPS 21411. Sex, Race, and Empire. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course surveys how science, race, and gender interacted in the early modern Atlantic world from 1500-1800. We will critically examine how new modes of scientific inquiry brought Africans, Americans, and Europeans into contact and conflict. Along the way, we will ask how, why, and with consequences imperial science created new knowledge claims about human inequality, especially racial and sexual difference. We will draw primarily on British, Iberian, and French imperial agendas in order to track the experiences of men and women from all corners of the Atlantic world, including indigenous peoples, enslaved black Africans, free people of color, and white Europeans. Through a variety of primary and secondary sources, we will uncover European aspirations to curate, control, and exploit the natural world and the agency of subjugated peoples in responding to and resisting these designs. Topics covered include natural history collecting and classification; the invention of racial theory; slavery and maroons; women, gender, and reproduction; consumption; and violence, resistance, and revolution.

<P>What do a lifelike wax woman, a birthing dummy, and a hermaphrodite have in common? This interdisciplinary course seeks answers to this question by exploring how eighteenth-century scientific and medical ideas, technologies, and practices interacted with and influenced contemporary notions of sex, sexuality, and gender. In our course, the terms &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;Enlightenment,&quot; and &quot;science&quot; will be problematized in their historic contexts using a variety of primary and secondary sources. Through these texts, as well as images and objects, we will see how emerging scientific theories about sex, sexuality, and gender contributed to new understandings of the human, especially female, body. We will also see how the liberating potential of Enlightenment thought gave way to sexual and racial theories that insisted on fundamental human difference. Topics to be covered include theories of generation, childbirth, homosexuality, monstrosities, race and procreation, and hermaphrodites and questions about the &quot;sex&quot; of the enlightened scientist and the gendering of scientific practices.

<P>HIPS 22001. Introduction to Science Studies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of science, medicine, and technology. During the twentieth century, sociologists, historians, philosophers, and anthropologists raised original, interesting, and consequential questions about the sciences. Often their work drew on and responded to each other, and, taken together, their various approaches came to constitute a field, &quot;science studies.&quot; The course furnishes an initial guide to this field. Students will not only encounter some of its principal concepts, approaches and findings, but will also get a chance to apply science-studies perspectives themselves by performing a fieldwork project. Among the topics we may examine are: the sociology of scientific knowledge and its applications; actor-network theories of science; constructivism and the history of science; and efforts to apply science studies approaches beyond the sciences themselves.

How much did colonial resources and markets contribute to economic growth and technological innovation in the metropole? The second part of the course will consider the global effects of British industrialization. To what extent can we trace anthropogenic climate change and other planetary crises back to the environmental transformation wrought by the British Empire? Topics include ecological imperialism, metabolic rift, the sugar revolution, the slave trade, naval construction and forestry, the East India Company, free trade and agriculture, energy use and climate change.

<P>This course provides students with an introduction to the phenomenological approach in cultural psychiatry, focusing on the problem of &quot;how to represent mental illness&quot; as a thematic anchor. Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of &quot;psychopathology&quot; or &quot;madness.&quot; By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/ depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of &quot;how to represent mental illness," students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.

<P>This seminar will bridge anthropologies and histories of science, technology, and medicine to Latin American decolonial thought. Throughout Latin America, techno-scientific objects and practices, with their presumed origin in the Euro-Atlantic North, are often complexly entangled with neo-imperial projects of development and modernization that elongate social forms of colonization into the present. Technoscience and its objects, however, can also generate new creative, political, and life-enhancing potentials beyond or despite their colonial resonances, or even provide tools to ongoing struggles for decolonization. Together, seminar participants will explore what a decolonial approach to the study of science, technology, and medicine in the Global South, particularly in Latin America, has been and could become and how decolonial theory can inflect our own disciplinary, conceptual, and political commitments as anthropologists of technoscience.

<P>HIPS 25114. Natural History and Empire, circa 1500-1800. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will examine natural history-broadly defined as a systematic, observational body of knowledge devoted to describing and understanding the physical world of plants, animals, natural environments, and (sometimes) people-in the context of European imperial expansion during the early modern era. Natural history was upended by the first European encounters with the New World. The encounter with these new lands exposed Europeans for the first time to unknown flora and fauna, which required acute empirical observation, collection, cataloguing, and circulation between periphery and metropole in order to understand their properties and determine their usefulness. As the Spanish, Portuguese, British, French, and Dutch competed with one another to establish overseas trade and military networks in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, they also competed over and shared information on natural resources. The course will combine lecture and discussion and mix primary source readings on natural history in the early modern world with modern historical writings. Though the readings skew a bit toward Britain and the British Atlantic world, every effort has been made to include texts and topics from multiple European and colonial locales. Topics and themes will include early modern sources of natural history from antiquity and their (re)interpretation in imperial context; early modern collecting cultures and cabinets of curiosities; Linnaeus and the origins of Equivalent Course(s): HIST 25114, ENST 25114 </P>

Students will work with rare books and archival materials, design exhibit cases, write exhibit labels, and contribute to the exhibit catalog. Half the course will focus on censorship in early modern Europe, including the Inquisition, the spread of the printing press, and clandestine literature in the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Special focus on the effects of censorship on classical literature, both newly rediscovered works like Lucretius and lost books of Plato, and authors like Pliny the Elder and Seneca who had been available in the Middle Ages but became newly controversial in the Renaissance. The other half of the course will look at modern and contemporary censorship issues, from wartime censorship, to the censorship of comic books, to digital-rights management, to free speech on our own campus. Students may choose whether to focus their own research and exhibit cases on classical, early modern, modern, or contemporary censorship.

<P>HIPS 25425. Censorship, Info Control, &amp; Revolutions in Info Technology from the Printing Press to the Internet. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The digital revolution is triggering a wave of new information control efforts and censorship attempts, ranging from monopolistic copyright laws to the &quot;Great Firewall&quot; of China. The print revolution after 1450 was a moment like our own, when the explosive dissemination of a new information technology triggered a wave of information control efforts. Many of today's attempts at information control closely parallel early responses to the printing press, so the premodern case gives us centuries of data showing how diverse attempts to control or censors information variously incentivized, discouraged, curated, silenced, commodified, or nurtured art, thought, and science. This unique course is part of a collaborative research project funded by the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and is co-organized with digital information expert Cory Doctorow. The course will bring pairs of experts working on the print and digital revolutions to campus to discuss parallels between their research with the class. Classes will be open to the public, filmed, and shared on the Internet to create an international public conversation.

<P>In this course we will examine the ways in which different groups of people--in different times and places--have understood the nature of life and living things, bodies and bodily processes, and health and disease, among other notions. We will address these issues principally, though not exclusively, through the lens of the changing sets of methods and practices commonly recognizable as science and medicine. We will also pay close attention to the methods through which scholars in history and anthropology have written about these topics, and how current scientific and medical practices affect historical and anthropological studies of science and medicine.

<P>HIPS 26121. Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Full title: &quot;Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800.&quot; Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of &quot;science&quot; to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800. Equivalent Course(s): HIST 26121, LACS 26121 </P>

<P>HIPS 27004. Babylon and the Origins of Knowledge. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In 1946 the famed economist John Maynard Keynes declared that Isaac Newton &quot;was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians.&quot; We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, Ibn Khaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful and reverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in the historical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? How did the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge? And is it reasonable to draw, as Keynes did, a line that begins with Babylon and ends with Newton? In this course we will take a cross comparative approach, investigating the history of the ancient city and its continuity in the scientific imagination. Instructor(s): E.

Our sources span several millennia of intellectual history, from cuneiform tablets containing glassmaking recipes and the &quot;secrets of the gods,&quot; to Medieval alchemical recipes, and to the first museums of natural history. We will investigate how and why science shifted from a subject intended for the elite few, to a more democratic ideal that embraced public demonstration. The role of patronage in the development of scientific knowledge, and the complex interaction between science and religion will be central to our discussions. Writing assignments will respond to thematic questions based on the readings. Equivalent Course(s): RLST 27550, KNOW 27005, HIST 24918 </P>

<P>This course introduces students to the central concepts and methods of medical anthropology. Drawing on a number of classic and contemporary texts, we will consider both the specificity of local medical cultures and the processes which increasingly link these systems of knowledge and practice. We will study the social and political economic shaping of illness and suffering and will examine medical and healing systems-including biomedicine-as social institutions and as sources of epistemological authority. Topics covered will include the problem of belief; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; the placebo effect and contextual healing; theories of embodiment; medicalization; structural violence; modernity and the distribution of risk; the meanings and effects of new medical technologies; and global health.

<P>HIPS 27302. Culture, Mental Health, and Psychiatry. 100 Units. </P>

<P>While mental illness has recently been framed in largely neurobiological terms as &quot;brain disease,&quot; there has also been an increasing awareness of the contingency of psychiatric diagnoses. In this course, we will draw upon readings from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies to examine this paradox and to examine mental health and illness as a set of subjective experiences, social processes, and objects of knowledge and intervention. On a conceptual level, the course invites students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Questions explored include: Does mental illness vary across social and cultural settings? How are experiences of people suffering from mental illness shaped by psychiatry's knowledge of their afflictions? Instructor(s): E.

<P>HIPS 29629. Tutorial: Romantic Bodies: Theater in the History of Science and Medicine. 100 Units. </P>

<P>It seems that science and theater have longed shared an ambiguous treatment as amoral yet bordering the ethically suspect. Scientific, medical, and technological advancements alter our everyday lives in profound ways and theater can play with the development and repercussions of these advancements, altering our memories of history. This stimulates a line of questioning for historians who view &quot;science plays,&quot; or plays that use science as the basis of their content and often also their form. In this tutorial, we will explore how these plays can (or cannot) fit into intellectual history as well as social and cultural histories of science. We will investigate how these plays can act as vehicles for remembering (or reconstructing) histories of science, reminding ourselves that the moral quandaries and ethical dilemmas that we juggle in science and medicine are as recurring as the theatrical productions are.

<P>HIPS 29630. Tutorial: History and Philosophy of Social Science. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sociology and anthropology are highly self-reflexive disciplines. Their own contested histories have been taught and critiqued as a matter of course in the majority of sociology and anthropology departments in the US and Europe since their inception--hardly a surprise, given how dense, kaleidoscopic, and political they are. Meanwhile, the philosophy of social science has been gaining popularity in philosophy departments, apparently independently of the centuries-old reflection on social scientific methodologies that can be found within sociological and anthropological texts2. In true interdisciplinary fashion, this course seeks to marry these areas of scholarship, bringing together readings in philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and classical social theory, under the common themes that unite (and divide) them. We will cover debates on the epistemological priority of the individual or of society, the priority of naturalist or humanist perspectives, and the generalisability or spatio-temporal specificity of social scientific explanations.

<P>HIPS 29631. Tutorial: History of Cryptography. 100 Units. </P>

<P>People have used codes and ciphers to keep their communications secret for thousands of years. Codebreakers, meanwhile, have been battling in parallel to break into those secrets nearly as long. From Roman generals to Arabic mathematicians to the Zimmerman telegram, cryptography has long been important to military and diplomatic history, while technological developments in the last forty years have brought cryptography to the masses, securing bank transactions, text messages, and countless other data on the Internet. This course will survey the long history of cryptology from the ancient world to today, with a focus on its uses in society. We will discuss, among other things, changing ideas of secrecy, privacy, and freedom of speech; the relationship between the state and science; and how technological developments influence and are influenced by cultural context. No technical or mathematical background is necessary for this course, although those with such background are welcome. (Syllabus and CV attached.) Instructor(s): Jillian Foley Terms Offered: Winter.

<P>HIPS 29632. Tutorial: The Poet's Scientist: A pre-disciplinary course in science &amp; literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a way of gathering three interests. I'm interested in understanding a way of writing about scientists that is not readily available to historians of science, a more expressive, more intuited way of writing that we can find in some poets and novelists: Osip Mandelstam writing of the way &quot;Lamarck wept his eyes out over his magnifying glass&quot;; Arthur Koestler of how Kepler laid &quot;a monstrous egg&quot; with his elliptical orbit. I am interested in the particular license taken in these instances-that flash of soul; I think the same license is taken to great effect in, for instance, the historical fiction of Hilary Mantel, and I want to see what we can win by it if we permit ourselves to tolerate it in real histories, and particularly in histories of science. That's a larger inquiry than this course undertakes, but I try to begin here by studying some writers who have won by it. Instructor(s): Lily Huang Terms Offered: Spring.

What factors influence the ways in which doctors and patients--and scientists, artists, politicians, legislators, activists, and educators, among others--understand matters of health and disease, of proper and improper interventions, of the rights of individuals and the needs of communities? This course treats these questions as a starting point for exploring the interactions of medicine and society from 1800 to the present. Through a combination of primary and secondary sources we will examine changing causes of morbidity and mortality, the development of new medical technologies and infrastructures, shifting patterns of disease and shifting ideas about bodies, and debates about health care policy, among other topics.

<P>HMRT 21002. Human Rights: Philosophical Foundations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Human rights are claims of justice that hold merely in virtue of our shared humanity. In this course we will explore philosophical theories of this elementary and crucial form of justice. Among topics to be considered are the role that dignity and humanity play in grounding such rights, their relation to political and economic institutions, and the distinction between duties of justice and claims of charity or humanitarian aid. Finally we will consider the application of such theories to concrete, problematic and pressing problems, such as global poverty, torture and genocide. (A) (I) Instructor(s): B.

<P>HMRT 21400. Health and Human Rights. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course attempts to define health and health care in the context of human rights theory and practice. Does a &quot;right to health&quot; include a &quot;right to health care&quot;? We delineate health care financing in the United States and compare these systems with those of other nations. We explore specific issues of health and medical practice as they interface in areas of global conflict: torture, landmines, and poverty. Readings and discussions explore social determinants of health: housing, educational institutions, employment, and the fraying of social safety nets. We study vulnerable populations: foster children, refugees, and the mentally ill. Lastly, does a right to health include a right to pharmaceuticals? What does the big business of drug research and marketing mean for our own country and the world? Instructor(s): R. Sherer, E.

<P>HMRT 24701. Human Rights: Alien and Citizen. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course addresses how international human rights doctrines, conventions, and mechanisms can be used to understand the situation of the &quot;alien&quot; (or foreigner) who has left his or her country of origin to work, seek safe haven, or simply reside in another country. If human rights are universal, human rights are not lost merely by crossing a border. We use an interdisciplinary approach to study concepts of citizenship and statelessness, as well as the human rights of refugees and migratory workers. Instructor(s): S.

<P>HMRT 25210. Anthropology of Disability. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar undertakes to explore &quot;disability&quot; from an anthropological perspective that recognizes it as a socially constructed concept with implications for our understanding of fundamental issues about culture, society, and individual differences. We explore a wide range of theoretical, legal, ethical, and policy issues as they relate to the experiences of persons with disabilities, their families, and advocates. The final project is a presentation on the fieldwork. Instructor(s): M.

<P>HMRT 27061. United States Legal History. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course focuses on the connections between law and society in modern America. It explores how legal doctrines and constitutional rules have defined individual rights and social relations in both the public and private spheres. It also examines political struggles that have transformed American law. Topics to be addressed include the meaning of rights; the regulation of property, work, race, and sexual relations; civil disobedience; and legal theory as cultural history. Readings include legal cases, judicial rulings, short stories, and legal and historical scholarship. Instructor(s): A.

<P>HMRT 27306. U.S. Women and Gender. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course studies the history of women, gender relations, and ideas of sex difference from the emergence of the women's rights movement in the 1840s to the rise of women's liberation in the 1960s. Issues of work, rights, citizenship, race, and sexuality take center stage as we explore the social, political, and cultural forces that shaped women's lives and the aspirations and agency of women who sought to transform the rules and relations of gender in the United States. Readings include primary sources as well as classic and recent historical scholarship. Instructor(s): A.

<P>HMRT 28310. Vulnerability and Human Rights. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course discusses current theories of vulnerability and passivity in relation to human rights. It pays particular attention how human rights and social justice can be thought of in relation to people with severe disabilities, animals, and others who are not traditionally thought of as subjects of justice. We will discuss philosophical texts by Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, John Rawls, Martha Nussbaum, and others, and sociological texts by scholars like Bryan Turner and Tom Shakespeare.

<P>HMRT 29120. Poverty Law and Policy Reform. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar seeks to give students a comprehensive understanding of the major anti-poverty programs in the United States with an emphasis on current challenges and reform proposals. We will spend the first half of the course exploring the implementation and evaluation of the programs that make up the traditional safety net for poor Americans: income supports, health insurance, and housing assistance. We will spend the rest of the quarter exploring topics that complicate the traditional social policy regime, including how the safety net is more robust for some groups, such as the elderly and veterans, than others. We will explore how the legal systems of immigration and incarceration hamper anti-poverty policy and how safety net programs address the needs of rural and Native Americans. Finally, we will investigate two recent developments in the field: social entrepreneurship and the critique of procedural rights.

<P id="LinkTarget_64347">Department Website: http://ishum.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Bachelor of Arts degree program in Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities (ISHU) offers qualified undergraduates the opportunity to shape an interdisciplinary plan of course work centered in, but not necessarily restricted to, study in the humanities. The program is meant to accommodate a course of study that could not otherwise be carried out easily within the structures of a single disciplinary major. </P>

<P>One of the notable features of the program is the requirement that all ISHU majors complete a formal BA paper at the end of their term of study that integrates the disparate fields of each student's study in a truly interdisciplinary manner. A BA paper will normally consist of an analytical research paper. An alternative option is a creative BA project, which would be accompanied by an analytical write-up of the project's background, conceptual problem(s), and methodology. </P>

<P>To be considered for admission to this BA program, a student must submit an application. This application consists of the student's selection and rationalization of a plan of courses that form a discrete field of interdisciplinary study. (The specific materials and protocol necessary for the application are described below.) The application process is designed to make clear in each individual case what intellectual concerns are to be related to one another through interdisciplinary study and what method of comparative analysis is suited to such an approach. </P>

<P>Students should discuss plans and proposed courses with both the ISHU chair and College adviser. These meetings will help students evaluate the available courses of study to arrive at a balanced and coherent interdisciplinary plan. </P>

<P>Once a student is admitted to ISHU, she or he will come to have the support also of the BA preceptor and, by the end of the third year, a faculty BA adviser. The preceptor is typically a graduate student with interdisciplinary expertise who will help the student to progress towards successful completion of the degree program, including completion of the BA paper. The faculty adviser is a faculty member who has expertise in the student's main field of study, and agrees to supervise the development of the BA paper specifically. (The student is responsible for securing a faculty BA adviser, but can ask the ISHU staff for assistance in doing so.) </P>

<P>A student in the ISHU BA program will take courses in two or three academic departments, and it is common for ISHU majors to have two or three sets of chosen courses that do not intersect with each other at all. (Your program is interdisciplinary; your courses, individually, need not be interdisciplinary.) There is, however, a required structure to the distribution of courses that a student takes, and there are two specific courses that every ISHU major must take. These requirements are explained below. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Each student's program of study must meet the following six distribution requirements. Students can ensure that these requirements are met by completing the application worksheet that is available from the ISHU College adviser or ishum.uchicago.edu: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Six courses in a primary field or in closely integrated subject areas in more than one field. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Three courses in a first supporting field or in closely integrated subject areas in more than one field. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Three courses in a second supporting field or in closely integrated subject areas in more than one field. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>A &quot;field&quot; is defined in one of three ways: (a) a selection of courses from a traditional department (such as Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations or Philosophy), (b) a traditional discipline spread over more than one department (such as a &quot;Theater&quot; field containing South Asian Languages and Civilizations and Theater and Performance Studies courses), or (c) an interdisciplinary set of courses under a certain rubric (such as an &quot;American studies&quot; field containing courses from English, History, and Sociology, or a &quot;Narrative/ Storytelling&quot; field containing courses from Romance or Slavic Languages and Literatures, Anthropology, and Psychology). Students are encouraged to create their six-course field from a single, traditional discipline, so that, however broad their program, they can also have some depth of learning in a single discipline. </P>

<P>Any one of the fields listed under (1), (2), and (3) may be drawn from outside the humanities. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Two courses or one sequence of two courses (drawn from offerings in the humanities) that emphasizes intellectual approaches or critical methods germane to a student's particular interdisciplinary course program. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>ISHU 29802 The BA Colloquium in the Spring Quarter of the third year, which meets three times over the quarter and is taught by the ISHU BA preceptor. The purpose of this course is for each student to begin working on the structure and argument of the BA paper that he or she will complete the following year. At the end of the course, each student will have written a proposal for the BA paper, which will generally be a </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>précis of the argument that the student anticipates making. Grading for this course is Pass/Fail (P/F) for all students. </P>

<P>Students should note that the course carries no numerical credit towards their degree (it is a &quot;zero-unit" course). It cannot fill any role in the student's degree program other than the one it is designed to fill; it also cannot be an elective. Because it is a noncredit course, students must carry at least three additional courses while registered for ISHU 29802 in order to meet requirements for full-time student status. Regardless of these technical qualifications, the course is compulsory for ISHU majors in their third year unless an exemption is granted for unusual circumstances, such as the student's being in residence at a study-abroad program that quarter. </P>

<P>6. ISHU 29900 Preparation of the BA Project. This course is structured as an independent study. The instructor will be the student's faculty BA adviser. It should be taken in the Autumn or Winter Quarter of fourth year, but in special circumstances may be taken in Spring Quarter of fourth year. The faculty adviser will devise a plan of reading and writing for the student and will critique drafts of the student's BA paper as </P>

<P>BA Paper Preparation Related Deadlines </P>

<P>In order to maintain good standing in the program, fourth-year ISHU majors are expected to meet certain deadlines as they move toward completing their BA paper: (This schedule is based upon a normal Spring Quarter graduation plan; students planning to graduate in another quarter should adjust the various deadlines accordingly.) </P>

<P>Fourth year ISHU students will meet with the BA preceptor at least twice during the Autumn Quarter and twice again during the Winter Quarter. In these meetings they will discuss their work with the preceptor and show him or her drafts of the BA paper or, in the minimal case, evidence of their progress toward the completion of the paper. By the end of the Autumn Quarter, fourth-year students will turn in a preliminary draft/first iteration of the BA paper to the preceptor. There will then be a pre-final draft due to the faculty BA adviser, the ISHU chair, and the preceptor for perusal and critique by the end of the Winter Quarter. The final BA paper should be turned in to each of these three people and also to the academic advisor by Friday of fourth week in Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>In addition to these departmental requirements, a student's faculty BA adviser may impose earlier deadlines and further conditions in relation to the work expected of the student in ISHU 29900 Preparation of the BA Project. </P>

<P>Sample Programs </P>

<P>While the potential for developing individual BA programs in Interdisciplinary Studies is as great as the combined ingenuity, imagination, and interest of each student in consultation with his or her advisers, there are identifiable patterns in the choices of fields and lines of inquiry currently being implemented in the ISHU program. The most prominent of these include the following: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study in philosophy and literature (with either literature or philosophy emphasized) to investigate differences in handling concepts and language in philosophy and literature and/or mutual influence between the two fields. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study in verbal and nonverbal art forms and expressions (art and literature; and music and literature) leading to consideration of the implications of the verbal and nonverbal distinction for interpretation and criticism. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study in the history, philosophy, language, religious expression, and literary and artistic productions of a given culture or of a given historical period within one or more cultures. Examples include American studies, the Renaissance, the Near East, or Greece (and the Mediterranean) in the preclassical and classical ages. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study in humanistic fields (e.g., literature and philosophy) and in a social science field (e.g., sociology, psychology, anthropology, political science). This option is particularly adapted to a focus on gender studies. Please note, however, that the College offers a major in Gender Studies. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study of modern culture in its various aspects of popular and elite forms of cultural expression. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study in humanistic approaches to biological or physical science. This option is particularly adapted to interest in problems or aspects of intellectual and cultural history (e.g., the impact of Newtonian physics on eighteenth-century European thought) or to study of modern society and science's role within it (medical ethics being one possible focus among many). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>Study in human rights in relation to one or two humanistic disciplines such as philosophy, literature, or history. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Application </P>

<P>Interested students should make application to the ISHU program as soon as possible upon completion of general education requirements (typically by the end of the second year and, except in extraordinary circumstances, no later than the end of Autumn Quarter of the third year). Transfer students in particular are urged to apply at the earliest point that they can. An application is initiated by securing an interview with the ISHU chair and College adviser, to discuss the feasibility of shaping and implementing a given set of interdisciplinary concerns into a course of study for the BA. </P>

<P>After consultation, students who wish to pursue an application to the ISHU program must submit a recent course transcript (with a minimum B average in preceding course work) and a two-part written proposal according to the following guidelines: </P>

<P>Personal Statement </P>

<P>The first part of the proposal consists of a personal reflective statement of approximately 500 to 1,000 words in length, explaining the character of their interdisciplinary interests and stating as thoughtfully as possible how they propose to channel and expand them within course offerings currently available. Some consideration of prospects and possibilities for a BA paper or project is a desirable part of these statements, if it can be provided. </P>

<P>Course Prospectus </P>

<P>The second part of the proposal consists of a list of courses to fill the headings given in the above set of guidelines. This list will include courses the student has already taken as well as ones he or she intends to take. While a list of courses the student proposes to take is a required part of the application, it is understood that these will undergo modification. Any changes to the course prospectus should be discussed with (and approved by) the College adviser. </P>

<P>After the application materials have been reviewed by the ISHU chair and academic adviser, a twenty-minute interview will be scheduled with the ISHU chair. The ISHU chair will inform the student via email of the result of the application. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All courses in the major must be taken for a quality grade (that is, A, B, C, D, or F, with + and – grades), with the exception of the zero-unit course ISHU 29802 The BA Colloquium, for which students will receive a grade of Pass or Fail. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To be eligible for honors, a student must maintain an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and a GPA in the major of 3.5 or higher. Honors are reserved for the student whose BA project shows exceptional intellectual merit in the judgment of the faculty adviser, ISHU chair, and master of the Humanities Collegiate Division. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Close contact with the faculty and staff relevant to the student's career in ISHU—including the ISHU College adviser, chair, and preceptor, and the faculty adviser of the BA paper—is essential in a program that involves so much individual initiative and experimentation. Students are encouraged to seek their advice whenever they have an intellectual or practical concern about progress in the major. </P>

<P>Faculty </P>

<P>Since ISHU is an interdisciplinary major whose field of study encompasses all the offerings in the various departments and programs of the University (particularly in the Humanities Division), all faculty members of these varied departments and programs are related to ISHU. ISHU students may approach any University of Chicago faculty member who works in his or her field of interest with a request to serve as faculty adviser for the BA paper. Similarly, ISHU students may take courses with any faculty member from any department of the University. </P>

<P>Courses </P>

<P>For the same reason—that ISHU is an interdisciplinary major whose field of study encompasses all the offerings in the various departments and programs of the University (particularly in the Humanities Division)— all substantive and methodology courses offered in these varied departments and programs are viable courses for the program. ISHU students may take any courses offered in the University that fit in with their program of study, provided these are approved by the ISHU College adviser and chair. </P>

<P>In addition to the above courses that are grounded in particular fields of study, the program requires all ISHU students to take two courses that are related to the preparation of the BA paper: </P>

<P>ISHU 29802. The BA Colloquium. 000 Units. </P>

<P>Required of third-year students who are majoring in ISHU. This zero-unit, noncredit course must be taken for P/ F grading. To meet requirements for full-time student status, students must carry at least three additional courses while registered for this course. Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Consent of ISHU College adviser and chair Note(s): Required of third-year students who are majoring in ISHU. This zero-unit, noncredit course must be taken for P/F grading. To meet requirements for full-time student status, students must carry at least three additional courses while registered for this course. </P>

<P>ISHU 29900. Preparation of the BA Project. 100 Units. </P>

<P>No description available. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter Prerequisite(s): Consent of faculty adviser and ISHU chair Note(s): Students are required to submit the College Reading and Research Course Form. </P>

<P>More details of these two courses have been provided earlier in the Program Requirements section. </P>

<P>Moreover, inasmuch as the ability to write clear, effective prose is part of the essential skill set required of the humanist endeavor, ISHU students are encouraged (but not required) to take a course on academic writing such as: </P>

<P>ENGL 13000. Academic and Professional Writing (The Little Red Schoolhouse) 100 Units. </P>

<P>Academic and Professional Writing, a.k.a. &quot;The Little Red Schoolhouse&quot;or &quot;LRS&quot; (English 13000/33000) is an advanced writing course for third- and fourth-year undergraduates who are taking courses in their majors or concentrations, as well as graduate students in all of the divisions and university professional programs. LRS helps writers communicate complex and difficult material clearly to a wide variety of expert and non-expert readers. It is designed to prepare students for the demands of academic writing at various levels, from the B.A. thesis to the academic article or book--and for the tasks of writing in professional contexts. Instructor(s): L. McEnerney, K. Cochran, T. Weiner Terms Offered: Spring Winter Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing Note(s): This course does not count towards the ISHU program requirements. May be taken for P/F grading by students who are not majoring in English. Materials fee $20. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 33000 </P>

<H3>Jewish Studies </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64348">Department Website: http://ccjs.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The BA program in Jewish Studies provides a context in which College students may examine the texts, cultures, languages, and histories of Jews and Judaism over three millennia. The perspective is contextual, comparative, and interdisciplinary. The long and diverse history of Jews and Judaism affords unique opportunities to study modes of continuity and change, interpretation and innovation, and isolation and integration of a world historical civilization. Students are encouraged to develop appropriate skills (in texts, languages, history, and culture) for independent work. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Jewish Studies. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Jewish Civilization Sequence </P>

<P>A two-course Jewish Civilization sequence is offered in the Autumn and Winter Quarters. The first course begins in antiquity and extends to the early medieval period (JWSC 12000 Jewish Civilization I: Ancient Beginnings to Early Medieval Period). The second course begins in the medieval period and extends to the present (JWSC 12001 Jewish Civilization II: Late Medieval to Modern Period). Jewish civilization courses may be used to fulfill the College’s general education requirement in civilization studies. It is recommended, though not required, that students take these two courses in sequence. Students who register for the Autumn Quarter course will automatically be pre-registered for the winter segment. </P>

<P>Note: Jewish Studies revised its civilization studies courses for academic year 2018-2019. Students who began the requirement prior to Autumn Quarter 2018, under the previous course options, may complete it with those courses that remain available, or they may combine them with the new course options. However, students must have at least one course on the ancient/medieval period (JWSC 20120-20199 or JWSC 12000 Jewish Civilization I: Ancient Beginnings to Early Medieval Period) and at least one on the modern period (JWSC 20220-20299 or JWSC 12001 Jewish Civilization II: Late Medieval to Modern Period). Students who begin the requirement in Autumn Quarter 2018 or later may only use the new sequence to meet the general studies requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P>Students may also fulfill the Jewish civilization requirement by participating in the “Jerusalem in Middle Eastern Civilizations” Study Abroad program. (For more information about this program, please see the Study Abroad page of this catalog.) </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students who have not completed the College’s general education requirements before starting the major should do so during their first year as Jewish Studies majors. Students are required to meet with the director of undergraduate studies before declaring a major in Jewish Studies. Each student in the major will have as an adviser a faculty member who is affiliated with the Greenberg Center for Jewish Studies. </P>

<P>Major in Jewish Studies </P>

<P>The major requires twelve courses distributed according to the guidelines that follow. A full, constantly updated list of courses approved for the major and minor is available on the Greenberg Center for Jewish Studies website at ccjs.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Language </P>

<P>Students must typically take three quarters of Hebrew. If the student's research project requires knowledge of a language other than Hebrew, the student may petition the committee to substitute that language in the place of Hebrew. </P>

<P>Jewish Civilization and Electives </P>

<P>Students in the major must take nine additional courses in Jewish Studies, for a total of twelve courses. </P>

<P>Jewish Civilization: Students in the major must complete either the two-quarter Jewish Civilization sequence or the Jerusalem Study Abroad program. </P>

<P>If students take one of these sequences to satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies, one elective in the major must come from another civilization studies sequence pertinent to the area and period of the student’s primary interest in Jewish Studies. </P>

<P>For students who take a sequence outside Jewish Studies to satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies, the two-course Jewish Civilization sequence (or three-course sequence offered in Jerusalem) will count among the JWSC electives required for the major. </P>

<P>Other Electives: The remaining courses must come from JWSC course offerings. These elective courses should normally focus in a specific area of concentration within Jewish Studies and should be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Students who complete the option BA these (as described under Optional BA Paper) may count JWSC 29900 among these courses. </P>

<P>Beyond the requirements for the major, students are encouraged to take at least one course in method or theory pertaining to their area of concentration in Jewish Studies, whether it is a JWSC course that can count in </P>

<P>Optional BA Paper </P>

<P>Students who choose this option are to meet with their advisers by May 15 of their third year to determine the focus of the research project, and they are expected to begin reading and research for the BA paper during the summer before their fourth year. After further consultation, students are to continue guided readings and participate in a (formal or informal) tutorial during Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. Credit toward the major is received only for the Winter Quarter tutorial during which the BA paper is finally written and revised. The BA tutorial may count toward one of the courses related to Jewish Studies. The BA paper must be received by the primary reader by the end of fifth week of Spring Quarter. A BA paper is a requirement for consideration for honors. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program chair. Approval from both program chairs is required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Honors are awarded to students who demonstrate excellence in their course work, as well as on the BA paper. To qualify for honors, students must register for JWSC 29900 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/? P=JWSC%2029900) BA Paper Preparation Course in addition to the twelve courses required in the general program of study, bringing the total number of courses required to thirteen. Students must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major, and the BA paper must be judged to be at least of A- quality. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students take all courses required for the major for quality grades. </P>

<P>Minor in Jewish Studies </P>

<P>The minor in Jewish Studies provides a basic introduction to the texts, cultures, languages, and history of the Jews and Judaism. Six courses are required for the minor, two of which are the Jewish Civilization sequence. The other courses may be in any area of Jewish Studies, including languages such as Hebrew and Yiddish; such courses can be identified by their JWSC prefix. Students can earn credit for three courses in Jewish civilization (ancient, medieval, and modern) by participating in the “Jerusalem in Middle Eastern Civilizations” Study Abroad program. (For more information about this program, please see the Study Abroad (http:// collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/offcampusstudyprograms) page of this catalog.) </P>

<P>Students who wish to do a minor in Jewish Studies must meet with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of the Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. The director’s approval for the minor program will then be communicated to the student’s College adviser. </P>

<P>Courses taken to fulfill the requirements for the minor in Jewish Studies may not be double-counted with courses taken for the student’s major(s) or courses taken for other minors. Courses taken for the minor in Jewish Studies must be taken for quality grades. </P>

<P>Jewish Civilization is a two-quarter sequence that explores the development of Jewish culture and tradition from its ancient beginnings through its rabbinic and medieval transformations to its modern manifestations. Through investigation of primary texts—biblical, Talmudic, philosophical, mystical, historical, documentary, and literary —students will acquire a broad overview of Jews, Judaism, and Jewishness while reflecting in greater depth on major themes, ideas, and events in Jewish history. Note: Jewish Studies revised its civilization studies courses for academic year 2018–19. Students who began the requirement prior to Autumn Quarter 2018, under the previous course options, may complete it with those courses that remain available, or they may combine them with the new course options. However, students must have at least one course on the ancient/medieval period (JWSC 20120-20199 or JWSC 12000 Jewish Civilization I: Ancient Beginnings to Early Medieval Period) and at least one on the modern period (JWSC 20220-20299 or JWSC 12001 Jewish Civilization II: Late Medieval to Modern Period). Students who begin the requirement in Autumn Quarter 2018 or later may only use the new sequence to meet the general studies requirement in civilization studies. </P>

<P>JWSC 20120. Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious, political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of texts continues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course, we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualize their ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt. Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient Near East. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along with representative selections from secondary literature. We will also spend some time thinking about the nature of biblical interpretation. Instructor(s): J.

<P>JWSC 24105. Letters to Zion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar centers the question: what do we mean when we describe Jewish authors and thinkers from the past as Zionist, anti-Zionist, or non-Zionist? We will approach this question by reading three correspondences: Kafka's letters to Felice Bauer, and the correspondences between Gershom Scholem and Hannah Arendt and between Paul Celan and Ilana Shmueli. In each case, the question of Zionism and of Israel looms in the background of the exchange in some way. Our key question is: can we definitively determine the position of each of these letter-writers on the question of Zionism? And do we want to? Or does the form of the correspondence rather open a possibility for a more flexible, complex account of their positions, allowing us to think of them as changing and evolving, indeed as dialogic? In addition to the letters themselves, we will read other texts by these authors and about them, as well as background reading on the letter as genre and as historical document. We will also take note of the fact that these are all exchanges that cross the gender divide and ask how the question of Zionist ideology intersects with issues of gender in Jewish history.

<P>JWSC 26210. Oedipus in Zion: The Oedipal Figure in Modern Hebrew Literature. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Historians often refer to the emergence of Zionism as an &quot;Oedipal Revolution. Hence, the secular son's rebellion against his orthodox father is understood as the thrust that triggered the modern Jewish revolution. Alan Mintz aptly described the inter-generational rift between fathers and sons at the turn of the 20th century as a tragic yet inevitable consequence of modernity, underscoring the psychological difficulties and political dilemmas that haunted the sons who were &quot;banished form their father's table. This seminar will focus on the (highly androcentric) oedipal figure in literary theory and explore its prominence in modern Hebrew literature. Freud's preoccupation with the Oedipus complex at the turn of the century coincided with the emergence of a powerful oedipal narrative in modern Hebrew culture. This confluence provides a fascinating backdrop to the &quot;invention" of the Oedipus complex. We will read a variety of literary texts which rework the oedipal figure from the late 19th century to the 1980s and beyond.

<P>JWSC 29550. Cinema and the Holocaust. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Focuses on cinematic responses by several leading film directors from East &amp; Central Europe to a central event of 20th century history -- the Holocaust. Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioning cameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandistic schemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocide produced after the actual traumatic events. This class aims at discussing the challenge of representing the Jewish genocide which has often been defined as un-representable. Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raise questions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production &amp; a search for relevant artistic means with which to engage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation of death &amp; suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization; intertwined notions of chance &amp; hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims. The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the course simultaneously explores extensive &amp; continuous cinematic production of the genre &amp; its historical development in various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, &amp; Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. Instructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Course requirements: film screenings, class participation, reading assignments, one class presentation, and a final project.

<P>Students who major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies gain a thorough grounding in selected aspects of Latin American societies, cultures, histories, politics, and economics through one or more of the social sciences as they deal with Latin American materials, and through competence in Spanish or Portuguese (an added intellectual asset). The BA program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies can provide an appropriate background for careers in business, journalism, government, teaching, or the nonprofit sector, or for graduate studies in one of the social sciences disciplines. Students who are more interested in the languages and/or literatures of Latin America may wish to consider the major in Romance Languages and Literatures. Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Information about the minor follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>APPLICATION TO THE MAJOR PROGRAM </P>

<P>Students who plan to declare a major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies should follow the guidelines below. An informational meeting is held each autumn to describe the program and its requirements, as well as to explain and facilitate the declaration process. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>As early as possible in their studies and in consultation with their College adviser and the LACS program adviser, students should prepare a preliminary plan of study that would meet program requirements. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Students must meet with the LACS program adviser no later than the Autumn Quarter of their third year to discuss their major progress and to discuss the BA Colloquium and their proposed BA thesis topic and relevant readings and resources. Students will choose a suitable faculty adviser to supervise the development of their BA essay project no later than Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>NOTE: Students who plan to study abroad during the Winter or Spring Quarter of their third year should meet with the LACS program adviser before leaving campus. </P>

<P>MAJOR PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </P>

<P>As early as possible in their studies, students should obtain a worksheet from the LACS program adviser, who will assist them with selecting the five required LACS content courses. For a list of approved courses, visit the LACS website at clas.uchicago.edu or consult with the LACS program adviser. </P>

<P>Depending on whether the student counts two or three Latin American civilization courses toward the general education requirement, the major requires either eleven or twelve courses. Students who use all three quarters of a Latin American civilization sequence to meet the general education requirement will complete an eleven-course major. Students who fulfill the general education requirement with two quarters of the sequence will count the third quarter of the sequence toward the major, for a total of twelve courses in the major. </P>

<P>Students participating in a study abroad program may petition to have courses accepted in partial fulfillment of requirements for the major. </P>

<P>GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in Latin American and Caribbean Studies must complete the general education requirement in civilization studies with LACS 16100-16200-16300 Introduction to Latin American Civilization I-II-III or SOSC 19019-19020-19021 Latin American Civilization in Oaxaca I-II-III . Either of these sequences provides an excellent introduction to the program. </P>

<P>LANGUAGE COURSES </P>

<P>Students should complete three courses in second-year Spanish or Portuguese to meet the language requirement for the major. Eligible students may petition for credit. </P>

<P>CONTENT COURSES AND ELECTIVES </P>

<P>To meet requirements for the major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies, students must also take five courses that focus on Latin America or the Caribbean—at least four of the five must be in the social sciences—and two additional courses that cover any social science topic. Students may find listings of quarterly Latin American themed courses on the Latin American and Caribbean Studieswebsite at clas.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>BA COLLOQUIUM </P>

<P>All students who are majoring in Latin American and Caribbean Studies are required to participate in the BA Colloquium and to submit a BA essay. The BA Colloquium in Latin American Studies (LACS 29801 BA Colloquium) is a yearlong course led by the preceptor and BA adviser. Fourth-year students are </P>

<P>required to participate in all three quarters, although they register for the colloquium only once in Autumn Quarter. The colloquium assists students in formulating approaches to the BA essay and developing their research and writing skills, while providing a forum for group discussion and critiques. Graduating students present their BA essays in a public session of the colloquium during Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>BA ESSAY </P>

<P>All students who are majoring in Latin American and Caribbean Studies are required to write a BA essay under the supervision of a faculty member. The BA essay is due Spring Quarter of the year of graduation. During the Spring Quarter of their third year, all BA majors (double majors included) will be required to participate in a thesis proposal workshop series. This series will help third-year majors develop a thesis topic, find a faculty adviser, and begin conducting thesis research prior to the start of the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. Students will be contacted in the Winter Quarter of their third year with information regarding the workshop series. </P>

<P>Registration for a BA essay preparation course (LACS 29900 Prep: BA Essay) is optional. Students who do register for LACS 29900 Prep: BA Essay may count this course as one of the five they must take dealing with Latin America. The grade students will receive for this course depends on the successful completion of the BA essay. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA essay project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of both program chairs. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College advising office. It must be completed and returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>LACS 24706. Science in the South: Decolonizing the Study of Knowledge in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar will bridge anthropologies and histories of science, technology, and medicine to Latin American decolonial thought. Throughout Latin America, techno-scientific objects and practices, with their presumed origin in the Euro-Atlantic North, are often complexly entangled with neo-imperial projects of development and modernization that elongate social forms of colonization into the present. Technoscience and its objects, however, can also generate new creative, political, and life-enhancing potentials beyond or despite their colonial resonances, or even provide tools to ongoing struggles for decolonization. Together, seminar participants will explore what a decolonial approach to the study of science, technology, and medicine in the Global South, particularly in Latin America, has been and could become and how decolonial theory can inflect our own disciplinary, conceptual, and political commitments as anthropologists of technoscience. Instructor(s): S. Graeter Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ANTH 23026, HIPS 24706 </P>

<P>LACS 25117. The Audience, The Archaeologist, and the Art Historian. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will address archaeological objects as well as the techniques that have been developed in order to capture them in a broader sense: to capture their meaning, to capture their form, to capture their trajectories. Archaeological objects change depending on the place where they are and the people who manipulate them. Instructor(s): Castillo Deball, Mariana Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Tinker Visiting Professor 2018; There is a studio component to this course. Equivalent Course(s): ARTV 25117, LACS 35117, ARTV 35117 </P>

<P>LACS 25118. Historical Sociology of Racism Latin America. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course will examine the discourse on race, racism, and racial inequalities through the available sociological literature. Special emphasis will be placed on the emergency of social movements and collective agencies that have shaped the present racial order in the region. This course will first present how racialization processes intermingled with the formation of mestizo nation-states in Latin America, and, by doing so, establishing racial democracy as the corner stone of modern democracies (1920s to 1960s). Second, examine how authoritarian regimes promoted economic development but were incapable of curtailing social inequalities in the region, eventually dismantling the international perception of these countries as racial democracies (1960s to 1980s). And, finally, explore how processes of racial formation operated in the whole region, giving way to the formation of multiracial nations and to the visibility of racism as a structural component of these societies (1990s to 2010s).

<P>LACS 25120. Territorial Identities, State Formation, and the Experience of Modernity in the Modern World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>During the last twenty years, scholars interested in the history of the crisis of the Spanish Monarchy focused on the development of the idea of nation and nationhood in the Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic. Criticizing the idea of the birth of post-colonial Latin American republics as the triumph of a national sentiment, historians reconceptualized the nation as a result of the imperial crisis. However, considerably less attention has been paid to the parallel process of state building in the Iberian World. This course will offer an introductory overview of the process that led from imperial monarchy to national republics from the point of view of statehood formation. It will focus on the complexity of the process of emancipation as a transition from monarchical tutorship to the birth of modern &quot;Administración,&quot; while also addressing territorial identities as forms of non-national self-recognition that transited from colonial monarchy to post-colonial state. Instructor(s): J. Portillo Valdés Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): HIST 26221, LACS 35120, HIST 36221 </P>

<P>LACS 25121. The Brazil-Argentina Nuclear Cooperation Agreement and Thermoelectric Transition in Brazil. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course will be developed in a series of theory-practice based sessions. Due to the richness that the University offers, in terms of faculties and other resources, some of the sessions will be accompanied by scholars from other faculties to address a particular topic or expertise relevant to the session. Instructor(s): Ramos, Alexandre Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Tinker Visiting Professor Autumn 2018 Equivalent Course(s): HIPS 25121, LACS 35121, CHSS 35121 </P>

<P>LACS 26416. Latin American Extractivisms. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will survey the historical antecedents and contemporary politics of Latin American extractivisms. While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current &quot;neoextractivisms&quot; have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells, open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformations to local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present. Yet parallel to neo-extractive regimes, emergent Latin American social movements have unleashed impassioned and often unexpected forms of local and transnational resistance. Readings in the course will contrast cross-regional trends of extractive economic development and governance with fine-grained accounts of how individuals, families, and communities experience and respond to land dispossession, local and transregional conflict, and the ecological and health impacts of Latin American extractivisms. Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 26416, ANTH 23093 </P>

<P>LACS 26417. Toxic States: Corrupted Ecologies in Latin America and the Caribbean. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Concepts of purity and danger, the sacred and profane, and contamination and healing constitute central analytics of anthropological inquiry into religion, medicine, and ecology. This course brings diverse theories of corporeal corruption to bare on contemporary ethnography of toxicity, particularly in order to examine the impact of political corruption on ecological matters in Latin America and the Caribbean. We will both historicize a growing disciplinary preoccupation with materiality, contamination, and the chemical, as well as conceptualize its empirical significance within neo-colonial/liberal states throughout the region. Instructor(s): S. Graeter Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): LACS 36417 </P>

<P>LACS 29700. Reading and Research in Latin American Studies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Students and instructors can arrange a Reading and Research course in Latin American Studies when the material being studied goes beyond the scope of a particular course, when students are working on material not covered in an existing course or when students would like to receive academic credit for independent research. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,Summer,Winter Prerequisite(s): Consent of undergraduate thesis/project adviser required Note(s): College students are required to submit the College Reading and Research Course Form. Must be taken for a quality grade. </P>

<P>LACS 29801. BA Colloquium. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This colloquium, which is led by the LACS BA Preceptor, assists students in formulating approaches to the BA essay and developing their research and writing skills, while providing a forum for group discussion and critiques. Graduating students present their BA essays in a public session of the colloquium during the spring quarter. Instructor(s): CLAS Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): For fourth year (graduating) students majoring in Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

<H6 id="LinkTarget_64350">The Law, Letters, and Society major will resume in 2018–19. Students who matriculated in Autumn Quarter 2017 may apply in Spring Quarter of their first year to begin the program in Autumn 2018. See below for application details. </H6>

<P>Application to the Program </P>

<P>Students must apply in Spring Quarter of their first year to enter the program in their second year. Autumn Quarter 2017 matriculants only are eligible to apply to begin the program in 2018–19. Students who entered the College prior to Autumn Quarter 2017 will not be considered. </P>

<P>Application forms may be obtained from the Office of the New Collegiate Division in Harper Memorial (HM) 235. Applications are available in HM 235 on Friday of tenth week of Winter Quarter and must be submitted to HM 235 by noon on Friday of the first week of Spring Quarter. No applications will be be distributed or accepted during spring break. Students are evaluated on the basis of the application statement and previous performance in the College. Because of the nature of the requirements of the program, no more than twenty-five students can be admitted per year. </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The program in Law, Letters, and Society is concerned with law in civilian and customary legal systems, both historically and contemporaneously. The program is designed to develop the student's analytical skills to enable informed and critical examination of law broadly construed. The organizing premise of the program is that law is a tool of social organization and control, not simply an expression of will or aspiration, and that it is best understood by careful study of both rhetorical artifacts and empirical consequences of its application. Program requirements are constructed to support the organizing premise, and, because of the nature of the requirements, transfer students are not eligible to register as Law, Letters, and Society majors. </P>

<P>The program requires course work in three areas, although there is a reasonably broad latitude both expected and permitted in satisfaction of the distributional requirement. There is a substantial writing requirement for all majors; majors are expected to produce substantial written work (sometimes called &quot;the BA Paper&quot;) under the close supervision of a faculty member whose area of scholarly concern is related to the broad objectives of the program. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Course work is required in three areas. After successfully completing the Introductory Course, students must take two courses in Letters and two courses in Society. In addition, students must complete six other courses that, while not necessarily offered or listed formally under either rubric, are substantively supportive of the topics, areas, skills, or concerns of the two areas. Courses satisfying the additional requirement are identified on a quarterly basis, and final approval of additional required course work is made by consultation between the student and the program chairman. </P>

<P>The Introductory Course </P>

<P>The Introductory Course establishes the intellectual moorings of the program. The importance of the Introductory Course lies not in its content (indeed, its precise focus and scope may be different from time to time) but on its approach to the nature of law. Recently, for example, the Introductory Course has been LLSO 24200 Legal Reasoning, a study, based primarily on cases, of the classic conventions of legal argument in the Anglo-American legal system. In other years, the Introductory Course might be Roman Law or Greek Law, Medieval Law, or a text-based course on ancient legal philosophy, or a comparison of modern legal categories and policies with those of former societies and cultures. The objective is not so much to establish a historical foundation for modern studies as to demonstrate that legal systems are culturally rooted; that urgent, present concerns may obscure important characteristics of legal ideas and behavior; and that many recurrent themes in Western legal thought are shaped or driven by both common and uncommon features. Unlike many legal studies programs that attempt to orient study of the law primarily in contemporary debates, usually in the field of American constitutional law, the program seeks to organize its exploration of law as a system rather than as a forum or an instrument. </P>

<P>Other Course Work </P>

<P>Students must also take two courses each in the Letters and Society divisions of the program, plus six other courses complementary to the required work, as outlined previously (the other six courses may be ones cross listed in the program or may be from other disciplines). Letters and Society are not meant as fixed or self-defining fields, but instead as organizational categories emphasizing two fundamental modes of examining law in a systemic fashion. Courses under the rubric of Letters (whether based in the program or in English, philosophy, or political theory) tend to be based on the study of literary and historical artifacts, such as cases, tracts, conventional literature, or other texts, and emphasize the ways in which law formally constitutes itself. Questions of interpretative and normative theory, rhetorical strategy, and the like are central to such courses. Society serves to organize studies from a variety of different disciplines (including history, political science, economics, and sociology) that try to measure, with different techniques and at different times, the effect of </P>

<P>law on society. The combined objective is to treat law as an intellectual activity and as a phenomenon, and to emphasize that both occur in contexts that help to shape them, whether ancient or modern. </P>

<P>Research </P>

<P>In addition to satisfying the course requirements, each student in the program must produce evidence of sustained research in the form of a substantial research paper during either the junior or senior year and obtain approval of a member of the faculty, although not necessarily a member of the program faculty. Papers may be written in conjunction with Law, Letters, and Society courses, under the auspices of reading and research courses, or in a Research Seminar. (The paper is an independent requirement, however, and need not be accomplished in conjunction with enrollment in a specific course.) The scope, method, and objective of the paper, as well as its length, are subject to negotiation between the student and the instructor. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements </P>

<P>LLSO 24200 Legal Reasoning (Introductory Course) 100 </P>

<P>Two Letters courses (List II) 200 </P>
<Figure>

<ImageData src=""/>
Two Society courses (List III)200Six Complementary courses*600</Figure>

<P>Total Units 1100 </P>

<P>* Complementary courses are courses from other departments that support work done in the major. Some students prefer to concentrate their work on a specific issue or problem, e.g., urban politics and policy, historic societal discrimination, or the role of international institutions in policy implementation. Other students prefer to examine a series of discrete topics that are not directly related but that concern the operation of regimes of social control. Lists of Pre-Approved Complementary Courses are published quarterly, and students who believe that a course not so listed nonetheless supports work in the major may petition the program chair for approval at any time while enrolled in the course or within one quarter of completing the course. Courses taken in Autumn Quarter of the second year simultaneously with the Introductory Course may count as Complementary Courses. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Students who wish to be considered for honors must notify the program chairman and their faculty supervisor in writing no later than two quarters before the quarter in which they expect to receive their degree. Eligible students must maintain a GPA of at least 3.50 both overall and in the major, and they must write a distinguished research paper. The paper must be submitted by noon on Friday of fifth week in the quarter of proposed graduation (other papers must be submitted by noon on Friday of seventh week), and the student's faculty supervisor and a second reader must agree that honors are merited. It should be noted that honors are awarded sparingly. </P>

<P>Reading and Research Courses </P>

<P>For students with a legitimate interest in pursuing study that cannot be met by means of regular courses, there is an option of devising a reading and research course to be supervised by a member of the faculty and taken for a quality grade. Such courses may not be used to satisfy the requirements of either the two-course Letters or two-course Society requirements, but may be used to satisfy part of the other six required courses, with the written permission of the program chairman obtained in advance of initiation of the work. Only two research courses may be used within the major. LLSO 29400 Research Seminar: LLSO may also be used as one of the six Complementary Courses. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Two of the six complementary courses required in the program may, with consent of instructor, be taken for Pass/Fail grading. Students who enroll in LLSO 29400 Research Seminar: LLSO, offered annually, beginning Autumn 2010, are graded on a P/F basis, and the seminar counts as one of the two P/F-graded complementary courses. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students who wish to major in Law, Letters, and Society must register for LLSO 24200 Legal Reasoning in Autumn Quarter of their second year. This requirement is not negotiable. Students should note that, as an interdisciplinary major, the program has a strictly limited enrollment and that registration for the Introductory Course is determined during the preceding Spring Quarter. Upon deciding to major in Law, Letters, and Society, students should arrange to consult with the program chairman and the associate director on their course of study in the program. Students should continue to consult with their College advisers on general education degree requirements. </P>

<P>LLSO 20019. Mesopotamian Law. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Ancient Mesopotamia--the home of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians who wrote in cuneiform script on durable clay tablets--was the locus of many of history's firsts. No development, however, may be as important as the formations of legal systems and legal principles revealed in contracts, trial records, and law collections (codes), among which The Laws of Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 BC) stands as most important for understanding the subsequent legal practice and thought of Mesopotamia's cultural heirs in the Middle East and Europe until today. This course will explore the rich source materials of the Laws and relevant judicial and administration documents (all in English translations) to investigate topics of legal, social, and economic practice, including family formation and dissolution, crime and punishment (sympathetic or talionic eye for an eye, pecuniary, corporal), and procedure (contracts, trials, ordeals).

<P>LLSO 21002. Human Rights: Philosophical Foundations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Human rights are claims of justice that hold merely in virtue of our shared humanity. In this course we will explore philosophical theories of this elementary and crucial form of justice. Among topics to be considered are the role that dignity and humanity play in grounding such rights, their relation to political and economic institutions, and the distinction between duties of justice and claims of charity or humanitarian aid. Finally we will consider the application of such theories to concrete, problematic and pressing problems, such as global poverty, torture and genocide. (A) (I) Instructor(s): B.

<P>LLSO 22612. Introduction to Political Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will investigate what it is for a society to be just. In what sense are the members of a just society equal? What freedoms does a just society protect? Must a just society be a democracy? What economic arrangements are compatible with justice? In the second portion of the course we will consider one pressing injustice in our society in light of our previous philosophical conclusions. Possible candidates include, but are not limited to, racial inequality, economic inequality, and gender hierarchy. Here our goal will be to combine our philosophical theories with empirical evidence in order to identify, diagnose, and effectively respond to actual injustice. (A) Instructor(s): B.

<P>LLSO 23008. Montesquieu's &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; 100 Units. </P>

<P>From its publication in 1748, &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; has been interpreted, among other things, as a foundational work of method in historical jurisprudence; a pæan to the English constitution and an inspiration for that of the future United States; a precocious call for penal reform and the abolition of slavery; a monument to the Enlightenment's capacity for cultural relativism that laid the groundwork for the discipline of sociology; a historical treatise on the rise of globalized commerce and its political effects in Europe; and a manifesto for a reactionary feudal aristocracy. We will read &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; with attention to these and other possible interpretations. This course is mainly an exercise in close reading, but we will also think about the contexts for the writing and reception of this landmark work of Enlightenment social and political thought.

<P>LLSO 23313. Democracy and Equality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Democracy has often been celebrated (and often criticized) for expressing some kind of equality among citizens. This course will investigate a series of questions prompted by this supposed relationship between democracy and equality. Is democracy an important part of a just society? What institutions and practices does democracy require? Is equality a meaningful or important political ideal? If so, what kind of equality? Does democracy require some kind of equality, or vice-versa? The course will begin by studying classical arguments for democracy by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Stuart Mill, and then focus on contemporary approaches to these questions. The course will conclude with some treatment of current democratic controversies, potentially including issues of race and representation; the fair design of elections; the role of wealth in political processes; and the role of judicial review. The course aims to deepen participants' understanding of these and related issues, and to develop our abilities to engage in argument about moral and political life.

<P>LLSO 25110. Empire and International Justice. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How did European thinkers from 1492 onward understand and evaluate the extraordinary developments by which some European countries came to rule over much of the non-European world? This seminar examines theories of international justice and global relations from the early sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Philosophers, theologians, and political actors in this period responded to the key issues of global politics in the modern age, including the seizure of non-European lands; the establishment of slavery and the slave trade; the religious and cultural conversion of colonized peoples; the emerging institutions and practices of global commerce; and the impact of these developments upon both European and non-European societies. Indeed, many dilemmas that confront citizens and states today about humanitarian intervention, national sovereignty, conquest and occupation, empire, and human rights in a global context have an intriguing and complex intellectual history. The readings are primary texts by influential thinkers from the period of the initial Spanish conquests of the Americas through the mid-nineteenth century, including Montesquieu, Diderot, Burke, Bentham, Adam Smith, Cugoano, Kant, Herder, Constant, Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx.

<P>The course will explore moral and political problems of racial justice and injustice. Topics may include antidiscrimination theory, the fair political representation of racial minorities, reparations for racial injustice, racial segregation, the use of racial preferences in various practices of selection, and the evaluation of practices of law enforcement and punishment. We will use reflections on particular problems such as these to inquire about the uses of racial concepts in political theory; the connections between racial justice and ostensibly more general conceptions of justice; and the connections between racial equality and other egalitarian ideals.

<P>LLSO 25206. Digital Culture: Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms, and the Web. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In contrast to print culture and electronic culture, yet embedded in them, contemporary digital culture engages us in human-computer systems empowered as media for mobile communication in the global network society. In our conjoined online and offline environments, we inhabit human-computer hybrids in which (for instance) we learn, imagine, communicate, pay attention, and experience affect. How can we understand and critique our theories, concepts, practices, and technologies of intelligence and information in relation to the capacities of these digital machines with which we co-evolve? For exploring this question, our case studies include comparing artificial and natural intelligences, as well as examining algorithms and their socio-political impacts, in current web functionalities such as search (Google) and social media (Facebook,Twitter).

<P>The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once observed: &quot;The main part of intellectual education is not the acquisition of facts but learning how to make facts live.&quot; This course concerns itself with the various ways people have striven to understand the American South, past and present. We will read fiction, autobiography, and history (including meditations on how to write history). Main themes of the course include the difference between historical scholarship and writing history in fictional form; the role of the author in each and consideration of the interstitial space of autobiography; the question of authorial authenticity; and the tension between contemporary demands for truthfulness and the rejection of &quot;truth."

<P>LLSO 25902. Contemporary African American Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the issues, actions, and arguments that comprise black politics today.Our specific task is to explore the question of how do African Americans currently engage in politics and political struggles in the United States. This analysis is rooted in a discussion of contemporary issues, including the election of the first African American president, Barack Obama, the emergence of the Movement for Black Lives, the exponential incarceration of black people, and the intersection of identities and the role black feminism in shaping the radical freedom tradition in black politics. Throughout the course we attempt to situate the politics of African Americans into the larger design we call American politics. Is there such a thing as black politics? If there is, what does it tell us more generally about American politics? Instructor(s): C. Cohen Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CRES 22150, PLSC 22150 </P>

<P>LLSO 26703. Political Parties in the United States. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Political parties are a central feature of American government. In this course we will explore their role in contemporary politics and learn about their development over the course of American history. We will start by asking the following questions: What is a political party? Why do we have a two-party system, and how did that system develop? We will then proceed to study shifts in party coalitions, parties' evolving structures, their role in policymaking, and trends in popular attitudes about parties. Although our primary empirical focus will be on parties in the United States, we will spend some time on comparative approaches to political parties. Instructor(s): R.

<P>LLSO 27100. Human Rights II: History and Theory. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is concerned with the theory and the historical evolution of the modern human rights regime. It discusses the emergence of a modern &quot;human rights&quot; culture as a product of the formation and expansion of the system of nation-states and the concurrent rise of value-driven social mobilizations. It proceeds to discuss human rights in two prevailing modalities. First, it explores rights as protection of the body and personhood and the modern, Western notion of individualism. Second, it inquires into rights as they affect groups (e.g., ethnicities and, potentially, transnational corporations) or states.

<P>LLSO 27101. Democracy and the Information Technology Revolution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The revolution in information technologies has serious implications for democratic societies. We concentrate, though not exclusively, on the United States. We look at which populations have the most access to technology-based information sources (the digital divide), and how individual and group identities are being forged online. We ask how is the responsiveness of government being affected, and how representative is the online community. Severe conflict over the tension between national security and individual privacy rights in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Ireland will be explored as well. We analyze both modern works (such as those by Turkle and Gilder) and the work of modern democratic theorists (such as Habermas). Instructor(s): M.

<P>LLSO 27950. The Declaration of Independence. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores important intellectual, political, philosophical, legal, economic, social, and religious contexts for the Declaration of Independence. We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke's Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine's Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson's drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (1650-1830, 1830-1940) This is a 2018-19 College Signature Course.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The purpose of the BA program in linguistics is to provide a solid, integrated introduction to the scientific study of language through course work in the core subdisciplines of linguistics, as well as to ensure that the student has a language background sufficient to provide a complement to the theoretical parts of the program and for an understanding of the complexities of human language. This program provides students with a general expertise in the field and prepares them for productive advanced study in linguistics. </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in linguistics may visit linguistics.uchicago.edu to learn about events and resources on and off campus and for links to information on employment opportunities. </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in linguistics. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The BA in linguistics requires thirteen courses, which fall into two categories: courses that provide expertise in linguistics and courses that ensure breadth of study in a non–Indo-European language. Students have flexibility to construct a course of study that accords with their interests, but their final tally of thirteen courses must include the following: </P>

<P>LING 20001 Introduction to Linguistics 100 LING 20101 Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology 100 LING 20201 Introduction to Syntax 100 LING 20301 Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics 100 Study of a non-Indo-European language </P>

<P>The language requirement is designed to ensure breadth of study in a non–Indo-European language. This requirement can be met in four different ways: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Registration in a three-quarter course in a non–Indo-European language on campus </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Examination credit in a non–Indo-European language for which the University offers placement examinations </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Registration for an intensive one-quarter course in the structure of a non–Indo-European language offered by a member of the linguistics faculty (or by another faculty member upon approval by the director of undergraduate studies) </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Completion of an approved intensive language program taken elsewhere for languages not offered or tested for at the University of Chicago. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Students who fulfill the non–Indo-European language requirement with fewer than three quarters of study must substitute elective courses for the language course quarters not taken. At least six electives for the major must be courses offered by the Department of Linguistics (i.e., courses whose numbers begin with LING). For any further electives, a student may petition the department to substitute a related course that does not have a LING number. </P>

<P>The complete list of available languages can be viewed at humanities.uchicago.edu/about/languagesuchicago. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements </P>

<P>LING 20001 Introduction to Linguistics 100 LING 20101 Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology (core course) 100 LING 20201 Introduction to Syntax (core course) 100 LING 20301 Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics (core course) 100 Nine courses from the following: 900 </P>

<P>0-3 courses in a non-Indo-European language * </P>

<P>6-9 Linguistics electives ** </P>

<P>Total Units 1300 </P>

<P>* Credit may be granted by examination. When any part of the language requirement is met by examination, the equivalent number of electives in linguistics must be substituted for quarter credit granted. With prior approval of the director of undergraduate studies, such electives may be taken in other departments. </P>

<P>** </P>

<P>A minimum of six must be courses with LING numbers. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All courses used to satisfy requirements for the major and minor must be taken for quality grades. With consent of the instructor, nonmajors may take linguistics courses for P/F grading. </P>

<P>NOTE: Students who entered the University prior to Autumn 2009 may choose to fulfill either the requirements stated here or those that were in place when they entered the University. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>In order to receive the degree in linguistics with honors, a student must write an honors essay. At the end of a student's third year, any student who has maintained a 3.0 or better overall GPA and a 3.5 or better GPA in linguistics courses may consult with the director of undergraduate studies about submitting an honors essay. The honors essay must be submitted by fifth week of the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. Complete guidelines and requirements for the honors essay can be obtained from the director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<P>Students wishing to write an honors essay are required to take two graduate-level courses (numbered 30000 or above) in areas most relevant to their thesis work, as determined in consultation with their adviser(s) and approved by the director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major with the consent of both program chairs. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Minor Program in Linguistics </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may complete a minor in linguistics. The minor in linguistics requires a total of seven courses, which must include three linguistics electives (courses whose numbers begin with LING) and the following four courses: </P>

Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades (not P/F), and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Linguistics Courses </P>

<P>LING 20001. Introduction to Linguistics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course offers a brief survey of how linguists analyze the structure and the use of language. Looking at the structure of language means understanding what phonemes, words, and sentences are, and how each language establishes principles for the combinations of these things and for their use; looking at the use of language means understanding the ways in which individuals and groups use language to declare their social identities and the ways in which languages can change over time. The overarching theme is understanding what varieties of language structure and use are found across the world's languages and cultures, and what limitations on this variety exist. Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,Winter </P>

<P>LING 20101. Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an introduction to the study of speech sounds and their patterning in the world's languages. The first half of the course focuses on how speech sounds are described with respect to their articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual structures. There are lab exercises both in phonetic transcription and in the acoustic analysis of speech sounds. The second half focuses on fundamental notions that have always been central to phonological analysis and that transcend differences between theoretical approaches: contrast, neutralization, natural classes, distinctive features, and basic phonological processes (e.g., assimilation). Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): LING 20001 </P>

<P>LING 20150. Language and Communication. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course can also be taken by students who are not majoring in Linguistics but are interested in learning something about the uniqueness of human language, spoken or signed. It covers a selection from the following topics: What is the position of spoken language in the usually multimodal forms of communication among humans? In what ways does spoken language differ from signed language? What features make spoken and signed language linguistic? What features distinguish linguistic means of communication from animal communication? How do humans communicate with animals? From an evolutionary point of view, how can we account for the fact that spoken language is the dominant mode of communication in all human communities around the world? Why cannot animals really communicate linguistically? What do the terms language &quot;acquisition&quot; and &quot;transmission&quot; really mean? What factors account for differences between &quot;language acquisition&quot; by children and by adults? Are children really perfect language learners? What factors bring about language evolution, including language speciation and the emergence of new language varieties? How did language evolve in mankind? This is a general education course without any prerequisites. It provides a necessary foundation to those working on language at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

<P>LING 20201. Introduction to Syntax. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an introduction to basic goals and methods of current syntactic theory through a detailed analysis of a range of phenomena, with emphasis on argumentation and empirical justification. Major topics include phrase structure and constituency, selection and subcategorization, argument structure, case, voice, expletives, and raising and control structures. Instructor(s): Chris Kennedy Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): LING 20001 </P>

<P>LING 20202. Advanced Syntax. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a continuation of Introduction to Syntax (LING 20201). We will discuss movement and agreement phenomena in a variety of constructions, based on selected readings from the primary literature, and data from a number of typologically diverse languages, such as Irish, Wolof, Chamorro, Kinande, Berber, West Germanic languages. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): LING 20201 </P>

<P>LING 20301. Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course familiarizes students with what it means to study meaning and use in natural language. By &quot;meaning&quot; we refer to the (for the most part, logical) content of words, constituents, and sentences (semantics), and by &quot;use&quot; we intend to capture how this content is implemented in discourse and what kinds of additional dimensions of meaning may then arise (pragmatics). Some of the core empirical phenomena that have to do with meaning are introduced: lexical (i.e., word) meaning, reference, quantification, logical inferencing, presupposition, implicature, context sensitivity, cross-linguistic variation, speech acts. Main course goals are not only to familiarize students with the basic topics in semantics and pragmatics but also to help them develop basic skills in semantic analysis and argumentation. Instructor(s): Itamar Francez Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): LING 20001 Equivalent Course(s): LING 30310 </P>

<P>LING 21000. Morphology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Looking at data from a wide range of languages, we will study the structure of words. We will consider the nature of the elements out of which words are built and the principles that govern their combination. The effects of word structure on syntax, semantics, and phonology will be examined. We will think critically about the concepts of morpheme, inflection, derivation, and indeed, the concept of word itself. Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): LING 20001 </P>

<P>LING 21310. Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An introduction to the comparative study of the Indo-European languages. We will survey the major branches of the Indo-European family and discuss various aspects of PIE grammar as it is currently reconstructed. Instructor(s): Yaroslav Gorbachov Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): LING 31310 </P>

<P>LING 21920. The Evolution of Language. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How did language emerge in the phylogeny of mankind? Was its evolution saltatory or gradual? Did it start late or early and then proceed in a protracted way? Was the emergence monogenetic or polygenetic? What were the ecological prerequisites for the evolution, with the direct ecology situated in the hominine species itself, and when did the prerequisites obtain? Did there ever emerge a language organ or is this a post-facto construct that can be interpreted as a consequence of the emergence of language itself? What function did language evolve to serve, to enhance thought processes or to facilitate rich communication? Are there modern &quot;fossils&quot; in the animal kingdom that can inform our scholarship on the subject matter? What does paleontology suggest? We will review some of the recent and older literature on these questions and more.

<P>LING 22750. Laboratory Phonology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is intended to provide a foundation for students to pursue the quantitative study of phonology in the context of human interaction, and of speech and perception in the context of language. Specifically, this course focuses on how to design, conduct, and analyze a phonological experiment. We will approach laboratory phonology from the perspectives of both the speaker and the listener, with each perspective constituting roughly half the course. In the process, we will gain and practice skills in experimental phonetic and psycholinguistic work, while testing aspects of current phonological theory. Instructor(s): Alan Yu Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): LING 32750 </P>

<P>LING 23115. Old Church Slavonic. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an introduction to the language of the oldest Slavic texts. It begins with a brief historical overview of the relationship of Old Church Slavonic to Common Slavic and the other Slavic languages. This is followed by a short outline of Old Church Slavonic inflectional morphology. The remainder of the course is spent in the reading and grammatical analysis of original texts in Cyrillic or Cyrillic transcription of the original Glagolitic. Equivalent Course(s): REES 23115, REES 33115, LING 35100 </P>

<P>Equivalent Course(s): LING 42010 </P>

<P>LING 23450. Language and Violence. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Language is generally associated with the abstract realm of thought, representation and expression, a realm that contrasts sharply with the material realm in which we tend to place violence. Language is furthermore often seen as antithetical to violence: violence is outburst that comes when the rational order of language fails. In fact, however, questions of language, and especially of speech, surface in every aspect of thinking about violence. Speech is a medium within which violence is performed, and is part of the modern machinery of war. It is also a medium through which systems of oppression and subordination are articulated and registered by groups and individuals, socially and psychically. Violence relies on speech for its justification, rationalization, and sustention. At the same time, the rawness of violence challenges our fundamental faith in the representational and expressive capacities of language, in both destructive and creative ways. This intensive reading seminar explores the relation between speech and violence through scholarly and literary texts from a variety of humanistic fields and traditions. Instructor(s): Itamar Francez Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>LING 23920. The Language of Deception and Humor. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will examine the language of deception and humor from a variety of perspectives: historical, developmental, neurological, and cross-cultural and in a variety of contexts: fiction, advertising, politics, courtship, and everyday conversation. We will focus on the (linguistic) knowledge and skills that underlie the use of humor and deception and on what sorts of things they are used to communicate. Instructor(s): Jason Riggle Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): SIGN 26030, LING 33920 </P>

<P>LING 26020. Truth. 100 Units. </P>

<P>One of the salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit,&quot; says the Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurt in his 1986 essay, 'On Bullshit.' Frankfurt distinguishes bullshit from lying, and argues that it is the more insidious of the two because it involves not an attempt to conceal the truth, but rather a failure to even care about the truth in the first place. But what exactly is truth, and why should we care so much about it? This course will begin with an examination of the fundamental role of a truth convention in meaning and communication, the way that such a convention makes bullshit possible, and the causes and consequences of bullshit. We will then turn to foundational questions about the nature of truth, criticisms of the value of truth and why they have had such appeal, and expressions of skepticism about the possibility of &quot;objective&quot; truth. Along the way, we will consider whether it makes sense for everyone to agree that something is the case and yet still be wrong; whether our claims to know certain things are always limited because they come from a particular perspective; paradoxes of truth and falsity and their relevance for scientific inquiry; and what value (if any) truth contributes to the well-lived life.

<P>Elementary Basque I-II-III </P>

<P>BASQ 12000. Elementary Basque I. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will be an approach to the puzzling language and culture that defines Basque people. A challenge for those who dare to learn a language different from any they have ever heard. A journey to the wonderful land of the Basques, full of enigmas, strong traditions, and peculiar customs that will be discovered through very dynamic activities, such as interactive presentations, brief dialogues, games. The aim of the course is to introduce students to the Basque language through the development of some basic written and conversational skills and through structural analysis. The instructor will propose real communicative situations that will encourage the students to learn the language for the purpose of visiting the Basque Country and being able to communicate in basic ways with Basque speakers. These are usually small classes where it is easy to get a lot of first-hand exposure to the language, and the instructor creates an enriching atmosphere full of entertaining activities and possibilities to hone all skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing-as well as gaining a good grasp of the structure of the language.

<P>BASQ 12100. Elementary Basque II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will be a continuation of Elementary Basque I, advancing the students' knowledge of grammatical structure and their receptive, expressive, and conversational skills. The module uses a task-based approach to learning Basque. By means of this methodology, the accumulation of task cycles promotes the acquirement of communicative goals. We will work on different tasks on each lesson, and the progressive build-up of those tasks will cause the gradual improvement of the students' communicative skills and overall fluency. By the end of the quarter the student should be able to produce grammatically accurate short texts in Basque, interact with speakers of Basque at a basic level while employing a variety of complex cases and tenses, understand a range of basic written and oral texts in Basque, and understand a range of cases and the differences between them. This is achieved by creating a motivating atmosphere where all the students want to take part in the activities, while the teacher guides them during their learning process, providing them with the vocabulary and grammar they need to reach these goals.

<P>BASQ 24700. Introduction to Basque Culture. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Straddling the border of southern France and northern Spain, the land of the Basques has long been home to a people who had no country of their own but have always viewed themselves as a nation. No one has ever been able to find their roots, and their peculiar language is not related to any other in the world, but they have managed to keep their mysterious identity alive, even if many other civilizations tried to blot it out. The aim of this course is to create real situations that will enable the students to learn the meaning of Basque culture. It will be a guided tour throughout Basque history and society. They will learn about the mysterious origins of the language; they will visit the most beautiful places of the Basque country; they will get to know and appreciate Basque traditions, gastronomy, music... and most importantly, they will be able to compare and constrast their own cultures and share their ideas during the lessons, creating an enriching atmosphere full of entertaining activities, such as listening to music, reading legends and tales, watching documentaries, and much more. This course will be conducted in English. It is not necessary to have prior knowledge of Basque language or culture to take this course. Instructor(s): Diana Palenzuela Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Undergraduate Programs </P>

<P>Four bachelor's degrees are available in the Department of Mathematics: the BA in mathematics, the BS in mathematics, the BS in applied mathematics, and the BS in mathematics with specialization in economics. Programs qualifying students for the degree of BA provide more elective freedom. Programs qualifying students for the degrees of BS require more emphasis in the physical sciences, while the BS in mathematics with specialization in economics has its own set of specialized courses with more electives in economics in place of electives in the physical sciences. All degree programs, whether qualifying students for a degree in mathematics or in applied mathematics, require fulfillment of the College's general education requirements. The general education sequence in the physical sciences must be selected from either first-year chemistry or first-year physics. </P>

<P>Except for the BS in mathematics with specialization in economics, each degree requires at least five courses outside mathematics (detailed descriptions follow for each degree). These courses must be within the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division (PSCD) or from Computational Neuroscience (CPNS). One of these courses must complete the three-quarter sequence in basic chemistry or basic physics. At least two of these courses must be from a single department and all must be chosen from among Astronomy (20000 or above), Chemistry, Computer Science (not including 10100, 10200, 11000, 11100, or 11200), Physics (12000s or above), Geophysical Sciences, Statistics (22000 or above), CPNS, or Molecular Engineering. Graduate courses from these departments may also be used to fulfill these requirements. No courses from the Financial Mathematics program may be used in any of the undergraduate degree programs in mathematics. Please note in particular the different requirements outside of mathematics described below in the degree program for the BS in mathematics with specialization in economics. </P>

<P>Degree Programs in Mathematics </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in mathematics are required to complete: a 10000-level sequence in calculus (or to demonstrate equivalent competence on the calculus accreditation examination); either MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III or MATH 16310 Honors Calculus III (IBL) as the third quarter of the calculus sequence or MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis; the linear algebra course MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra; a three-quarter sequence in analysis (MATH 20300-20400-20500 Analysis in Rn I-II-III or MATH 20310-20410-20510 Analysis in Rn I (accelerated); Analysis in Rn II (accelerated); Analysis in Rn III (accelerated) or MATH 20700-20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn I-II-III); and one quarter of an algebra sequence (MATH 25400-25500 Basic Algebra I-II or MATH 25700-25800-25900 Honors Basic Algebra I-II-III). Students may not use both MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis and (MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III/MATH 16310 Honors Calculus III (IBL)) to meet major or minor requirements. For students whose first mathematics course at the University of Chicago is MATH 20700 Honors Analysis in Rn I, the MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis/MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III/MATH 16310 Honors Calculus III (IBL) requirement is waived. For students who complete MATH 20700 Honors Analysis in Rn I, the MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra requirement is waived, but the student must then take an additional course from the List of Approved Courses. </P>

<P>Candidates for the BA and BS in mathematics take at least one course in basic algebra. BA candidates may opt for the first quarter of either the regular or the honors sequence ( or MATH 25700-25800-25900 Honors Basic Algebra I-II-III), whereas candidates for the BS degree must take the first two quarters of one of the two sequences. MATH 25700-25800-25900 Honors Basic Algebra I-II-III is designated as an honors version of Basic Algebra. Registration for this course is the option of the individual student, but consultation with one of the departmental counselors is strongly advised. </P>

<P>The remaining mathematics courses needed in the programs (three for the BA, two for the BS) must be selected, with due regard for prerequisites, from the following list of approved mathematics courses. Note that STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability or STAT 25150 Introduction to Mathematical Probability-A also meet the requirement. BA candidates may include MATH 25500 Basic Algebra II or MATH 25800 Honors Basic Algebra II. Mathematics courses in the Paris Mathematics program each Spring Quarter may also be used to meet this requirement. </P>

<P>Degree Program in Mathematics with Specialization in Economics </P>

<P>This program is a version of the BS in mathematics. The BS degree is in mathematics with the designation &quot;with specialization in economics&quot; included on the final transcript. Candidates are required to complete a yearlong sequence in calculus, MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis if the calculus sequence did not terminate with MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III/MATH 16310 Honors Calculus III (IBL), the one-quarter course MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra, a yearlong sequence in analysis (MATH 20300-20400-20500 Analysis in Rn I-II-III or MATH 20310-20410-20510 Analysis in Rn I (accelerated); Analysis in Rn II (accelerated); Analysis in Rn III (accelerated) or MATH 20700-20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn I-II-III), and one quarter of abstract algebra (MATH 25400 Basic Algebra-1 or MATH 25700 Honors Basic Algebra I), and earn a grade of at least C– in each course. Students must also take STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability or STAT 25150 Introduction to Mathematical Probability-A. The remaining two mathematics courses must be among the following five: MATH 27000 Basic Complex Variables, MATH 27100 Measure and Integration, MATH 27200 Basic Functional Analysis, MATH 27300 Basic Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations, or MATH 23500 Markov Chains, Martingales, and Brownian Motion. A C average or higher must be earned in these two courses. </P>

<P>In addition to the third quarter of basic chemistry or basic physics, the eight courses required outside the Department of Mathematics must include STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods or STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I. The remaining seven courses should be in the Department of Economics and must include ECON 20000-20100-20200 The Elements of Economic Analysis I-II-III or ECON 20010-ECON 20110-ECON 20210 The Elements of Economic Analysis: Honors I-II-III and either ECON 20900 Econometrics: Honors or ECON 21000 Econometrics A. The remaining two courses may be chosen from any undergraduate economics course numbered higher than ECON 20210 The Elements of Economic Analysis III Honors. A University of Chicago Booth School of Business course may be considered for elective credit if the course requires the equivalent of ECON 20100 as a prerequisite and is numbered as a Chicago Booth 40000 or higher course. Additionally, the course needs to pertain to the application of economic theory to a course subject that is not offered by the Department of Economics. Courses such as accounting, investments, and entrepreneurship will not be considered for economics elective credit. Consideration for elective credit must be done by petition before a student registers for the course. There will be no retroactive consideration for credit. Students must earn a grade of C or higher in each course taken in economics to be eligible for this degree. </P>

<P>It is recommended that students considering graduate work in economics use some of their electives to include at least one programming course (CMSC 15100 Intro To Computer Science-1 is strongly recommended) and an additional course in statistics (STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II or STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia and STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II are appropriate two-quarter sequences). Students planning to apply to graduate economics programs are strongly encouraged to meet with one of the economics undergraduate program directors before the beginning of their third year. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Subject to College grading requirements and grading requirements for the major and with consent of instructor, students (except students who are majoring in mathematics or applied mathematics) may take any mathematics course beyond the second quarter of calculus for either a quality grade or for P/F grading. A Pass grade is given only for work of C- quality or higher. </P>

<P>All courses taken to meet requirements in the mathematics major must be taken for quality grades. A grade of C- or higher must be earned in each calculus, analysis, or algebra course; and an overall grade average of C or higher must be earned in the remaining mathematics courses that a student uses to meet requirements for the major. Students must earn a grade of C or higher in each course taken in economics for the degree in mathematics with a specialization in economics. Mathematics or applied mathematics students may take any 20000-level mathematics courses elected beyond program requirements for P/F grading. </P>

<P>Incompletes are given in the Department of Mathematics only to those students who have done some work of passing quality and who are unable to complete all the course work by the end of the quarter. Arrangements are made between the instructor and the student. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>The BA or BS with honors is awarded to students who, while meeting requirements for one of the mathematics degrees, also meet the following requirements: (1) a GPA of 3.25 or higher in mathematics courses and a 3.0 or higher overall; (2) no grade below C- and no grade of W in any mathematics course; (3) completion of at least one honors sequence (either MATH 20700-20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn I-II-III or MATH 25700-25800-25900 Honors Basic Algebra I-II-III) with grades of B- or higher in each quarter; and (4) completion with a grade of B- or higher of at least five mathematics courses chosen from the list that follows so that at least one course comes from each group (i.e., algebra, analysis, and topology). No course may be used to satisfy both requirement (3) and requirement (4). If both honors sequences are taken, one sequence may be used for requirement (3) and one sequence may be used for up to three of the five courses in requirement (4). </P>

<P>With departmental approval, MATH 29700 Proseminar in Mathematics, or any course(s) in the Paris Mathematics Program, may be chosen so that it falls in one of the three groups. One of the three Paris courses each year will be designated as a replacement for MATH 25500 Basic Algebra II for students wishing to complete the BS degree. Additionally, one of the three Paris courses each year will be designated as a replacement for MATH 25900 Honors Basic Algebra III for candidates who are working toward graduation with honors. Courses taken for the honors requirements (3) and (4) also may be counted toward courses taken to meet requirements for the major. Students who wish to be considered for honors should consult with one of the departmental counselors no later than Spring Quarter of their third year. </P>

<P>Minor Program in Mathematics </P>

<P>The minor in mathematics requires a total of six or seven courses in mathematics, depending on whether or not MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis, MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III or MATH 16310 Honors Calculus III (IBL) is required in another degree program. If it is not used elsewhere, MATH 15910 Introduction to Proofs in Analysis, MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III or MATH 16310 Honors Calculus III (IBL) must be included in the minor, for a total of seven courses. The remaining six courses must include the linear algebra course MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra, a three-course sequence in analysis MATH 20300-20400-20500 Analysis in Rn I-II-III or MATH 20310-20410-20510 Analysis in Rn I (accelerated); Analysis in Rn II (accelerated); Analysis in Rn III (accelerated) or MATH 20700-20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn I-II-III), and the first course in one of the algebra sequences (MATH 25400 Basic Algebra-1 or MATH 25700 Honors Basic Algebra I). The sixth course may be chosen from either the second course in one of the algebra sequences (MATH 25500 Basic Algebra II or MATH 25800 Honors Basic Algebra II) or a mathematics course numbered 23000 or higher chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies or one of the departmental counselors. A student who completes MATH 20700 Honors Analysis in Rn I is not obligated to take MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra, but should instead select another mathematics course numbered 23000 or higher. Under special circumstances and to avoid double counting, students may also use mathematics courses numbered 23000 or higher to substitute for up to two quarters of analysis or algebra, if these are required in another degree program. </P>

<P>No course in the minor can be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors; nor can it be counted toward general education requirements. Students must earn a grade of at least C- in each of the courses </P>

<P>in the mathematics minor. More than one-half of the requirements for a minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Students must meet with the director of undergraduate studies or one of the departmental counselors by Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete a minor program in mathematics and to obtain approval for the minor on a form obtained from their College adviser. Courses for the minor are chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies or one of the departmental counselors. </P>

<P>Paris Mathematics Program (http://study-abroad.uchicago.edu/programs/paris-mathematics) </P>

<P>Each Spring Quarter, the Department of Mathematics offers a study abroad opportunity for students to take upper-level mathematics electives at the University's Center in Paris. Departmental faculty offer three successive three-week courses in specialized topics, and students also take a French language course from local French faculty. Students should have completed one of the analysis sequences (MATH 20300-20400-20500 Analysis in Rn I-II-III or MATH 20310-20410-20510 Analysis in Rn I (accelerated); Analysis in Rn II (accelerated); Analysis in Rn III (accelerated) or MATH 20700-20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn I-II-III) and at least one quarter of one of the algebra sequences (MATH 25400 Basic Algebra-1 or MATH 25700 Honors Basic Algebra I) before attending the Paris program. First round applications are due the prior Spring Quarter and should be submitted to the Study Abroad office. If the program does not reach maximum capacity, second round applications will also be accepted in the Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>Joint Degree Programs </P>

<P>BA/MS or BS/MS in Mathematics Qualified College students may receive both a bachelor's and a master's degree in mathematics concurrently at the end of their studies in the College. Qualification consists of satisfying all requirements of each degree in mathematics. To be eligible for the joint program, a student must begin MATH 20700 Honors Analysis in Rn I in the Autumn Quarter of the student's first year. By following a program of prescribed undergraduate course sequences in mathematics and succeeding in all courses with grades no lower than A–, the student becomes eligible to enroll in graduate courses in mathematics in the student's third year. While only a few students complete the joint BA/MS program, many undergraduates enroll in graduate-level mathematics courses. Admission to all mathematics graduate courses requires prior written consent of the director or co-director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<P>Students should submit their application for the joint program to one of the departmental counselors as soon as possible, but no later than the Winter Quarter of their third year. </P>

<H3>Media Arts and Design </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64353">In the early twenty-first century, “design” is no longer a term used simply to describe surface aesthetics or ornamentation. Design, as a field, now encompasses a wide range of human interactions with the technologies, devices, environments, and communities that shape daily life. The largest company in the world (by market capitalization) is fundamentally a design company. Apple Inc.’s products inspire feelings of love and devotion (as well as frustration) with few rivals in any cultural sphere. Design is central to the company’s identity and success. A former Apple engineer observed that when a designer joined a meeting it was “like being in church when the priest walks in.” </P>

<P>Our current historical period, described by some as the “digital revolution” or a “postindustrial society,” relies heavily on media and design, which embed technologies increasingly within everyday life. If you consider the number of screens in your immediate vicinity, it becomes evident how substantial an impact media arts and design have on the ways we learn, work, and play. The design of screens (in their aesthetic, interactive, and technical dimensions) affects how we think, act, and communicate. Extraordinarily rapid developments have changed the character of contemporary life—in ways that remain largely opaque and demand ongoing study, critique, and experimentation. The University of Chicago is now in a position to establish new practice-based research that combines analytical and creative approaches to understanding these problems and to solving them. </P>

<P>ARTH 16709. Islamic Art &amp; Architecture, 1100-1500. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course surveys the art and architecture of the Islamic world from 1100-1500. In that period, political fragmentation into multiple principalities challenged a deeply rooted ideology of unity of the Islamic world. The courts of the various principalities competed not only in politics, but also in the patronage of architectural projects and of arts such as textiles, ceramics, woodwork, and the arts of the book. While focusing on the central Islamic lands, we will consider regional traditions from Spain to India and the importance for the arts of contacts with China and the West. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Urban Design. Instructor(s): P. Berlekamp Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. Equivalent Course(s): NEAA 10630, NEHC 16709 </P>

<P>FREN 21700. Le Roman De La Rose. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The mid-thirteenth-century Roman de la Rose was arguably the single most influential vernacular text of the (French) Middle Ages. A sprawling, encyclopedic summa composed by two separate authors writing some forty years apart, whether taken as a source of inspiration or an object of condemnation, the Roman de la Rose became an obligatory point of reference for generations of authors. Over the course of the quarter, we will read the conjoined text, each student focusing their reading through a critical optic of their choice (e.g., gender studies, animal studies, ethics and philosophy, reception studies, manuscript studies, etc.). Students will select and read ancillary texts to enrich their understanding of the Rose, and will collaborate with one another to chart a rich and diverse set of interpretive paths through this complex work. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 21700, GNSE 27300, FREN 31700 </P>

<P>FREN 23217. Merveilleux et vraisemblable du moyen âge au XVIIe siècle. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What if I told you that the real was imaginary and the imaginary was real? This course will explore the concepts of the marvelous, the imaginary, and the real through a selection of French literature from the Middle Ages to the 17th century. The Middle Ages are often perceived as a rigid feudal society. Yet, fairies abound in stories, people shape-shift, and objects magically transform under our eyes. In the 16th century truth appears to harden through advances in science, mathematics, and art. But simultaneously religious schisms, the discovery of the New World, and political anarchy shake the notion of the world's stable limits to the core. The 17th century is known for Descartes' rationalism and classical regularity. But even here there is the unexpected, the surprising je ne sais quoi and overwhelming ineffable. Through the literature of each era, we will see how reality often mixes with the marvelous and everything is not always as it seems. Instructor(s): E. Van Dyke Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): FREN 20500 Note(s): Taught in French. </P>

<P>HIST 22407. Medieval England. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How merry was &quot;Olde England&quot;? This course is intended as an introduction to the history of England from the withdrawal of the Roman legions in the early fifth century to the defeat of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in AD 1485. Sources will include chronicles, biographies, laws, charters, spiritual and political treatises, romances, and parodies. Themes will include the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity; the Viking and Norman invasions; the development of the monarchy and parliament; monastic, peasant, and town life; the role of literacy and education in the development of a peculiarly &quot;English&quot; society; and the place of devotion, art, and architecture in medieval English culture. Students will have the opportunity to do a research paper or craft a project of their choice based on the themes of the course. Instructor(s): R. Fulton Brown Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): HIST 32407 </P>

<P>ITAL 23900. Marsilio Ficino's &quot;On Love&quot; 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is first of all a close reading of Marsilio Ficino's seminal book On Love (first Latin edition De amore 1484; Ficino's own Italian translation 1544). Ficino's philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of the Renaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence on European culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato's Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino's text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione's The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo's Dialogues on Love, Tullia d'Aragona's On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo's canzoniere, Maurice Scève's Délie, and Fray Luis de León's Poesía. Instructor(s): A. Maggi Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Course taught in English. Equivalent Course(s): ITAL 33900, REMS 33900, CMLT 36701, FNDL 21103, CMLT 26701 </P>

<P>ITAL 26002. Philosophical Petrarchism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a close reading of Petrarch's Latin corpus. Readings include the Coronation Oration, The Secret, and selections from Remedies for Fortune Fair and Foul, On Illustrious Men, On Religious Leisure, and The Life of Solitude. Special attention is devoted to Petrarch's letter collections (Letters on Familiar Matters, Letters of Old Age, Book without a Name, etc.) and his invectives. The aim of the course is to familiarize the student with the new and complete Petrarch that emerged in 2004 on the occasion of the 700th anniversary of his birth. Discussion will focus on Petrarch's self-consciousness as the &quot;father of humanism,&quot; his relationship to Dante, autobiographism, dialogical inquiry, anti-scholasticism, patriotism, and Petrarch's &quot;civic&quot; reception in the Quattrocento as well as on a comparative evaluation of the nineteenth-century Petrarchs of Alfred Mézières, Georg Voigt, and Francesco De Sanctis. Equivalent Course(s): ITAL 36002, FNDL 25802 </P>

<P>ITAL 26401. Torquato Tasso. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course investigates the entire corpus of Torquato Tasso, the major Italian poet of the second half of the sixteenth century. We read in detail the Gerusalemme Liberata and Aminta, his two most famous works, in the context of their specific literary genre. We then spend some time examining the intricacies of his vast collection of lyric poetry, including passages from his poem &quot;Il mondo creato.&quot; We also consider some of his dialogues in prose that address essential issues of Renaissance culture, such as the theories of love, emblematic expression, and the meaning of friendship. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 26401, ITAL 36401 </P>

<P>NEAA 20522. Archaeology of Islamic Syria-Palestine. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an exploration of the cultural patterns in the Levant from the late Byzantine period down to modern times, a span of some 1500 years. While the subject matter is archaeological sites of this period in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel, the focus is on the role of medieval archaeology in amplifying the history of economic and social systems. It is this connective quality of Islamic archaeology that contributes to an understanding of the earlier history and archaeology of this region. Instructor(s): D.

<H3>Molecular Engineering </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64355">Department Website: http://ime.uchicago.edu/students/undergraduates </P>

<P>Engineering is the science of solving complex technological problems and, in the case of molecular engineering, using tools and concepts that arise from the fundamentals of science at the nanoscale. The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. </P>

<P>Institute for Molecular Engineering </P>

<P>The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) was founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. </P>

<P>Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well-established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. </P>

<P>Major Program in Molecular Engineering </P>

<P>The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Majors choose from three quantitative engineering tracks: one track aimed at engineering with a biology emphasis, a track with a focus on chemical and soft materials, and a track geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. </P>

<P>Courses in the major are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. </P>

<P>Major Program Requirements </P>

<L>
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.</Lbl>

<LBody> A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements as early in their academic sequence as possible and at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will better position students to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>As discussed in more detail below, there are three tracks for Molecular Engineering majors: the Biology Track, the Chemical and Soft Materials Track, and the Quantum Track. Students in the first two tracks will follow precedents set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the Quantum Track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. </LI>
</L>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.</Lbl>

<LBody> Three Molecular Engineering tracks. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, three distinct tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological engineering, another is aimed toward chemical and soft materials, and the other is aimed at preparing students for the engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. </LBody>

<LBody>MENG 29511-29512 Engineering Design I-II (200-unit capstone sequence) . This design course is a two-quarter sequence that teaches students how to combine fundamental science and engineering to solve open-ended problems, for example, analyzing the chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. Engineers from industry, the national laboratories, and academia, including IME </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>faculty and fellows, will propose real-world projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in small teams throughout the two quarters to address the diverse engineering challenges that arise. </P>

<P>For the 2018–19 academic year only, MENG 29500 Engineering Design will be offered in the Winter Quarter as an alternative capstone option. This intensive, 300-unit course covers many of the same principles as MENG 29511-29512 Engineering Design I-II, with an eye toward similar outcomes. MENG 29501 Undergraduate Research Colloquium will no longer be offered or required. The Molecular Engineering department recommends that majors take MENG 29511-29512 Engineering Design I-II rather than MENG 29500, unless their Autumn Quarter schedule makes doing so unfeasible. Students with questions should contact the adviser for Molecular Engineering as early as possible. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>5.</Lbl>

<LBody> Advanced electives (four required courses in the major). The major is structured to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisers. Not only can students choose between multiple tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisers, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6.</Lbl>

<LBody> Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences and Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101 Transport Phenomena I: Forces and Flows and MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7.</Lbl>

<LBody> Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in engineering education programs. Although there is no plan to seek ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (particularly emphasized in the Design sequence) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study in engineering, medicine, law, and business administration. </LBody>

<P id="LinkTarget_64357">Department Website: http://nelc.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Majors in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (NELC) at the University of Chicago pursue rigorous knowledge about a region of the world that is known as “the cradle of civilization” and the home of several important religious and cultural traditions, as well as one of the most important geopolitical areas of our contemporary world. NELC majors acquire languages; learn how archaeologists, economists, historians, linguists, literary scholars, and careful readers of legal, religious, economic, and other kinds of texts critically evaluate evidence; and acquire, largely in small class settings, analytical writing, thinking, and research skills that will help prepare them for a variety of careers. </P>

<P>Geographically centered on the Nile to Oxus and Danube to Indus region, NELC also embraces North Africa and Islamic Spain, as well as Central Asia and the Balkans in its ambit, from the early Bronze Age to the recent era of revolutions. Students can gain expertise in a wide variety of languages, including the living spoken tongues of the modern Middle East and Central Asia (Arabic, Armenian, modern Hebrew, Kazakh, Persian, Turkish, and Uzbek) or languages that open gateways onto the ancient past (Aramaic, Babylonian, Biblical Hebrew, Coptic, Egyptian Hieroglyphics, Elamite, Ge’ez, Hittite, Middle and Old Persian, Ottoman, Syriac, Ugaritic, etc.). </P>

<P>In an interdisciplinary area studies department like NELC, majors learn about the region through primary sources (material, oral, or textual) and scholarly analysis, structuring their curriculum around various disciplines and methodologies, including stratigraphy and paleobotany, comparative literature, cultural and civilizational studies, economics and numismatics, gender studies, history (economic, political, religious, and social), human rights, public policy, and digital humanities approaches. </P>

<P>Students who major in NELC learn one or more of the primary native languages as a means of access to the cultures of the ancient Near East and/or the modern Middle East. In consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, each student chooses an area of specialization and devises a program of study that provides a sound basis for graduate work in that area or for a career in business, education, government, journalism, law, museology, public policy, public service, or a variety of other disciplines and professions. </P>

<P>Major Requirements </P>

<P>Requirements for the NELC major are described below. The Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Department Coordinator are available to answer questions, discuss programs of study, and support students as they make their way through the major in NELC. Students are encouraged to track their progress through requirements by using our major worksheet (available on the department website (http://nelc.uchicago.edu/ undergraduate)). NELC strongly encourages students to study abroad if they are able. </P>

<P>Thirteen courses and a BA paper are required for a NELC major. </P>

<P>Note that the course sequence on “Archaeology of the Ancient Near East” does not fulfill the general </P>

<P>education requirement in civilization studies. All of the other NELC civilization sequences do fulfill the </P>

<P>general education requirement. If a Near Eastern civilization sequence is used to meet the College general </P>

<P>education requirement, a second Near Eastern civilization sequence is required for the NELC major. </P>

<P>+ Students who began taking Jewish Civilization courses prior to Autumn 2018 may continue to use the courses that previously satisfied the civilization studies requirement. See the Jewish Studies page for details. </P>

<P>** </P>

<P>Credit for language courses may not be granted by examination or petition. § These may consist of any NELC courses, including additional language courses, an additional civilization sequence, or NELC courses in areas such as archaeology, art, literature in translation, history, and religion. NEHC 29999 may be counted towards the elective requirement. Contact the NELC Director of Undergraduate Studies for questions about course requirements. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All courses used to meet requirements in the major must be taken for quality grades with the exception of the NEHC 29800 BA Paper Seminar, which is taken for P/F grading. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>As soon as they declare their major in NELC, students must consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies to plan their programs of study. In Autumn Quarter of their fourth year, all NELC students must see the Director of Undergraduate Studies with an updated degree program and transcript. </P>

<P>BA Paper </P>

<P>NELC majors are required to write a substantial BA paper during their fourth year. The BA paper should be an original academic paper/research project of approximately 30 to 50 pages. The BA paper provides majors the opportunity to develop research, writing, and presentation skills while working closely with a faculty adviser. The BA paper can be used in graduate school applications or as part of job application portfolios, and some recent NELC graduates have been able to publish their papers. The process of declaring a paper topic and choosing an adviser begins in the third year. </P>

<P>The timeline below assumes a Spring Quarter graduation. Students who expect to graduate in other quarters should consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </P>

<P>Year 3: Spring Quarter </P>

<P>NELC majors in their third year should discuss possible BA paper topics with NELC faculty members with whom they have worked or who have expertise in their topic. This may grow out of a paper written from a course or may be an entirely new project. </P>

<P>After choosing a topic and narrowing down its focus, students are responsible to request a member of the NELC faculty to serve as their research adviser, who will help them further conceive the scope and aims of the project and provide guidance about methods and sources for carrying out their research. Students must formally file their proposed BA paper topic with their faculty adviser’s signature in the NELC department office before the end of their third year (by Monday of tenth week of Spring Quarter). Forms to register the topic are available on our website (http://nelc.uchicago.edu/undergraduate). </P>

<P>Year 4: Autumn Quarter </P>

<P>Students are required to register for NEHC 29800 BA Paper Seminar in Autumn Quarter of their fourth year on a P/F basis. The BA Paper Seminar is a workshop course designed to survey the fields represented by NELC and to assist students in researching and writing their BA papers. The course is run by a BA preceptor, typically an advanced PhD student in NELC. Preceptors work closely with students and their faculty advisers to assist in all aspects of conceiving, researching, and writing. A passing grade (P) for the BA Paper Seminar depends on full attendance and participation throughout the quarter. </P>

<P>Year 4: Winter Quarter </P>

<P>NELC majors are strongly encouraged to register for an optional one-quarter independent study course NEHC 29999 BA Paper Preparation with their BA preceptor that will allow time in their schedules over Winter Quarter to write and revise their papers. Students will receive a quality grade for this course, equivalent to the final BA paper grade, reported in the Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>Year 4: Spring Quarter </P>

<P>The completed BA paper must be submitted to the Department Coordinator by Monday of third week in Spring Quarter. Students should submit two bound hard copies and one pdf of the paper. The Department Coordinator will distribute the BA papers to the faculty adviser. Students who fail to meet the deadline will not be eligible for honors and may not be able to graduate in that quarter. </P>

<P>The faculty adviser will grade the paper and submit grades and honors recommendations to the Director of Undergraduate Studies by Monday of fifth week in Spring Quarter. </P>

<P>Double Majors </P>

<P>Students taking a double major may, with the permission of the NELC Director of Undergraduate Studies, write a single BA paper that is designed to meet the requirements of both majors, provided that the faculty research adviser is a member of the NELC faculty. Approval from both program chairs is required. A consent form, to be signed by the chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student’s year of graduation. </P>

<P>Research Funding </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to begin the reading/research for the BA paper in the summer before their fourth year. Research grants are available to undergraduates. Please discuss the availability of grants with the Department Coordinator and/or Director of Undergraduate Studies early in the third year and visit the department website for updated information. </P>

<P>NELC is a participant in the PRISM program (https://careeradvancement.uchicago.edu/jobs-internshipsresearch/prism-grants) and majors are encouraged to apply for PRISM grants. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Students who complete their course work and their BA papers with distinction are considered for honors. To be eligible for honors, students must have an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher, they must have a NELC GPA of 3.5 or higher, and they must have earned a grade of A on the BA paper. </P>

<P>Prizes </P>

<P>The department awards the Justin Palmer Prize annually to the BA paper judged to be the most outstanding. The Director of Undergraduate Studies makes this determination in consultation with the department chair and faculty members. This monetary prize is made possible by a generous gift from the family of Justin Palmer, AB’04, who completed a minor in NELC. </P>

<P>Minor Program in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations </P>

<P>Students in the College with an interest in the languages and cultures of the Middle East or of the ancient Near East may pursue a minor in NELC. Completion of this minor certifies that your undergraduate course work at the University of Chicago has prepared you with language skills and cultural competency that can give you an advantage on the job market for a wide variety of careers—in business, in medicine or law, or in the public sector. </P>

<P>Students who wish to take a minor in NELC must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Students must submit the Consent to Complete a Minor Program (https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/ files/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf) form to their College adviser by the deadline above. The Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Department Coordinator are available to answer questions, discuss programs of study, and support students as they make their way through the minor in NELC. Students are encouraged to track their progress through requirements by using our minor worksheet, which can be found on our website (http://nelc.uchicago.edu/undergraduate). </P>

<P>Program Requirements for the Minor </P>

<P>Students may choose one of two tracks: language or culture. Both tracks require a two- or three-quarter NELC civilization sequence (see Major Requirements for more detail on civilization sequences). In addition, the Language Track requires three courses of one NELC language at any level. Students using a NELC sequence to satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies may seek approval from the department to substitute additional language course work in place of the civilization requirement in the minor. The Culture Track allows students to focus on topics such as archaeology, history, religion, or literature in translation and does not have a language requirement. </P>

<P>The six courses in the minor may not be double counted with a student's major(s) or with other minors, and they may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. </P>

<P>ARAB 10123. Summer Intensive Arabic Level 1. 300 Units. </P>

<P>Summer Intensive Arabic Level I is an eight-week course designed to introduce complete novices to the fundamentals of Arabic in the four language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). Classes are small and use the Alif Baa' and al-Kitaab textbook (2nd edition), supplemented by authentic materials, both to learn the language and to experience the culture. Cultural proficiency is an integral part of the language instruction (forms of address, youth phrases, phrases used among intimate friends,etc.). Students will spend 4-5 hours per day practicing using Arabic in classroom activities and should plan on studying an additional 3-4 hours most afternoons and evenings. In addition to class time, a full day trip to an Arab neighborhood in Chicago provides an opportunity to use Arabic in an authentic cultural context. Cultural exposure will also be supplemented through guest speakers, songs, and films. At the conclusion of the course, students can expect to have mastered the sounds and shapes of the Arabic alphabet and to be able to speak about themselves and their world in Modern Standard Arabic, as well as to engage in conversations about familiar topics with native speakers, to comprehend basic texts, and to use some common phrases in colloquial Egyptian and Shaami. After the eight-week course, students can expect to advance to the Intermediate Low level on the ACTFL scale. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Summer. Summer 2017 dates: 6/19/17-8/11/17 </P>

<P>NEAA 20002. Archaeology of the Ancient Near East II: Anatolia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Situated in the heart of the ancient Mediterranean, Anatolia lies at the crossroads of Mesopotamia, the Levant, Persia, Greece, and the Caucasus. Among Anatolia's mountains, plains, and rich river valleys, people first experimented with ideas like agriculture and monumental architecture that define human life around the world today. In this course, we will use the archaeological record to delve into the lives of the people of the hillside villages and magnificent cities of Anatolia, from the severed skull cult of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic and the regimented bureaucratization of the Late Chalcolithic, to the thousand gods of the Hittites and the mountain fortresses of Urartu. This material is well-suited for understanding the basis, in material flows and rhythms of daily life, of the development of religious and secular authority, large-scale violence, ideologies of domination, and resistance movements that played out again and again in the ever-changing cultural contexts of the region.

<P>NEHC 20019. Mesopotamian Law. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Ancient Mesopotamia--the home of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians who wrote in cuneiform script on durable clay tablets--was the locus of many of history's firsts. No development, however, may be as important as the formations of legal systems and legal principles revealed in contracts, trial records, and law collections (codes), among which The Laws of Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 BC) stands as most important for understanding the subsequent legal practice and thought of Mesopotamia's cultural heirs in the Middle East and Europe until today. This course will explore the rich source materials of the Laws and relevant judicial and administration documents (all in English translations) to investigate topics of legal, social, and economic practice, including family formation and dissolution, crime and punishment (sympathetic or talionic eye for an eye, pecuniary, corporal), and procedure (contracts, trials, ordeals).

<P>Is Islam a religion or a political ideology? What is sharī#a and what is sharī#a law? What do Muslims mean when they use terms like sharī#a, fiqh and Islamic law? Does Islamic law represent a challenge to the authority of the nation-state?&quot; In this course, we will examine all of these issues and more. In this course, we will approach Islamic law from three main angles, jurisprudence, substantive law, and the judiciary. The substantive areas of Islamic law to be covered include the following: ritual worship, family and personal status law, criminal law, contract law, constitutional &amp; international law. We will also be dealing with the challenges posed by the advent of modernity and colonialism to Muslims' understanding and practice of Islamic law. The course will combine readings in primary and secondary literature with case studies to illustrate the workings of Islamic law. The main textbooks will be Wael Hallaq's Introduction to Islamic Law and Knut Vikor's Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law. Supplemental readings will be provided from other works. Students will be required to write three 3-4 page response papers, take a midterm and a final exam. The final exam will comprise take home essay questions.

<P>NEHC 20215. Babylon and the Origins of Knowledge. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In 1946 the famed economist John Maynard Keynes declared that Isaac Newton &quot;was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians.&quot; We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, Ibn Khaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful and reverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in the historical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? How did the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge? And is it reasonable to draw, as Keynes did, a line that begins with Babylon and ends with Newton? In this course we will take a cross comparative approach, investigating the history of the ancient city and its continuity in the scientific imagination. Instructor(s): E.

<P>Egypt in Late Antiquity was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and religions. With the native Egyptians subject to a series of foreign masters (Greek and Roman), each with their own languages and religious practices, Egyptian society was marked by a rich and richly documented diversity. In this course we will pay special attention to the contact of languages and of religions, discussing on the basis of primary sources in translation different aspects characteristic of this period: the crises of the Roman Empire and their effects in Egypt, the emergence of Christianity and the decline of paganism, the development of monastic communities. The course will end at the Islamic conquest. Equivalent Course(s): CLCV 20216, CLAS 35716, HREL 30287, NEHC 30287 </P>

<P>This course will address the thousand-year evolvement of post-Biblical Judaism from a Temple and Land orientation to the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism. The first section of the course will focus on the political and cultural effects of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods on Jews and Judaism, with a stress placed not only on the social and political developments in Judea but on the early stages and subsequent growth of Jewish diaspora communities as well. In this context special attention will be given to the variegated literary corpus produced by Jews both in Judea and the diaspora. The second section will analyze the changes in Jewish life and self-identity in the aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70CE, and the gradual emergence of Rabbinic Judaism as an alternative expression of Jewish religious commitment. The Roman Empire's embracing of Christianity on the one hand, and the growing assertiveness of a Babylonian Rabbinic community on the other, will also be closely examined. Instructor(s): I.

<P>NEHC 20504. Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious, political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of texts continues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course, we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualize their ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt. Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient Near East. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along with representative selections from secondary literature. We will also spend some time thinking about the nature of biblical interpretation. Instructor(s): J.

In this course, we tackle these questions through an investigation of some the major scandals of the early modern and modern periods in both Europe and the Middle East. From courtroom dramas in Paris and London to fierce debates in coffee houses and newspapers in Cairo, Beirut, and Istanbul, this course offers a comparative view of how scandals were disseminated, received, and narrativized across time and space. In doing so, we will also examine the central role of the &quot;public&quot; both as a concept and as an actor in early modern and modern scandals. The course will also introduce students to a wide variety of primary sources as well as a rich literature on the subject. All readings are in English. No prior background on the subject is required.

<P>NEHC 20745. A Social History of the Poet in the Arab and Islamic World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What constitutes a poet? What role does a poet play in society? Can we think of poets as agents of change? If so, in what capacity? This course asks the student to consider the role of the poet in the shaping of Islamic history. The course traces the changing role of the poet and of poetry in Islamic history with a focus on Arabic poetry (in translation) in the early modern and modern Middle East and North Africa. From early modern mystical poets, to modern Arab nationalist poets, to the street poets of the Arab Spring, the course investigates the role and function of the poet as an agent of change and of poetry as a catalyst for the formation of collective identity. To do this the course also explores the variety of mediums through which poetry was transmitted and remembered. We will thus consider the role of orality, aurality, and memory in the creation, preservation, and transmission of poetry in the early modern and modern Arabic-speaking world.

<P>Late antiquity witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of peoples in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Vandals, Arabs, Goths, Huns, Franks, and Iranians, among numerous others, took shape as political communities within the Roman and Iranian empires or along their peripheries. Recent scholarship has undone the traditional image of these groups as previously undocumented communities of &quot;barbarians&quot; entering history. Ethnic communities emerge from the literature as political constructions dependent on the very malleability of identities, on specific acts of textual and artistic production, on particular religious traditions, and, not least, on the imperial or postimperial regimes sustaining their claims to sovereignty. The colloquium will debate the origin, nature, and roles of ethno-political identities and communities comparatively across West Asia, from the Western Mediterranean to the Eurasian steppes, on the basis of recent contributions. As a historiographical colloquium, the course will address the contemporary cultural and political concerns-especially nationalism-that have often shaped historical accounts of ethnogenesis in the period as well as bio-historical approaches-such as genetic history-that sometimes sit uneasily with the recent advances of historians.

<P>NEHC 20884. The Brighter Side of the Balkans: Humor &amp; Satire in Lit &amp; Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we examine the poetics of laughter in the Balkans. In order to do so, we introduce humor as both cultural and transnational. We unpack the multiple layers of cultural meaning in the logic of &quot;Balkan humor.&quot; We also examine the functions and mechanisms of laughter, both in terms of cultural specificity and general practice and theories of humor. Thus, the study of Balkan humor will help us elucidate the &quot;Balkan&quot; and the &quot;World,&quot; and will provide insight not only into cultural mores and social relations, but into the very notion of &quot;funny.&quot; Our own laughter in class will be the best measure of our success - both cultural and intellectual. Instructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Readings in English. Background in the Balkans will make the course easier, but is not required.

<P>This course investigates the complex relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western &quot;gaze&quot; for whose benefit the nations stage their quest for identity and their aspirations for recognition. We also think about differing models of masculinity, the figure of the gypsy as a metaphor for the national self in relation to the West, and the myths Balkans tell about themselves. We conclude by considering the role that the imperative to belong to Western Europe played in the Yugoslav wars of succession. Some possible texts/films are Ivo Andric, Bosnian Chronicle; Aleko Konstantinov, Baj Ganyo; Emir Kusturica, Underground; and Milcho Manchevski, Before the Rain. Instructor(s): A.

It looks at how the modern historiography of modern Middle Eastern studies shaped, and was shaped by, post-colonial studies, subaltern studies, and historical perceptions of urbanity, modernity, Orientlaism, and class. The class will pay heed to the fluid and constructed nature of Arab national culture, and the terminology used by Arab nationalists concerning &quot;nahda,&quot; &quot;revival,&quot; and &quot;rebirth.&quot; We will explore various &quot;golden ages&quot; Arab nationalists envisioned, like pre-Islamic Semitic empires, the first Islamic state under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad, the Ummayds, the Abbasids and Muslim Spain, as a way of analyzing the the constructed and temporal nature of national discourses. We will finally examine the distinction between Pan-Arab nationalism (qawmiyya), which considered Arab culture, history, and language as markers of one's national identity, and often strove for political unity with other Arab states; and territorial-patriotic nationalism (wataniyya), which hailed the national cultures of particular Arab states (Egyptian, Iraqi, Lebanese), focusing on their geography, archaeology, and history the key features of national identity.

<P>NEHC 21000. Before the Zodiac: Astronomy and Mathematics as Ancient Culture. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Taking as its central theme the cultural situatedness of the earliest systems of mathematics and astronomy-from their origins in ancient Mesopotamia (Iraq, c. 3400 BCE) until the Common Era (CE)-this course explores topics in mathematical language and script, metrology, geometry and topology, music theory, definitions of time, models of stars and planets, medical astrology, and pan-astronomical hermeneutics in literature and an ancient board game. Pushing against boundaries separating the humanities and social and physical sciences, students discover how histories of science and mathematics could be decisively shaped not merely by sensory experience or axiomatic definition, but also by ideas and imagery derived from the cultures, societies, and aesthetics of their day.

<P>NEHC 21010. The Age of Innovation - Famous Firsts 5,000 Years Ago. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The first man on moon&quot;, &quot;the first Thanksgiving,&quot; or &quot;the first kiss&quot;--our society is still fascinated and remembers the exact moment something happened for the first time. The history of the Ancient Near East, especially the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), is quite rich of such &quot;firsts in history.&quot; From the moment, writing is discovered there is an abundance of textual record, covering the first documents about politics, law, and economics. The first private documents allow us a glimpse into what living and dying were like more than 5,000 years ago. This course will explore what the cultural conditions of those innovations were, how innovations transform societies, and why it matters to study ancient civilizations. By discovering primary sources (in English translation), the fascination of reading those texts for the &quot;first&quot; time will be experienced. Visits at the Oriental Institute Museum will link textual record and object-based inquiry. Instructor(s): S. Paulus Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): SIGN 26016 </P>

<P>This course considers art and architecture patronized by the Seljuk, Mongol, and Timurid courts from Anatolia to Central Asia from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries. While the princes of these courts were of Turkic and/or Mongol origin, they adopted many of the cultural and artistic expectations of Perso-Islamicate court life. Further, many objects and monuments patronized by these courts belong to artistic histories variously shared with non-Islamic powers from the Byzantine Empire to China. Questions of how modern scholars have approached and categorized the arts and architecture of these courts will receive particular attention. Each student will write a historiographic review essay with a research component. Instructor(s): P. Berlekamp Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): NEHC 38002, ARTH 28002, ARTH 38002 </P>

Proud… This course provides insight into identity dynamics between the &quot;West,&quot; as the center of economic power and self-proclaimed normative humanity, and the &quot;Rest,&quot; as the poor, backward, volatile periphery. We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

<P id="LinkTarget_64358">Department Website: http://neuroscience.uchicago.edu/undergraduate </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Neuroscience is the study of neurons and neural systems and their outputs: sensation, perception, homeostasis, and behavior. Neural function is investigated at the levels of molecules, cells, circuits, organisms, and species, making neuroscience inherently multidisciplinary. In addition to established neuroscience career paths in academia, medicine, and the pharmaceutical industry, new careers for students of neuroscience are emerging in economics, software development, and other fields requiring &quot;big data&quot; analysis or a mechanistic understanding of how humans think. The course of study in the undergraduate major in neuroscience provides students with the background and skills appropriate for these diverse careers. </P>

<P>The University of Chicago offers a bachelor of arts (BA) degree and a bachelor of science (BS) degree in Neuroscience. The Neuroscience major is designed to accommodate students with the range of scientific variety that one finds at the professional level of neuroscience, including physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, biology, psychology, and medicine. Neuroscience faculty at the University of Chicago have expertise in all of these areas and are distributed across the Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and Physical Sciences Divisions. Majoring students have the opportunity to take a broad range of courses or to specialize in a particular area. </P>

<P>Declaring the Major </P>

<P>Students who wish to major in Neuroscience should declare the major in their second year. </P>

<P>(Because the Neuroscience major was introduced in the 2016–17 academic year, the Class of 2020 and subsequent classes can design a plan of study in Neuroscience from their first year. Students in the Class of 2019 may also be able to major in Neuroscience, depending on the courses they have already taken, although there is no way to guarantee this.) </P>

<P>General Education </P>

<P>Students majoring in Neuroscience typically begin their general education requirement in the biological sciences with BIOS 20186 Fundamentals of Cell and Molecular Biology. Attaining a proper grounding in cell biology is essential before delving into neuroscience as a discipline. To complete the requirement, students may choose to take one of the following: BIOS 20150 How Can We Understand the Biosphere?, BIOS 20151 Introduction to Quantitative Modeling in Biology (Basic), BIOS 20152 Introduction to Quantitative Modeling in Biology (Advanced), BIOS 20187 Fundamentals of Genetics, BIOS 20188 Fundamentals of Physiology, or BIOS 20191 Integrative Physiology. (Note: The general education requirement for the Neuroscience major can be fulfilled by courses in the Biology Fundamentals Sequences [BIOS 20186 to 20190] without the Biological Sciences prerequisites [BIOS 20150-20151/20152] unless a student pursues a double major in Biological Sciences. Students who choose this path will be expected to possess the competency in mathematical modeling of biological phenomena covered in BIOS 20151 or BIOS 20152.) </P>

<P>Two alternative paths to fulfilling the general education requirement in the biological sciences exist. (1) Neuroscience majors may petition to take the Pre-Med Sequence for Non-Biology majors. In this case, BIOS 20170 Microbial and Human Cell Biology and BIOS 20171 Human Genetics and Developmental Biology will satisfy the general education requirement in the biological sciences. (Note that BIOS 20171 must be taken concurrently with BIOS 20172 Mathematical Modeling for Pre-Med Students.) (2) A score of 4 or 5 on the AP Biology exam allows students to enter the Advanced Biology sequence in the Autumn Quarter of their first year. This three-quarter, lab-intensive sequence is for students with a strong background in research. Upon completion of the sequence students are awarded two credits, which satisfy the general education requirement in the biological sciences. </P>

<P>The Major </P>

<P>The basic degree in Neuroscience is the BA. A BS is awarded to students who complete an additional three quarters of Neuroscience electives, which must include one to three quarters of faculty-supervised research (scholarly or experimental) resulting in a written thesis (see Requirements for the Bachelor of Science Degree in Neuroscience below). </P>

<P>The major curriculum includes nine required Neuroscience courses, which provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Students must also take another 700 units of elective courses, offering broad exposure to the many aspects of neuroscience or tailored for depth in a particular area, such as cognitive neuroscience or machine learning. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To obtain honors in Neuroscience, students must have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major and a cumulative GPA of 3.25 at the point of entering the honors track, no later than the end of the third year. Only students who receive a BS will be eligible for honors. Entry into the honors track must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Students must do full-time paid experimental research over the summer between their third and fourth years (students accepted into the honors program will receive funding from the department). Students continue with part-time research effort for three quarters throughout their fourth year (NSCI 29200 Neuroscience Honors Thesis Research, NSCI 29201 Neuroscience Honors Thesis Research, NSCI 29202 Neuroscience Honors Thesis Research). As part of the research course work, honors students participate in regular group meetings in which they share their research with each other and supervising faculty, and receive guidance on formulating testable hypotheses, experimental design, report writing, and oral presentations. They also receive training in the responsible conduct of research. Experimental research may not be credited toward honors in more than one major. </P>

<P>Minor in Neuroscience </P>

<P>The minor in Neuroscience is intended to provide neuroscientific literacy for students whose primary interest lies in other fields.

<P>NSCI 20140. Sensation and Perception. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What we see and hear depends on energy that enters the eyes and ears, but what we actually experience-perception-follows from human neural responses. This course focuses on visual and auditory phenomena, including basic percepts (for example, acuity, brightness, color, loudness, pitch) and also more complex percepts such as movement and object recognition. Biological underpinnings of perception are an integral part of the course. Instructor(s): S. Shevell Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): PSYC 20700 </P>

<P>NSCI 20500. Neuroanatomy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is part of the Study Abroad Neuroscience program in Paris, France. In this course, we will use an understanding of development in order to understand the neuroanatomy of the adult vertebrate nervous system. This understanding will be solidified by dissections of mammalian, fish and bird brains as well as a trip to see myriad brains at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle. In the second half of the course, neuroanatomical adaptations specific to particular animals will be examined in the context of critical environmental and ecological factors. Examples include postural control in sloths, vision in marine animals and raptors, and the control of muscles of facial expression across mammalian species. Instructor(s): P.

This course will approach neuroethology from a modern evolutionary perspective, one that integrates findings from genomics, molecular developmental biology and paleontology with insights from neuroethology. Our exploration will include the controversies over the evolutionary origin of neurons and centralized brains, the independent solutions across taxa to processing ecologically important sensory information, and recent insights into the evolution of the neocortex. Instructor(s): C. Ragsdale Terms Offered: TBD. Paris Study Abroad Neuroscience Program Prerequisite(s): Enrollment into the Paris Study Abroad Program </P>

<P>NSCI 21000. Social Neuroscience. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Social species, by definition, create emergent organizations beyond the individual - structures ranging from dyads and families to groups and cultures. Social neuroscience is the interdisciplinary field devoted to the study of neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms, and to the study of the associations and influences between social and biological levels of organization. The course provides a valuable interdisciplinary framework for students in psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics, and comparative human development. Many aspects of social cognition will be examined, including but not limited to attachment, attraction, altruism, contagion, cooperation, competition, dominance, empathy, isolation, morality, and social decision-making. Instructor(s): J. Decety Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ECON 21830, PSYC 22350, CHDV 22350, BIOS 24137 </P>

<P>NSCI 21100. Photons to Consciousness: Cellular and Integrative Brain Functions. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course uses the visual system as a model to explore how the brain works. We begin by considering the physical properties of light. We then proceed to consider the mechanism of sensory transduction, cellular mechanisms of neuron to neuron communication, the operation of small neural networks, strategies of signal detection in neuron networks, and the hierarchical organization of cortical function. We conclude with visually guided behavior and consciousness. Instructor(s): E. Schwartz Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): NSCI 20110 Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 24136 </P>

<P>NSCI 21500. Epigenetics in Brain and Behavior. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Epigenetic mechanisms alter the function of the genome without altering the base sequence of genomic DNA (the As, Cs, Ts, and Gs we are familiar with), thus can be flexibly modified in response to the environment. Once considered a domain of cancer, we now recognize that epigenetic processes affect neurodevelopment, cognitive processes, mental disorders, and behavior. Through a combination of introductory lectures and student-led discussion of primary literature, we will explore a variety of epigenetic modifications, consider how they encode personal and transgenerational experiences, and examine how they influence brain function and behavior. Instructor(s): S. London Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): At least one course in cell, molecular, or systems biology is highly encouraged. Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 24134, PSYC 26665, CHDV 26665 </P>

<P>NSCI 21800. Perspectives in Drug Abuse. 100 Units. </P>

<P>It is a broad overview course about drug abuse, that is appropriate for graduate students as well as undergraduates. It includes lectures on epidemiology, genetics, neurobiology, experimental methods, policy and treatment, as well as lectures on several specific drug classes. Lectures are by Dr. de Wit and by other invited faculty members, and students are required to present and discuss recent published papers during classes. Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 24135, NURB 32900 </P>

<P>NSCI 22000. Gazing into the Black Box: Neocortex. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The neocortex is the multilayered outermost structure of the mammalian brain. It is the site of higher brain functions including reasoning and creativity. However, the complexity of the neocortex-it is comprised of ~20 billion neurons which have 0.15 quadrillion connections between them-seems to preclude any hope of achieving a fundamental understanding of the system. Recent technological innovations have opened novel avenues of investigation making realization of the neocortex an increasingly tractable problem. This course will place particular emphasis on how to critically read scientific papers as we evaluate and discuss current experimental approaches to the neocortex. Integral to this evaluation will be the detailed discussion of the latest technological approaches. Instructor(s): J. MacLean Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): NSCI 20110, 20120, 20130 or consent of instructor. For Biology majors: Three quarters of a Biological Sciences Fundamentals sequence. Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 24226, CPNS 34200 </P>

<P>NSCI 22100. Molecular Neuroscience. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This lecture/seminar course explores the application of modern cellular and molecular techniques to clarify basic questions in neurobiology. Topics include mechanisms of synaptic transmission, protein trafficking, exo- and endo-cytosis, and development and mechanisms of neurological diseases. Instructor(s): S. Sisodia Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): NSCI 20110, NSCI 20120 and BIOS 20200, or consent of instructor Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 24131 </P>

<P>NSCI 22300. Molecular Principles of Nervous System Development. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This elective course provides an overview of the fundamental questions in developmental neurobiology. It is based on primary research papers and highlights key discoveries in vertebrate and invertebrate animals that advanced our understanding of nervous system development. Topics covered, among others, will include neural stem cells, neuronal specification and terminal differentiation, and circuit assembly. Dogmas and current debates in developmental neurobiology will be discussed, aiming to promote critical thinking about the field. This advanced-level course is open to upper level undergraduate and graduate students and combines lectures, student presentations, and discussion sections. Instructor(s): E. Grove, P. Kratsios Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): For Neuroscience Majors: NSCI 20110, NSCI 20120, NSCI 20130, BIOS 20187 or consent of instructor Equivalent Course(s): CPNS 32300, NURB 32300, DVBI 32300 </P>

<P>NSCI 22400. Neuroscience of Seeing. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course focuses on the neural basis of vision, in the context of the following two questions: 1. How does the brain transform visual stimuli into neuronal responses? 2. How does the brain use visual information to guide behavior? The course covers signal transformation throughout the visual pathway, from retina to thalamus to cortex, and includes biophysical, anatomical, and computational studies of the visual system, psychophysics, and quantitative models of visual processing. This course is designed as an advanced neuroscience course for undergraduate and graduate students. The students are expected to have a general background in neurophysiology and neuroanatomy.

<P>Philosophy Undergraduate Wiki </P>

<P>https://wiki.uchicago.edu/display/phildr/Philosophy+Wiki+Home+Page </P>

<P>Email Lists </P>

<P>All majors and minors in philosophy should immediately subscribe to two Department of Philosophy email lists: philugs@lists.uchicago.edu and philosophy@lists.uchicago.edu. These lists are the department’s primary means of disseminating information on the undergraduate program, deadlines, prizes, fellowships, and events. Information on how to subscribe can be found here: https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/phildr/Philosophy +Email+Lists. </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Philosophy covers a wide range of historical periods and fields. The BA program in philosophy is intended to acquaint students with some of the classic texts of the discipline and with the different areas of inquiry, as well as to train students in rigorous methods of argument. In addition to the standard major, the department offers two tracks. The intensive track option is for qualified students interested in small group discussions of major philosophical problems and texts. The option in philosophy and allied fields is designed for students who wish to pursue an interdisciplinary program involving philosophy and some other field. All three options are described in the next section. </P>

<P>The course offerings described include both 20000-level courses (normally restricted to College students) and 30000-level courses (open to graduate students and advanced College students). There is room for a good deal of flexibility in individual planning of programs. Most of the requirements allow some choice among options. Course prerequisites may be relaxed with the consent of the instructor, and College students may take 40000- and 50000-level courses (normally restricted to graduate students) under special circumstances. Students should work out their program under the guidance of the director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Philosophy. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>All majors will be required to meet with the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies during Winter Quarter of their third year to review their program of study and discuss the possibility of writing the senior essay. </P>

<P>The Standard Major </P>

<P>The following basic requirements for the standard major in philosophy are intended to constitute a core philosophy curriculum and to provide some structure within an extremely varied collection of course offerings that changes from year to year. </P>

<P>The Department of Philosophy offers a three-quarter sequence in the history of philosophy (PHIL 25000 Ancient Philos/Hist Philos-1, PHIL 26000 History of Philosophy II: Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy, and PHIL 27000 History of Philosophy III: Kant and the 19th Century), which begins in the first quarter with ancient Greek philosophy and ends in the third quarter with nineteenth-century philosophy. Students are required to take two courses from this sequence (any two are acceptable) and are encouraged to take all three. Students are also encouraged to take these courses early in their program because they make an appropriate introduction to more advanced courses. </P>

<P>Students may bypass PHIL 20100 Elementary Logic for a more advanced course if they can demonstrate to the instructor that they are qualified to begin at a higher level. </P>

<P>Standard majors are welcome to apply to write senior essays. For more information, please see The Senior Essay (below). </P>

<P>Distribution </P>

<P>At least two courses in one of the following two fields and at least one course in the other field: (A) practical philosophy and (B) theoretical philosophy. </P>

<P>Courses that may be counted toward these requirements are indicated in the course descriptions by boldface letters in parentheses. Other courses may not be used to meet field distribution requirements. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements: Standard Major Two of the following: </P>

<P>PHIL 25000 Ancient Philos/Hist Philos-1 </P>

<P>Four additional courses in philosophy * 400 </P>

<P>Total Units 1000 </P>

<P>* These courses must be drawn from departmental offerings. Students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies regarding courses taken at other colleges. Only one of these courses may be satisfied by participation in the BA essay workshop. </P>

<P>The Intensive Track </P>

<P>Admission to the intensive track requires an application, which must be submitted by the middle of the Spring Quarter in the student's second year. The application form is on the department wiki (https:// coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/phildr/Philosophy+Undergraduate+Wiki). The director of undergraduate studies and the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies will have &quot;interview&quot; meetings following the application deadline. (The departmental website lists the office hours of the director of undergraduate studies and the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies.) </P>

<P>The intensive track is designed to acquaint students with the problems and methods of philosophy in more depth than is possible for students in the standard major. It differs from the standard program mainly by offering the opportunity to meet in the following very small discussion groups: the intensive track seminar in the Autumn Quarter of the third or fourth year (PHIL 29601 Intensive Track Seminar), PHIL 29200 Junior Tutorial, and PHIL 29300 Senior Tutorial. </P>

<P>Note on the pacing and scheduling of the intensive track: Intensive track majors take PHIL 29601 Intensive Track Seminar in Autumn Quarter of their third year. Students fulfill the tutorial requirement by selecting one junior tutorial (PHIL 29200) in any quarter of their third year and one senior tutorial (PHIL 29300) in any quarter of their fourth year. Finally, intensive track students must write a senior essay. The essay process includes participation in the Senior Seminar over the three quarters of their fourth year; students must register for PHIL 29901 Senior Seminar I and PHIL 29902 BA Essay Preparation,Senior Seminar II in two of these three quarters. </P>

<P>These courses must be drawn from departmental offerings. Students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies regarding courses taken at other colleges. </P>

<P>Philosophy and Allied Fields </P>

<P>This variant of the major is a specialist option for students with a clear and detailed picture of a coherent interdisciplinary course of study, not available under the standard forms of major and minor. Examples of recent programs devised by students electing this track are philosophy and mathematics, philosophy and biology, and philosophy and economics. Students in this program must meet the first three of the basic requirements for the standard major (a total of six courses) and take six additional courses that together constitute a coherent program; at least one of these six additional courses must be in the Department of Philosophy. Students must receive approval for the specific courses they choose to be used as the allied fields courses. Admission to philosophy and allied fields requires an application to the director of undergraduate studies, which should be made by the middle of Spring Quarter of their second year. To apply, students must submit a sample program of courses as well as a statement explaining the nature of the interdisciplinary area of study and the purpose of the proposed allied </P>

<P>fields program. Applicants must also have the agreement of a member of the Department of Philosophy to serve as their sponsor in the program. Interested students should consult with the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies before applying; for office hours and the application form, visit the departmental wiki (https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/phildr/Philosophy+Undergraduate+Wiki) or website. </P>

<P>* Only one of these courses may be satisfied by participation in the BA essay workshop. </P>

<P>The Senior Essay </P>

<P>Students who have been admitted to the intensive track are required to write a senior essay (also called the “BA essay”). Standard majors and philosophy and allied fields majors may also apply to write an essay. The proposal should be formulated in consultation with a faculty adviser who has expertise in the topic area. Potential advisers can be approached directly, but the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies can help pair students with suitable advisers as needed. BA essay applications are due middle of Spring Quarter. Applications are available from the shelves outside the Philosophy Department office (Stuart 202) as well as on the wiki (https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/phildr/Philosophy+Undergraduate+Wiki). </P>

<P>Students writing a BA essay in philosophy are normally expected to have maintained a GPA of 3.25 in their philosophy courses. A 3.25 is also the minimum GPA for departmental honors in philosophy. Students should submit, along with their application to write a BA essay, a record of their grades in the College. If a student who wishes to write a BA essay in philosophy has a GPA in philosophy courses below 3.25, the student should also submit a petition in writing to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </P>

<P>In their fourth year, students writing BA essays must participate in the senior seminar. The seminar runs all three quarters, and though attendance during all three is required, participants will only register for two of the three quarters. Students should register for PHIL 29901 Senior Seminar I in Autumn (or Winter) Quarter and for PHIL 29902 BA Essay Preparation,Senior Seminar II in Winter (or Spring) Quarter. These two courses are among the requirements for the intensive track. For essay writers who are in the standard track or the allied fields track, both courses must be taken; however, only PHIL 29902 will be counted toward the track's total-units requirement. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All courses for all tracks must be taken for a quality grade. The one exception is for students in the Intensive Track: PHIL 29901 is graded on a Pass/Fail basis. Accordingly, students in other tracks taking PHIL 29901-29902 will only be able to count PHIL 29902 in the major. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>The main requirement for honors is a senior essay of distinction. A GPA in the major of 3.25 or higher typically also is required. </P>

<P>Transfer Students </P>

<P>Requirements for students transferring to the University of Chicago are the same as for other students. Up to (but typically no more than) three courses from another institution may be counted toward major requirements. All such courses must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students should contact the director of undergraduate studies with questions concerning program plans, honors, and so forth. </P>

<P>Minor Program in Philosophy </P>

<P>The minor program in philosophy provides a basic introduction to some central figures and themes in both the history of philosophy and in current philosophical controversies. The minor requires six courses: students must take: either two courses from the history of philosophy sequence and one course from field A or field B, </P>

<P>along with three additional courses in philosophy; or one course from the history of philosophy sequence and one course from each of fields A and B, along with three additional courses in philosophy. </P>

<P>No courses in the minor can be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors; nor can they be counted toward general education requirements. They must be taken for quality grades. </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program should meet with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the program. The approval of the director of undergraduate studies for the minor should be submitted to the student's College adviser, on a form obtained from the College adviser, no later than the end of the student's third year. </P>

<P>Philosophy Courses </P>

<P>PHIL 20000. Introduction to Philosophy of Science. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An introductory exploration of some of the central questions in the philosophy of science. These will include: What is (the definition of) a science--such that the natural, formal, and social sciences all count as sciences, but (for example) philosophy and literary criticism do not? How, in the natural sciences, do theory-building and observation relate to each other? Can some of the sciences be reduced to other sciences? (What is reduction of this kind supposed to involve?) What is evidence? What are the old and new problems of induction? What is a scientific (or indeed any other form of) explanation? What is a law of nature? Do the sciences make real progress? </P>

<P>(B) Instructor(s): B. Callard Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>PHIL 20100. Elementary Logic. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An introduction to the concepts and principles of symbolic logic. We learn the syntax and semantics of truth-functional and first-order quantificational logic, and apply the resultant conceptual framework to the analysis of valid and invalid arguments, the structure of formal languages, and logical relations among sentences of ordinary discourse. Occasionally we will venture into topics in philosophy of language and philosophical logic, but our primary focus is on acquiring a facility with symbolic logic as such. Instructor(s): K. Davey Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Course not for field credit. Equivalent Course(s): CHSS 33500, HIPS 20700, PHIL 30000 </P>

<P>PHIL 20102. Changing, Resting, Living: Aristotle's Natural Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How can many things be one thing? Aristotle's answer to this question treats living things--plants and animals-as the paradigm cases of unified multiplicities. In this course, we will investigate how such things are held together and what makes it possible for them to change over time. Readings will be from Aristotle's Physics, Metaphysics, De Anima, Parts of Animals, On Generation and Corruption, and De Motu Animalium. (B) Instructor(s): A. Callard Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Students who are not enrolled by the start of term but wish to enroll must (a) email the instructor before the course begins and (b) attend the first class. Equivalent Course(s): CLCV 20118, CLAS 30118, PHIL 30102 </P>

<P>PHIL 20210. Kant's Ethics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will read, write, and think about Kant's ethics. After giving careful attention to the arguments in the Second Critique, portions of the Third Critique, the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, the Metaphysics of Morals, and several other primary texts, we will conclude by working through some contemporary neo-Kantian moral philosophy, paying close attention to work by Christine Korsgaard, David Velleman, Stephen Engstrom, and others. (A) (V) Instructor(s): B. Laurence Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): PHIL 30210, FNDL 20210 </P>

<P>PHIL 21000. Introduction To Ethics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we will read, write, and think about philosophical work meant to provide a systematic and foundational account of ethics. We will focus on close reading of two books, Immanuel Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism, along with a handful of more recent essays. Throughout, our aim will be to engage in serious thought about good and bad in our lives. (A) Instructor(s): C. Vogler Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 23107, HIPS 21000 </P>

<P>PHIL 21002. Human Rights: Philosophical Foundations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Human rights are claims of justice that hold merely in virtue of our shared humanity. In this course we will explore philosophical theories of this elementary and crucial form of justice. Among topics to be considered are the role that dignity and humanity play in grounding such rights, their relation to political and economic institutions, and the distinction between duties of justice and claims of charity or humanitarian aid. Finally we will consider the application of such theories to concrete, problematic and pressing problems, such as global poverty, torture and genocide. (A) (I) Instructor(s): B.

<P>PHIL 21600. Introduction to Political Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will investigate what it is for a society to be just. In what sense are the members of a just society equal? What freedoms does a just society protect? Must a just society be a democracy? What economic arrangements are compatible with justice? In the second portion of the course we will consider one pressing injustice in our society in light of our previous philosophical conclusions. Possible candidates include, but are not limited to, racial inequality, economic inequality, and gender hierarchy. Here our goal will be to combine our philosophical theories with empirical evidence in order to identify, diagnose, and effectively respond to actual injustice. (A) Instructor(s): B. Laurence Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): PLSC 22600, GNSE 21601, LLSO 22612 </P>

<P>PHIL 21620. The Problem of Evil. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Epicurus's old questions are yet unanswered. Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?&quot; (Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion) This course will consider the challenge posed by the existence of evil to the rationality of traditional theistic belief. Drawing on both classic and contemporary readings, we will analyze atheistic arguments from evil and attempts by theistic philosophers to construct &quot;theodicies&quot; and &quot;defenses&quot; in response to these arguments, including the &quot;free-will defense,&quot; &quot;soul-making theodicies,&quot; and &quot;suffering God theodicies.&quot; We will also consider critiques of such theodicies as philosophically confused, morally depraved, or both; and we will discuss the problem of divinely commanded or enacted evil (for example, the doctrine of hell). (A) Instructor(s): M. Kremer Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): RLST 23620 </P>

<P>PHIL 21720. Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will offer a close reading of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, one of the great works of ethics. Among the topics to be considered are: What is a good life? What is ethics? What is the relation between ethics and having a good life? What is it for reason to be practical? What is human excellence? What is the non-rational part of the human psyche like? How does it ever come to listen to reason? What is human happiness? What is the place of thought and of action in the happy life? (A) Instructor(s): J. Lear; G. Richardson Lear Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): This course is intended for Philosophy majors and for Fundamentals majors. Otherwise please seek permission to enroll. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 21908 </P>

<P>PHIL 21834. Self-Creation as a Literary and Philosophical Problem. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Can we choose who to be? We tend to feel that we have some ability to influence the kind of people we will become; but the phenomenon of 'self-creation' is fraught with paradox: creation ex nihilo, vicious circularity, infinite regress. In this course, we will read philosophical texts addressing these paradoxes against novels offering illustrations of self-creation. Instructor(s): A. Callard Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Students who are not enrolled by the start of term but wish to enroll must (a) email the instructor before the course begins and (b) attend the first class. Equivalent Course(s): SIGN 26001 </P>

<P>PHIL 21901. Feminist Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course is an introduction to the major varieties of philosophical feminism. After studying some key historical texts in the Western tradition (Wollstonecraft, Rousseau, J. S. Mill), we examine four types of contemporary philosophical feminism: Liberal Feminism (Susan Moller Okin, Martha Nussbaum), Radical Feminism (Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin), Difference Feminism (Carol Gilligan, Annette Baier, Nel Noddings), and Postmodern &quot;Queer&quot; Gender Theory and trans femism (Judith Butler, Michael Warner and others). After studying each of these approaches, we will focus on political and ethical problems of contemporary international feminism, asking how well each of the approaches addresses these problems. (A) Instructor(s): M. Nussbaum Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Undergraduates may enroll only with the permission of the instructor.

<P>PHIL 22001. Teaching Precollegiate Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will consider the practices of philosophy through a critical examination of different approaches to teaching precollegiate philosophy. Philosophy at the precollegiate level is common outside of the United States, and there is a growing movement in the U.S. to try to provide greater opportunities, in both public and private schools, for K-12 students to experience the joys of philosophizing. But what are the different options for teaching precollegiate philosophy and which are best? These are the main questions that this course will address. Students in this course will also have the opportunity to include an experiential learning component by participating in the UChicago Winning Words precollegiate philosophy program. (A) Instructor(s): B. Schultz Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): MAPH 32001 </P>

<P>PHIL 22209. Philosophies of Environmentalism and Sustainability. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Many of the toughest ethical and political challenges confronting the world today are related to environmental issues: for example, climate change, loss of biodiversity, the unsustainable use of natural resources, pollution, and other threats to the well-being of both present and future generations. Using both classic and contemporary works, this course will highlight some of the fundamental and unavoidable philosophical questions presented by such environmental issues. Can a plausible philosophical account of justice for future generations be developed? What counts as the ethical treatment of non-human animals? What do the terms &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;wilderness" mean, and can natural environments as such have moral and/or legal standing? What fundamental ethical and political perspectives inform such positions as ecofeminism, the &quot;Land Ethic,&quot; political ecology, ecojustice, and deep ecology? And does the environmental crisis confronting the world today demand new forms of ethical and political philosophizing and practice? Are we in the Anthropocene? Is &quot;adaptation&quot; the best strategy at this historical juncture? Field trips, guest speakers, and special projects will help us philosophize about the fate of the earth by connecting the local and the global. (A) Instructor(s): B.

<P>PHIL 22709. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics,Introduction to Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we examine some of the conceptual problems associated with quantum mechanics. We will critically discuss some common interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, the many-worlds interpretation, and Bohmian mechanics. We will also examine some implications of results in the foundations of quantum theory concerning non-locality, contextuality, and realism.,In this course we examine some of the conceptual problems associated with quantum mechanics.

<P>PHIL 23000. Intro:Metaphysics/Epistemology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will explore some of the central questions in epistemology and metaphysics. In epistemology, these questions will include: What is knowledge? What facts or states justify a belief? How can the threat of skepticism be adequately answered? How do we know what we (seem to) know about mathematics and morality? In metaphysics, these questions will include: What is time? What is the best account of personal identity across time? Do we have free will? We will also discuss how the construction of a theory of knowledge ought to relate to the construction of a metaphysical theory-roughly speaking, what comes first, epistemology or metaphysics? (B) Note(s): Students should register via discussion section. Instructor(s): B. Callard Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>PHIL 23205. Intro to Phenomenology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The aim of this course is to introduce students to one of the most important and influential traditions in the European Philosophy of the 20th Century: Phenomenology. The main task of this course will be to present Phenomenology's main concepts and the meaning of Phenomenology's transformations from Husserl to Heidegger, Sartre, Levinas and Henry. The fundamental credo of Phenomenology consists in the emphasis laid upon phenomena given to consciousness. This emphasis coincides with the &quot;return to things in themselves&quot; as formulated by Husserl. What can this kind of return actually mean? And what does this claim suggest about philosophical practices prior to phenomenology, idealism or empiricism? In what way, for Husserl, was classical philosophy not able to give access to things such as they are truly given? And what is the meaning of such idea of « givenness »? Does Phenomenology fall into the so-called « myth of the Given Note(s): Students should register via discussion section. Instructor(s): R. Moati Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>PHIL 24599. Introduction to Frege. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Gottlob Frege is often called the father of analytic philosophy, but the real reason to study him is not his historical significance, but, rather, that in his work one encounters a philosophical intelligence of the very first order. This course is an introductory survey of his most important ideas, in philosophy of mathematics, logic, philosophy of language, and metaphysics. To help us in our project of understanding and assessing these ideas we will read discussions of Frege by Michael Dummett, Tyler Burge, Joan Weiner, Nathan Salmon, Michael Resnik, Danielle Macbeth, Hans Sluga, Patricia Blanchette, John Searle, Crispin Wright, and others. (B) Instructor(s): B. Callard Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 24599 </P>

<P>PHIL 24800. Foucault and The History of Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course centers on a close reading of the first volume of Michel Foucault's &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, with some attention to his writings on the history of ancient conceptualizations of sex. How should a history of sexuality take into account scientific theories, social relations of power, and different experiences of the self? We discuss the contrasting descriptions and conceptions of sexual behavior before and after the emergence of a science of sexuality. Other writers influenced by and critical of Foucault are also discussed. Instructor(s): A. Davidson Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): One prior philosophy course is strongly recommended.

<P>PHIL 25000. Ancient Philos/Hist Philos-1. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An examination of ancient Greek philosophical texts that are foundational for Western philosophy, especially the work of Plato and Aristotle. Topics will include: the nature and possibility of knowledge and its role in human life; the nature of the soul; virtue; happiness and the human good. Instructor(s): G.

<P>PHIL 27000. History of Philosophy III: Kant and the 19th Century. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The philosophical ideas and methods of Immanuel Kant's &quot;critical&quot; philosophy set off a revolution that reverberated through 19th-century philosophy. We will trace the effects of this revolution and the responses to it, focusing on the changing conception of what philosophical ethics might hope to achieve. We will begin with a consideration of Kant's famous Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, in which the project of grounding all ethical obligations in the very idea of rational freedom is announced. We will then consider Hegel's radicalization of this project in his Philosophy of Right, which seeks to derive from the idea of rational freedom, not just formal constraints on right action, but a determinate, positive conception of what Hegel calls &quot;ethical life&quot;. We will conclude with an examination of three very different critics of the Kantian/Hegelian project in ethical theory: Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Instructor(s): M.

<P>PHIL 29411. Consequentialism from Bentham to Singer. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Are some acts wrong &quot;whatever the consequences&quot;? Do consequences matter when acting for the sake of duty, or virtue, or what is right? How do &quot;consequentialist&quot; ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, address such issues? This course will address these questions by critically examining some of the most provocative defenses of consequentialism in the history of philosophy, from the work of the classical utilitarians Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick to that of Peter Singer, one of the world's most influential living philosophers and the founder of the animal liberation and effective altruism movements. Does consequentialism lend itself to the Panoptical nightmares of the surveillance state, or can it be a force for a genuinely emancipatory ethics and politics? Instructor(s): B.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Physics is concerned with the study of matter, energy, forces, and their interaction in the world and universe around us. The undergraduate curriculum in the Department of Physics leading to the BA in physics includes a strong emphasis on experiment and covers the broad fundamentals necessary for graduate study in theoretical physics, experimental physics, or astronomy and astrophysics, as well as some fields of engineering and many interdisciplinary specialties requiring a strong technical background (e.g., biophysics, medical physics, atmospheric and environmental sciences). </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in physics. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Courses </P>

<P>The curriculum leading to the BA degree in physics is designed for maximum flexibility consistent with a thorough coverage of the essential principles of physics. Degree requirements include introductory and advanced physics and mathematics courses, as well as physics electives that allow students to pursue specific interests. </P>

<P>Students who plan to major in physics are encouraged to start course work in their first year. However, the program can be completed in three years, so one could start physics in the second year without delaying graduation. Two of the physics and two of the mathematics courses can be designated as general education courses, with sixteen courses remaining to fulfill the major. </P>

<P>In general, students should take the most advanced courses for which they have the appropriate prerequisites. Entering students will be given a placement for either PHYS 13100 Mechanics or PHYS 14100 Honors Mechanics based on their mathematics and physics background. Either course is appropriate for students planning to major (or minor) in physics. </P>

<P>Mathematics </P>

<P>The mathematics requirement is a calculus sequence (MATH 15100-MATH 15200-MATH 15300 or MATH 16100-MATH 16200-MATH 16300) followed by PHYS 22100. As an alternative to PHYS 22100, students taking an Analysis sequence (MATH 20300-MATH 20400-MATH 20500 or MATH 20700-MATH 20800-MATH 20900) may substitute MATH 20500 or MATH 20900 for PHYS 22100, though they will subsequently need to acquire certain math tools, as needed, on their own. However, students interested in pursuing further study in physics and mathematics should consider taking both PHYS 22100 and an Analysis sequence. </P>

<P>But please note that for students starting their program with the PHYS 13100-PHYS 13200-PHYS 13300 sequence, the MATH 15300/MATH 16300 requirement is replaced by PHYS 22000. This course in mathematical methods introduces tools typically used in the PHYS 14100-PHYS 14200-PHYS 14300 sequence, and ensures that a student taking PHYS 13100-PHYS 13200-PHYS 13300 will possess the mathematical background needed for subsequent physics course work. </P>

<P>Finally, entering students placing into MATH 13100 should consult the undergraduate program chair to plan a program of study. </P>

<P>Total Units: 1100 </P>

<P>In addition, three electives (selected from a list of approved courses) must be taken. In deciding when to take electives, students should be mindful of any course prerequisites. </P>

<P>The required laboratory sequence PHYS 21101-21102-21103 is a year-long study of experimental physics. It is recommended, but not required, that Experimental Physics be taken in the third year, concurrent with PHYS 23500. </P>

<P>Progress through the physics program can be accelerated by &quot;doubling up&quot; on some of the required courses. For example, PHYS 23500 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=PHYS%2023500) and PHYS 19700 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=PHYS%2019700) may be taken concurrently in the third year, and PHYS 22500 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=PHYS%2022500)/PHYS 22700 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=PHYS%2022700) may be concurrent with PHYS 18500 (http:// collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=PHYS%2018500)/PHYS 23400 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/? P=PHYS%2023400) in the second year. This provides more options in the third and fourth years for electives, as well as research or graduate course work. Note that it is possible to complete all program requirements in three years. </P>

<P>Finally, the sample programs shown here are only meant to be illustrative. Students are encouraged to speak with the departmental counselors in planning individual programs, especially regarding selection of mathematics courses and program electives. </P>

<P>Introductory Course </P>

<P>The introductory course for students in the physical sciences is divided into two variants—PHYS 13100PHYS 13200-PHYS 13300 and PHYS 14100-PHYS 14200-PHYS 14300—so students may learn with others who have comparable physics and mathematics backgrounds. The co-requisite for both is a first-year calculus sequence: MATH 15100-MATH 15200-MATH 15300 or MATH 16100-MATH 16200-MATH 16300 (or completion of MATH 13100-MATH 13200-MATH 13300). The essential physics content of these two sequences is the same, but the 140s sequence covers material at a higher mathematical level. Both PHYS 130s and PHYS 140s prepare students for further courses in the physics major or minor. </P>

<P>First-year students are assigned to either PHYS 13100 or PHYS 14100 based on Advanced Placement test scores. In addition, physics placement may be adjusted by consulting the undergraduate program chair (KPTC 205) during Orientation week. Transfer students who have satisfactorily completed calculus-based introductory physics courses at another university may be granted appropriate transfer credit upon petition to, and approval by, the program chair. </P>

<P>Another introductory sequence, PHYS 12100-PHYS 12200-PHYS 12300, is intended for students pursuing studies in biology or medicine. The prerequisite is two quarters of calculus and completion of general chemistry. While topics are similar to the 130s and 140s sequences, PHYS 120s cannot serve as a prerequisite for further courses in physics, and thus cannot be used for the physics major or minor. </P>

<P>A student who completes PHYS 14100 or PHYS 14200 with a grade below C is normally required to move to PHYS 13200 or PHYS 13300 the following quarter. Petitions for a waiver of this requirement must be presented to the undergraduate program chair before the second day of the succeeding course. A student who receives an A or A- in PHYS 13100 may petition the undergraduate program chair to move to PHYS 14200. </P>

<P>Advanced Placement </P>

<P>Students who took both Physics C Advanced Placement examinations prior to matriculation in the College may receive credit for PHYS 12100 and/or PHYS 12200. Consult the section on Advanced Placement Credit in this catalog for more information. </P>

<P>Accreditation </P>

<P>Accreditation examinations are administered for the content of PHYS 12100-PHYS 12200-PHYS 12300 and PHYS 14100-PHYS 14200-PHYS 14300. The first examination may be taken by incoming students only at the time of matriculation in the College. Students who pass the first examination (for PHYS 12100 or PHYS 14100) will receive credit for the lecture part of the course only and will then be invited to try the next examination of the sequence. All students who receive advanced standing on the basis of a physics accreditation examination are interviewed by the undergraduate program chair to determine the extent of their lab experience. Additional laboratory work may be required. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>All regular (non-research) physics courses must be taken for quality grades. All courses used to satisfy prerequisites must be taken for quality grades. The Department of Physics requires students to pass PHYS 13100PHYS 13200-PHYS 13300/PHYS 14100-PHYS 14200-PHYS 14300, PHYS 15400, PHYS 18500, and PHYS 23400 with an average of 2.0 or higher to continue in the program. </P>

<P>Opportunities for Participation in Research </P>

<P>The physics program offers unique opportunities for College students to become actively involved in the research being conducted by faculty of the department. Interested students are welcome to consult with the departmental counselors. The focus of much of the undergraduate research is structured around the Bachelor's Thesis (PHYS 29100-PHYS 29200-PHYS 29300). Alternatively, third- or fourth-year students majoring in physics may register for research for academic credit (PHYS 29700). In addition to these formal arrangements, students at any level may become involved in research by working in a faculty member's lab or research group on an extracurricular basis. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>There are two routes to receiving a BA with honors. Both require a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the courses listed under Major in the preceding Summary of Requirements section. In the first route, the student must register for PHYS 29100-PHYS 29200-PHYS 29300 and earn a grade of B or higher based on a bachelor's thesis describing an approved research project completed during the year. The second route to receiving a BA with honors is to pass an approved set of three graduate courses, with a grade of B or higher in each. One such set of courses is PHYS 34100-PHYS 34200 and PHYS 35200; however, other 30000-level courses may be used with approval from the program chair. </P>

<P>Degree Program in Physics with Specialization in Astrophysics </P>

<P>With the introduction of the major of Astronomy and Astrophysics in the 2018–19 academic year, the Physics Specialization in Astrophysics is being discontinued. Students who matriculated in Autumn Quarter 2017 or earlier may still complete the specialization with approval from the department. Students entering the College in Autumn Quarter 2018 or later and wish to pursue study in astrophysics should plan to major in Astronomy and Astrophysics. </P>

<P>The program leading to a BA in physics with a specialization in astrophysics is a variant of the BA in physics. The degree is in physics, with the designation &quot;with specialization in astrophysics&quot; included on the final transcript. Candidates are required to complete all requirements for the BA degree in physics, plus three courses in astrophysics (selected from ASTR 23900 Physics of Galaxies, ASTR 24100 The Physics of Stars, ASTR 24300 Cosmological Physics, ASTR 25400 Radiation Processes in Astrophysics, ASTR 28200 Current Topics in Astrophysics), or two courses in astrophysics plus a senior thesis project in physics (PHYS 29100-29200-29300 Bachelor's Thesis I-II-III) on a topic in astrophysics. If the latter option is chosen, the thesis topic must be approved by the program chair. (This thesis may simultaneously fulfill part of the requirements for honors in physics.) A grade of at least C- must be obtained in each course. </P>

<P>Minor Program in Physics </P>

<P>The minor in physics is designed to present a coherent program of study to students with a strong interest in physics but insufficient time to pursue the major. The courses required for the minor are: </P>

<P>The mathematics requirement for the minor is identical to the requirement for the major; please consult the description of the major for more information, particularly regarding PHYS 22000 and PHYS 22100. Note that PHYS 22000 and PHYS 22100 may be replaced by equivalent courses, as approved by the undergraduate program chair. Note also that the PHYS 13300/PHYS 14300, PHYS 22100, and MATH 15300/MATH 16300/PHYS 22000 requirements will be waived for those who must take these courses to satisfy the requirements of a major or another minor. Consequently, the number of courses needed for the minor will vary between five and eight. </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program in physics must meet with the physics undergraduate program chair before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. The approval of the program chair for the minor program should be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the College adviser. Courses for the minor are chosen in consultation with the program chair. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors and </P>

<P>(2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and students must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher in the minor. More than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<H3>Political Science </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64362">Department Website: http://political-science.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Political science is the study of governments, public policies, political processes, political behavior, and ideas about government and politics. Political scientists use both humanistic and scientific perspectives and a variety of methodological approaches to examine the political dynamics of all countries and regions of the world, both ancient and modern. Political science contributes to a liberal education by introducing students to concepts, methods, and knowledge that help them understand and judge politics within and among nations. A BA degree in political science can lead to a career in business, government, journalism, education, or nonprofit organizations; or it can lead to a PhD program in the social sciences or to professional school in law, business, public policy, or international relations. Our graduates have gone into all those areas in recent years. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Starting in the 2016–17 academic year, the Department of Political Science has abolished the list of &quot;preapproved&quot; petition courses. No course outside of Political Science taken in Summer 2016 or later will be automatically counted for the major; all must be petitioned to the department. Inclusion on the now-defunct pre-approved list does not guarantee future approval. </P>

<P>Course Requirements </P>

<P>The Political Science major requires twelve political science courses and a substantial paper. All students must take three out of the four courses that introduce the fields of political science. All students must also take the required research methods course. Students may meet the writing requirement by completing a BA Thesis or by writing a Long Paper. The BA Thesis and Long Paper options are explained below. </P>

<Sect>
<H6>Introductory Course Requirement </H6>

<P>To gain a broad understanding of political science, the department's faculty thinks students should take a wide range of courses. To ensure that breadth, students are required to take at least three of the following four courses: </P>

<P>PLSC 28701 Introduction to Political Theory </P>

<P>PLSC 28801 Introduction to American Politics </P>

<P>PLSC 28901 Introduction to Comparative Politics </P>

<P>PLSC 29000 Introduction to International Relations </P>

<P>Each course will be offered every year, introducing students to the four principal areas of study in political science. The introductory courses must be taken for quality grades. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Research Methods Requirement </H6>

<P>To prepare students to evaluate the materials in their classes and to write research papers, students are also required to take the department's research methods course, which will be offered every quarter: </P>

<P>PLSC 22913 The Practice of Social Science Research </P>

<P>The department also strongly recommends, but does not require, a course in statistics. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Political Science Course Requirement </H6>

<P>In addition to the above requirements, students are required to take six to eight Political Science courses of their choosing in order to develop their interests in and knowledge of the field. Those following the Long Paper path, described below, must complete eight courses while those on the BA Thesis path must complete at least six. It may be appropriate for advanced students to pursue an independent study credit (see below). Courses outside Political Science may be considered for the major only by petition. (Please submit the General Petition form (http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) (college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-andpetitions) along with a copy of the course syllabus to Pick 406.) </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Writing Requirement: Two Options </H6>

<P>Students who are majoring in political science must write at least one substantial paper. There are two ways to meet this requirement, by writing a BA Thesis or by submitting a Long Paper. </P>

<P>Option 1: Long Paper </P>

<P>The Long Paper is typically a course paper. It may be written for either a professor in Political Science or a professor in another department whose course is accepted for Political Science credit. Students who write a Long Paper are not required to write a BA Thesis. Students submitting a Long Paper must bring an approval form to the departmental office signed by an instructor who verifies that the paper meets two requirements: (a) the </P>

<P>paper is twenty pages or longer, double-spaced (that is, approximately 5,000 words or longer); and (b) the paper received a grade of B or better (that is, a grade of B- or below does not meet the requirement). </P>

<P>The Long Paper might be: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>A class paper for any course used to meet the major's requirements. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>An extended version of a shorter paper written for a course. If a course requires a shorter paper, students may ask the instructor for permission to write a twenty-page paper instead. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Written for a course that did not require any papers. Students may ask the instructor for permission to write a twenty-page paper, either in place of another assignment, as an extra assignment, or as an ungraded assignment. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Written for a Political Science instructor after a course is completed. The student could either produce an entirely new paper or, with the instructor's permission, take a shorter assignment and turn it into a longer paper. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>If the paper is not a graded assignment for class, it still meets the department's requirement if the instructor attests that it merits a grade of B or better. Unless the paper is written for a graded class assignment, students must ask the instructor's permission to submit any such paper. </P>

<P>Students are responsible for obtaining an approval form (political-science.uchicago.edu/sites/politicalscience.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Long Paper Form.pdf) to verify the successful completion of the Long Paper from the department office and giving it to the relevant instructor. Please ask the instructor to sign the approval form and return it to the departmental office. The deadline for submitting the approval form (http:// political-science.uchicago.edu/sites/political-science.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Long%20Paper%20Form.pdf) and the paper is 4 p.m. on Friday of the second week of the quarter in which the student expects to graduate. Students should complete their paper before their final quarter; the approval form should be submitted to the departmental office as soon as the writing requirement is completed. </P>

<P>Option 2: BA Thesis </P>

<P>Writing a BA Thesis will meet the writing requirement in Political Science and may also qualify a student for consideration for honors; see sections below for more information. In either case, the paper is typically from thirty-five to fifty pages in length (the length of most scholarly articles in professional journals). It must receive a grade of B or higher. Students choose a suitable faculty member to supervise the research and writing. The deadline for submitting two copies of a BA Thesis to the departmental office is 4 p.m. on Friday of the fourth week of the quarter in which the student expects to graduate. </P>

<P>BA Colloquium. Students who choose to write a BA Thesis are required to enroll in PLSC 29800 BA Colloquium in the Spring Quarter of the third year and continue to attend the BA Colloquium in the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. The colloquium is designed to help students carry out their BA Thesis research and to offer feedback on their progress. Although the course meets over two quarters, it counts as a single course and has a single grade. The final grade for the colloquium is based on the student's contribution to the colloquium during both quarters. Students who write a BA Thesis must also enroll in PLSC 29900 BA Thesis Supervision for one quarter, normally Winter Quarter of fourth year (although enrollment may be in any quarter). </P>

<P>A few students each year study abroad in the Spring Quarter of third year or in the Autumn Quarter of the fourth year and also intend to complete the Political Science major by writing a BA Thesis. Students who study abroad in the Spring Quarter are not required to enroll in the BA Colloquium in the Spring Quarter, but are expected to enroll and participate in the BA Colloquium in the Autumn Quarter. Students who study abroad in the Autumn Quarter must enroll in the BA Colloquium in the previous Spring Quarter, but are not required to participate in the Autumn Quarter. </P>

<P>All students who intend to write a BA thesis must submit a proposal for the thesis by the end of Spring Quarter, regardless of residency. Students who are away from campus in the Spring Quarter should line up an adviser and discuss ideas about a thesis topic while they are abroad or even during the Winter Quarter before departure. The department has arranged the BA Thesis process so that students arrive back on campus for fourth year ready to execute the research for the thesis in the Autumn Quarter, rather than compressing research and writing both into the Winter Quarter. Students who will be abroad in Spring Quarter and unable to participate in the Spring BA Colloquium should contact the department's Undergraduate Studies office during the Winter Quarter to receive instructions about the preparations they should expect to make while they are away. </P>

<P>BA Thesis Supervision. During their fourth year, students who choose to write a BA Thesis must register with their BA Thesis faculty adviser for one quarter of PLSC 29900 BA Thesis Supervision. Students may also elect to take a second quarter of PLSC 29900 BA Thesis Supervision, which will count toward the twelve required courses. To enroll, students are required to submit the College Reading and Research Course Form, which is available from the College advisers. The final grade for the course will be based on the grade given the BA Thesis by the faculty adviser. Although most BA Theses are supervised by Political Science professors, the adviser need not be a member of the Department of Political Science. </P>

<P>Pass/Fail Courses </P>

<P>Courses that meet requirements for the major are normally taken for quality grades. The three required introductory courses must be taken for quality grades. However, students may take up to two courses in the major on a P/F basis. </P>

<P>Independent Study </P>

<P>Students with extensive course work in Political Science who wish to pursue more specialized topics that are not covered by regular courses have the option of registering for PLSC 29700 Independent Study, to be taken individually and supervised by a member of the Political Science faculty. Students must obtain the prior consent of the program director and the instructor, as well as submit the College Reading and Research Course Form that is available from their College adviser. The substance of the independent study may not be related to the BA Thesis or BA research, which is covered by PLSC 29900 BA Thesis Supervision. Only one PLSC 29700 Independent Study course may count toward requirements for the major. </P>

<P>Honors in the Major </P>

<P>Students who do exceptionally well in their course work and who write an outstanding BA Thesis are recommended for honors in the major. A student is eligible for honors if the GPA in the major is 3.6 or higher and the overall GPA is 3.0 or higher at the beginning of the quarter in which the student intends to graduate. Students who wish to be considered for honors are required to register for PLSC 29800 BA Colloquium and PLSC 29900 BA Thesis Supervision and to submit a BA Thesis. To graduate with department honors, then, a student must have both honors-level grades and a BA Thesis that receives honors. </P>

<P>Double Majors </P>

<P>Students who plan to double major may complete the Political Science requirements by either the BA Thesis option or the Long Paper option. Students who write the BA Thesis must attend the Political Science BA Colloquium even if the other major also requires attendance at its colloquium. A request to use a single BA Thesis for two majors requires the approval of both program directors on a form available from the student's College adviser or here (http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) (college.uchicago.edu/advising/formsand-petitions). </P>

<P>Courses Taken at Other Universities by Students Who Transfer to the University of Chicago </P>

<P>Student who transfer into the University of Chicago and wish to transfer courses into the major should see the Director of Undergraduate Studies soon after matriculation. The introductory course requirement and the research methods requirement cannot be satisfied by courses taken elsewhere, but courses may be counted </P>

<P>toward the major by petition (http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) (college.uchicago.edu/ advising/forms-and-petitions). </P>

<P>Becoming a Political Science Major </P>

<P>Most students declare a major at the end of the second year or beginning of the third. The department encourages students to try out the major even before declaring. To receive announcements about the program in the major and other information about the Department of Political Science, students should sign up for the undergraduate email list either in the departmental office or at https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/info/ugpolsall. </P>

<P>Political Science Courses for 2018-19 </P>

<P>PLSC 20235. Computing for Social Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 20235, SOCI 20235, SOCI 30235 </P>

<P>PLSC 20280. The Politics of Popular Sovereignty: Participation and Protest. 100 Units. </P>

<P>If government is of, by and for the people, what kinds of politics are possible? Certainly, politics will operate through established institutions such as elections and legislatures. But popular politics may also take other forms: petitions, social movements, protest in the streets, and cultural critique. These efforts often fail, sometimes dramatically, but they have also contributed to major social change including the abolition of slavery, the expansion of rights, and demands for new understandings of justice. This course will explore the history of popular politics within democratizing societies, the development of new forms of collective mobilization and technologies of political influence, and the changing relation of popular politics to formal political institutions. Instructor(s): E. Clemens Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 20280 </P>

<P>PLSC 21390. Philosophy of Poverty. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Global poverty is a human tragedy on a massive scale, and it poses one of the most daunting challenges to achieving a just global order. In recent decades, a significant number of philosophers have addressed this issue in new and profoundly important ways, overcoming the disciplinary limitations of narrowly economic or public policy oriented approaches. Recent theories of justice have provided both crucial conceptual clarifications of the very notion of 'poverty'-including new measures that are more informed by the voices of the global poor and better able to cover the full impact of poverty on human capabilities and welfare-and vital new theoretical frameworks for considering freedom from poverty as a basic human right and/or a demand of justice, both nationally and internationally. Moreover, these philosophers have pointed to concrete, practical steps, at both the level of institutional design and the level of individual ethical/political action, for effectively combating poverty and moving the world closer to justice. The readings covered in this course, from such philosophers as Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, David Graeber, and Martha Nussbaum, will reveal, not only the injustice of global poverty, but also what is to be done about it. Instructor(s): B. Schultz Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring Equivalent Course(s): PHIL 21390, HMRT 21390, PBPL 21390 </P>

<P>PLSC 21410. Advanced Theories of Gender and Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Zerilli: This course examines contemporary theories of sexuality, culture, and society. We then situate these theories in global and historical perspectives. Topics and issues are explored through theoretical, ethnographic, and popular film and video texts. Simon: Our itinerary in this coursewill be interdisciplinary, ranging from political theory to science studies. Topics for discussion will likely include: the gendering of reason and passion in the history of philosophy; the power, persistence, and flexibility of norms; the relationship between eros and other forms of desire; the division of labor and other economic tributaries to gendered experience; openings for and challenges to the political aspirations of sexual (and other) minorities; and the pressures exerted by technology on erotic life. Students will engage key concepts in the field, and will be encouraged to experiment with new ones. Instructor(s): L. Zerilli Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Completion of GNSE 10100-10200 and GNSE 28505 or 28605 or permission of instructor. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 30201, ENGL 21401, MAPH 36500, GNSE 31400, PLSC 31410, GNSE 21400 </P>

<P>PLSC 21505. Sex, Gender and War. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the sexed, gendered, and oftentimes racialized dimensions of war. With the rise of civil wars and the decrease of interstate or world wars, the nature of warfare has changed: wars are no longer being fought in battlefields, but neighborhoods; and combatants and civilians are no longer distinguishable. Additionally, over the last century, women's formal participation in armed groups and militaries has increased, challenging the traditional segregation of men and women into different roles during war. As such, this undergraduate seminar explores various dimensions of contemporary war, in order to understand how war is not only made possible, but is perpetuated and reinforced by sexed, gendered, and racialized inequalities. It draws from literature in armed conflict studies and gender studies, as well as from contemporary representations of gender and war in films and novels. The goals of the course are two-fold: to engage with the five themes of the course in order to understand, analyze, and interrogate the sexed, gendered, and racialized dimensions of war, and to develop critical writing skills for the social sciences. Instructor(s): A. Blair Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 21505 </P>

<P>PLSC 21820. Global Justice and the Ethics of Immigration. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines different theories of global justice and justice in migration that have been developed by political theorists since the 1980s. It explores urgent ethical questions in international affairs, with a particular focus on global poverty, global inequality and the ethics of immigration. Addressed questions will include the following: what does justice require at the global level? Does the very idea of global justice make sense? Are economic inequalities between countries morally objectionable and, if so, why? What do affluent countries (and their citizens) owe to less affluent countries (and their citizens)? Should states have a right to control their territorial borders? To what extent do they have a right to exclude immigrants? What are the obligations of states towards newly arrived immigrants? We will address these normative questions by reading and critically assessing important texts written by leading scholars within the field of political theory and applied ethics, including John Rawls, Charles Beitz, Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, Joseph Carens and many others.

<P>PLSC 22150. Contemporary African American Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the issues, actions, and arguments that comprise black politics today.Our specific task is to explore the question of how do African Americans currently engage in politics and political struggles in the United States. This analysis is rooted in a discussion of contemporary issues, including the election of the first African American president, Barack Obama, the emergence of the Movement for Black Lives, the exponential incarceration of black people, and the intersection of identities and the role black feminism in shaping the radical freedom tradition in black politics. Throughout the course we attempt to situate the politics of African Americans into the larger design we call American politics. Is there such a thing as black politics? If there is, what does it tell us more generally about American politics? Instructor(s): C. Cohen Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CRES 22150, LLSO 25902 </P>

<P>PLSC 22202. Philosophies of Environmentalism and Sustainability. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Many of the toughest ethical and political challenges confronting the world today are related to environmental issues: for example, climate change, loss of biodiversity, the unsustainable use of natural resources, pollution, and other threats to the well-being of both present and future generations. Using both classic and contemporary works, this course will highlight some of the fundamental and unavoidable philosophical questions presented by such environmental issues. Can a plausible philosophical account of justice for future generations be developed? What counts as the ethical treatment of non-human animals? What do the terms &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;wilderness" mean, and can natural environments as such have moral and/or legal standing? What fundamental ethical and political perspectives inform such positions as ecofeminism, the &quot;Land Ethic,&quot; political ecology, ecojustice, and deep ecology? And does the environmental crisis confronting the world today demand new forms of ethical and political philosophizing and practice? Are we in the Anthropocene? Is &quot;adaptation&quot; the best strategy at this historical juncture? Field trips, guest speakers, and special projects will help us philosophize about the fate of the earth by connecting the local and the global. (A) Instructor(s): B.

<P>PLSC 22600. Introduction to Political Philosophy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will investigate what it is for a society to be just. In what sense are the members of a just society equal? What freedoms does a just society protect? Must a just society be a democracy? What economic arrangements are compatible with justice? In the second portion of the course we will consider one pressing injustice in our society in light of our previous philosophical conclusions. Possible candidates include, but are not limited to, racial inequality, economic inequality, and gender hierarchy. Here our goal will be to combine our philosophical theories with empirical evidence in order to identify, diagnose, and effectively respond to actual injustice. (A) Instructor(s): B.

<P>PLSC 22700. Happiness. 100 Units. </P>

<P>From Plato to the present, notions of happiness have been at the core of heated debate in ethics and politics. Is happiness the ultimate good for human beings, the essence of the good life, or is morality somehow prior to it? Can it be achieved by all, or only by a fortunate few? These are some of the questions that this course engages, with the help of both classic and contemporary texts from philosophy, literature, and the social sciences. This course includes various video presentations and other materials stressing visual culture. (A) Instructor(s): B.

<P>PLSC 22819. Philosophy of Education. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What are the aims of education? Are they what they should be, for purposes of cultivating flourishing citizens of a liberal democracy? What are the biggest challenges-philosophical, political, cultural, and ethical-confronting educators today, in the U.S. and across the globe? How can philosophy help address these? In dealing with such questions, this course will provide an introductory overview of both the philosophy of education and various educational programs in philosophy, critically surveying a few of the leading ways in which philosophers past and present have framed the aims of education and the educational significance of philosophy. From Plato to the present, philosophers have contributed to articulating the aims of education and developing curricula to be used in various educational contexts, for diverse groups and educational levels. This course will draw on both classic and contemporary works, but considerable attention will be devoted to the work and legacy of philosopher/educator John Dewey, a founding figure at the University of Chicago and a crucial resource for educators concerned with cultivating critical thinking, creativity, character, and ethical reflection. The course will also feature field trips, distinguished guest speakers, and opportunities for experiential learning. (A) (B) Equivalent Course(s): PHIL 22819, MAPH 32819, CHDV 22819 </P>

<P>PLSC 22913. The Practice of Social Science Research. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is a first course in empirical research as it is practiced across a broad range of the social sciences, including political science. It is meant to enable critical evaluation of statements of fact and cause in discussions of the polity, economy, and society. One aim is to improve students' ability to produce original research, perhaps in course papers or a senior thesis. A second objective is to improve students' ability to evaluate claims made by others in scholarship, commentary, or public discourse. The specific research tools that the course develops are statistical, but the approach is more general. It will be useful as a guide to critical thinking whether the research to be evaluated, or to be done, is quantitative or not. Above all, the course seeks to demonstrate the use of empirical research in the service of an argument. Instructor(s): P. Conley Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,Winter </P>

<P>PLSC 23100. Democracy and the Information Technology Revolution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The revolution in information technologies has serious implications for democratic societies. We concentrate, though not exclusively, on the United States. We look at which populations have the most access to technology-based information sources (the digital divide), and how individual and group identities are being forged online. We ask how is the responsiveness of government being affected, and how representative is the online community. Severe conflict over the tension between national security and individual privacy rights in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Ireland will be explored as well. We analyze both modern works (such as those by Turkle and Gilder) and the work of modern democratic theorists (such as Habermas). Instructor(s): M.

<P>PLSC 23113. Black Feminism in a Transnational Perspective. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course surveys Black women's experiences living with and confronting state oppression around the across the Americas and the Caribbean. From the United States to Brazil, Black women experience similar patterns of political, social and economic inequality. Transnationally, racism, sexism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia, misogynoir, and classism affect the quality of life of Black women, particularly within nation-states with legacies of slavery and colonialism. This course takes a historical, social and theoretical look at the roots of this inequality and how Black women have chosen to respond to it locally and globally. This is not an introductory course on Feminist Theory. Some prior knowledge of first, second, and/or third wave feminism is expected.

<P>PLSC 23313. Democracy and Equality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Democracy has often been celebrated (and often criticized) for expressing some kind of equality among citizens. This course will investigate a series of questions prompted by this supposed relationship between democracy and equality. Is democracy an important part of a just society? What institutions and practices does democracy require? Is equality a meaningful or important political ideal? If so, what kind of equality? Does democracy require some kind of equality, or vice-versa? The course will begin by studying classical arguments for democracy by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Stuart Mill, and then focus on contemporary approaches to these questions. The course will conclude with some treatment of current democratic controversies, potentially including issues of race and representation; the fair design of elections; the role of wealth in political processes; and the role of judicial review. The course aims to deepen participants' understanding of these and related issues, and to develop our abilities to engage in argument about moral and political life.

<P>PLSC 24201. Liberalism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The post-war consensus on liberal democratic government can today seem under siege in Europe and the United States. Has liberalism run its course, its once revolutionary promise now dimmed by rising inequality, populist ideology, and perceived threats to national cultures? What newer, more persuasive liberalism might replace the managerial, economistic, instrumental model that we've inherited? This seminar explores a variety of answers to that question, arguing that the canonical replies may be stranger, the forgotten alternatives more compelling, and liberal thought far more variegated than liberalism's critics or defenders have recognized. Our eclectic respondents include F.A. Hayek, Judith Shklar, Bernard Williams, Susan Okin, Richard Rorty, and Nancy Rosenblum. We will also explore some surprisingly topical interventions by John Locke, Voltaire, Diderot, Condorcet, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Dewey, and José Ortega y Gasset.

<P>PLSC 25110. Empire and International Justice. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How did European thinkers from 1492 onward understand and evaluate the extraordinary developments by which some European countries came to rule over much of the non-European world? This seminar examines theories of international justice and global relations from the early sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Philosophers, theologians, and political actors in this period responded to the key issues of global politics in the modern age, including the seizure of non-European lands; the establishment of slavery and the slave trade; the religious and cultural conversion of colonized peoples; the emerging institutions and practices of global commerce; and the impact of these developments upon both European and non-European societies. Indeed, many dilemmas that confront citizens and states today about humanitarian intervention, national sovereignty, conquest and occupation, empire, and human rights in a global context have an intriguing and complex intellectual history. The readings are primary texts by influential thinkers from the period of the initial Spanish conquests of the Americas through the mid-nineteenth century, including Montesquieu, Diderot, Burke, Bentham, Adam Smith, Cugoano, Kant, Herder, Constant, Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx.

Topics may include antidiscrimination theory, the fair political representation of racial minorities, reparations for racial injustice, racial segregation, the use of racial preferences in various practices of selection, and the evaluation of practices of law enforcement and punishment. We will use reflections on particular problems such as these to inquire about the uses of racial concepts in political theory; the connections between racial justice and ostensibly more general conceptions of justice; and the connections between racial equality and other egalitarian ideals.

<P>PLSC 25501. Race and Imperialism in the 20th Century. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The turn of the 20th C. marked the legal sanctioning of Jim Crow segregation in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision while the Scramble for Africa only a decade earlier had inaugurated a new era of imperial expansion. For W.E.B. Du Bois and others, these confluences indicated a singularity about the global experience of race in the 20th C. Focusing on the period prior to WWII, this course is an effort at understanding this specificity through an engagement with the politicians, statesmen, activists, and intellectuals writing in the midst of &quot;the problem of the color line.&quot; The course exposes students to thinkers on both sides of the color line as we read Sir Frederick Lugard, the colonial administrator of Nigeria and a member of the League of Nations' Permanent Mandates Commission, alongside George Padmore, the anticolonialist of Trinidadian descent who played a central role in Ghana's independence movement. To further our insights, we engage recent commentary by scholars who have sought to understand the racial formations of the 20th C. The course aims are 1) to trace the processes-ideological, political, and economic-through which the Jim Crow color line became international and consider the reverberations of this internationalism, 2) to reexamine the crisis of WWI and the creation of the League of Nations in light of the &quot;problem of the color line,&quot; and 3) to trace the intellectual roots of a global anticolonial movement concerned with securing racial equality.

<P>PLSC 25818. Stoic Ethics Through Roman Eyes. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The major ideas of the Stoic school about virtue, appropriate action, emotion, and how to live in harmony with the rational structure of the universe are preserved in Greek only in fragmentary texts and incomplete summaries. But the Roman philosophers give us much more, and we will study closely a group of key texts from Cicero and Seneca, including Cicero's De Finibus book III, his Tusculan Disputations book IV, a group of Seneca's letters, and, finally, a short extract from Cicero's De Officiis, to get a sense of Stoic political thought. For fun we will also read a few letters of Cicero's where he makes it clear that he is unable to follow the Stoics in the crises of his own life. We will try to understand why Stoicism had such deep and wide influence at Rome, influencing statesmen, poets, and many others, and becoming so to speak the religion of the Roman world. (A) Instructor(s): M. Nussbaum Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Ability to read the material in Latin at a sufficiently high level, usually about two-three years at the college level.

<P>South Asia is one of the most complex, dynamic, and dangerous foreign policy environments in the world, encompassing decades of warfare in Afghanistan, the rise of India as a major power, instability in and around a nuclear-armed Pakistan, and Myanmar's tenuous opening to the world. This course will systematically explore the foreign policies of the region's states, extra-regional involvement and intervention by China, the United States, and Russia/Soviet Union, and the domestic politics and internal conflicts that have shaped international politics. It will combine international relations theory, detailed research on individual countries, and thematic topics (such as alliances, nuclear weapons, the domestic politics of security policy, international implications of insurgencies and coups, economic globalization, and the causes and prevention of interstate war), using a blend of lecture and discussion. Though the primary focus will be on India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, the course will also cover Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar. Instructor(s): P.

<P>PLSC 26152. A Right to Belong. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will seek to identify commonalities and disparities in the formal and informal ways in which we belong to political societies today, seeking to articulate how the formal and informal structures of inclusion mimic or contradict one another. Doing so should provide analytical opportunities to recognize the virtues and shortcomings of the institutional tools designed to guarantee the many pieces necessary to make belonging possible. Part of what this course seeks to accomplish is to support students in thinking about the commonalities between the many ways in which we belong, while avoiding the temptation of silver bullets and all-encompassing explanations. The end-goal is a more refined and informed approach to the topic, as well as the ability to articulate a cogent response to whether belonging should be understood as a human right or not. If belonging ought to be considered a human right, what kind of policies and international instruments are better suited to guarantee it?

It investigates the relationships between political and economic change in the processes of state-building, economic development, and national integration. The course begins by comparing the experience of early and late developing countries, which will provide students with a broad historical overview of market formation and state-building in Europe and will cover the legacies of the Ottoman empire, European colonialism, and the Mandate period in the Middle East. The course then explores topics such as: the failure of constitutional regimes and the role of the military, class formation and inequality, the conflict between Pan-Arabism and state-centered nationalisms, the role of political parties, revolutionary and Islamicist movements, labor migration and remittances, and political and economic liberalization in the 1990s.

<P>Political parties are a central feature of American government. In this course we will explore their role in contemporary politics and learn about their development over the course of American history. We will start by asking the following questions: What is a political party? Why do we have a two-party system, and how did that system develop? We will then proceed to study shifts in party coalitions, parties' evolving structures, their role in policymaking, and trends in popular attitudes about parties. Although our primary empirical focus will be on parties in the United States, we will spend some time on comparative approaches to political parties. Instructor(s): R.

<P>PLSC 26920. Freedom, Justice and Legitimacy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will explore two main questions, which are central to both contemporary political theory and political discourse: (1) how different concepts and conceptions of freedom ground different theories of social justice and political legitimacy and (2) how to understand the relationship between justice and legitimacy. To what extent are justice and legitimacy separate ideas? Does legitimacy require justice? Are just states necessarily legitimate? We will critically analyze and normatively assess how different contemporary theories have answered, whether explicitly or implicitly, such questions. The course will focus on five major contemporary theories: liberal-egalitarianism as represented by the work of John Rawls; libertarianism, as represented by the work of Robert Nozick, neo-Lockean theories as represented by the work of John Simmons, neo-republicanism as represented by the work of Philip Pettit, and neo-Kantian theories as represented by the work of Arthur Ripstein.

<P>This course is devoted to the idea of &quot;political theology&quot; that developed during the interwar period in twentieth-century Central Europe, specifically Germany's Weimar Republic. The course's agenda is set by Carl Schmitt, who claimed that both serious intellectual endeavors and political authority require extra-rational and transcendent foundations. Along with Schmitt's works from the period, such as Political Theology and the Concept of the Political, we read and discuss the related writings of perhaps his greatest interlocutor, Leo Strauss.

<P>PLSC 28006. Intro to Social Choice and Electoral Systems. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Voting procedures play an integral role in our lives as citizens by translating the preferences of people into collective outcomes. This course will evaluate these procedures mathematically, by considering the various properties that electoral systems may or may not satisfy. A classic example is Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which tells us that every electoral system must fail to satisfy one or more criteria of fairness or sensibility. We will examine this result and other legislative paradoxes, and learn why the choice of procedure is critical to our understanding of how &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; decisions can be made-and how we can distinguish a bad decision from a good one.

This course examines three approaches to self-knowledge: Buddhism, Psychoanalytic Theory, and Social Neuroscience. We will learn both the theories behind each approach and how they can foster deeper perspectives on our own condition. We will explore the nature of love, guilt, anxiety, and other emotions, the origins of morality, and the many biases in our cognition.

<P>PLSC 28901. Introduction to Comparative Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Why are some nations rich and others are poor? Why is inequality skyrocketing across the developed world? Why are some countries democratic and others are dictatorships, and what determines switching between regimes? Does democracy matter for health, wealth, and happiness? Why are some countries beset by civil violence and revolution whereas others are politically stable? Why do political parties organize themselves politically around ethnicity, language, religion, or ideology? This course explores these and other similar questions that lie at the core of comparative politics. Drawing on political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology, while utilizing a wealth of data and case studies of major countries, we will examine how power is exercised to shape and control political, cultural, and economic institutions and, in turn, how these institutions generate policies that affect what we learn, what we earn, how long we live, and even who we are. Instructor(s): B. Lessing Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>PLSC 29000. Introduction to International Relations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>PLSC 29411. Consequentialism from Bentham to Singer. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Are some acts wrong &quot;whatever the consequences&quot;? Do consequences matter when acting for the sake of duty, or virtue, or what is right? How do &quot;consequentialist&quot; ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, address such issues? This course will address these questions by critically examining some of the most provocative defenses of consequentialism in the history of philosophy, from the work of the classical utilitarians Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick to that of Peter Singer, one of the world's most influential living philosophers and the founder of the animal liberation and effective altruism movements. Does consequentialism lend itself to the Panoptical nightmares of the surveillance state, or can it be a force for a genuinely emancipatory ethics and politics? Instructor(s): B.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Psychology is the study of the mental states and processes that give rise to behavior. It seeks to understand the basic mechanisms and functions of perception, cognition, emotion, and attitudes in guiding behavior. Although it focuses on the level of the individual, individual behavior depends on the social relationships and structures in which people are embedded and the biological systems of which we are comprised. Thus, psychological study encompasses a broad set of topics that overlap with a number of disciplines across the social and biological sciences. The requirements of the major are designed to acquaint students with the research methods psychologists use and to provide a foundation of core knowledge covering the major areas of psychology. This broad foundation allows students to pursue a more advanced understanding of subfields related to their own particular interests and goals for the major. The program may serve as preparation for graduate work in psychology or related fields (e.g., neuroscience, education), as well as for students interested in careers in social work, public policy, business, or medicine. Students are encouraged to become actively engaged in research in the department and should consult with the director of undergraduate research about their interests as early as possible. </P>

<P>PSYC 21135. Zero to Infinity: The Psychology of Numbers. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Can monkeys do math? Are babies statistical experts? Will I ever be good at calculus? What are we born with and what do we learn? Before children are ever taught formal mathematics in a classroom, they are confronted with situations where they must use their intuitive understanding of numbers, geometry, and space to successfully navigate their environments. In this course we read and discuss both foundational and cutting-edge articles from neuroscience, cognitive science, education and psychology to understand how humans bridge this gap between the informal and formal mathematical worlds. In doing so, we will try to understand where numbers come from, a question that bridges several areas of psychology, including how humans build theories about the world and how language affects our thinking. We will also tackle questions such as: How do culture and varying social contexts affect numerical understanding? What do we know about gender differences in math achievement? How do stereotypes, prejudice, and math anxiety affect math performance? Instructor(s): D. Gibson Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): PSYC 20000 or Mind recommended. </P>

<P>PSYC 21510. Neuroscience of Communication. 100 Units. </P>

This course emphasizes the application of theory and research from the field of psychology to the realm of teaching and learning in contemporary classrooms. Course concepts will be grounded in empirical research and activities geared towards understanding the nuances and complexities of topics such as cognitive development (memory, attention, language), early assessment systems, standardized testing, &quot;mindset&quot;, &quot;grit&quot;, exercise/nutrition, emotion regulation, and more. Instructor(s): Kate O'Doherty Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>PSYC 23000. Cultural Psychology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of &quot;normal&quot; psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of &quot;culture&quot; and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning. Instructor(s): R. Shweder Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Undergraduates must be in third or fourth year.

We will discuss evidence for sharp capacity limits in an individual's ability to actively monitor and maintain information in an &quot;online&quot; mental state. Readings will be primarily based on original source articles from peer-reviewed journals, with a focus on behavioral and neural approaches for measuring and understanding these basic cognitive processes. Instructor(s): E. Awh, E. Vogel Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>PSYC 23860. Beyond Good and Evil: The Psychology of Morality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Morality is a mysterious and possibly uniquely human capacity that influences how we make decisions in a number of domains. In this course we will explore how and why human beings have the moral intuitions that they do and also where these intuitions come from-what about our moral intuitions are built in and how are these intuitions shaped by experience? To achieve these goals, we will discuss literature from developmental, social, and evolutionary psychology, as well as some literature from behavioral economics and experimental philosophy. We will briefly review the history of moral psychology, but spend the bulk of our time discussing contemporary debates and findings from research on moral psychology. Instructor(s): A. Shaw Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>PSYC 24055. The Psychological Foundations of Wisdom. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It's often used with a meaning more akin to &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;clever&quot;. Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom-how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy. Instructor(s): A.Henly, H. Nusbaum Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing. </P>

<P>PSYC 24133. Neuroscience of Seeing. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course focuses on the neural basis of vision, in the context of the following two questions: 1. How does the brain transform visual stimuli into neuronal responses? 2. How does the brain use visual information to guide behavior? The course covers signal transformation throughout the visual pathway, from retina to thalamus to cortex, and includes biophysical, anatomical, and computational studies of the visual system, psychophysics, and quantitative models of visual processing. This course is designed as an advanced neuroscience course for undergraduate and graduate students. The students are expected to have a general background in neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. Instructor(s): W. Wei, J. Maunsell, M. Sherman, S. Shevell Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): NSCI 20110 or BIOS 24110 or consent of instructor Equivalent Course(s): NSCI 22400, BIOS 24133 </P>

<P>PSYC 24231. Methods in Computational Neuroscience. 100 Units. </P>

<P>PSYC 24280. The Psychology and Neurobiology of Emotion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is emotion? How can we measure it? In this course we will trace this universal yet abstract concept through its evolutionary origins, biological underpinnings, and associations with other subjects in psychology. Topics include autonomic and neural correlates of emotions, features of negative and positive emotions, variation across methods of measurement, and the relationships to cognition, social behavior, culture, and health. This course emphasizes the study of interdisciplinary research and multilevel analysis, as well as critical evaluation of empirical research articles. Background experience in psychology and/or biology is encouraged but not required. Instructor(s): K. Faig Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>PSYC 25101. The Psychology of Decision Making. 100 Units. </P>

<P>We constantly make decisions, determine our preferences, and choose among alternatives. The importance of our decisions range from ordering a meal at a restaurant to choosing what college to attend. How do we make such decisions? What are the rules that guide us and the biases that shape our decisions? What determines our preferences? What impacts our willingness to take risks? In this course we consider how the way we go about gathering information affects our judgment, and how the way we frame problems affects our perceptions and shapes the solutions to problems. We learn what governs choice and the systematic way it deviates from normative rules. We consider how we think about the future and how we learn from the past. The course focuses on the psychology behind making decisions with implications for a wide range of areas such as public policy, law, and medicine. Instructor(s): B. Keysar Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year students only Note(s): It is recommended that students take this course before PSYC 25700 The Psychology of Negotiation. </P>

<P>PSYC 25120. Child Development and Public Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about &quot;what develops?&quot;, critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children's environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children's development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches. Instructor(s): A. Kalil Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Attendance on the first day of class is required or registration will be dropped. Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 25120, CHDV 25120 </P>

<P>PSYC 25280. The Psychology of Close Relationships. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an exploration of the psychology of close relationships. We will first examine various methodological issues in the study of close relationships before examining numerous different approaches to relational research. We will learn about a variety of close relationships- from intimate relationships to friendships to familial bonds. We will examine the development of interpersonal attraction, theories of love and relationship development, and common problems in relationships (jealousy, loneliness, conflict). In addition to discussing central topics in the study of close relationships, we will review empirical articles to understand how interpersonal relationships impact aspects such as our self-concept, health, and interactions with technology. Instructor(s): A. Barakzai Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>PSYC 25300. Social Context, Biology, and Health. 100 Units. </P>

<P>We take for granted our relationships with other people as fundamental. Yet when these connections are absent or disrupted, our minds and biology are likewise disrupted. Epidemiological studies have now clearly established a relationship between social isolation and both mental and physical health. This course adopts an integrative interdisciplinary approach that spans the biological to sociological levels of analysis to explore the interactions involved and possible mechanisms by which the social world gets under the skin to affect the mind, brain, biology, and health. Instructor(s): J. Cacioppo, M. McClintock, L. Waite Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing Equivalent Course(s): BPRO 23600 </P>

<P>PSYC 25700. The Psychology of Negotiation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Negotiation is ubiquitous in interpersonal interactions, from making plans for a trip with friends or family, to determining working conditions with an employer, to managing international conflicts. In this course we examine the structure of different negotiations and the psychology that governs the processes and outcomes of a negotiation. For instance, we consider the role of perceptions, expectations, intuitions, and biases. We evaluate the role of information processing, modes of communication, and power in influencing a negotiated outcome. We see how the psychology of trust, reciprocity, fairness, cooperation, and competition can affect our ability to benefit from an exchange or contribute to the escalation of conflict. To better understand the dynamics of the negotiation process, we learn both through engaging in a variety of negotiation role-plays and relating these experiences to research findings. Instructor(s): B. Keysar Terms Offered: Winter. Third- or fourth-year students only Note(s): It is recommended that students take PSYC 25101 The Psychology of Decision Making before this course, as it provides the conceptual foundations. </P>

<P>PSYC 25750. The Psychology and Neurobiology of Stress. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the topic of stress and its influence on behavior and neurobiology. Specifically, the course will discuss how factors such as age, gender, and social context interact to influence how we respond to stressors both physiologically and behaviorally. The course will also explore how stress influences mental and physical health. Instructor(s): G. Norman Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): This course does not meet the requirements for the Biological Sciences Major. Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 29271 </P>

<P>PSYC 25901. Psychology for Citizens. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will examine aspects of the psychology of judgment and decision making that are relevant to public life and citizenship. Judgment and decision making are involved when people evaluate information about electoral candidates or policy options, when they vote, and when they choose to behave in ways that affect the collective good. Topics considered in the course will include the following. (1) What is good for people? What do we know about happiness? Can/should happiness be a goal of public policy? (2) How do people evaluate information and make decisions? Why does public opinion remain so divided on so many issues? (3) How can people influence others and be influenced (e.g., by policy makers)? Beyond persuasion and coercion, what are more subtle means of influence? (4) How do individuals' behaviors affect the collective good? What do we know about pro-social behavior (e.g., altruism/charitable giving) and anti-social behavior (e.g., cheating)? (5) How do people perceive and get along with each other? What affects tolerance and intolerance? Instructor(s): W. Goldstein Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 26901 </P>

<P>PSYC 26350. Clinical Cognitive Neuroscience: Function and Dysfunction. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will examine the relationships between brain, behavior, and cognitive function/dysfunction. Initial lectures will consist of a general introduction to neuroanatomy, cortical organization and methods used by cognitive neuroscientists. These introductory lectures will be followed by lectures focusing on specific cognitive functions and dysfunctions (e.g., attention and neglect, memory and amnesia, language and aphasia etc). Emphasis will be placed on the consequences of specific forms of brain injuries. Classes will consist of lecture, discussions (within lecture), case studies and videos demonstrating impairment in the cognitive abilities outlined in lecture. Instructor(s): K. Krpan Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): 3rd and 4th year students only. </P>

<P>PSYC 26665. Epigenetics in Brain and Behavior. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Epigenetic mechanisms alter the function of the genome without altering the base sequence of genomic DNA (the As, Cs, Ts, and Gs we are familiar with), thus can be flexibly modified in response to the environment. Once considered a domain of cancer, we now recognize that epigenetic processes affect neurodevelopment, cognitive processes, mental disorders, and behavior. Through a combination of introductory lectures and student-led discussion of primary literature, we will explore a variety of epigenetic modifications, consider how they encode personal and transgenerational experiences, and examine how they influence brain function and behavior. Instructor(s): S. London Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): At least one course in cell, molecular, or systems biology is highly encouraged.

<P>PSYC 28810. From Fossils to Fermi's Paradox: Origin and Evolution of Intelligent Life. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course approaches Fermi's question, &quot;Are we alone in the universe?,&quot; in the light of recent evidence primarily from three fields: the history and evolution of life on Earth (paleontology), the meaning and evolution of complex signaling and intelligence (cognitive science), and the distribution, composition and conditions on planets and exoplanets (astronomy). We also review the history and parameters governing extrasolar detection and signaling. The aim of the course is to assess the interplay between convergence and contingency in evolution, the selective advantage of intelligence, and the existence and nature of life elsewhere in the universe - in order to better understand the meaning of human existence.

<P>PSYC 28850. The Biological Nature of Psychological Problems. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is based on the strong assumption that psychology is a biological science, albeit with elements of the social sciences. The course uses a combination of lectures and classroom discussion of primary and secondary source readings assigned for each class meeting. It presents a strong biological science perspective on individual differences in emotions, motivations, and cognitions that cause distress or interfere with adaptive life functioning, but does so in a non-stigmatizing manner. The course begins with a description and discussion of the nature of psychological problems. The course will survey what is known about the genetic, environmental, and epigenetic bases of such problems and the methods used to study genetic influences and gene-environment interactions. Next, students will review what is currently known about the neural and other biological mechanisms involved in maladaptive individual difference in emotion, motivation, and cognitive processes, with discussion of the methods of studying such mechanisms in humans and nonhumans. The pros and cons of the medical model of 'mental illness' will be discussed as the major contrast with the natural science view advocated by the instructor. Instructor(s): B.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>Public Policy Studies is a multidisciplinary major grounded in the social sciences, with substantial inputs from economics, sociology, political science, and law, among other disciplines. The major recognizes that public issues are not neatly contained within traditional disciplinary boundaries and that analysts possessing a broad range of social scientific understanding, quantitative expertise, and communication skills are well placed to contribute to improved public policies. Public Policy involves direct contact with policy problems, ensuring that academic speculations are well-informed and connected to real-world conditions. </P>

<P>The Public Policy Studies major strives to put analysis before advocacy, stressing that compelling policy analysis is a central component of effective advocacy. We aim to be open and helpful to students of all political persuasions and challenge students to rethink clichéd responses to policy problems. The program of study for the BA degree in Public Policy Studies is designed to introduce students to policy analysis and implementation, equip them to use quantitative and economic techniques and methods, train them in policy research, and give them a thorough grounding in one or more specific policy areas. </P>

<P>The program also encourages students to undertake an internship experience either during the academic year or during the summer: the course PBPL 29600 Internship: Public Policy offers academic credit for students completing an approved, policy-oriented internship. </P>

<P>Students with questions about meeting the requirements for the Public Policy Studies degree should contact the program administrator. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The suggested sequence described below is typical, but many other variations are possible. There is flexibility within the program regarding when required courses can be taken. </P>

<P>First and Second Years </P>

<P>During their first or second year, students should take two quarters of calculus plus STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods. </P>

<P>Many students take the following required three-quarter sequence in their second year, although sometimes students defer one or more of these courses until later years. Taking the courses in the same year is not required and the courses may be taken in any order. </P>

<P>Courses in an Area of Specialization </P>

<P>Students should identify their area of specialization and submit a proposal for their program of study to the program administrator by the end of Winter Quarter in their third year. Students are required to complete three substantive policy courses that make up a specialization in a public policy field. Students may meet the specialization requirement in one of two ways: (1) by taking three courses that thematically connect (e.g., courses in urban politics, urban economics, and urban society would count as an urban specialization; or courses in international relations, international finance, and history of the European Union might be an international specialty); or (2) by taking three courses beyond the introductory course in one discipline other than public policy (e.g., economics, political science, sociology, statistics). Courses that satisfy the area of specialization requirement do not have to be listed or cross-listed as public policy courses; however, these courses should involve a substantial policy component. Please see the Public Policy Studies website for examples of some specialization courses and to submit your own proposed specialization: pbpl.uchicago.edu/page/areasspecialization. </P>

<P>Research Practicum </P>

<P>Students must fulfill a two-quarter research program. One of the quarters must be drawn from a “Methods” course, and the other quarter must be drawn from a “Windows” course. Most students will fulfill this requirement through the two-quarter “practicum” sequence PBPL 26200-26300 Field Research Project in Public Policy I-II. The traditional practicum is designed to teach research methods (e.g., focus groups, community surveys, GIS mapping) in a hands-on way and provide a &quot;window&quot; from the ivory tower into the &quot;real world." Many of the practica in the past have involved collective work on a real-world policy problem with a community organization or government entity; see, for example, some final reports at https://pbpl.uchicago.edu/cprt. </P>

<P>Alternatives to the traditional two-quarter practicum PBPL 26200-26300 Field Research Project in Public Policy I-II can be drawn from the Methods and Windows courses listed below. A common option is the one-quarter practicum PBPL 26301 Field Research Project in Public Policy, which can count as a Methods or Windows course (or both, if taken twice). Students may petition the program director for permission to fulfill either their Methods or Windows requirement (or both) with courses that are not listed. </P>

<P>The Methods courses include: </P>

<P>PBPL 26301 Field Research Project in Public Policy PBPL 27040 Public Finance and Public Policy ENST 26433 Practicum in Environmental Management ENST 26444 Practicum in Campus Athletics and Environment ENST 27150 Urban Design with Nature ENST 27221 Sustainable Urbanism ENST 27325 Urban Ecology in the Calumet Region GEOG 28201 Intro to Geographic Information Systems PLSC 22913 The Practice of Social Science Research PPHA 34600 Program Evaluation PPHA 34810 Mixed Methods Approaches to Policy Research SOCI 20001 Sociological Methods SOCI 20112 Applications of Hierarchical Linear Models ENST 20500 Introduction to Population </P>

<P>The Windows courses include: </P>

<P>PBPL 26301 Field Research Project in Public Policy PBPL 24751 The Business of Non-Profits: The Evolving Social Sector PBPL 29404 Inequality, Household Finance, and Tax Policy CHDV 20305 Inequality in Urban Spaces ENST 26433 Practicum in Environmental Management ENST 26444 Practicum in Campus Athletics and Environment ENST 27150 Urban Design with Nature ENST 27221 Sustainable Urbanism </P>

<P>ENST 27325 Urban Ecology in the Calumet Region </P>

<P>GEOG 26800 Geography Issues in Housing and Community Development </P>

<P>SOCI 20140 Qualitative Field Methods </P>

<P>The research practicum is generally taken by students in their third year. Students who plan to study abroad in Winter or Spring Quarter of their third year may opt to complete the research practicum in their second or fourth year. One of the goals of the practicum requirement is to prepare students to write excellent BA papers, so generally it is best if the practicum can be completed before the fourth year. </P>

<P>Fourth Year </P>

<P>All students must write a BA paper in their fourth year. The process runs from Autumn through early Spring quarter. The composition of the project is supported by two required seminars taken with the same preceptor: PBPL 29800 BA Seminar: Public Policy I (credit) and PBPL 29801 BA Seminar: Public Policy II (no credit). PBPL 29800 BA Seminar: Public Policy I (credit) is a 100-unit course offered in Autumn and Winter. Students all participate in the same thesis process throughout the year, but only register for this course in one of those two quarters. In the other quarter, students will register for PBPL 29801. PBPL 29801 BA Seminar: Public Policy II (no credit) is a zero-unit course, meaning it has no impact on students’ course load for that quarter. Students may register for either seminar first and follow it with the other seminar in Winter quarter. </P>

<P>The instructor of the courses, the Public Policy Preceptor, serves as the first reader for student BA papers. Students are encouraged (though not required) to choose a faculty adviser as a second reader for the project. Outstanding BA papers can earn an honors designation, and a select few will be nominated for the Richard P. Taub BA Thesis Prize in Public Policy. In early April, fourth-year students present their BA papers at a Public Policy undergraduate research symposium. </P>

<P>In addition to the BA Seminar sequence students may take up to two quarters of PBPL 29900 BA Paper Preparation: Public Policy for elective credit. For most students, PBPL 29800 BA Seminar: Public Policy I (credit) and PBPL 29801 BA Seminar: Public Policy II (no credit) will prove sufficient for producing a satisfactory BA paper. </P>

<P>Public Policy Studies may accept a BA paper that also is being used to satisfy the requirements of a second major. Approval from both program chairs is required to submit one BA paper for two majors. The Dual Major/ One BA Petition Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/BA_Double_Major.pdf), to be signed by both program chairs, is required to be completed and returned to the College adviser at the start of Autumn Quarter of the student’s year of graduation. </P>

<P>Courses outside Public Policy </P>

<P>Many courses in related disciplines (e.g., Anthropology; Economics; History; Law, Letters, and Society; Political Science; Sociology; Biological Sciences) count toward the major when used as “specialization” courses. </P>

<P>Study Abroad </P>

<P>The University of Chicago’s Spring quarter Barcelona Public Policy program provides University of Chicago students with an opportunity to study comparative public policy in the exciting cultural and political capital of Catalonia in northeastern Spain. The program is designed to expose students to policymaking in a non-U.S. setting through a combination of courses and excursions that will allow students to learn how the political and policymaking system operates in other nations. The three-course Public Policy sequence will meet the requirement for three courses in an area of specialization within the Public Policy major (though students need not be Public Policy majors to participate in the program). In addition to the Public Policy sequence, participants take a fourth course in Spanish language. Students with sufficient knowledge of Catalan may substitute a Catalan language course in place of the Spanish language course. For more information, or to apply, visit the Study Abroad website (http://study-abroad.uchicago.edu/programs/barcelona-public-policy). </P>

<P>PBPL 20305. Inequality in Urban Spaces. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The problems confronting urban schools are bound to the social, economic, and political conditions of the urban environments in which schools reside. Thus, this course will explore social, economic, and political issues, with an emphasis on issues of race and class as they have affected the distribution of equal educational opportunities in urban schools. We will focus on the ways in which family, school, and neighborhood characteristics intersect to shape the divergent outcomes of low- and middle-income children residing with any given neighborhood. Students will tackle an important issue affecting the residents and schools in one Chicago neighborhood. This course is part of the College Course Cluster: Urban Design. Instructor(s): M.

<P>PBPL 21390. Philosophy of Poverty. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Global poverty is a human tragedy on a massive scale, and it poses one of the most daunting challenges to achieving a just global order. In recent decades, a significant number of philosophers have addressed this issue in new and profoundly important ways, overcoming the disciplinary limitations of narrowly economic or public policy oriented approaches. Recent theories of justice have provided both crucial conceptual clarifications of the very notion of 'poverty'-including new measures that are more informed by the voices of the global poor and better able to cover the full impact of poverty on human capabilities and welfare-and vital new theoretical frameworks for considering freedom from poverty as a basic human right and/or a demand of justice, both nationally and internationally. Moreover, these philosophers have pointed to concrete, practical steps, at both the level of institutional design and the level of individual ethical/political action, for effectively combating poverty and moving the world closer to justice. The readings covered in this course, from such philosophers as Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, David Graeber, and Martha Nussbaum, will reveal, not only the injustice of global poverty, but also what is to be done about it.

<P>PBPL 21425. Health in a Changing America: Social Context and Human Rights. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this interdisciplinary course, students will consider the social context of health and the social and political commitments necessary to protect health as a human right. We will analyze recent trends in population health, such as the obesity epidemic, the opioid crisis, and the large gaps in life expectancy between neighborhoods in urban centers. Using case studies, students will envision a human rights-based response to these and other health challenges. We will examine the ways that framing health as personal versus public responsibility is consequential for social policy.

<P>PBPL 21501. Environmental Justice. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The effects of environmental pollution are not evenly distributed and are more likely to be experienced by low-income and minority communities. The location of toxic waste sites (both manufacturing plants and dump sites), the persistence of brownfields locations, and a lack of parks and open space are some of the conditions that have led to an ongoing effort to expand the focus of environmental advocacy to the pursuit of equitable and just outcomes in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This course will examine the history of the environmental justice, the efforts to pursue more equitable outcomes, and the prospect for such efforts in the face of global challenges such as climate change. The course will include class visits to sites in Chicago where environmental justice efforts are being undertaken as well as speakers from environmental justice organizations.

<P>PBPL 22200. Public Policy Analysis. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course reviews and augments the basic tools of microeconomics developed in ECON 20000 and applies these tools to policy problems. We examine situations in which private markets are likely to produce unsatisfactory results, suggesting a potential rationale for government intervention. Our goal is to allow students to comprehend, develop, and respond to economics arguments when formulating or evaluating public policy. Instructor(s): J. Leitzel Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): PBPL 20000 or ECON 20000 Note(s): PBPL 22100-22200-22300 may be taken in any order.

<P>PBPL 22300. Policy Implementation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Good public policy has the potential to advance justice in society. However, once a policy or program is put in place, policymakers often face challenges in getting it carried out in the ways it was intended. This course explores some of the structural and cultural challenges that government and organizations face as they attempt to put policies into effect. Focusing on the United States, we will draw on organizational theory as well as case studies from education, policing, healthcare, and the corporate world in order to investigate the broader context of policy implementation. Instructor(s): S. Brophy Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter Prerequisite(s): Second-year standing is recommended; attendance on the first day of class is required or registration is dropped.

<P>PBPL 23000. Organizational Analysis. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a systematic introduction to theoretical and empirical work on organizations broadly conceived (e.g., public and private economic organizations, governmental organizations, prisons, professional and voluntary associations, health-care organizations). Topics include intraorganizational questions about organizational goals and effectiveness, communication, authority, and decision making. Using recent developments in market, political economy, and neoinstitutional theories, we explore organizational change and interorganizational relationships for their implications in understanding social change in modern societies. Social network analysis will inform much of the discussion. Instructor(s): E. Laumann Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30101, SOCI 20101 </P>

<P>PBPL 23550. Urban Ecology and the Nature of Cities. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Urban ecology is an interdisciplinary field derived from the academic discipline of ecology. How well does classical ecological theory, typically formed from reductionist views of nature without humans, describe and predict patterns in human-dominated landscapes? Students will learn fundamental concepts in ecological theory, examine how these concepts apply to urban systems, and explore the paradigms of ecology in, of, and for cities. Readings and discussions will focus on classical research papers from the ecological literature, history of modern ecology, and contemporary approaches to studying biotic systems in cities. Instructor(s): Alison Anastasio Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): ENST 23550 </P>

<P>PBPL 23606. Political Culture, Social Capital, and The Arts. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Many analysts like Robert Putnam hold that bowling alone signals a decline in social capital, with major consequences for trust and legitimacy of the political system. But new work finds that certain arts and cultural activities are rising, especially among the young, in many countries. This course reviews core related concepts-political culture, social capital, legitimacy-and how they change with these new developments. We lay out new concepts and related methods, such as a grammar of scenes, measured for 40,000+ U.S. zip codes. Scenes, nightlife, design, the internet, and entertainment emerge as critical drivers of the post-industrial/knowledge society. Older primordial conflicts over class, race, and gender are transformed with these new issues, which spark new social movements and political tensions. The course has two halves: first to read and discuss major works and complete a mid-term exam, second to continue as a seminar where the main requirement is writing a paper.

<P>PBPL 23610. Eating a Global Environment: Critical Perspectives of Agrofood Systems. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This topics course looks at questions about the human dimensions of the globalization and localization of food production. Drawing sociological theories of labor and consumption, class, and capitalism into popular notions of taste, nutrition, and the &quot;good farmer,&quot; this course aims to answer questions of agrofood systems in a globalizing world. We will bring social scientific theory to bear on a series of case studies centering on the United States and its relationships with other places. Our driving questions and interdisciplinary readings will be animated by four themes: 1) ideological roots of food and farming, 2) causes and consequences of agricultural globalization, 3) challenges facing urban and rural food access, and 4) power dynamics of sustainable land use. Equivalent Course(s): ENST 23610 </P>

<P>PBPL 23650. Revolutionizing Agriculture: Early Modern Technologies for the New Millennium. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Based on a wave of sustainable and organic farming technologies that have reinvented early modern growing practices, this course integrates USDA reports and modern field and lab studies into the historiography of The British Agricultural Revolution. Not all historical technologies were sustainable, and this course relies upon modern agronomy to evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of the farming improvements that defined the British Agricultural Revolution. We similarly explore primary historical sources and historiography to better understand the environmental limits of the technologies used by organic and sustainable farmers today. By bringing the science and history into discourse, we will take a critical look at the British Agricultural Revolution, which is thought to have facilitated the Industrial Revolution by accumulating capital for investment and by allowing England to feed a growing urban population and manufacturing sector without a significant increase in arable acres. We know that yields per acre per worker did increase, but this is the only aspect of the story that remains unquestioned. Some agricultural improvement technologies, like light plowing and enclosure, caused catastrophic environmental harms that ultimately lowered yields over time. Other technologies like The Norfolk Rotation may have had small and gradual impacts over time and cannot be easily correlated with increases in yields on a site-by-site basis in the historical literature or in modern field trials. Other early modern technologies have proven to be more beneficial than previously thought. How can a better understanding of this history inform farming practices today?

<P>PBPL 24308. Reproductive Worlds. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores how human reproduction and the reproductive body is compelled, constrained, enabled, and narrated across the globe. The &quot;natural&quot; aspects of reproduction intersect in increasingly fraught and often surprising ways with its technological/ scientific, institutional/professional, religious/spiritual, and political/ ideological aspects. The starting point for the course is that the reproduction of bodies is differently understood and politically contested among and for various groups of people. We will pay particular attention to the ways bodies, ideas, and technologies flow throughout global contexts, while exploring how inequalities at various levels (race, class, geographic region, nationality, gender, sexuality, practices of family making) impact the &quot;nature&quot; of the reproductive body, and how reproductive practices &quot;reproduce&quot; such inequalities. We will also explore how knowledge of the reproductive body is contested through biomedicine, law, and media, with particular attention to naturalizing discourse about gender and intuition. Finally, we will look at how ecology and reproduction are intertwined via concern about environmental toxicities and the impact of non-human actors. Instructor(s): A.

<P>PBPL 24600. Economic Development in the Inner City. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore conceptually what the issues are around the economic position of cities in the early 21st century, and how to think creatively about strategies to generate economic growth that would have positive consequences for low-income residents. Community Development Corporations, empowerment zones, housing projects, and business development plans through credit and technical assistance will all be considered. Instructor(s): R.

<P>PBPL 24605. Introduction to Urban Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a grand tour of conceptual frameworks, general phenomena, emerging data and policy applications that define a growing scientific integrated understanding of cities and urbanization. It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses. We will show how issues of inequality also have consequences at more macroscopic levels and derive the general features of population and economic growth for systems of cities and nations.

<P>PBPL 24756. Exploring the Resilient City. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In recent years, sub-national units of government have enacted meaningful policy plans in the wake of the ongoing failure of the international community to address global climate change. Cities in particular have shaped their plans to address the now-inevitable effects of climate change by adopting policies that emphasize resilience and environmental protection, without sacrificing economic growth, and with attention to the ongoing challenges of poverty and inequality. This course will take a comparative look at the policies adopted by cities on an international basis, while defining what it means to be a resilient city and how much the built environment can be adjusted to limit the environmental impact of densely populated metropolises. It will also consider what impact citizen activism and input had upon the shape of each plan and the direction that its policies took. Students will also be asked to consider what might be missing from each plan and how each plan could be improved to foster greater resiliency. Instructor(s): R.

<P>PBPL 25003. Immigration, Law and Society. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Law is everywhere within the social world. It shapes our everyday lives in countless ways by permitting, prohibiting, protecting, and prosecuting native-born citizens and immigrants alike. This course reviews the major theoretical perspectives and social science research on the relationship between law and society, with an empirical focus on Latin American migration to the United States. We explore the permeation of law in everyday life, legal consciousness, and gap between &quot;law on the books&quot; and &quot;law on the ground,&quot; as well as types of immigrants, motivations behind migration, and national, state, and local immigration laws. The social impact of law is examined through the topics of liminal legality; children and families; policing, profiling, and raids; detention and deportation; and the mobilization for immigrants' rights. This course focuses on the social, political, economic, and cultural contexts of law as it relates to immigration issues. It is designed to give students the theoretical and analytical skills to critically examine the relationship between law, society, and immigration. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program, Inequality.

<P>PBPL 25004. Punishment and Social Theory. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, students examine the rise of the penal state, tracing its roots from the birth of the prison to the ascendance of mass imprisonment. The course is organized around four lines of inquiry--(1) How is the power to punish derived? (2) In what ways has the role of punishment in society been conceived? (3) What do the practices of punishment produce and tell us about ourselves? (4) Are there alternatives? Taking up these questions, students will outline the major theories of punishment advanced by classical political philosophers and penologists (Locke, Hume, Beccaria, Bentham, etc.), and trace the trajectory of our modern impulse to punish through the works of the &quot;masters of suspicion,&quot; (Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche). We will interrogate the political economy, culture, and consequences of punishment through readings on the carceral state (i.e. Alexander, Allen, Dubois, Garland, Gilmore, Gottschalk, Foucault, Harcourt, Muhammad, Melossi and Pavarini, Rusche and Kirchheimer, Wacquant, Western, etc.), and conclude by raising new questions about the role, force, consequence and alternatives to punishment in an age of mass imprisonment.

<P>PBPL 25120. Child Development and Public Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about &quot;what develops?&quot;, critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children's environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children's development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.

<P>This course is designed to discuss the ways that cultural and social psychology contribute to understandings about human rights conceptually, and how human rights issues emerge from social dynamics. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about theories on intergroup conflict and prejudice, how an individual's beliefs emerge from social contexts and shape their relationships with others, how obedience to authority is created and abused, and how social positioning and narratives influence conceptions of self and other. We will also discuss the relevance and impact of psychological study and data on human rights issues. Equivalent Course(s): INRE 30600, CHDV 25220, HMRT 25220 </P>

<P>PBPL 25370. Social Justice and Social Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is a fair policy? Policy makers often appeal to justice, fairness or rights to justify policy. Yet it is often unclear what exactly these concepts mean. This course will examine contemporary theories of justice and teach students how these theories can be applied to public policy issues. We will start with three general theories of justice: utilitarianism, liberal equality and libertarianism. We will then discuss more specific issues pertaining to marginalized groups such as immigrants or the disabled. Finally, we will examine empirical evidence about peoples' fairness beliefs in the US and abroad. This course will allow students to form a more coherent notion of what they think is fair, while understanding that rational people can legitimately disagree with each other about what is fair.

<P>PBPL 25405. Child Poverty and Chicago Schools. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This discussion- and debate-based course begins with a sociological and historical examination of child poverty, focusing on its origin, experience, and perpetuation in disadvantaged Chicago communities. Class meetings will involve debating school reform efforts, such as &quot;turnaround&quot; schools, charter schools, Promise Neighborhoods, and stepped-up teacher evaluations. Further, the barriers that have contributed to the failure of previous reform initiatives-barriers that include social isolation, violence, and the educational system itself-will be identified and analyzed in-depth.

<P>PBPL 26416. Latin American Extractivisms. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will survey the historical antecedents and contemporary politics of Latin American extractivisms. While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current &quot;neoextractivisms&quot; have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells, open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformations to local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present. Yet parallel to neo-extractive regimes, emergent Latin American social movements have unleashed impassioned and often unexpected forms of local and transnational resistance. Readings in the course will contrast cross-regional trends of extractive economic development and governance with fine-grained accounts of how individuals, families, and communities experience and respond to land dispossession, local and transregional conflict, and the ecological and health impacts of Latin American extractivisms.

The primary goal is to give students conceptual and critical tools to understand and analyze how international relations theory, U.S. foreign policy decision-making processes, and current events fit together, especially in the post 9/11 world. It is designed to develop students' capacity both to explain the foreign policy-making process in the United States, and to better understand the underlying patterns, logic, and implications of American foreign policy in the world at large. The course is divided into three main topics. First, we will discuss International Relations theory that grounds U.S. foreign policy focusing on American international power and the goals for which this power is employed. The second part of the class will examine the institutions and processes that guide foreign policy formation and implementation. Questions will revolve around who are the important people setting the foreign policy agenda and what are the important institutions attempting to implement this agenda. Finally, the last third of the course will review some of the more salient foreign policy challenges facing the U.S. in the 21st century, including particular focus on geographic regions. Some of these issues include how the recent global economic crises may influence foreign policy, how terrorism and democracy promotion continue to shape U.S. foreign policy, and whether U.S. foreign policy towards Africa is undergoing significant change.

<P>PBPL 28350. Education and Development: Policy and Research. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course covers policy issues related to education in developing contexts. We will analyze education policies and reforms, review relevant research on each topic, and examine implications of the findings to policy and practice. Topics include understanding factors that influence educational decisions, provision of basic needs in schools, teacher pay and incentives, school choice, discrimination and inclusion in education, early childhood education, and education in emergency settings. We will often have guest speakers who are working in policy and practice share their on-the-ground experiences followed by a class-led discussion about related academic papers. Instructor(s): A. Adukia Terms Offered: TBD Prerequisite(s): A microeconomics course and a statistics course. This course is intended for third- and fourth-year students; first-year students not admitted; second-year students require instructor consent. </P>

<P>PBPL 28375. Political Economy of Development. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores why some countries are poor and violent, and what (if anything) peaceful and prosperous countries can do to foster stability and development elsewhere in the world. The first half of the class looks at history and theory to understand the roots of violence and how order and development emerged in some places. The second half of the class looks at Western interventions in the last half century (and today), from aid to military intervention to democracy portion, to understand why some efforts succeed and fail. Instructor(s): C. Blattman Terms Offered: TBD </P>

<P>PBPL 28425. Strategic Behavior and Regulation of Firms. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will examine the role of public policy in oligopoly markets, where competition is imperfect. We will examine the strategies that firms use to increase profits, the effects of those strategies on consumers, and the cases for and against regulatory intervention in markets. Topics will include issues such as mergers, predation, price discrimination, collusion, and network economics. Class discussions will frequently focus on the economics of recent business and regulatory case studies, such as the California electricity crisis, Google's use of its search engine, and net neutrality regulation. An important component of the course will be the Competitive Strategy Game, in which students will form firms that compete against one another in several simulated markets, allowing students to gain first-hand experience with some of the strategic decisions firms regularly face.

<P>PBPL 28488. Politics and Public Policy in Latin America. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will cover the politics of policy making in Latin America. The first part will focus on understanding the problems of economic development in the region. It will address how and why Latin America is different by looking at its economic outcomes, economic and social policies and political institutions. It will also look at different examples of how political institutions shape policy outcomes. The second part will ground the distinctiveness of Latin America in its history, and show why understanding this is critical for comprehending why it is so different from the United States. It will explore how these historical factors persist, for example, how the legacy of authoritarianism shapes redistributive policies and how these historical foundations have created the weak Latin American states we see today. The third part of the course will look at how groups such as civil society or violent actors can also shape policymaking and welfare in this region. Finally, it will discuss some perspectives on whether some countries in the region have managed to find ways to change their political institutions and subsequently their social and economic policies with the prospect of creating a more prosperous society. The aim of this course is for students to gain empirical knowledge on the region's politics and policies as well as a practical understanding of political factors that shape policy outcomes.

<P>PBPL 28501. Process and Policy in State and City Government. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course consists of three interrelated sub-sections: (1) process and policy in city and state government; (2) the role played by influential, key officials in determining policy outcomes; and (3) policymaking during and after a political crisis. Issues covered include isolating the core principles driving policy at city and state levels; understanding how high level elected officials can shape the course of policy; and determining how a political crisis affects policy processes and outcomes. Most of the specific cases are drawn from Chicago and the State of Illinois. Instructor(s): C. Harris III Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter </P>

<P>PBPL 28510. Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Indian city of Bombay and the Mumbai it has now become has been referred to as the &quot;imagined&quot; city, the &quot;kinetic&quot; city, the &quot;cosmopolitan city,&quot; and &quot;the city of slums.&quot; What do these labels mean to the practice of sociality and politics in Bombay/Mumbai; how does the urban experience in South Asia differ from that in other parts of the world; and how do gender, religion and class influence the different experiences of the city? Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics is an interdisciplinary course that will address these and several related issues. Using the city of Mumbai as its lens it introduces students to the ways in which urban subjects and urban life are constituted in a globalizing South Asia. The course explores the city of Mumbai through an urbanculturalist perspective and problematizes the ways in which the built environment of the city: its transportation, streets, slums, neighborhoods, tenements, markets, malls and businesses animate and are animated by the everyday life and politics in the metropolis. It encourages students to think about the ways in which Mumbai's past and present patterns of urban informality, capitalism, consumption, criminality and urban dislocations mediate very particular experiences of politics, sociality, class, gender and globalization. The course uses a range of historical, theoretical, literary, and ethnographic readings as well as films, photography, and music to highlight the connections between place, space and everyday life in Mumbai.

<P>PBPL 28525. Missing Markets: The Economics of the Environment. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course presents a broad-based treatment of the theory and application of environmental economics. Topics are introduced in the context of real-world environmental policy questions (with special emphasis on energy policy), then translated into microeconomic theory to highlight the salient constraints and fundamental trade-offs faced by policymakers. Topics include property rights, externalities, Pigouvian taxes, command-andcontrol regulation, cap-and-trade, valuation of environmental quality, cost-benefit analysis, policymaking under uncertainty, and inter-regional competition.

<P>PBPL 28538. Political Economy of Natural Resources. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The aim of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the political and economic consequences of natural resource wealth. The course will combine theoretical models and empirical evidence on the relationship between natural resources and outcomes such as low economic growth, authoritarianism, corruption and conflict. We will look at the very different experiences of different resource-rich countries (e.g. Norway versus Venezuela) and will also explore the differences across resources (e.g. oil vs minerals). The course will provide a setting for the discussion of the merits and potential pitfalls of various policies for the management of natural resource wealth.

<P>PBPL 28550. Social Experiments: Design and Experimentation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The pressure in many fields (notably medicine, health research, and education) for evidence-based results has increased the importance of the design and analysis of social investigations. This class will address two broad topics: (i) the design of experiments, quasi-experiments, and surveys; and (ii) the use of these social investigations for generalization in policy areas. The class will explore how the relationship between surveys and experiments can inform generalization from experiments. Randomized clinical trials in medicine, field experiments in economics and psychology, and the use of scientific evidence in policy formulation will be among the examples. Instructor(s): C. O'Muircheartaigh Terms Offered: TBD </P>

<P>PBPL 28605. Economic Analysis of Law. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course involves the application of the choice theory of economics to the opportunities obtainable within different legal environments. The likelihood that a person will choose to return a lost wallet, keep a promise, drive more carefully, or heed the terms in a will is partly a function of the applicable laws and regulations. Alternative rules, under the standard Law and Economics approach, are compared in terms of the economic efficiency of their subsequent outcomes. This efficiency lens of Law and Economics is applied to rules concerning property, torts, contracts, and criminal behavior. Instructor(s): J. Leitzel Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): ECON 20100 Equivalent Course(s): ECON 28600 </P>

<P>PBPL 28640. Mixed Methods Approaches to Policy Research. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Course Description: This course will introduce students to a diverse range of mixed methods approaches to policy research. Students will learn about multiple disciplinary perspectives and methodological approaches to policy research. The course will expose students to different styles of mixed methods research, including a small project on qualitative data analysis. Students in this course will become critical consumers of both qualitative and quantitative research, specifically, what types of questions best lend themselves to quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies. Instructor(s): A. Claessens Terms Offered: TBD </P>

<P>PBPL 28702. Electoral Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course involves the scientific study of elections in advanced democracies with a primary focus on the modern United States. We will address empirical and theoretical questions about voters, candidates, parties, and the electoral system as a whole. For example, who runs for political office? How do they choose their policy platforms? How do citizens form their vote choices? Who turns out to vote and why? Who is informed and why? Does it matter that many citizens abstain from politics and are uninformed? What roles do race, ethnicity, and prejudice play in elections? What role does the media play? What laws and policies could improve political participation and political representation? We will address these questions through the applications of game theory, microeconomic theory, and most importantly quantitative/statistical analysis. Instructor(s): A. Fowler Terms Offered: TBD Prerequisite(s): Basic familiarity with American politics and statistics is required. </P>

<P>PBPL 28730. Insurgency in South and Southeast Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will trace the emergence, spread, and decline of insurgencies across South and Southeast Asia. We will use cutting-edge theoretical and quantitative research to examine the causes of each conflict---from the Naxal Insurgency in India to the varied separatist movements in Indonesia---and draw on in-depth case studies of various counterinsurgency strategies to assess how these conflicts were or might be resolved through cooperation between local and international actors. Students will engage with ongoing field data collection efforts in Thailand and the Philippines, and will use original microdata as a core feature of their final research paper. Instructor(s): Wright, A. Terms Offered: TBD </P>

<P>PBPL 28747. The Modern Welfare State. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In 2016, Denmark was the happiest country in the world according to a United Nations happiness report. Denmark, along with Sweden and Finland have shared 20 years of relative prosperity and now are among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita. They are also &quot;welfare states&quot; with very high levels of taxation and redistribution--policies at odds with traditional views on the power of incentives to encourage prosperity. The influence of the Nordic Model is evident is policy discussion in the US on issues ranging from educational subsidies to family-friendly workplaces. What can policy makers in other countries learn from the successes and failures of the Nordic Model? This class has three goals: 1. to familiarize you with Nordic taxes and subsidies, 2. to help you understand why these policies are successful (or appear to be successful), and 3. to give you the tools to critically evaluate suggestions for similar policy implementation in the US. Instructor(s): Yana Gallen Terms Offered: TBD Prerequisite(s): PBPL 26400 or equivalent </P>

<P>PBPL 28750. Conflict: Root Causes, Consequences, and Solutions for the Future. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will focus on understanding the causes and consequences of conflict, drawing on literatures from economics, political science and psychology. We will study why people join armed groups; and examine the role of ethnicity, religion and poverty in terrorism and civil war. We will also study whether conflict has lasting consequences on social cohesion and prospects for economic development. Finally, we will examine how individuals reconcile and rebuild in the aftermath of conflict. Instructor(s): Dube, O Terms Offered: TBD </P>

<P>PBPL 28775. Poverty and Economic Development. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course focuses mainly on the microeconomic fundamentals of economic development. We will study causes of poverty and underdevelopment, poverty measurement issues, and policies to improve well-being. We will concentrate on topics such as fertility, nutrition and health, education, labor markets, intra-household allocation of resources and foreign aid. Empirical evidence from developing economies will be used extensively. Instructor(s): A. Menendez Terms Offered: TBD Prerequisite(s): A microeconomics course and a statistics/econometrics course is required. This course is recommended for third and fourth-year students. </P>

<P>PBPL 28780. The Art and Science of Negotiations and Persuasion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The ability to influence other people and convince them to go along with your beliefs about what they should do is perhaps one of the most sought after, but misunderstood, professional skills. Those who appear to be successful at negotiation and persuasion are routinely built up as having unique traits like charisma, excellent leadership skills, and innate talent. However, this course will explain how success in influencing others depends not on innate or unique traits, but rather on knowledge and practice of basic psychological principles that govern interpersonal behavior. This course will increase your understanding of negotiations and persuasion in several ways. First, you will experience varied negotiation situations firsthand in the classroom on a weekly basis. Second, you will learn how to analyze your work using insights collected from decades of research in social psychology, decision-making, and behavioral science. Third, and unlike most real-life situations, you will be able to receive feedback on your performance. Life, unfortunately, does not often offer the opportunity to compare your outcomes to other people's outcomes. This course does, thereby enabling you to identify what you did right, what you did wrong, and improve your performance by evaluating your work compared to the rest of the class. This course aims to provide you with negotiation experience, tools for persuading others to go along with your beliefs, and general knowledge of human psychology.

<P>PBPL 28805. Behavioral Economics and Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness? Instructor(s): J. Leitzel Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): ECON 26920 </P>

<P>PBPL 28820. Machine Learning and Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The goal of this course is to make students better producers and consumers of machine learning tools designed to help solve public policy problems. One thing this goal requires is some understanding of the basics of machine learning: how it works, what makes it different from the usual sort of statistical and econometric tools that we tend to use in social science studies of public policy problems, and how to implement these prediction models (which we will be doing in R, a free statistical program that now includes many machine learning packages). But this goal also requires some understanding of issues that are outside the usual machine learning toolkit, such as: what sorts of public policy problems are right for these tools, and which are not; how do we know whether a new prediction tool is capable of actually improving policy decisions, not just predicting outcomes accurately within some hold-out set; what additional considerations around fairness and other normative values may arise in using machine learning tools for public policy applications; and what challenges are associated with getting policymakers, front-line practitioners or individual citizens to make use of prediction tools and resulting decision aids.

<P>PBPL 28891. The Supreme Court and Public Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Learning how courts interpret policy has become an important component of the policymaker's toolkit. This course aims to introduce students to how Constitutional interpretation touches upon pressing policy questions of today. Students will engage with what courts expect to see from policymakers, while also learning how to read cases from a lawyer's perspective. Topics covered include federalism, LGBT rights, race and ethnicity, criminal justice issues, voting rights, emoluments, and political questions and official immunity. Instructor(s): D. Spencer Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Third or Fourth year standing required </P>

<P>PBPL 28900. Environmental and Science Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>With a strong emphasis on the fundamental physics and chemistry of the environment, this course is aimed at students interested in assessing the scientific repercussions of various policies on the environment. The primary goal of the class is to assess how scientific information, the economics of scientific research, and the politics of science interact with and influence public policy development and implementation.

<P>PBPL 28920. Inequality: Origins, Dimensions, and Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>For the last four decades, incomes in the United States and across the globe have grown more unequal. That fact has attracted worldwide attention from scholars, governments, religious figures, and public intellectuals. In this interdisciplinary course, participating faculty members drawn from across the University and invited guest speakers will trace and examine the sources and challenges of inequality and mobility in many of its dimensions, from economic, political, legal, biological, philosophical, public policy, and other perspectives. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Inequality. Instructor(s): A. Sanderson and Staff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing Note(s): ECON 24720 or ECON 22410 may be used as an Economics elective, but only one of the two may be used toward Economics major requirements.

<P>PBPL 28923. Health Impacts of Transportation Systems. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Transportation systems affect human health through complex pathways. Governments invest in transport infrastructure because it encourages economic growth and mobility of people and goods, which have direct and indirect benefits to health. Yet, an excessive reliance on motorized modes of transport harms population health, the environment and social wellbeing. The impact on population health is substantial: Globally, road traffic crashes kill over 1.3 million annually. Air pollution, to which transport is an important contributor, kills another 3.2 million people. Motorized modes of transport are also an important contributor to sedentary lifestyles. Physical inactivity is estimated to cause 3.2 million deaths every year, globally. This course will introduce students to thinking about transportation as a technological system that affects human health and wellbeing through intended and unintended mechanisms. The course will examine the complex relationship between transportation, land use, urban form, and geography, and explore how decisions in other sectors affect transportation systems, and how these in turn affect human health. Students will learn to recognize how the system level properties of a range of transportation systems (such as limited-access highways, urban mass transit, inter-city rail) affect human health. The course reviews the pathways through which road transport impacts population health and focuses on how to measure these impacts, and how to compare them with other leading causes of health loss.

<P>PBPL 28957. The Social Psychology of Behavior in Organizations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Understanding others' thoughts and behaviors is essential for professional and personal success. Most of us try to understand others by putting on the cap of an &quot;intuitive scientist,&quot; relying on our intuitions to identify others' thoughts and motivations and to predict others' behavior. However, decades of psychological research suggest that our intuitions about other people are often misguided in systematic ways. This course will enable you to have a more accurate understanding of others' motivations, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors by teaching you to think like a &quot;psychological scientist&quot; rather than an intuitive scientist. Relying on research in social psychology, judgment and decision-making, and behavioral science, this course will help you understand when your intuitions are likely to be reliable and when they are unlikely to be so, giving you important knowledge and tools to succeed professionally and interpersonally. Managing other people-be they co-workers, customers, constituents, or competitors-is critical for professional and personal success. At the very start of your professional career, your success will likely depend on having the necessary technical expertise to produce excellent work product for your organization. As you progress in your career, however, success will increasingly require you to manage groups of people, to align their skills, solve interpersonal problems, and create well-functioning teams. This course is intended to provide the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical for successfully managing others, and also for successfully managing yourself.

<P>PBPL 29000. Energy and Energy Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course shows how scientific constraints affect economic and other policy decisions regarding energy, what energy-based issues confront our society, how we may address them through both policy and scientific study, and how the policy and scientific aspects can and should interact. We address specific technologies, both those now in use and those under development, and the policy questions associated with each, as well as with more overarching aspects of energy policy that may affect several, perhaps many, technologies.

<P>PBPL 29050. Youth Law and Policy: Child Welfare and Juv. Just. in the U.S. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores how legal institutions protect and punish children in the United States. We will spend the first part of the course exploring the child welfare system, which purports to protect children from abuse and neglect through various mechanisms including foster care and the termination of parental rights. We will spend the second part of the course exploring the juvenile justice system, which purports to prosecute and rehabilitate children for their criminal acts in a system separate from the criminal justice system. In the final part of the course, we will consider special topics in this area of law and policy including &quot;cross-over youth&quot; (i.e. children involved in both systems), unaccompanied immigrant children, homeless and runaway youth, and the so-called &quot;school-to-prison-pipeline.&quot; This course will place special emphasis on the judges, lawyers, law enforcement officers, and social workers that comprise these legal institutions.

<P>PBPL 29120. Poverty Law and Policy Reform. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar seeks to give students a comprehensive understanding of the major anti-poverty programs in the United States with an emphasis on current challenges and reform proposals. We will spend the first half of the course exploring the implementation and evaluation of the programs that make up the traditional safety net for poor Americans: income supports, health insurance, and housing assistance. We will spend the rest of the quarter exploring topics that complicate the traditional social policy regime, including how the safety net is more robust for some groups, such as the elderly and veterans, than others. We will explore how the legal systems of immigration and incarceration hamper anti-poverty policy and how safety net programs address the needs of rural and Native Americans. Finally, we will investigate two recent developments in the field: social entrepreneurship and the critique of procedural rights. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): No first year students; attendance on the first day of class is required.

<P>PBPL 29355. Leading Complex Organizations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In virtually any field of endeavor, individuals will find themselves operating within organizations - many of them quite complex. By studying leadership of such organizations at the outset of a career, individuals will learn how to better succeed within any organization and will attain a level of preparation for assuming leadership positions if they ultimately become available. The seminar will cover a number of critical subjects: the difference between leadership and management; the development of the organization's sense of mission and the strategy to achieve it; organizational culture; building and leading a team; entrepreneurial leadership; organizational transformation; leading an organization through crisis; how a leader relates to an organization's governing body and external constituencies; how leaders are held accountable.

<P>PBPL 29404. Inequality, Household Finance, and Tax Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The first component of this course will feature seminar discussions of income inequality and US tax policy, with a focus on income transfers such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. We will also review current policy topics in Household Finance, the study of how households save, borrow, and/or use insurance to overcome unexpected changes in household income. In addition, we will discuss the process of filing tax returns, the prevalence of income tax refunds, and the various industries, both non-profit and for-profit, that have arisen around this phenomenon. Next, students will go into the field, and work as volunteer tax preparers for a local, Chicago nonprofit, the Center for Economic Progress (CEP). Students will be trained as tax preparers (which requires a 3hour training session), learn how these services are delivered, and will also learn about the various social goals and public benefits that are often coupled with this process. Tax season begins in late January, and the students will work on site at some steady frequency, until the end of the quarter. Students are also encouraged, though not required, to continue to volunteer until the end of the tax season, April 15th. Finally, students will produce one of three deliverables. They can prepare an evaluation of CEP or they can produce a policy brief, or they can produce a research proposal. This course satisfies the Public Policy windows practicum requirement.

<P>PBPL 29411. Mediation, Moderation, and Spillover Effects. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students from social sciences, statistics, health studies, public policy, and social services administration who will be or are currently involved in quantitative research. Research questions about why an intervention works, for whom, under what conditions, and whether one individual's treatment could affect other individuals' outcomes are often key to the advancement of scientific knowledge yet pose major analytic challenges. This course introduces cutting-edge theoretical concepts and methodological approaches with regard to mediation of intervention effects, moderated intervention effects, and spillover effects in a variety of settings. The course content is organized around six case studies. In each case, students will be involved in critical examinations of a working paper currently under review. Background readings will reflect the latest developments and controversies. Weekly labs will provide supplementary tutorials and hands-on experiences with mediation and moderation analyses. All students are expected to contribute to the knowledge building in class through participation in discussions. Students are encouraged to form study groups, while the two written assignments are to be finished and graded on an individual basis. Instructor(s): G.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The program in Religious Studies introduces students to the academic study of religion. Students in Religious Studies learn how to think, talk, and write about religion in a way that is well-informed, rigorously critical, and responsibly engaged. The study of religion investigates the way human societies construct practices, seek meanings, and pose questions about their world. These investigations may be constructive, cultural, and/or historical. Since it touches all facets of human experience, the study of religion is a crucial conversation partner with other fields of study and draws on the entire range of humanistic and social scientific disciplines. Students in the program are able to explore numerous religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, and are exposed to the sources, problems, methods, and methodologies of our diverse areas of study, including Biblical and Historical Studies; Ethics, Theology, and the Philosophy of Religions; as well as History of Religions, Anthropology, Sociology, and Religion and Literature. The interests of our students may be descriptive, explanatory, and/or normative. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>A major in Religious Studies consists of twelve courses, including one introductory course and a two-quarter senior seminar. It is preferable that students consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies and declare their major in Religious Studies before the end of their second year. Students and the Director of Undergraduate Studies will work together to create a program of study. The goal is to develop depth in one area so that a satisfactory BA paper will be written in the fourth year. Students are encouraged to explore more than one religious tradition in their courses. </P>

<P>Students with permission to enroll in graduate Divinity courses may count these toward the major. Students who wish to receive credit in the major for non-departmental courses must submit a petition to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Such requests are decided on a case-by-case basis. NOTE: The Office of the Dean of Students in the College must also approve the transfer of all courses taken at institutions other than those in which students are enrolled as part of a study abroad program that is sponsored by the University of Chicago. For more information, visit Transfer Credit. </P>

<P>Introductory Course </P>

<P>Students in Religious Studies are required to take RLST 10100 Introduction to Religious Studies. It need not precede other course work in the major, but students are advised to have completed it by the end of their second year. It will typically be offered every year during Autumn Quarter. This course will introduce students to some of the central themes in Religious Studies; its particular focus will vary according to the interests of the individual instructor. </P>

<P>Course Distribution </P>

<P>Religion is expressed in many forms throughout the world's cultures, and the academic study of religion therefore requires multiple perspectives on its subject. Students of religion should have some knowledge of the historical development of specific religious traditions, understand and critically engage the ethical and intellectual teachings of various religions, and begin to make some comparative appraisals of the roles that religions play in different cultures and historical periods. To introduce students to these multiple perspectives on religion and to provide a sense of the field as a whole, students are required to take at least one course in each of the following areas. To identify the areas, refer to the RLST number range (see below). </P>

<P>A. Historical Studies in Religious Traditions: courses that explore the development of particular religious traditions, including their social practices, rituals, scriptures, and beliefs in historical context (RLST 11000 through 15000, 20000 through 22900). </P>

<P>B. Constructive Studies in Religion: courses that investigate constructive or normative questions about the nature and conduct of human life that are raised by religious traditions, including work in philosophy of religion, ethics, and theology (RLST 23000 through 25900). </P>

<P>C. Cultural Studies in Religion: courses that introduce issues in the social and cultural contingencies of religious thought and practice by emphasizing sociological, anthropological, and literary-critical perspectives on religion, and by raising comparative questions about differing religious and cultural traditions (RLST 26000 through 28900). </P>

<P>Senior Seminar and BA Paper </P>

<P>The two-quarter senior sequence (RLST 29800 BA Paper Seminar I and RLST 29900 BA Paper II) will assist students with the preparation of the required BA paper. During May of their third year, students will work with the preceptor to choose a faculty adviser and a topic for research, and to plan a course of study for the following year. These must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students will take part in the BA Paper Seminar convened by a preceptor during Autumn and Winter Quarters. This seminar will allow students to prepare their bibliographies, hone their writing, and present their research. Students will register for RLST 29800 BA Paper Seminar I in the Autumn Quarter and for RLST 29900 BA Paper II in the Winter Quarter. The BA paper </P>

<P>will be due the second week of Spring Quarter. The length is typically between thirty and forty pages, with the upward limit being firm. </P>

<P>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program. Approval from both departments is required. Students should consult with the departments by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both departments, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Religious Studies majors must receive quality grades in all courses in the major. With consent of instructor, nonmajors may take Religious Studies courses for P/F grading. Faculty will determine the criteria that constitute a Pass. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Honors are awarded by the Divinity School's Committee on Undergraduate Studies. Students who write senior papers deemed exceptional by their faculty advisers will be eligible for consideration for graduation with honors. To be considered for honors, students must also have a 3.5 GPA or higher in the major and a 3.25 GPA or </P>

<P>Minor Program in Religious Studies </P>

<P>The minor in Religious Studies requires a total of seven courses. RLST 10100 Introduction to Religious Studies is required of all minors. The remaining six courses should be chosen to reflect a broad understanding of the academic study of religion. Of these six, students must take at least one course in each of our three areas of study [Historical Studies (A), Constructive Studies (B), and Cultural Studies (C)]. Courses in the minor may not be double-counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, and may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>The student must complete a substantial (at least 10–15 pages) paper or project. This work should engage critically with primary source materials and exemplify methodological sophistication in the study of religion, and should earn a grade no lower than B-. It is expected that this paper will normally be written as part of the student's course work for the minor. The Director of Undergraduate Studies will approve the paper for fulfillment of this requirement. </P>

<P>Students who elect the minor program in Religious Studies must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor. Consent to complete a minor forms are available from the student’s College adviser or online at https:// college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/attachments/consent_minor_program.pdf. </P>

<P>Religious Studies Courses </P>

<P>RLST 10100. Introduction to Religious Studies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What are we talking about when we talk about religion? There are a multitude of answers to that question, and this course provides students with an entry way into a longstanding conversation-involving insiders, outsiders, and those in between-around the meanings of a word that indexes ideas of god and the gods, of origins and ends, and of the proper places of humans (and everything else, including animals) above, in, and below the globe. Talk about religion today is, in fact, cheap: this course will aim to promote a grammatical currency (morphology, vocabulary, syntax) to enhance the value of such talk. Instructor(s): Sarah Hammerschlag Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Required of students who are majoring in Religious Studies. </P>

<P>RLST 11004. Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious, political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of texts continues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course, we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualize their ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt. Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient Near East. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along with representative selections from secondary literature. We will also spend some time thinking about the nature of biblical interpretation. Instructor(s): J. Stackert Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): BIBL 31000, NEHC 30504, JWSC 20120, NEHC 20504 </P>

<P>RLST 11030. Introduction to the Qur'an. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces the historical context, thematic and literary features, major biblical figures, and exegetical literature on the Qur'an, with a focus on the early (8th-10th century CE) and medieval periods (11th - 15th century CE). We will read select English translations from the Qur'an and its commentators, accompanied by academic secondary literature that emphasize the Qur'an's literary structure, theological underpinnings, historical, geographical, social, political and cultural contexts in early and medieval Islamic civilization, and the role of the Qur'an as both a fixed and a living and dynamic text in Muslim devotional life. Instructor(s): Yousef Casewit Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Knowledge of Arabic is not a prerequisite, but general knowledge about Islam or an &quot;Introduction to Islam&quot; course is highly recommended. Equivalent Course(s): ISLM 30030, NEHC 30030 </P>

<P>RLST 12000. Introduction to the New Testament: Texts and Contexts. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An immersion in the texts of the New Testament with the following goals: 1. through careful reading to come to know well some representative pieces of this literature; 2. to gain useful knowledge of the historical, geographical, social, religious, cultural and political contexts of these texts and the events they relate; 3. to learn the major literary genres represented in the canon (&quot;gospels,&quot; &quot;acts,&quot; &quot;letters,&quot; and &quot;apocalypses&quot;) and strategies for reading them; 4. to comprehend the various theological visions and cultural worldviews to which these texts give expression; 5. to situate oneself and one's prevailing questions about this material in the history of research, and to reflect on the goals and methods of interpretation; 6. to raise questions for further study. Instructor(s): M. Mitchell Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Interest in this literature, and willingness to enter into conversation with like- and non-likeminded others on the texts and the issues involved in their interpretation. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 28202, BIBL 32500 </P>

<P>RLST 20111. History of Death. 100 Units. </P>

<P>From the treatment of mortal remains to the built environment of cemeteries, tombs, and memorials, the dead have always played a role in the lives of the living. This course examines how beliefs and practices surrounding death have been a source of meaning making for individuals, institutions, religious communities, and modern nations. It will ask students to consider how examining death makes it possible to better understand the values and concerns of societies across time and space. This course will consider case studies from Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, North America, Europe, and Asia, from the Middle Ages to the Vietnam War. It introduces students to the methods and debates that animate the historical study of death-coming from histories of the body, social history, and the study of slavery-and ends by asking the question: &quot;Is it possible to have a global history of death?"

<P>This course will examine some of the Greco-Roman roots of early Christianity. We will focus on affinities between Christianity and the classical tradition as well as ways in which the Christian faith may be considered radically different. Some of the more important issues that we will analyze are: 1. &quot;The spell of Homer.&quot; How the Homeric poems exerted immeasurable influence on the religious attitudes and practices of the Greeks. 2. The theme of creation in Greek and Roman authors such as Hesiod and Ovid. The Orphic account of human origins. The Early Christian theme of Christ as creator/savior. 3. Greek and Roman conceptions of the afterlife. The response to the Homeric orientation in the form of the great mystery cults of Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The views of the philosophers (esp. Plato). The New Testament conception of resurrection. 4. Greek and Roman conceptions of sacrifice, the crucifixion of Christ as archetypal sacrifice and early Christian reflection upon it. 5.

<P>RLST 21450. Coptic Bible. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Coptic versions of the Bible present one of the earliest translations of Christian scripture as the new religion spread. Understanding how the Bible (canonical and non-canonical) was read and used in Egypt at this early stage implies studying the development of Christian communities in those agitated times, as well as paying attention to questions of literacy and linguistic environment, book production, Bible (both Greek and Coptic) on papyrus, and translation and interpretation in Antiquity. The course will draw on materials assembled from my work on the critical edition of the Gospel of Mark, but will also look into other materials like the Coptic Old Testament, and non-canonical scriptures such as Nag Hammadi and the Gnostic scriptures.

<P>RLST 23905. Is Buddhism a Religion? 100 Units. </P>

<P>One often hears it said that &quot;Buddhism is not a religion, it's […]&quot; - with the ellipsis variously filled in as (e.g.) &quot;a philosophy,&quot; &quot;a kind of mind science,&quot; &quot;a spiritual practice,&quot; etc. This course will explore the origins and function of this meme, as well as the question of what, if anything, distinguishes a tradition as &quot;religious.&quot; It is hoped that we will, along the way, learn a bit about Buddhism, and/or about various Asian encounters with colonialism, empire, and modernity.

<H3>Renaissance Studies </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64366">Department Website: https://voices.uchicago.edu/renaissancestudies </P>

<P>The minor in Renaissance studies offers students an interdisciplinary examination of the networks of trade, culture, and power that, in the formative centuries between the Black Death and the Enlightenment, profoundly changed the culture and society of Europe and the Mediterranean and brought the region into contact with the broader globe. This era birthed empires, economies, literatures, languages, conflicts, technologies, and ideas whose influence, both within the European continent and well beyond, powerfully shaped the advent and structures of modernity. A list of University of Chicago faculty working in Renaissance studies can be found on the Renaissance Studies website (https://voices.uchicago.edu/renaissancestudies/facultybydept). </P>

<P>The minor unites the humanities and social sciences, teaching students to use the tools of multiple disciplines to examine the society, art, literature, music, and the political, economic, and historical experiences of the Renaissance world. A student might choose to minor in Renaissance studies in order to reach beyond the lens of one discipline to see how major figures (Machiavelli, Luther, Montaigne, Cervantes, Shakespeare) or major events (the Reformation, European contact with the Americas) yield different insights when examined with the diverse methods and tools of inquiry used in different departments. </P>

<P>The minor could represent an interest distinct from the student’s major, or it could complement a major in the social sciences or humanities for a student working on materials from the period. It could equally complement a major in the sciences, for students who want to understand the era (of Galileo and Vesalius) that so powerfully shaped the way their disciplines are understood and studied today. </P>

<P>Minor in Renaissance Studies </P>

<P>Students must complete six courses for the minor. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the minor, courses eligible for the minor will come from a variety of departments and will be cross-listed with a RENS (Renaissance Studies) subject code. </P>

<P>The Renaissance can be approached through many disciplines, including: </P>

<P>Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, English Language and Literature, Fundamentals: Issues and Texts, Germanic Studies, History, History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine, Music, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, Romance Languages and Literatures (e.g., Catalan, French, Italian), Russian and East European Studies (e.g., Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Czech, Polish), and Theater and Performance Studies. </P>

<P>At least three (3) of the above disciplines must be represented among the six (6) approved courses that students take to complete the minor. An updated list of eligible courses with descriptions specifying which discipline each course represents will be maintained on the Renaissance Studies website (https:// voices.uchicago.edu/renaissancestudies/courses). Any uncertainty about which courses represent which disciplines can be resolved by consulting the Renaissance Studies website or the program director. </P>

<P>Students may petition to count courses not cross-listed as RENS if they can demonstrate that the courses have substantial content related to Renaissance questions. A student may also petition to count up to two language courses if the student can demonstrate that the language is being studied for the purpose of pursing Renaissance studies. A successful petition requires students to obtain approval from the program director, who will contact College Advising on the student’s behalf. </P>

<P>Courses in the minor may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors. </P>

<P>Summary of Requirements </P>

<P>Three RENS courses representing three distribution areas * 300 </P>

<P>Three RENS electives </P>

<P>Total Units 600 </P>

<P>* Students must take approved RENS courses in at least three distinct disciplines (History, Philosophy, Religious Studies, etc.). Consult the Renaissance Studies website (http://voices.uchicago.edu/ renaissancestudies/courses) for lists of courses and the disciplines they represent. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Prospective minors must meet with the Renaissance Studies program director to discuss their interests and course plans and to obtain advice and approval. This meeting could happen whenever the student is ready to declare. Together the student and the program director will fill out the Minor Program Application Form listing </P>

<P>the proposed courses, which the program director signs. Students should submit completed, signed forms to their College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of their third year. </P>

<P>Renaissance Studies Courses </P>

<P>Full, updated lists of eligible courses along with the distribution areas they fulfill can be found on the Renaissance Studies website (https://voices.uchicago.edu/renaissancestudies/courses), but contact the program director if you have questions about whether a course may be counted toward the Renaissance Studies minor. </P>

<H3>Romance Languages and Literatures </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64367">Department Website: http://rll.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Programs of Study </P>

<P>The Department of Romance Languages and Literatures (RLLT) offers several programs of study leading to the BA degree in French, Italian, or Spanish literature and culture; or in some combination, which may include Catalan or Portuguese. Catalan and Portuguese offerings include a two-year language sequence, minor programs in Catalan and Portuguese, and selected literature and culture courses. The BA programs are designed to give students knowledge of the literature and culture of their area of concentration, as well as to develop their linguistic competence in one or more of the Romance languages. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in RLLT. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Courses in the major may not be counted toward general education requirements. For courses that are not taken as part of a University of Chicago study abroad program, students must petition for elective credit from the College before requesting departmental credit. Advanced language students should consider taking special topic courses at the 20000 and 30000 levels. Some of these courses require consent of the instructor. </P>

<P>Degree Program in French and Francophone Literature, Culture, andSociety </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students who elect the major program must meet with the French undergraduate adviser before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the major and to complete the required paperwork. Students choose their track and appropriate courses in consultation with the French undergraduate adviser. Students must submit to the departmental office an approval form for the major program signed by the French undergraduate adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of their third year. Students must then submit a copy of the signed approval form to their College adviser. </P>

<P>The major program in French consists of ten courses beyond FREN 20300 Language, History, and Culture </P>

<P>III. One course must be either FREN 20500 Ecrire en français or FREN 20503 Modes De Raisonnement Francais (taught in Paris). The remaining courses should be upper-level courses in or related to French, and determined according to the student’s major track. </P>

<P>All students must take at least one departmental course at the introductory level. Introductory-level courses (as designated in the course title or description) are designed as “gateway” courses that provide foundations for the major and are suitable for students who have just completed the advanced language requirement. All students must also take at least three courses that include pre-nineteenth-century material. </P>

<P>Two tracks, with different emphases, are offered as paths to the French major. These areas of special emphasis are broadly defined, and the chosen track need not determine all the courses a student can take within the department. The tracks are intended to give students the flexibility to explore their own interests while developing in-depth knowledge of the language, literature, and culture of the Francophone world. </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>French and Francophone Language and Literature: This track focuses on developing advanced proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing French, as well as broad knowledge of the field of French and Francophone literary studies. Through the close study of major works, students learn critical techniques appropriate to their interpretation. Students must complete most of their course work (e.g., readings, writing) in French in order to receive credit. Advanced students may petition to take RLLT 38800 Foreign Language Acquisition, Research and Teaching as one of their courses. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>French and Francophone Society and Culture : This track is intended for students who have a special interest in understanding the historical, social, and cultural complexity of France and the Francophone world, or in the visual arts, cinema, music, or theater. Students must take a majority of their courses in the department, but are also encouraged to explore appropriate course offerings in History, Political Science, Sociology, Art History, Cinema and Media Studies, Music, and Theater and Performance Studies. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Study Abroad </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to participate in the College's study abroad programs in France. Many of these programs confer major or minor credit, including the courses in the summer Advanced French program. The three civilization courses in the French-language European Civilization in Paris program can be used for credit in any track of the French major or minor, assuming a student is not using these courses to fulfill the general education civilization studies requirement. For the French and Francophone Society and Culture major track, the three courses from the Autumn African Civilizations in Paris program or the three courses from the Winter Cinema and Media Studies program in Paris can be used for credit (if they are not being used to meet the general education requirements in civilization studies or the arts). Further information is available from the Study Abroad office or at study-abroad.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Students may also petition for credit for other courses taken at the University of Chicago Center in Paris, depending on the course content, or for courses taken at other institutions (for instance, at French universities as part of the year-long study abroad program), subject to College procedures and departmental approval. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>French majors must receive quality grades in all required courses. Nonmajors may take departmental courses for P/F grading with consent of instructor. However, all language courses must be taken for a quality grade. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To qualify for honors, students must have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher and an average GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. They must also submit a completed BA paper to their adviser no later than Friday of fifth week of Spring Quarter of their fourth year. Students with papers judged superior by the BA paper adviser and another faculty reader will be recommended to the Master of the Humanities Collegiate Division for honors. </P>

<P>Only students who wish to be considered for honors are required to write a BA paper. </P>

<P>Students should select a faculty supervisor for the paper in early Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. During Autumn or Winter Quarter, they may register for FREN 29900 BA Paper Preparation: French. Students seeking honors may count this course towards their course requirements; it must be taken for a quality grade. The BA paper typically is a research paper with a minimum of 15–20 pages, as agreed upon with the BA advisor, and a bibliography written in the language of specialization. </P>

<P>Students must seek permission from their BA paper adviser to use a single paper or project to meet both the major requirements of Romance Languages and Literatures and those of another department or program. Students must also obtain the approval of both program chairs on a form available from the College adviser, to be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation. </P>

<P>FREN 21719. Histoire, Superstitions et Croyances dans le roman francophone des XXe et XXIe siècles. 100 Units. </P>

<P>L'Afrique et les Antilles sont généralement présentées comme des régions hautement superstitieuses, figées dans les croyances et les traditions. La littérature apparaît comme le lieu privilégié où se reflètent ces éléments culturels. Les écrivains africains et antillais (plus précisément d'Haïti, de Martinique, de Guadeloupe et de la Guyane française) analysent, questionnent, reformulent des récits, mythes et légendes tirés d'une tradition avant tout orale. A leur suite, nous essayerons de remonter aux origines de ces croyances et superstitions. Nous naviguerons entre essais théoriques et récits linéaires pour mener une réflexion critique, et formuler des réponses à un certain nombre de questions, notamment : Croyances et superstitions sont-elles uniquement les vestiges d'un héritage oral ? Comment se rattachent-elles à l'histoire de ces peuples ? Quelle perception [sociale] suscitentelles ? En tant qu'éléments du récit, quels effets provoquent-elles chez le lecteur ? Soulignent-elles des objectifs spécifiques d'écriture ? Nous examinerons également les rapports entre ces deux notions et celles d'identité et d'altérité. Les auteurs plus particulièrement étudiés seront Mariama Bâ, René Depestre, Jean-Roger Essomba, Véronique Lordinot, André Paradis, Gisèle Pineau, Jacques Roumain, Simone Schwarz-Bart et Véronique Tadjo.

<P>FREN 22619. Paris and the French Revolution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The French Revolution is one of the defining moments of modern world history. This course will explore the mix of social, political, and cultural factors which caused its outbreak in 1789 and go on to consider the overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy in 1792, the drift towards state-driven Terror in 1793-94, and the ensuing failure to achieve political stability down to the advent of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. We will view these epochal changes through the prism of France's capital city. Paris shaped the revolution in many ways, but the revolution also reshaped Paris. The urbane city of European enlightenment acquired new identities as democratic hub from 1789 and as site of popular democracy after 1793-94. In addition, the revolution generated new ways of thinking about urban living and remodelling the city for the modern age. A wide range of primary sources will be used, including visual sources (notably paintings, political cartoons and caricatures, and maps). Instructor(s): C. Jones Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Students taking FREN 22619/32619 must read French texts in French. Equivalent Course(s): HIST 32610, HIST 22610, FREN 32619 </P>

<P>FREN 22818. Figures du poète au XXème siècle (1900-1950) 100 Units. </P>

<P>En quoi consiste la crise du moi poétique théorisée par Mallarmé à la fin du XIXe siècle ? Quelles sont les formes du lyrisme « neuf et humaniste à la fois » envisagé par Apollinaire au début du XXe ? Est-ce qu'il est encore possible de dire « je » en poésie ? Face à ces changements, le poète doit reconfigurer son rapport à une histoire à la fois bouleversée et bouleversante, et retrouver sa place au milieu d'un renouvèlement littéraire désormais nécessaire. Ce cours analysera la façon dont la recherche poétique, dans son contenu comme dans sa forme, fait front au défi de la modernité sans renoncer à sa nature d'expérience de « vie intégrale » (Saint-John Perse). Par le moyen d'une variété expressive extraordinaire, le poète devient une figure souple, en mesure d'adapter son langage et son rôle aux sollicitations de la réalité. Les textes du corpus (Breton, Aragon, Char, Cocteau,Claudel, Éluard, Ponge, etc.) seront accompagnés de références critiques qui serviront de guide pour l'étudiant.À travers ces lectures on essaiera d'examiner comment le poète rend compte des expériences qui l'entourent à l'aube du XXe siècle : la guerre, le cosmopolitisme, l'appel à un engagement politique et culturel, la confluence des arts - autrement dit, tous les champs d'application d'une nouvelle forme de lyrisme. Ainsi le poète se fait-il soldat, voyageur, peintre, musicien, artiste engagé, dans un processus de métamorphose incessante et pourtant indispensable. Instructor(s): C.

<P>FREN 22910. Medieval Beasts. 100 Units. </P>

<P>From fables to bestiaries, in the margins of medieval manuscripts and at the center of animal narratives, animals abound in medieval literature. Transformations from human to animal form (or vice versa), friendships between animals and humans, the anthropomorphization of animals, invite us to interrogate the relationship between animals and humans, and to put into question the boundary (if indeed one can be defined) between the two. In this course we will read a variety of medieval texts as well as modern critical theory in order to gain a better understanding of the textual, narrative, hermeneutic, and ethical roles that animals play in medieval literature, and in our contemporary critical posture vis à vis the natural world. Instructor(s): D. Delogu Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Reading knowledge of French for all; FREN 20500 or 20503 for those seeking credit for the French major/minor.

<P>FREN 23219. The Medieval Mediterranean. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will be looking at the medieval Mediterranean world from the perspective of French literature of the 12th and 13th centuries. In direct contrast to an understanding of the Middle Ages as a time of cultural isolation and homogeneity, we will be considering some of the many points of contact between medieval France and other Mediterranean geographies, cultures, and peoples. Our readings will take us to such places as Greece and Rome, Constantinople, Cairo, Syria, Jerusalem, and Spain. The emphasis will be on texts that present these trans-Mediterranean relationships in complex and varied ways. Texts will be selected from a variety of genres, including poetry, epic, and romance, and we will also look at medieval art and art objects. Instructor(s): J. Victor Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): All of the Old French texts will be available in modern French translations. </P>

<P>FREN 23404. French Cinema of the 20's and 30's. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In our study of two decades in the history of French cinema, we will track the rise of the poetic realist style from the culture of experimentation that was alive in both the French film industry and its surrounding artistic and literary landscape. As an exercise in the excavation of a history of film style, we will consider the salient features of the socio-political, cultural, theoretical, and critical landscape that define the emergence and the apex of poetic realism, and that reveal it as a complicated nexus in the history of film aesthetics. Main texts by Dudley Andrew and Richard Abel will accompany a wide range of primary texts. Films by Epstein, L'Herbier, Buñuel, Dulluc, Dulac, Gance, Clair, Vigo, Feyder, Renoir, Duvivier, Allégret, Carné, Grémillon. Instructor(s): J.

<P>FREN 23500. Caribbean Fiction: Self-Understanding and Exoticism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Caribbean is often described as enigmatic, uncommon, and supernatural. While foreigners assume that the Caribbean is exotic, this course will explore this assumption from a Caribbean perspective. We will examine the links between Caribbean and Old World imagination, the relationship between exoticism and Caribbean notions of superstition, and the way in which the Caribbean fictional universe derives from a variety of cultural myths. Instructor(s): D. Desormeaux Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): FREN 20500 or 20503 Note(s): Taught in English.

<P>FREN 23660. Baudelaire et Flaubert: la vie littéraire en l'an 1857. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) and Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880): two young men from wealthy families, two opponents of bourgeois education, two aborted social callings, two terminal illnesses, two resounding failures before literary institutions, two adventures in love, two satanic fascinations, two notorious literary trials, two conceptions of the craft of writing, two approaches to realism, two criticisms of romantic art, two models of poetic inspiration, two aesthetics of language, two cults of Beauty, all for one and a unique literature. This seminar will be devoted to the literary life of two writers whose canon for more than a century has occupied a central place of importance in contemporary literary criticism. It will be our task to place their work in perspective within the context of the rise of modernism, which is to say, the new status of literature as of the year 1857. We shall endeavor, thus, to discern the authenticity of the creative relationship of each artist with himself and subsequently with others. The point will be to foreground three fundamental principles that will aid in grasping the evolution of the literary world under the Second Empire and under the Third Republic: literary history, writing and the elevation of the writer (Bénichou). Our work will be based on three or four texts by Baudelaire and Flaubert, it being understood that additional works of criticism will illuminate the discussion of these texts. Instructor(s): D. Desormeaux Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): FREN 20500 or 20503 Note(s): Taught in French. Discussions in both French and English. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 23660, FREN 33660 </P>

<P>FREN 23810. Memory and Identity in French Literature: Proust to the Present. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This introductory-level course takes as its point of departure Marcel Proust's conceptualization of memory as the foundation both for the self and for literature. For Proust, literary style conveys the singularity of an individual vision while rescuing experience from the contingencies of time. Literature, identity, and memory are inseparable. Later writers will follow Proust's lead in defining literature as an art of memory; but they develop this art in different ways, whether by inventing new forms of life-writing or attempting to revive, via fiction, a lived connection to history. How does memory serve as the foundation of individual or collective identities? How does fiction imagine and give form to memory, and how does literature serve as a medium for cultural memory? How do literary works register the intermittence of memory, its failings and distortions, its fragility as well as its attachment to bodies and places? We will tackle these questions through close analysis of a range of texts. In addition to Proust, authors studied may include Yourcenar, Perec, Modiano, Roubaud, and Ernaux. Instructor(s): A. James Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Taught in English. French reading knowledge desirable but not required. The course may be counted toward the French major or minor; students taking the course for French credit will do appropriate readings in French and participate in a weekly French discussion section.

<P>FREN 24110. L'écriture du quotidien au XXe siècle. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Si les avant-gardes de la première moitié du siècle prétendent &quot;changer la vie&quot; (selon l'expression de Rimbaud), c'est surtout après la Seconde Guerre mondiale que s'élaborent des théories du quotidien (Lefebvre, de Certeau). Ce cours se propose de confronter les théories du quotidien aux différentes pratiques d'écriture du quotidien et au quotidien (des surréalistes à Annie Ernaux, en passant par Michel Leiris, Roland Barthes, et Georges Perec), afin de mieux cerner la spécificité des approches littéraires du réel.

<P>FREN 25000. Molière. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Molière crafted a new form of satirical comedy that revolutionized European theater, though it encountered strong opposition from powerful institutions. We will read the plays in the context of the literary and dramatic traditions that Molière reworked (farce, commedia dell'arte, Latin comedy, Spanish Golden Age theater, satiric poetry, the novel), while considering the relationship of laughter to social norms, as well as the performance practices and life of theater in Molière's day.

<P>FREN 25220. Pour une sociologie de Rabelais. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Nous aborderons l'œuvre de Rabelais à partir d'une lecture contextuelle de Gargantua et Pantagruel (les deux romans que nous lirons dans ce sours). Le but de ce cours est de présenter le contexte social, politique, économique et religieux de la première moitié du XVIe siècle en reliant les thèmes choisis (guerre, genre, utopie, éducation, amitié, écocomie, etc.), à des problèmes plus modernes. Car Rabelais nous permet aussi d'adresser les grands thèmes de la société française et occidentale contemporaine. Nous étudierons ainsi l'écriture du corps, l'organisation sociale de l'Ancien régime, les premières théories économiques, la découverte du Nouveau Monde et l'exploration de l'altérité. Nous lirons deux romans de Rabelais: Gargantua et Pantagruel. Instructor(s): P. Desan Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): FREN 20300 Note(s): Taught in French.

<P>FREN 26043. Versailles: Art, Power, Resistance and the Sun King's Palace. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles helped shape European culture and history from the Baroque era through the French Revolution, and it continues to animate contemporary international culture. How does this astounding assemblage of architecture, visual arts, landscaping, performance spaces and political arenas reveal transformations in cultural tastes and power arrangements over the centuries? How do literature and art alternately support and subvert absolutist power and state propaganda? To respond we will range across media, from the bitingly satiric comedies and provocative tragedies of the 17th century (Molière, Racine), through royal edicts regulating colonial slavery and first-hand accounts of the 1789 Women's March on Versailles that upended the monarchy, and finally to cinematic depictions (from Jean Renoir to Sophia Coppola) and experimental palace installations by the world's leading contemporary artists (Jeff Koons, Anish Kapoor, etc.). While this course will broadly introduce major themes of French and European culture and history of the early-modern and modern periods, students are also encouraged to pursue in-depth projects in their own areas of interest, from history and political philosophy to the visual arts, theater and performance, and literature.

<P>FREN 27400. Autobiographies Maghrébines: de l'Ecriture de Soi à l'Ecriture de l'Histoire. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Dès sa naissance, la littérature maghrébine d'expression française s'est distinguée par son ancrage dans le contexte historique, politique et socio-culturel des trois pays du Maghreb que sont le Maroc, l'Algérie et la Tunisie. Souvent, l'écriture de soi a donné lieu à une (ré)écriture de l'Histoire, mettant l'individuel et le collectif en dialogue permanent. L'autobiographie, par exemple, devient le champ d'une exploration simultanée des identités individuelle et collective, le lieu d'un témoignage littéraire autour de l'expérience coloniale et de ses conséquences, ou encore de la confrontation entre le poids persistant de la tradition et le désir de liberté et de changement. En se racontant, l'écrivain maghrébin restitue les tensions qui hantent l'espace et la mémoire partagés tout en proposant des voies de reconstruction à travers la révolte, le désir, et le travail de la langue. En s'appuyant sur un corpus d'œuvres marquantes de la littérature maghrébine d'expression française (Albert Memmi, Driss Chraïbi, Kateb Yacine, Assia Djebar, Fatima Mernissi, Abdellatif Laâbi), ce séminaire sera consacré essentiellement à la question du rapport entre écriture personnelle et écriture de l'Histoire dans un contexte maghrébin. On s'interrogera en particulier sur les stratégies narratives et les outils esthétiques mis en œuvre par les auteurs maghrébins pour représenter, affronter ou déconstruire une réalité d'ordre historique, politique ou socio-culturel.

<P>FREN 29100. Pascal and Simone Weil. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century and Simone Weil in the twentieth formulated a compelling vision of the human condition, torn between greatness and misery. They showed how human imperfection coexists with the noblest callings, how attention struggles with distraction and how individuals can be rescued from their usual reliance on public opinion and customary beliefs. Both thinkers point to the religious dimension of human experience and suggest unorthodox ways of approaching it. We will also study an important text by Gabriel Marcel emphasizing human coexistence and cooperation. Instructor(s): T. Pavel Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Undergraduates must be in their third or fourth year. Note(s): The course will be taught in English.

<P>ITAL 22900. Vico's New Science. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course offers a close reading of Giambattista Vico's masterpiece, New Science (1744)-a work that sets out to refute &quot;all opinions hitherto held about the principles of humanity.&quot; Vico, who is acknowledged as the most resolute scourge of any form of rationalism, breathed new life into rhetoric, imagination, poetry, metaphor, history, and philology in order to promote in his readers that originary &quot;wonder&quot; and &quot;pathos&quot; which sets human beings on the search for truth. However, Vico argues, the truths that are most available and interesting to us are the ones humanity &quot;authored&quot; by means of its culture and history-creating activities. For this reason the study of myth and folklore as well as archeology, anthropology, and ethnology must all play a role in the rediscovery of man. The New Science builds an &quot;alternative philosophy&quot; for a new age and reads like a &quot;novel of formation&quot; recounting the (hi)story of the entire human race and our divine ancestors. In Vico, a prophetic spirit, one recognizes the fulfillment of the Renaissance, the spokesperson of a particular Enlightenment, the precursor of the Kantian revolution, and the forefather of the philosophy of history (Herder, Hegel, and Marx). The New Science remained a strong source of inspiration in the twentieth century (Cassirer, Gadamer, Berlin, Joyce, Beckett, etc.) and may prove relevant in disclosing our own responsibilities in postmodernity.

<P>ITAL 23101. Early Italian Lyric: Dante and His Rivals. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines Dante's complicated relationship with other contemporary and near-contemporary lyric poets. In particular, we examine Dante's texts as part of a dense web of contending vernacular discourses instead of as the final word or telos of our studies. For this reason, special emphasis is given to the sonnet form as a ritualized genre in which poetic communities are formed and contending philosophical, political, and sociological visions of society are constructed and deconstructed. The role of books and manuscript culture is especially important as we try to understand the material production and reception of the emergent vernacular literature, and its role and function in late medieval urban Italy. Instructor(s): J. Steinberg Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): Interested undergraduates should contact instructor before the first day of class Note(s): The first hour will be dedicated to close reading of poem/s in Italian.

<P>ITAL 24218. Unveiling Chivalry: Chivalric literature in Medieval and Early Modern Europe (1100-1600) 100 Units. </P>

<P>The myth of chivalry has been fostered and reshaped from the Middle Ages to the present with damsels-indistress, knights' self-sacrifice, adventures and courtly love. But how was chivalry in eleventh- or sixteenth-century literature different from today's perception? What changed between historical chivalry and its fictional representation? This course aims to challenge the narrative of chivalry as one characterized by rise and fall, or a movement from virtue to parody, or spirituality to skepticism. We will see instead how each text provides multiple layers of interpretation and how chivalry is redefined across time and space. Exploring the notion of chivalry will also allow us to focus on the so-called &quot;spirituality&quot; of the Middle Ages and the relationship between the Renaissance and the past.

<P>ITAL 25218. Reading Nonhuman Animals: A Challenge to Anthropocentrism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How can we &quot;read&quot; a literary nonhuman animal? In what ways does literature deal with ethical and political issues concerning nonhuman animals? What does it mean to live in a multicultural and multispecies world? What does it mean to be &quot;human&quot;? In this course we will ask these and other related questions as they are presented and represented in Italian 20th century literary texts, read alongside philosophical writings, scholarly essays, and visual materials. While maintaining a focus on Italian literature, a comparative approach involving literary works of non-Italian authors will be key in understanding the pervasiveness of the problems that have caused our detachment from nature and our broken relationship with nonhuman animals. We will closely analyze and critically evaluate the works of several authors, including those by Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Anna Maria Ortese, Elsa Morante, Italo Svevo, Alice Walker, and Franz Kafka, giving particular attention to techniques of close reading. A thematic approach will enable us to explore a large number of critical discourses, from the moral status of nonhuman animals to the long-held assumptions regarding the anthropocentric set of values that have defined (Western) culture. We will also take into consideration different theoretical frameworks such as posthumanist theory and gender studies in order to discuss and evaluate the selected texts from different perspectives and entry points.

<P>ITAL 26500. Renaissance Demonology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we analyze the complex concept of demonology according to early modern European culture from a theological, historical, philosophical, and literary point of view. The term 'demon' in the Renaissance encompasses a vast variety of meanings. Demons are hybrids. They are both the Christian devils, but also synonyms for classical deities, and Neo-platonic spiritual beings. As far as Christian theology is concerned, we read selections from Augustine's and Thomas Aquinas's treatises, some complex exorcisms written in Italy, and a recent translation of the infamous Malleus maleficarum, the most important treatise on witch-hunt. We pay close attention to the historical evolution of the so-called witch-craze in Europe through a selection of the best secondary literature on this subject, with special emphasis on Michel de Certeau's The Possession at Loudun. We also study how major Italian and Spanish women mystics, such as Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and Teresa of Avila, approach the issue of demonic temptation and possession. As far as Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophy is concerned, we read selections from Marsilio Ficino's Platonic Theology and Girolamo Cardano's mesmerizing autobiography. We also investigate the connection between demonology and melancholy through a close reading of the initial section of Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and Cervantes's short story The Glass Graduate (El licenciado Vidriera).

<P>ITAL 27500. Women and the Mafia in Contemporary Italian Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will examine how gender dynamics within mafia contexts have been represented in a selection of Italian films. Students will engage in cinematic analysis by drawing from sociological and psychological studies on female roles in relation to organized crime. Both these fields, sociology and psychology, have underscored the important part that women play in relation to the mafia, notwithstanding the rigid patriarchal structure that allows only male affiliation. Although focusing primarily on Sicilian mafia, this course will include information on other types of Italian mafia, namely Camorra, 'Ndrangheta and Sacra Corona Unita. Vocabulary in Italian to identify formal elements of the films will be provided throughout the course. Instructor(s): V.

<P>ITAL 27700. The (Auto)Biography of a Nation: Francesco De Sanctis and Benedetto Croce. 100 Units. </P>

<P>At its core, this course examines the making and legacy of Francesco De Sanctis's History of Italian Literature (1870-71), a work that distinguished literary critic René Wellek defined as &quot;the finest history of any literature ever written&quot; and &quot;an active instrument of aesthetic evolution.&quot; We will read the History in the larger context of De Sanctis's corpus, including his vast epistolary exchanges, autobiographical writings, and so-called Critical Essays in order to detail his reform of Hegelian aesthetics, his redefinition of the intellectual's task after the perceived exhaustion of the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic moments, and his campaign against the bent toward erudition, philology, and antiquarianism in 19th-century European scholarship. We will compare De Sanctis's methodology to that of his scholarly models in France (Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred Mézières) and Germany (Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Georg Voigt) to explore De Sanctis's claim that literary criticisms - not just literary cultures - are &quot;national.&quot; In the second part of the course, we assess Benedetto Croce's appropriation of De Sanctis in his Aesthetics (1902), arguably the last, vastly influential work in its genre and we conclude with Antonio Gramsci's use of De Sanctis for the regeneration of a literary savvy Marxism or philosophy of praxis.

<P>ITAL 28219. Negative Empathy, Catharsis, Fear: An Intermedial Approach to Tragedy and Its Transformations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Literature on empathy has enormously increased in recent decades, especially from the point of view of neuroscience and neuro-aesthetics. Scholars, however, have been focusing on the ethical dimension of empathy: on the identification with the victims, which is also highlighted by the political use of this concept. The course focuses instead on the (more or less latent) empathy with negative characters, which can have a strong cathartic and social function, as a discharge of destructive and self-destructive drives, and is often linked to the representation of fear and other strong emotions. The preliminary step is a theoretical introduction to the category of empathy, from its first eighteenth-century conceptions to new aesthetic and psychoanalytic elaborations at the beginning of twentieth century (especially Theodor Lipp), up to recent developments coming from the neurosciences. Other parallel issues to be introduced are catharsis, identification, and discharge. Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, Giuseppe Verdi and Pier Paolo Pasolini will be studied, as well as the TV series &quot;Breaking Bad,&quot; which brilliantly exemplifies what negative empathy means today.

<P>SPAN 21803. Introducción a las literaturas hispánicas: textos españoles contemporáneos. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Este curso ofrecerá un amplio panorama de las literaturas españolas de los siglos XIX y XX. Buena parte de la historia cultural de España ha estado marcada por la ansiedad respecto al supuesto atraso cultural, político, social y económico del país. La modernidad se convierte así en objeto de deseo y de disputa cultural para los intelectuales españoles que luchan por definir en qué consiste y cómo alcanzarla. Este es el tema que nos guiará, de manera flexible, por las obras de autores como Mariano José de Larra, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, Rosalía de Castro, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Leopoldo Alas Clarín, Antonio Machado, Federico García Lorca, Ana María Matute, Max Aub y Manuel Rivas, entre otros, complementadas por algunas películas. En relación con este tema principal, se explorarán también el lugar del campo y la ciudad en la imaginación moderna, la cuestión nacional, las luchas por la emancipación de la mujer, las tensión creativa entre tradición y vanguardia artística, o los debates sobre la historia y la memoria del pasado reciente de España.

<P>SPAN 22218. De capa y espada: Martial Arts Culture in the Spanish Golden Age. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will study the surprising interconnections between literature and Hispanic martial arts in the early modern period (16th and 17th centuries). The course is divided in three units. In Unit 1, we will discuss general issues regarding the practice of fencing and other early modern martial arts, as well as its social and ideological implications. In Unit 2 we will examine the theme of arms and letters by analyzing two philosophical fencing treatises by Jerónimo Carranza and Luis Pacheco-two of the most famous swordsmen in early modern Europe. We will read this masters in the light of the most renowned literary authors of the moment, from Garcilaso de la Vega in the 16th century to Miguel de Cervantes and Francisco de Quevedo in the 17th century. In Unit 3, we will study the importance of fencing in the cultural (re)construction of concepts such as honor, race, gender, and other social issues. To this end, we will explore the narrative production of Maria de Zayas-a pioneer of literary feminism-and two plays by Lope de Vega and Andrés Claramonte. Instructor(s): M.

<P>SPAN 23201. Art, Ekphrasis, and Myth in Early Modern Spanish Theater. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the early modern age, the verbal had a strong visual component. Poets and playwrights utilized the sense of sight since it was the highest of the Platonic senses and a mnemonic key to lead spectators to remember vividly what they had read or heard, long before spectacle plays were in fashion. One important technique for visualization was ekphrasis, the description of an art work within a text. Often, to perform was to imitate the affects, sentiments and poses of a painting. For this purpose, playwrights such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega and Calderón often turned to the mythological canvases of the Italian Renaissance along with the portraits of great rulers and images of battle. The class will examine the uses of art onstage: mnemonic, mimetic, political, religious comic, tragic, lyric and licentious. It will also delve into different forms of ekphrasis from the notional to the dramatic and from the fragmented to the reversed. Although the course will focus on Spanish plays of the early modern period, it will also include ancient treatises by Cicero, and Pliny as well as Renaissance mnemonic treatises by Della Porta. The course will be in English. Reading knowledge of Spanish is required since plays will be read in the original. Those taking the class for credit in Spanish must write their final paper in Spanish.

<P>SPAN 23219. Leyes del deseo: miradas queer en España y Latinoamérica. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will follow the traces of queer voices throughout different textual and artistic manifestations from poetry to scenic arts, from narrative to cinema - with the aim to draw an intersectional, unstable and transnational map of rebel textualities and visualities in both the Latin American countries and Spain. As a lateral way of looking, queerness brings together, not without conflict, activism and academia, theory, action and creation. During the course, we will address how these Hispanic queer works problematize notions such as the canon, the tradition, the sociopolitical structures or the idea of family and lineage. By questioning them, we will see how not only these works challenge the fundamental basis of social, political and literary order, but also unfold a fluid, productive alternative to neoliberalism.

<P>SPAN 23619. Music and Ethnic Authenticity in Mexico and Cuba. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Music and Ethnic Authenticity in Mexico and Cuba, 1900-1950 This course uses literary, artistic, and musical materials to compare visions of Afro-Cuban and Native Mexican cultures as imagined by artists in this time period. Some of the issues in the political and cultural changes behind the remarkable new repertoires created in these two countries include nationalism, nativism, modernism, and relations with France and the U.S. We look at representations of these non-European cultures in paintings, &quot;high-culture&quot; music, anthropological research, and literature. Graduate students will have longer papers and more intense readings. Students will prepare one (oral) reading report, take two short ID/listening quizzes, and prepare a final paper due on Tuesday of Week 11. Instructor(s): Robert Kendrick Terms Offered: Autumn.

<P>This course will be focusing on Catalan culture and translation in order to address different aspects of translation history, ethics and practice in relation to minority and minoritized languages, identities and communities. The classes would seek to explore and analyze what happens to Catalan literature, film, theatre and performance in translation into other languages (in particular in the Anglophone world), as well as reflect on changing approaches to and affordances of translation within, between and beyond the Catalan-speaking territories in diverse situations of language contact and intercultural encounter involving Catalan-speaking individuals and communities. The course will be structured in four parts: Catalonia in-translation; invisible landscapes; traumatic translations; and cartographies of desire. Instructor(s): H.

<P>SPAN 24202. Don Quixote. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course will provide a close reading of Cervantes' Don Quijote and discuss its links with Renaissance art and Early Modern narrative genres. On the one hand, Don Quijote can be viewed in terms of prose fiction, from the ancient Greek romances to the medieval books of knights errant and the Renaissance pastoral novels. On the other hand, Don Quijote exhibits a desire for Italy through the utilization of Renaissance art. Beneath the dusty roads of La Mancha and within Don Quijote's chivalric fantasies, the careful reader will come to appreciate glimpses of images with Italian designs. Instructor(s): F. de Armas, T.

<P>SPAN 25818. Signs of the Americas. 100 Units. </P>

<P>It is a common misconception that literature can happen only in the alphabet or that such non-alphabetical literatures have long ago ceased to be made. This course corrects such misconceptions by exploring modern and contemporary literatures that have been written with, or in response to, such sign-systems as pictographs, hieroglyphs, totem poles, wampum, and khipu. Focusing especially on the sign-systems of the native Americas, this class gives students a basic introduction to the mechanics of these signs, in order to discuss how these mechanics might be at play in the works of such poets, writers, and artists as Anni Albers, Simon Ortiz, Gerald Vizenor, Louise Erdrich, John Borrows, Charles Olson, Bill Reid, Robert Bringhurst, Fred Wah, Clayton Eshleman, Cy Twombly, Joaquín Torres-Garcia, Cecilia Vicuña, and others. Key questions to be asked include: how are these signs an interface for contemporary histories of nation and capital? And: how do those material histories and their identifications in race, gender, kinship, and ecology change when cast in the mechanics, tropes, and figures of these signs? As a &quot;Makers Seminar,&quot; this course will include creative alternatives to the standard analytical college paper.

<P>SPAN 29117. Theater and Performance in Latin America. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is performance? How has it been used in Latin America and the Caribbean? This course is an introduction to theatre and performance in Latin America and the Caribbean that will examine the intersection of performance and social life. While we will place particular emphasis on performance art, we will examine some theatrical works. We ask: how have embodied practice, theatre and visual art been used to negotiate ideologies of race, gender and sexuality? What is the role of performance in relation to systems of power? How has it negotiated dictatorship, military rule, and social memory? Ultimately, the aim of this course is to give students an overview of Latin American performance including blackface performance, indigenous performance, as well as performance and activism.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers courses in the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Czech, Polish, and Russian languages and literatures, and other Slavic and East European cultures, leading to a BA in Russian and East European Studies. The BA degree program is designed to provide students with skills and facility in the languages and cultures of the region. It is intended for students preparing for graduate work, those planning a career in government or industry, and those whose primary aim is to master Russian and East European cultures in the original languages. Students interested in the program are encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies. The contact information for the current director of undergraduate studies may be obtained by consulting the departmental website at slavic.uchicago.edu. </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Russian and East European Studies. </P>

<P>General Education </P>

<P>Depending on the language(s) of concentration, it is recommended that students majoring in REES satisfy the general education requirement in civilization studies with SOSC 24000-24100 (http:// collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=SOSC%2024000-24100) Introduction to Russian Civilization I-II or HIST 13100-13200-13300 (http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=HIST%2013100-13200-13300) History of Western Civilization I-II-III. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students who are majoring or minoring in Russian and East European Studies must receive a quality grade in all courses taken to meet requirements in the major or minor. Nonmajors and nonminors have the option of taking courses on a P/F basis at the discretion of the instructor (except for language courses, which must be taken for quality grades). For the major a minimum of seven courses must bear University of Chicago course numbers and be completed for quality grades. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>To be eligible for honors in Russian and East European Studies, students must maintain an overall College GPA of 3.25 or higher and of 3.5 or higher in the major.

<P>Equivalent Course(s): BCSN 31103 </P>

<P>BCSN 21101. Advanced Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian: Language through Fiction. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Advanced BCS courses encompass both the 3rd and 4th years of language study, with the focus changed from language structure and grammar to issues in interdisciplinary content. The courses are not in sequence. Language through Fiction is designed to help students and instructors over one of the most difficult hurdles in language training-the transition from working through lessons in a textbook to reading unedited texts. Literature represents the greatest development of the expressive possibilities of a language and reveals the bounds within which language operates. The texts will immerse motivated language students in a complete language experience, as the passages and related exercises present the language's structure on every page. Students will learn how to engage the natural, organic language of a literary text across a variety of styles and themes. The course assumes that students are familiar with basic grammar and vocabulary, as well as both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. It is particularly appealing to students who are interested in the literature, history, and anthropology of the region.

<P>BCSN 21200. Advanced Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian: Language Through Film. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Advanced BCS courses encompass both the 3rd and 4th years of language study, with the focus changed from language structure and grammar to issues in interdisciplinary content. The courses are not in sequence. This course addresses the theme of Yugoslav and Post-Yugoslav identity through discussion and interpretation based on selected films, documentaries, images, and related texts-historical and literary, popular press, advertisements, screenplays, and literature e on film. Emphasis is on interpersonal communication as well as the interpretation and production of language in written and oral forms. The course engages in systematic grammar review, along with introduction of some new linguistic topics, with constant practice in writing and vocabulary enrichment. The syllabus includes the screening of six films, each from a different director, region, and period, starting with Cinema Komunisto (2012), a documentary by Mila Turajlic. This film will be crucial for understanding how Yugoslav cinema was born and how, in its origins, it belongs to what a later cinephile, Fredric Jameson, has called a &quot;geopolitical aesthetic.&quot; We shall investigate the complex relationship between aesthetics and ideology in the Yugoslav and Post-Yugoslav cinema, and pay close attention to aesthetic conceptions and concrete formal properties, and more importantly, to language, narrative logic, and style.

Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnography of the city, we will consider processes of urban destruction and renewal, practices of branding spaces and identities, urban life as praxis, art and design movements, architectural histories and styles, metropolitan citizenship, and the broader politics of space. The course is complemented by cultural and historical media, guest speakers, and virtual tours. Classes are held in English. No knowledge of BCS is required. However, this module can fulfill a language requirement or simply further the study of BCS with additional weekly sections, materials, discussions, and presentations in the target language.

This course, which encompasses both the 3rd and 4th years of language study, changes the focus from language structure and grammar to issues in interdisciplinary content. Each module foregrounds a different theme and leverages a different medium-fiction, film, art and architecture, urban anthropology, etc. Unlike the first- and second-year courses, advanced BCS courses are not in sequence, and students can take them randomly, over the course of two academic years to fulfill their 3rd and/or 4th year of language study. This year's sequences are as follows: Language through Fiction-Autumn Quarter 2017; Language through Film-Winter Quarter 2018; Language through Art and Architecture-Spring Quarter 2018. The course is complemented with cultural and historical media from the Balkans, guest speakers, cultural events, and field trips Equivalent Course(s): BCSN 31403 </P>

<P>In Poland, the divide between high and low strata of culture was not negotiable until the postwar advance of mass culture and technology, facilitated by the void created by the disappearing Polish folklore and social programs such as a systemic building of a classless society. Therefore, this course's main focus is on the trajectory of negotiations and mutual impact between these two cultural spheres, which in turn created a new set of cultural references and associations. On the one hand, the course offers an analysis of this complex interaction, through cinematic adaptations, between Polish canonical literature and contemporary cinema; while on the other, it discusses the young generation of Polish writers' recent engagement of youth culture, consumerism, popnationalism, and the standardized subculture of nouveau-riches. The course discusses main theoretical approaches to the popular culture; all materials are in English. Instructor(s): B. Shallcross Terms Offered: Winter 2013 Equivalent Course(s): POLI 37100 </P>

We also work on developing our abilities to paraphrase, narrate, describe, support opinions, hypothesize, discuss abstract topics, and handle linguistically unfamiliar situations (in spoken and written format). Classes conducted in Russian. Course-specific grammar issues are covered during drill sessions (weekly) and office hours (by appointment).

<P>Being alienated from myself, as painful as that may be, provides me with that exquisite distance within which perverse pleasure begins, as well as the possibility of my imagining and thinking,&quot; writes Julia Kristeva in Strangers to Ourselves, the book from which this course takes its title. The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writers struggle for breath - speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else. Join us as we explore the pain, the struggle, the failure and the triumph of emigration and exile.

<P>REES 13803. The Soviet Union. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature. In the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation--from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab--will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; Stalinism, its origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.

This intensive text-centered and discussion-based course attempts to supersede the univocal obsession with the novel's pedophiliac plot as such by concerning itself above all with the novel's language: language as failure, as mania, and as conjuration.

<P>REES 20011. Gogol. 100 Units. </P>

<P>One of the most enigmatic authors in Russian literature, Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) was hailed in his own lifetime as the leading prose writer of his generation, a brilliant comic writer, and the innovator of the new school of Russian Naturalism/Realism. Since his death, Gogol has been the subject of ever-greater critical controversy. Reading representative works from each period of Gogol's career, including his Petersburg Tales and Dead Souls, we will trace the author's creative development and consider it in relation to his biography and early 19thcentury Russian literary and social history. We will work together to identify the characteristic features of Gogol's narrative technique as well as the challenges to interpretation his texts pose. No knowledge of Russian required.

<P>REES 20013. Dostoevsky. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Dostoevsky was an inveterate risk-taker, not only at the baccarat tables of the Grand Casino in Baden-Baden, but in his personal life, his political activities, and his artistic endeavors. This course is intended to investigate his two greatest wagers: on the presence of the divine in the world and on the power of artistic form to convey and articulate this presence. Dostoevsky's wager on form is evident even in his early, relatively conventional texts, like The Double. It intensifies after his decade-long sojourn in Siberia, exploding in works like The Notes from Underground, which one-and-a-half centuries later remains an aesthetic and philosophical provocation of immense power. The majority of the course will focus on Dostoevsky's later novels. In Crime and Punishment Dostoevsky adapts suspense strategies to create a metaphysical thriller, while in The Demons he pairs a study of nihilism with the deformation of the novel as a genre. Through close readings of these works we will trace how Dostoevsky's formal experimentation created new ways of exploring realms of existence that traditionally belonged to philosophy and theology. The results were never comfortable or comforting; we will focus on interpreting Dostoevsky's metaphysical provocations.

To this purpose we will also read selected texts from such contemporaries as Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx, as well as a sampling of critical responses to Dostoevsky's novel and its adaptations in other media.

<P>REES 21000. Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorial style and concepts that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. Entangled in an ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish author is a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowicz applied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth, as we focus on Gombrowicz's novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings. With an insight from recent criticism of these primary texts, we seek answers to the more general question: What makes this author a philosopher?

<P>REES 21006. Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Course centers on Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel's relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad's interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative's ideology we discuss Conrad's historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 21006, REES 31006, ENGL 31006, FNDL 21006 </P>

<P>REES 21101. Advanced Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian: Language through Fiction. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Advanced BCS courses encompass both the 3rd and 4th years of language study, with the focus changed from language structure and grammar to issues in interdisciplinary content. The courses are not in sequence. Language through Fiction is designed to help students and instructors over one of the most difficult hurdles in language training-the transition from working through lessons in a textbook to reading unedited texts. Literature represents the greatest development of the expressive possibilities of a language and reveals the bounds within which language operates. The texts will immerse motivated language students in a complete language experience, as the passages and related exercises present the language's structure on every page. Students will learn how to engage the natural, organic language of a literary text across a variety of styles and themes. The course assumes that students are familiar with basic grammar and vocabulary, as well as both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. It is particularly appealing to students who are interested in the literature, history, and anthropology of the region.

This course concerns itself with the era in images, film, literature, pop culture, plastic arts, and philosophy from conditions leading to the rebellion known as the Prague Spring, the clampdown in its aftermath known as &quot;Normalization,&quot; and the movements simmering in the &quot;parallel polis&quot; that led to the &quot;Velvet Revolution.&quot; Mass culture, underground culture, and official culture are all confronted in seminar discussion.

This course will trace the encounter with cinematic modernity through the analysis of individual films by major directors, including (but not limited to) Shukhrat Abbasov, Melis Ubukeev, Ali Khamraev, Tolomush Okeev, Sergei Paradzhanov, Gulshad Omarova. In addition to situating the films in their cultural and historical situations, close attention will be paid to the sources of Central Asian cinema in cinemas both adjacent and distant; to the ways in which cinema enables a distinct encounter with modernity; and to the cinematic construction of Central Asia as a cultural entity.

<P>In this course we will explore thematic, aesthetic, and theoretical aspects of animated film in socialist Central and Eastern Europe from the 1920s through the late 1980s. Rather than attempting an exhaustive survey of the region's animated films and their contexts, we will bring a sampling of films from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria together with readings from the growing body of theoretical and critical works on animated film in hopes of building an understanding of animated film as a medium and of what does (or does not) make the animated films of socialist Central and Eastern Europe unique. </P>

<P>REES 24414. Soviet Science Fiction. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In the Soviet Union, science fiction played an integral part in intellectual debates about the best way to engage with the new realities of the twentieth century. This literary and cinematic genre was thought capable of reinventing the lives, realties and even beliefs of the Soviets. This course will study the cultural, historical, and political contexts of science fiction from the Soviet Union through literature such as Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopian novel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), Ivan Efremov's The Andromeda Nebula (1956), and the work Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, as well as through films such as Iakov Protazanov's Aelita (1924), the first Soviet science fiction film, along with later imaginings of space travel such as Pavel Klushantsev's Road to the Stars (1957), and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972)-a mysterious, human drama set in space. The primary goal of the course is to study how Soviet writers and filmmakers utilizes science fiction to interpret and/or comment upon their present historical moment? What alternatives to Soviet reality were proposed through science fiction? Lastly, how did science fiction texts and films relate to scientific research in the Soviet Union, especially the Soviet space program? Equivalent Course(s): CMST 24414 </P>

<P>REES 24415. The Intelligentsia: On Slavic Social Thought. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Isaiah Berlin described the notion of the Intelligentsia as &quot;arguably Russia's greatest contribution to world civilization.&quot; But just how culturally specific-or, alternatively, universal-is that concept? Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a &quot;public intellectual.&quot; How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order to relay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?

<P>REES 24416. Russian Literature in the Composer's Ear. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The dialogue between author and composer in Russia is probably without parallel in other national traditions. This course will examine the musical transposition of literary works in Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Shchedrin. While Stravinsky makes use of oral tradition and folk culture, our other examples will be drawn from classic literary works, primarily from the 19th century. We will integrate close textual readings with focused analyses of the musical pieces, while devoting considerable attention to contexts of composition and reception. Throughout, we will be concerned with cultural and socio-political events from the mid-19th century to the fall of Soviet Union-events that colored the performance and interpretation of these works and often set the tone for their composition as well.

<P>REES 25600. Realism in Russia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>From the 1830s to the 1890s, most Russian prose writers and playwrights were either engaged in the European-wide cultural movement known as &quot;realistic school&quot; which set for itself the task of engaging with social processes from the standpoint of political ideologies. The ultimate goal of this course is to distill more precise meanings of &quot;realism,&quot; &quot;critical realism,&quot;and &quot;naturalism&quot; in nineteenth-century Russian through analysis of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Goncharov, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Kuprin.

<P>REES 25602. Russian Short Fiction: Experiments in Form. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Russian literature is known for the sweeping epics that Henry James once dubbed the &quot;loose baggy monsters." However, in addition to the famed 'doorstop novels,' the Russian literary canon also has a long tradition of innovative short fiction-of short stories and novellas that experiment with forms of storytelling and narration. This course focuses on such works, as well as the narrative strategies and formal devices that allow these short stories and novellas to be both effective and economical. Throughout the quarter, we will read short fiction from a variety of Russian authors and examine the texts that establish the tradition of Russian short fiction as well as those that push its boundaries. This course will serve as a general survey of Russian Literature, as well as a focused introduction to a particular genre in that tradition. Although predominantly discussion-based, the class will also include short lectures by the instructor to introduce students to the broader historical contexts of the course texts, and to sample diverse theoretical approaches to those texts.

<P>REES 25603. Media and Power in the Age of Putin and Trump. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Over the past 200 years, various political and cultural regimes of Russia have systematically exploited the gap between experience and representation to create their own mediated worlds--from the tight censorship of the imperial and Soviet periods to the propaganda of the Soviet period and the recent use of media simulacra for strategic geopolitical advantage. During this same period state control of media has been used to seclude Russia from the advancement of liberalism, market economics, individual rights, modernist art, Freud, Existentialism, and, more recently, Western discourses of inclusion, sustainability, and identity. Examining this history, it is sometimes difficult to discern whether the architects of Russian culture have been hopelessly backward or shrewd phenomenologists, keenly aware of the relativity of experience and of their ability to shape it. This course will explore the worlds that these practices produce, with an emphasis on Russia's recent confrontations with Western culture and power, and including various practices of subversion of media control, such as illegal printing and circulation. Texts for the course will draw from print, sound, and visual media, and fields of analysis will include aesthetics, cultural history, and media theory.

<P>REES 25701. Memoir in Modernism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course serves as an introduction to Russian and European modernism, taking the fictionalized autobiography as its focus. In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers' approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely's Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam's The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others. Supplementary readings will include texts by Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, Gérard Genette and Mikhail Bakhtin. No knowledge of Russian or French is required, but an additional discussion section can be arranged for students with sufficient reading fluency in Russian. Equivalent Course(s): CMLT 25702 </P>

<P>The Soviet Union was a world in pictures, enabled and shaped by the media revolutions that accompanied every major period in its history, from the rise of cinema to the dawn of the internet. We will try to see communism as history and as promise, and to see how this relates to our own desire for social change in our own worlds. We will examine the interaction between Marxism, state power and image culture by focusing on key moments from the entire lifespan of the USSR (1917-1991) and from across the range of media,from graphic art and film to their reflections in literature and aesthetic theory. In addition to class readings and discussions, we will be able to engage directly with a vast array of material at exhibits of graphic art (three on campus, three more across the city) and film series that will be conducted in fall 2011 as part of the city-wide Soviet Arts Experience.

<P>REES 26019. Symbolism and Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In his 1896 essay on cinema, Russian writer Maxim Gorky described the new medium to &quot;madness or symbolism.&quot; The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was a dominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly) that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and even invisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention to French and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematic medium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and the mystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relates to notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and some American) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage to Andrei Tarkovsky.

<P>Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) is widely considered the founding genius of modern Russian literature, especially in his lyric and epic poetry; Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) injected a manic strain of magic realism to create the modern Russian novel. Apollon Grigor'ev later called Pushkin &quot;our everything&quot;; Dostoevsky claimed &quot;We all emerged out of Gogol's 'Overcoat.'&quot; During the quarter we will read a representative selection of both writers' major works, including Pushkin's verse novel Evgenii Onegin, verse epic The Bronze Horseman, and novel The Captain's Daughter, and Gogol's novel Dead Souls in addition to his fantastic stories &quot;The Nose&quot; and &quot;The Overcoat.&quot; We will focus on close readings of the texts, paying particular attention to their experiments with literary form, as well as attending to their broader historical contextualization. We will focus particularly on the conceptions of realism projected by the texts and imposed by later readers. All readings will be in English translation.

<P>REES 26064. Revolution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Revolution primarily denotes radical political change, but this definition is both too narrow and too broad. Too broad, because since the late eighteenth century revolution has been associated specifically with an emancipatory politics, from American democracy to Soviet communism. Too narrow, because revolutionary political change is always accompanied by change in other spheres, from philosophy to everyday life. We investigate the history of revolution from 1776 to the present, with a particular focus on the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, in order to ascertain how social revolutions have been constituted, conducted, and enshrined in political and cultural institutions. We also ask what the conditions and prospects of revolution are today. Readings will be drawn from a variety of fields, from philosophy to social history. Most readings will be primary documents, from Rousseau and Marx to Bill Ayers, but will also include major statements in the historiography of revolution.

<P>REES 26068. The Underground: Alienation, Mobilization, Resistance. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The ancient and multivalent image of the underground has crystallized over the last two centuries to denote sites of disaffection from-and strategies of resistance to-dominant social, political and cultural systems. We will trace the development of this metaphor from the Underground Railroad in the mid-1800s and the French Resistance during World War II to the Weather Underground in the 1960s-1970s, while also considering it as a literary and artistic concept, from Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground and Ellison's Invisible Man to Chris Marker's film La Jetée and Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker. Alongside with such literary and cinematic tales, drawing theoretical guidance from refuseniks from Henry David Thoreau to Guy Debord, this course investigates how countercultural spaces become-or fail to become-sites of political resistance, and also how dissenting ideologies give rise to countercultural spaces. We ask about the relation between social deviance (the failure to meet social norms, whether willingly or unwittingly) and political resistance, especially in the conditions of late capitalism and neo-colonialism, when countercultural literature, film and music (rock, punk, hip-hop, DIY aesthetics etc.) get absorbed into-and coopted by-the hegemonic socio-economic system. In closing we will also consider contemporary forms of dissidence-from Pussy Riot to Black Lives Matter-that rely both on the vulnerability of individual bodies and global communication networks.

<P>On the fiftieth anniversary of 1968 our course couples the study of revolutionary films (and films about revolution) with seminal readings on revolutionary ideology and on the theory of film and video. The goal will be to articulate the mechanics of revolution and its representation in time-based media. Students will produce a video or videos adapting the rich archive of revolutionary film for today's situation. The films screened will be drawn primarily from Soviet and US cinema, from the 1920s to the present day, proceeding more or less chronologically. We begin with newsreels and a &quot;poetic documentary&quot; by Dziga Vertov; they will be paired with classic readings from revolutionary theory, from Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin to Fidel Castro and Bill Ayres, and from film theory, including Vertov, Andre Bazin and Jean-Luc Godard. Readings will acquaint students with contemporary assessments of the emancipatory potential of film. Instructor(s): R. Bird; C.

(origin of the robot), Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopian novel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), and Stanislaw Lem's Solaris (the inspiration for several film versions including Andrei Tarkovsky's in 1972). Our primary objective will be to examine how these writers used science fiction to interpret, comment upon, or critique their historical moment. How did these works propose alternate realities? Or how did they engage with the new and changing realities of the 20th century? All readings in English. Instructor(s): Esther Peters Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): REES 36075 </P>

<P>This course traces the intellectual genealogies of the rise of a Global New Right in relation to the contexts of late capitalist neoliberalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, as well as the rise of social media. The course will explore the intertwining political and intellectual histories of the Russian Eurasianist movement, Hungarian Jobbik, the American Traditional Workers Party, the French GRECE, Greek Golden Dawn, and others through their published essays, blogs, vlogs and social media. Perhaps most importantly, the course asks: can we use f-word (fascism) to describe this problem? In order to pose this question we will explore the aesthetic concerns of the New Right in relation to postmodern theory, and the affective politics of nationalism. This course thus frames the rise of a global new right interdisciplinary and comparatively as a historical, geopolitical and aesthetic problem.

Without mechanically relating the films to the Ten Commandments, Kieślowski explores the relevance of the biblical moral rules to the state of modern man forced to make ethical choices. Each part of the series contests the absolutism of moral axioms through narrative twists and reversals in a wide, universalized sphere. An analysis of the films will be accompanied by readings from Kieślowski's own writings and interviews, including criticism by Zizek, Insdorf, and others.

<P>REES 27027. Cinema and the Holocaust. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Focuses on cinematic responses by several leading film directors from East &amp; Central Europe to a central event of 20th century history -- the Holocaust. Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioning cameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandistic schemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocide produced after the actual traumatic events. This class aims at discussing the challenge of representing the Jewish genocide which has often been defined as un-representable. Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raise questions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production &amp; a search for relevant artistic means with which to engage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation of death &amp; suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization; intertwined notions of chance &amp; hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims. The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the course simultaneously explores extensive &amp; continuous cinematic production of the genre &amp; its historical development in various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, &amp; Czechoslovakia during the Cold War.

<P>REES 27028. David Bergelson's Strange New World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Born in a shtetl in Kiev province in the Pale of Settlement in 1884, Bergelson began writing in Hebrew and Russian before switching to Yiddish, although his Yiddish always retained the trace of other languages. He lived through the First World War and the Russian revolution and civil war, and survived Hitler, but not Stalin, who had him executed for &quot;nationalism&quot; in 1952. &quot;Yiddish&quot; and &quot;shtetl&quot; may suggest a self-enclosed community of pious Jews, celebrating their rituals in an annual cycle. In Bergelson's world, however, time is out of joint. Anachronism, belatedness, and untimeliness, both joyful and tragic, unfold as an emotional, sensory, and existential condition in the world his fiction creates and the world in which he lived. For Bergelson Yiddish is the vehicle for questions about time, history, justice, art, and bodily experience. This course provides an introduction to Bergelson's novels and short stories, from his earliest writing to his Holocaust works.

We unpack the multiple layers of cultural meaning in the logic of &quot;Balkan humor.&quot; We also examine the functions and mechanisms of laughter, both in terms of cultural specificity and general practice and theories of humor. Thus, the study of Balkan humor will help us elucidate the &quot;Balkan&quot; and the &quot;World,&quot; and will provide insight not only into cultural mores and social relations, but into the very notion of &quot;funny.&quot; Our own laughter in class will be the best measure of our success - both cultural and intellectual.

The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writers struggle for breath-speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else.

We conclude by considering the role that the imperative to belong to Western Europe played in the Yugoslav wars of succession.

<P>What would your good do if evil did not exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows disappeared? After all, shadows are cast by things and people…. Do you want to strip the earth of all the trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light?&quot; asks the Devil. Mikhail Bulgakov worked on his novel The Master and Margarita throughout most of his writing career, in Stalin's Moscow. Bulgakov destroyed his manuscript, re-created it from memory, and reworked it feverishly even as his body was failing him in his battle with death. The result is an intense contemplation on the nature of good and evil, on the role of art and the ethical duty of the artist, but also a dazzling world of magic, witches, and romantic love, and an irresistible seduction into the comedic. Laughter, as shadow and light, as the subversive weapon but also as power's whip, grounds human relation to both good and evil. Brief excursions to other texts that help us better understand Master and Margarita. Equivalent Course(s): FNDL 29020, REES 39021 </P>

We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The discipline of sociology explores the nature, structure, and dynamics of social life, and also its causes and consequences for the world. With this broad mandate, sociology encompasses a diversity of substantive interests, methodological approaches, and theoretical orientations. Sociologists study diverse social phenomena ranging from online conversations, friendship, and families to neighborhoods, governments, and global markets. They study cities and communities, inequality, social mobility and social class, patterns of population change and migration, social identities such as race, class, and gender, ethnic relations and social conflict, social media and digital interaction, and social dimensions of sex, health, business, education, law, politics, religion, and science. Sociologists study the emergence, stabilization, disintegration, and wide-ranging implications of these social institutions, behaviors, and meanings. Methodologies of the field range from ethnography, interviews, and historical research to surveys, computational modeling, and big data analysis. </P>

<P>The University of Chicago’s sociology department was the first in the United States, and it stewards the American Journal of Sociology, the discipline’s longest running sociology journal. Chicago sociology builds on these legacies by continuing to sponsor pathbreaking research. Chicago training in sociology confers deep understanding of social organization and human relations, along with skill in drawing inferences from data, which has made it attractive for students considering careers in business, social media, data science, education, law, marketing, medicine, journalism, social work, politics, public administration, and urban planning. Chicago’s sociology education forms an excellent basis for specialized graduate work and affords entry to careers in federal, state, and local agencies, as well as into business enterprises, private foundations, and research institutes. Chicago’s sociology program provides a preeminent foundation for students considering careers in advanced research and university teaching. The program is designed to meet the needs of diverse students, and students declare a student-designed specialty that reflects their course work and BA thesis research, such as social policy or social analytics. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Students pursuing a BA degree in sociology are expected to complete the following requirements. All required sociology courses are offered annually, and students should inquire directly of the director of undergraduate studies if they need to know when a course will be offered in the next academic year. </P>

<P>A. Social Theory </P>

<P>Two required courses acquaint students with some of the fundamental problems and analytic perspectives of the field of sociology. </P>

<P>SOCI 20002 Social Structure and Change. The central objective of this course is to introduce students to the sociological study of individuals in society—how individual actions are shaped by their position in society, while contributing to its structure and change. We focus on sociological approaches to American society, its position in the international system, and principal dimensions including race and ethnicity, age, gender, and social class. </P>

<P>SOCI 20005 Sociological Theory. Drawing on the classics as well as on contemporary works in sociological theory, this course raises questions about the nature of sociological theory and its relation to both empirical research and sociological inquiry. Authors include Weber, Durkheim, Simmel, Dewey, Parsons, and Merton. </P>

<P>With the approval of the undergraduate program director, students may use other courses toward this requirement. </P>

<P>B. Methodology Students are required to take at least one of the following methodology courses. </P>

<P>SOCI 20001 Sociological Methods. This course introduces the philosophy and practice of social research. It explores questions of causality in social research and the limits of knowledge. It then covers the basic practices that are components of all methods of social research through an in-depth examination of interviews, ethnography, surveys, and archival, online, and computational research. Students spend the quarter working on a series of assignments that culminate in a research proposal for the BA thesis. </P>

<P>SOCI 20140 Qualitative Field Methods. This course introduces techniques and approaches to ethnographic field research. Emphasis is placed on quality of attention and awareness of perspective as foundational aspects of the craft. Students conduct research at a site, compose and share field notes, and produce a final paper distilling sociological insight from fieldwork. </P>

<P>C. Statistics Students must take the following statistics requirement. </P>

<P>SOCI 20004 Statistical Methods of Research. This required course provides a comprehensive introduction to widely used quantitative methods in sociology and related social sciences. Topics include analysis of variance and multiple regression, tools used often by practicing social scientists. Substitutes for this course are STAT </P>

<P>20000 Elementary Statistics or higher. Students with AP examination credit for Statistics may count it toward this requirement, although we encourage such students to take an additional social science statistics course. </P>

<P>D. Additional Courses Students must take seven additional courses in sociology or related fields, and at least four of these must be in sociology. They may be drawn from any of the 20000-level courses in sociology and, after the student completes SOCI 20002 Social Structure and Change, from any 30000-level courses in sociology that have not been </P>

<P>cross listed with undergraduate course numbers. Students may also count graduate courses (e.g., 40000-level or higher) in which they may enroll with permission of course instructors toward this requirement. </P>

<P>Courses outside of sociology must be approved by the undergraduate program director. Students must submit the College's General Petition Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) for review. With a few exceptions, courses offered in the Division of the Social Sciences are accepted. Other courses with significant social science content or special relevance to a student’s BA thesis may also be accepted. </P>

<P>Area of Specialization. At least three of the additional courses in sociology or related fields, outlined above, must comprise a self-defined area of specialization. Students will declare a specialization which reflects an emphasis of their course work and BA thesis research. Students in the Class of 2019 and beyond are required to develop a specialization; students in the Classes of 2017 and 2018 may elect to do so. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to consider their specialization from the time that they enter the program in order to guide their selection of courses and prepare them for the substantial research project of the BA thesis. Students formally propose their specialization at the start of their penultimate quarter of residence (ordinarily, this will be due in January of the student’s fourth year). The proposal should include a theme with three (or more) courses in sociology or related fields that students have completed or are completing within that domain. These proposals are to be submitted on the College's General Petition Form (https:// college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) and must be approved by the undergraduate program director. Some examples of specializations might be: </P>

<P>E. BA Thesis During their fourth year, students majoring in sociology are expected to complete an original project of sociological inquiry on a topic of their choice, culminating in a final paper from twenty to forty pages in length. The project is an independent research project in which questions are formulated and data are collected and analyzed by the student. Recent projects have included studies of emerging forms of social interaction on the Internet, conflict and safety in urban Chicago neighborhoods, immigration and national identity in Germany and Guatemala, processes of gendering in the workplace, homosexuality and AIDS in South Africa, church leadership transition among Korean immigrants, the power of public rhetoric in public housing, role models </P>

<P>among Mexican American youth, gender roles in families of graduate students, peer pressure and teenage pregnancy, and attitudes toward immigration. </P>

<P>The senior project is written under the guidance of an assigned preceptor from the department and a faculty member that students select during Spring Quarter of SOCI 29998 Sociology BA Thesis Seminar. After a faculty member agrees to advise a student’s thesis, the student will have the faculty member sign a hard copy of the BA Thesis Faculty Advisor Consent Form available for printing at sociology.uchicago.edu/sites/sociology.uchicago.edu/ files/AdvisorConsentForm_0.pdf, which is to be turned in to the Department of Sociology office. Students may register for additional reading courses (SOCI 29997 Readings in Sociology); however, only two sociology reading/ research courses can be counted toward courses required for the sociology major. </P>

<P>BA Seminar. The senior project is researched, discussed, and written in the context of SOCI 29998 Sociology BA Thesis Seminar, which is a required yearlong course. Students are required to attend this senior seminar in Spring Quarter of their third year and in the Autumn and Winter Quarters of their fourth year, but they must register for the seminar in only one of the three terms. Students who plan to study abroad during any of these quarters must still participate in the seminar by completing required assignments and submitting them online and on time. The completed thesis is submitted during Spring Quarter of their fourth year. Students graduating in a quarter </P>

<P>other than Spring Quarter must turn in their theses by Friday of seventh week of their final quarter. When circumstances justify it, the department may set individual deadlines and procedures. </P>

They must then declare their intention to major at my.uchicago.edu and inform the Department of Sociology at sociology.uchicago.edu/content/majoring-sociologyintake-form, which includes a short entry survey. Students may enter the program at any time upon completion of any social sciences general education sequence, but no later than the beginning of Spring Quarter in their third year. </P>

<P>Students are encouraged to complete the required introductory sociology courses (SOCI 20002 Social Structure and Change and SOCI 20005 Sociological Theory) as early as possible, and to enroll in a required methodology course by Spring Quarter of their third year, the quarter in which students begin SOCI 29998 Sociology BA Thesis Seminar. </P>

<P>Advising </P>

<P>Students should address technical questions regarding the program (e.g., required courses, petitions) to the undergraduate program director. During Spring Quarter of the third year, students will also select a faculty member to serve as adviser. Students may wish to contact their faculty adviser to address general questions regarding the discipline of sociology and to receive guidance in designing an individualized program of study and selecting a specialization. </P>

<P>Handbook </P>

<P>Students interested in pursuing the BA degree in sociology are encouraged to read the brochure Undergraduate Program in Sociology, which is available in the Office of the Department of Sociology (SS 307). </P>

<P>Sociology Courses </P>

<P>SOCI 20000. Invitation to Sociology. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What do sociologists do all day? This course introduces students to the vast terrain of contemporary sociology, including: culture, deviance, economic life, education, family, health and the body, politics, population, professions, race, science and knowledge, and sex/gender, employing institutionalization as a basic lens that leads sociology to have a somewhat different approach from other social sciences. Why an invitation? Unlike introductory courses that cover 10 topics in 10 weeks with an emphasis on foundational texts, students will get to know sociology by reading and analyzing a rotating selection of books and articles that exemplify the field today. Students will complete exercises and write-ups that link claims about the social world to evidence. Throughout the quarter, class format takes a variety of forms, including lectures, informal presentations, student-led discussions, debates, and guest speakers. Instructor(s): J. Martin and J. Trinitapoli Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>SOCI 20001. Sociological Methods. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces the philosophy and practice of social research. Working from the idea that the research process is fundamentally a critical dialogue, we begin by exploring questions of causality and the epistemology of social research. Then we turn to examine the basic practices that are a component of all methods of social research through an in-depth examination of interviews, ethnography, surveys, and archival research. Assignments culminate in a research proposal for the BA thesis. Instructor(s): R. Vargas Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Required of students who are majoring in Sociology </P>

<P>SOCI 20002. Social Structure and Change. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The title of this course is traditional more than it is descriptively accurate. It should be called How to Think Sociologically. Rather than attempt to survey the state of the field as introductory courses typically do, this course advances a particular vision of the discipline. We will be reading authors that fundamentally inform this vision (not all of whom were sociologists proper), including Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Garfinkel, Goffman, Geertz, Levi-Strauss, Mauss, Bourdieu, and Fanon. We will learn how to identify properly sociological objects and how to engage in various modes of sociological analysis. We will discuss social facts, forms, types, and relations; the collective nature of social reality, social identities such as race and gender, and social class. We may even get to talk about social structure and change. The course has been designed to provide students majoring in sociology a more solid-although, again, a very particular-disciplinary foundation. The readings fill the gap between the classical sociology covered in the social science cores Self and Power and the contemporary sociology covered by other departmental offerings. Instructor(s): M. Garrido Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Required of students who are majoring in Sociology </P>

<P>SOCI 20004. Statistical Methods of Research. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course provides a comprehensive introduction to widely used quantitative methods in sociology and related social sciences. Topics include analysis of variance and multiple regression, considered as they are used by practicing social scientists. Instructor(s): S. Raudenbush Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Priority registration for Ugrad Sociology majors and Sociology PhD students. No prior instruction in statistical analysis is required. Others by consent of instructor. Note(s): Students are expected to attend two lectures and one lab per week. Required of students who are majoring in Sociology Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30004 </P>

<P>SOCI 20005. Sociological Theory. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course provides a basic introduction to modern sociological theory. Readings focus on classic texts by Weber, Durkheim, Simmel, and Dewey, ending with an individually chosen (by each student) text by a theoretical writer from outside Europe and North America. Lectures provide a background history of modern social thought. Instructor(s): A. Glaeser Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Required of students who are majoring in Sociology. </P>

<P>SOCI 20101. Organizational Analysis. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a systematic introduction to theoretical and empirical work on organizations broadly conceived (e.g., public and private economic organizations, governmental organizations, prisons, professional and voluntary associations, health-care organizations). Topics include intraorganizational questions about organizational goals and effectiveness, communication, authority, and decision making. Using recent developments in market, political economy, and neoinstitutional theories, we explore organizational change and interorganizational relationships for their implications in understanding social change in modern societies. Social network analysis will inform much of the discussion. Instructor(s): E. Laumann Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 23000, SOCI 30101 </P>

<P>SOCI 20103. Social Stratification. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Social stratification is the unequal distribution of the goods that members of a society value - earnings, income, authority, political power, status, prestige etc. This course introduces various sociological perspectives about stratification. We look at major patterns of inequality throughout human history, how they vary across countries, how they are formed and maintained, how they come to be seen as legitimate and desirable, and how they affect the lives of individuals within a society. The readings incorporate classical theoretical statements, contemporary debates, and recent empirical evidence. The information and ideas discussed in this course are critical for students who will go on in sociology and extremely useful for students who want to be informed about current social, economic, and political issues. Instructor(s): R. Stolzenberg Terms Offered: Spring. Cancelled - Not offered in 2018/19 Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30103 </P>

<P>SOCI 20104. Urban Structure and Process. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course reviews competing theories of urban development, especially their ability to explain the changing nature of cities under the impact of advanced industrialism. Analysis includes a consideration of emerging metropolitan regions, the microstructure of local neighborhoods, and the limitations of the past American experience as a way of developing urban policy both in this country and elsewhere. Instructor(s): O. McRoberts Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): SOSC 25100, CRES 20104, SOCI 30104, GEOG 22700, GEOG 32700 </P>

<P>SOCI 20107. Sociology of Human Sexuality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>After briefly reviewing several biological and psychological approaches to human sexuality as points of comparison, this course explores the sociological perspective on sexual conduct and its associated beliefs and consequences for individuals and society. Substantive topics include gender relations; life-course perspectives on sexual conduct in youth, adolescence, and adulthood; social epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (including AIDS); sexual partner choice and turnover; and the incidence/prevalence of selected sexual practices. Network analytic approaches will be introduced. Instructor(s): E. Laumann Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Introductory social sciences course Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30107, GNSE 27100 </P>

<P>SOCI 20125. Rational Foundations of Social Theory. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces conceptual and analytical tools for the micro foundations of macro and intermediate-level social theories, taking as a basis the assumption of rational action. Those tools are then used to construct theories of power, social exchange, collective behavior, socialization, trust, norm, social decision making and justice, business organization, and family organization. Instructor(s): K. Yamaguchi Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30125 </P>

<P>SOCI 20126. Japanese Society: Functional/Cultural Explanations. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The objective of this course is to provide an overview of social structural characteristics and the functioning of contemporary Japanese society by a juxtaposition of universalistic functional (or rational) explanations and particularistic cultural (and historical) explanations. As well become clear as complementary to each other. Substantively, the course primarily focuses on 1) the forms of social interaction and structure, 2) work organization and family, and 3) education, social inequality, and opportunity. The course also presents discussions of the extent to which Japan is &quot;unique&quot; among industrial societies. In covering a broad range of English-language literature on Japanese society, the course not only presents reviews and discussions of various alternative theoretical explanations of the characteristics of Japanese society, but also a profound opportunity to critically review and study selected sociological theories.. Instructor(s): K. Yamaguchi Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30126 </P>

<P>SOCI 20140. Qualitative Field Methods. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces techniques of, and approaches to, ethnographic field research. We emphasize quality of attention and awareness of perspective as foundational aspects of the craft. Students conduct research at a site, compose and share field notes, and produce a final paper distilling sociological insight from the fieldwork. Instructor(s): O. McRoberts Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): CRES 20140, CHDV 20140 </P>

<P>SOCI 20157. Mathematical Models. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines mathematical models and related analyses of social action, emphasizing a rational-choice perspective. About half the lectures focus on models of collective action, power, and exchange as developed by Coleman, Bonacich, Marsden, and Yamaguchi. Then the course examines models of choice over the life course, including rational and social choice models of marriage, births, friendship networks, occupations, and divorce. Both behavioral and analytical models are surveyed. Instructor(s): K. Yamaguchi Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30157 </P>

<P>SOCI 20175. The Sociology of Deviant Behavior. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines how distinctions between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;deviant&quot; are created, and how these labels shift historically, culturally, and politically. We analyze the construction of social problems and moral panics (e.g., smoking, &quot;satanic&quot; daycares, obesity) to explore how various moral entrepreneurs shape what some sociologists call a &quot;culture of fear.&quot; Additionally, we investigate the impact on individuals of being labeled &quot;deviant&quot; either voluntarily or involuntarily, as a way of illustrating how both social control and social change operate in society. Instructor(s): K. Schilt Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 20170 </P>

<P>SOCI 20192. The Effects of Schooling. 100 Units. </P>

<P>From at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was the pre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education. The purpose of this course is to review what is known about the long-term effects of schooling. Instructor(s): R. Stolzenberg Terms Offered: Spring. Cancelled - Not offered in 2018/19 Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30192 </P>

<P>SOCI 20226. Urban Schools and Communities. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course focuses on urban communities and the contextual factors influencing the organization of schools. It emphasizes historical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives as we explore questions about the purpose and history of public schools, the influences on the character of their structure and organization (especially in urban areas), and the surrounding context, such as housing, policy, race and class. The topics detailed below provide essential intellectual perspectives on the history, work, and complexities of urban schools. Instructor(s): S. Stoelinga Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 27821, CHDV 27821 </P>

<P>SOCI 20233. Race in Contemporary American Society. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This survey course in the sociology of race offers a socio-historical investigation of race in American society. We will examine issues of race, ethnic and immigrant settlement in the United States. Also, we shall explore the classic and contemporary literature on race and inter-group dynamics. Our investigative tools will include an analysis of primary and secondary sources, multimedia materials, photographic images, and journaling. While our survey will be broad, we will treat Chicago and its environs as a case study to comprehend the racial, ethnic, and political challenges in the growth and development of a city. Instructor(s): S. Hicks-Bartlett Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Equivalent Course(s): MAPS 30233, SOCI 30233 </P>

<P>SOCI 20242. States, Markets, and Bodies. 100 Units. </P>

<P>An introduction to political economy, this course will introduce students to theories, concepts, and tools for studying relations between states and markets that affect the structure of power relationships. Taking a global approach, we will examine the different forms of state repression, the consequences of a neoliberal and decentralized global market, and its affects on individual people/workers. This course is motivated by three interrelated questions: (1) What is the appropriate role of the government in the economy? (2) How should states govern their citizens?

<P>With a focus on the past two decades, this interdisciplinary course explores the impact of economic integration, urbanization, and migration on Mexico and, to a lesser extent, on the United States-in particular, working class communities of the Midwestern Rust Belt. The course will examine work and life in the borderland production centers; agriculture, poverty, and indigenous populations in rural Mexico; evolving trade and transnational ties (especially in people, food products and labor, and drugs) between the U.S. and Mexico; and trade, trade adjustment, and immigration policy. Instructor(s): C. Broughton Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): This course is offered in alternate years. Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 24901, LACS 24901 </P>

<P>SOCI 20253. Introduction to Spatial Data Science. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Spatial data science consists of a collection of concepts and methods drawn from both statistics and computer science that deal with accessing, manipulating, visualizing, exploring and reasoning about geographical data. The course introduces the types of spatial data relevant in social science inquiry and reviews a range of methods to explore these data. Topics covered include formal spatial data structures, geovisualization and visual analytics, rate smoothing, spatial autocorrelation, cluster detection and spatial data mining. An important aspect of the course is to learn and apply open source software tools, including R and GeoDa. Instructor(s): L. Anselin Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): STAT 22000 (or equivalent), familiarity with GIS is helpful, but not necessary Equivalent Course(s): GEOG 30500, GEOG 20500, MACS 54000, SOCI 30253 </P>

<P>SOCI 20263. Human Migration. 100 Units. </P>

<P>At any moment, spatial location is a fixed, essential characteristic of people and the places they inhabit. Over time, individuals and groups of people change places. In the long run, the places themselves move in physical, social, economic and political space. These movements can be characterized by their origins and destinations, as intentional or accidental, forced or voluntary, individual or collective, within political borders (e.g. the farmto-city migration of the 1940's in the U.S), migration across political boundaries (e.g. &quot;displacement&quot; of pariah ethnicities after World War II), and by other criteria. All of these phenomena are aspects of migration This course reviews contemporary demographic research and theory concerning the nature of migration, and its extent, causes and consequences for individuals and collectivities. The demographic perspective absorbs a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including those of psychology (e.g. individual decision-making), sociology (collective behavior, stratification, race and ethnicity), economics (rational behavior, macroeconomic conditions), and more.

<P>SOCI 20264. Wealth. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Wealth is the value of a person's accumulated possessions and financial assets. Wealth is more difficult for social researchers to measure than earnings and income, and wealthy people are notoriously uncooperative with efforts to study them and their assets. Further, wealth data conveys less information than income data about the lives of the middle- and lower-classes -- who tend to have little or no wealth at all. However, information about wealth gives fundamentally important insight into the values, attitudes, behavior, consumption patterns, social standing, political power, health, happiness and yet more characteristics of individuals and population subgroups. This course considers the causes and consequences of wealth accumulation for individuals, the social groups to which they belong, and the societies in which they dwell. Instructor(s): R. Stolzenberg Terms Offered: Winter. Cancelled - Not offered in 2018/19 Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 30264 </P>

<P>SOCI 20268. Health, Medicine, and Human Rights. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The World Health Organization, United Nations and other international bodies consider health a fundamental human right. At the same time, most countries around the world are characterized by profound inequalities in health and wellbeing. In this course, we leverage sociological and social scientific concepts through a human rights framework to understand how these inequalities in mental and physical health are perpetuated by the structure and culture of society, with an emphasis on U.S. society. We will also examine medicine as an institution with a problematic history of repeated human rights violations (in the U.S. and around the world) and explore how that history shapes the current practice of medicine, medical research, and relations between doctors and patients. Finally, we will explore how institutions provide (or fail to provide) equal access to healthcare, and how state understandings of the right to health influence the lives of individuals and communities.

<P>SOCI 20274. Urban Spatial Archaeology II. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course builds off Urban Spatial Archaeology I, by focusing on more specific ways to apply the concepts of space and time to contemporary urban research issues. Students will also learn methods for analyzing the data they chose to digitize in the previous quarter, which will culminate in a research paper on a topic of their choosing. Students will walk away from this course with a deeper understanding of how researchers and policy makers think of space and time with respect to a particular urban issue. In addition, students will have produced a research paper and data visualization that would critique the ways researchers have traditionally conceptualized time and space. Instructor(s): R. Vargas Terms Offered: Spring. Cancelled - Not Offered in 2018/2019 Prerequisite(s): SOCI 20273/30273 and GEOG 20273/30273 Equivalent Course(s): GEOG 20274, SOCI 30274, GEOG 30274 </P>

<P>SOCI 20280. The Politics of Popular Sovereignty: Participation and Protest. 100 Units. </P>

<P>If government is of, by and for the people, what kinds of politics are possible? Certainly, politics will operate through established institutions such as elections and legislatures. But popular politics may also take other forms: petitions, social movements, protest in the streets, and cultural critique. These efforts often fail, sometimes dramatically, but they have also contributed to major social change including the abolition of slavery, the expansion of rights, and demands for new understandings of justice. This course will explore the history of popular politics within democratizing societies, the development of new forms of collective mobilization and technologies of political influence, and the changing relation of popular politics to formal political institutions. Instructor(s): E. Clemens Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): PLSC 20280 </P>

<P>SOCI 20281. Library Methods for the Social Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a graduate introduction to the methods involved with &quot;research with records&quot;--that is, material like manuscripts, books, journals, newspapers, ephemera, and government and institutional documents. (Such material has been typically printed but may now be stored electronically as well as physically.) The course covers the essentials of project design, bibliography, location, access, critical reading, source evaluation and provenance, knowledge categorization and assembly, and records maintenance. The course is a methodological practicum and will involve both small-scale exercises and a larger project. Major texts include Thomas Mann's Oxford Guide to Library Research and Andrew Abbott's Digital paper. Instructor(s): A. Abbott Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Advanced undergrads by consent Equivalent Course(s): SOCI 40142 </P>

<P>SOCI 20282. Immigrant America. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Nearly 60 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. in the past 50 years, mostly from Latin America and Asia, but also from Africa and the Middle-East. Today, a near-record 14% of the country's population is foreign born compared with just 5% in 1965. These profound demographic changes raise critical questions: Why do immigrants come to the U.S.? What impact do they have on U.S. society? Are today's immigrants fundamentally different from previous waves of immigrants? Are these immigrants assimilating to the U.S. or retaining their culture? Why do some immigrant groups appear to fare better than others? This course will expose students to the latest social science research on contemporary immigration to the United States. We will explore its origins, adaptation patterns, and long-term effects on American society. Instructor(s): R. Flores Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>SOCI 20284. Survey Research Practicum. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Survey Research Practicum is designed to give students real world experience in planning and administering a mixed-mode survey research project using an address based sample. The course will focus on the planning and administration of a ready-to-field survey, and on understanding how trade-off decisions in the planning phase may affect survey errors. This is a hands-on course in which students will take part in the actual how-to of data collection. Students will take part in every phase of the operational design and project execution. In the process of planning and fielding the survey, students will learn to; prepare a scope of work and write a budget, prepare and submit an IRB application, properly staff a field operation, learn to conduct a standardized survey interview, track fieldwork and disposition outcomes, calculate response rates, process and clean data, and prepare a methodological report. Students will also assist in the development and implementation of methodological experiments in order to understand how changes to the survey design affect data outcomes. Instructor(s): K. Ulrich Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>SOCI 28080. Sociology of Medicine. 100 Units. </P>

<P>We often think of medical diagnoses as objective labels that reflect verifiable biological realities-but are they always? This course complicates the biomedical model of health and illness by exploring the social, cultural, economic, and political factors that shape medical research, clinical practice, and the structure of the healthcare delivery system. Focusing primarily on the American context, students will investigate how disease labels interact with social non-conformities, how medical diagnoses can serve as forms of social control, and how healthcare inequalities emerge. Students will also learn about resistance to stigma and medicalization, as well as the relationship between experiences of illness and new technologies, such as gene sequencing and the Internet. Instructor(s): A. Brewer Terms Offered: Spring </P>

<P>SOCI 28081. The Social Life of the Law. 100 Units. </P>

<P>How does the American legal system create, solidify, or attempt to rectify social inequalities and injustices? This course investigates the relationship(s) between law and society, with a focus on the American civil legal system's historical and current role in inequality, social problems, and social disputes. We will examine the ways in which individuals and groups are oriented towards and mobilize the law within the constraints of the legal system and everyday life. We will ask: What are the roots of &quot;equality&quot; as the basis for addressing social discrepancies? What are the consequences of equality and rights forming the foundation for claims and cases in the American legal system? How do the overlaps of the criminal justice system, civil law, and everyday understandings of legality create or deny legal outcomes? What have the legal claims made by historical and current social movements brought into the picture and what has been left out of frame? In a political context that debates the worthiness of rights-based claims-making, where can we go from here? Instructor(s): K. Hendricks Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>SOCI 28082. Sociology of Higher Education. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is designed to introduce students to the sociological study of higher education in the United States. The course will examine the purpose of college and how inequalities in student pathways through higher education are shaped by individual context and institutional structure. This course will consider a number of critical problems and questions regarding higher education, including those related to preparation and access, forms of capital, campus experience, achievement, and outcomes. Instructor(s): M. Osborne Terms Offered: Winter </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations (SALC) offers an undergraduate major leading to a BA in the Humanities Collegiate Division. The social sciences are integrated into our program through the civilization sequence, and courses in the social sciences and religious studies are usually included in a student's program of study. Students majoring in SALC will gain a broad knowledge of the literature and history of the South Asian subcontinent (i.e., Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka), and proficiency in at least one South Asian language that is equivalent to one year of study or more. Students currently can study Bangla (Bengali), Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi, Pali, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Tibetan, or Urdu. As part of their course of study, students are encouraged to participate in a study abroad program in South Asia, such as the South Asian Civilizations in India sequence (Pune program). The SALC curriculum will develop the student's skills in formulating analyses of various types of texts (i.e., historical, literary, filmic), and students will also engage with social scientific approaches to South Asian cultures. The thorough area knowledge of South Asian arts, culture, history, and politics, and the critical and linguistic skills developed through the SALC degree may prepare a student for any number of careers. </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in SALC. Information on the minor follows the description of the major below. </P>

<P>Forms </P>

<P>Students who intend to join the SALC undergraduate program should fill out the appropriate form below and schedule a meeting with the SALC Director of Undergraduate Studies.

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Ideally, students will begin their study with the two-quarter sequence SALC 20100-20200 Introduction to the Civilizations of South Asia I-II. All SALC majors must take this sequence or the equivalent program taught in Pune, SOSC 23004-23005-23006 South Asian Civilizations in India I-II-III. If this sequence is not used to satisfy the civilization studies general education requirement, then it will count toward the major. </P>

<P>The major requires three courses in a South Asian language at the second-year level or above. These courses must be taken at the University of Chicago, and credit cannot be granted by examination. Students with prior knowledge of one or the languages offered by SALC may take a placement test in order to determine the right level for them to enroll. The College's language competency requirement may be satisfied by demonstrated proficiency equivalent to one year of study of a South Asian language offered through SALC. </P>

<P>Students are also required to take six courses related to South Asia. In addition to SALC offerings, courses with significant South Asian content that originate in other departments may be eligible, subject to the approval of the SALC Director of Undergraduate Studies. Three of these six courses may be language courses, either further courses in the same language or courses in another South Asian language. Students should choose courses in consultation with the SALC Director of Undergraduate Studies and fill out a form indicating what they intend to list for their major requirements. </P>

<P>Pune Program: SOSC 23004-23005-23006 South Asian Civilizations in India I-II-III </P>

<P>One of the College's study abroad programs that meet the general education requirement in civilization studies, the Autumn Quarter program in Pune (Poona) is devoted to the study of South Asian history and culture. It is built upon a three-course civilizations sequence examining the history, culture, and society of the South Asian subcontinent through course work, field studies, and direct experience. During the first seven weeks of the quarter, the program will be based in the city of Pune, where students will complete two courses and participate in expeditions to nearby cultural and historical sites. </P>

<P>Students participating in the Pune Program receive three credits for the civilizations sequence, which meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. Students who have already met the civilization studies requirement may use these SALC credits as electives. Two South Asian civilizations courses are required for students in the major or minor, as described above. The additional civilizations course, SOSC 23006 South Asian Civ In India-3, can be used toward other SALC requirements. Course titles, units of credit, and grades will be placed on the Chicago transcript. </P>

<P>In addition to the civilizations sequence, students take a fourth course in Hindi during the first seven weeks of the quarter. For students with no prior experience in South Asian languages, this course is designed to facilitate their access to local culture and to provide a basis for further study. Advanced sections will be held for those students with prior course work or experience in Hindi. </P>

<P>Pune is a city of some four million inhabitants, situated on the eastern foothills of the Indian western coastal mountains, or ghats, about 100 miles southeast of Mumbai. Labeled famously by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, as &quot;the Oxford and Cambridge of India,&quot; it is a major center for Indian art, religion, and higher education, and an ideal site for cultural immersion. </P>

<P>SALC 20509. Bombay to Bollywood. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course maps the transformation of the Hindi film industry in India. Starting out as a regional film production center, how did the Bombay film industry and Hindi cinema gain the reputation of being the leader of Indian cinema? This despite the fact that most critical acclaim, by the state and film critics, was reserved for &quot;art cinema.&quot; Through an analysis of Hindi films from the 1950s to the present we map the main trends of this complex artistic/ industrial complex to arrive at an understanding of the deep connect between cinema and other social imaginaries.

<P>SALC 20511. Screening India: Bollywood and Beyond. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Cinema is, unarguably, the medium most apposite for thinking through the complexities of democratic politics, especially so in a place like India. While Indian cinema has recently gained international currency through the song and dance ensembles of Bollywood, there remains much more to be said about that body of films. Moreover, Bollywood is a small (though very important) part of Indian cinema. Through a close analysis of a wide range of films in Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, and Urdu, this course will ask if Indian cinema can be thought of as a form of knowledge of the twentieth century.

<P>SALC 20722. Colonialisms and Literature: Adventures, Exoticisms, East and West. 100 Units. </P>

<P>European imperialism and colonialism have shaped the modern world as we know it today. The &quot;Age of Empire&quot; has bequeathed us a wealth of literary texts, from adventure tales to more serious novels about colonial encounters and life in the colonies. Colonialism also introduced the novel as a new literary genre to many literatures in Asia. Over the past decades literary critics, theorists, historians and philosophers have examined the interdependence of imperialism/colonialism and literature from many perspectives, notably in what is generally referred to as postcolonial theory. The present course provides a first introduction to to colonial writing and theoretical approaches to literary practices under colonialism, to its key thinkers, concepts and methods by examining what Empire was in the case of British India and the Dutch East Indies (today's Indonesia) and by reading English and Dutch novels together with the work of Asian writers (Forster, Rajam Aiyar, Couperus, Abdoel Moeis). We will explore key terms, such as &quot;otherness&quot;, &quot;hybridity&quot;, &quot;agency&quot;, &quot;modernity&quot;, &quot;nationalism" as well as larger themes, such as empire and gender and sexuality or colonial knowledge formation. - Of interest to students of literature, history, anthropology and other disciplines dealing with 'texts'.

<P>SALC 22603. Intro to Premodern South Asian Lit: Courts, Poets, Power. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Indian subcontinent and the surrounding areas were home to some of the most vibrant literary traditions in world history. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the main trends in the premodern (prenineteenth century) literatures of South Asia through a selection of texts translated from a variety of languages (Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Persian, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, etc.). We will discuss issues of literary historiography, the relations between orality and writing, the basic principles of Dravidian, Sanskrit, and Perso-Arabic poetics, the formation of vernacular literary traditions, multilingual literacy, and the role of literature in social interactions and community building in premodern South Asia. Each reading will thus be framed by the systematic exploration of those poetic systems and a close reading of representative texts. Attention will also be given to the original languages in which those texts were composed. The course offers a comprehensive and critical introduction to major non-western knowledge systems and aesthetic theories. Instructor(s): T.

<P>SALC 22604. A Poem in Every House&quot;: An Introduction to Premodern South Asian Literatures 2. 100 Units. </P>

<P>100gehe gehe kalau kāvya# … In the Kali age, there is a poem in every house … (Vidyāpati [ca. 1370-1460, Mithila], Kīrtilatā). The Indian subcontinent was home to some of the most vibrant literary traditions in world history. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the main trends in the premodern (/pre-nineteenth century) literatures of South Asia through a selection of poetic and theoretical texts translated from a variety of languages. We will discuss issues of literary historiography, the relations between orality and writing, literary and visual representations, poetry and music. Over two quarters, we will review the basic principles of Sanskrit, Dravidian, and Perso-Arabic poetics through a selection of representative theoretical treatises and poems. We will also explore the linguistic ecology of the Subcontinent, the formation of vernacular literary traditions, multilingual literacy, and the role of literature in social interactions and community building in premodern South Asia. Every week the first class will be devoted to the historical context and conceptual background of the texts we will read in the following class. Attention will be given to the original languages in which those texts were composed as well as the modes of performance of the poems and songs we will read together. Instructor(s): Thibaut d'Hubert Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): The course is the perfect complement to the Introduction to South Asian Civilizations sequence (SALC 20100-20200). Beyond its focus on South Asia, students interested in classics, poetics, rhetoric, musicology, theater studies, and comparative literature will find plenty of food for thought in the readings, lectures, and class discussions. For students interested in languages, it is an ideal way to have a lively introduction to the linguistic variety of South Asia. No prior knowledge of South Asian languages is required. Note(s): One session titled “Poetry Carved in Stones” will bring us to the Art Institute to study the relation between poetic and visual representations of gods and episodes drawn from the rich narrative tradition of South Asia. The first part of this sequence is devoted to Sanskrit, Middle Indic (Prakrit, Apabhramsha), and Dravidian (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam) literary traditions. Perso-Arabic (Persian, Dakani, Urdu) and northern vernacular literary traditions (Hindi, Panjabi, Maithili, Bengali) will be discussed in the Autumn Quarter of the following year. Students may take the courses in any order. </P>

<P>SALC 23103. Problems In the Study of Gender. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The notion of differential citizenship is a topic that exercises scholars the world over. In particular, those interested in issues of feminism and ethnicity have studied why women (and then some women more than others) or particular social groups experience disenfranchisement more than their counterparts. This is so even when officially many cultures grant them formal equality before the law. This course explores issues of disenfranchisement, inequality, and violence through a focus on South Asia. We will begin with a set of theoretical readings mainly John Locke and John Stuart Mill whose works demonstrate some early strands of thinking about the political and cultural role (or the lack thereof) of women within the (fraternal) social contract. We will then move to contemporary works such as Joan Scott's Only Paradoxes to Offer (selections), Parite: Sexual Equality and the Crisis of French Universalism (selections), Leila Ahmed's A Quiet Revolution (selections), Amy Dru Stanley's From Bondage to Contract (selections) to frame the issue of differential citizenship and inequality in a historical and global context. Following this we turn to South Asia with a particular focus on gender and caste inequality and the violence unleashed by majoritarian politics (both overt and covert). Instructor(s): R.

<P>SALC 25304. Introduction to Hinduism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will acquaint ourselves with the basic beliefs, practices, scriptures and varieties of the religion that goes by the name of &quot;Hinduism.&quot; We will follow its course through history, beginning with the earliest, most hallowed, little understood sources, the Vedas. We will look into the formation and peculiarities of its different branches such as the schools of Vaishnavism and Saivism, and learn about some of its central figures such as Shankara, Ramanuja and Chaitanya. Significant part of the course will be dedicated to the attempts to define and redefine Hinduism and its unity in the context of modernity, the encounter with colonialism and the course of globalization. We will explore some of its fundamental tensions, for instance between religion and liberation (dharma and moksha), social restrictions and freedom, knowledge and devotion. Finally, we will spend some time on the philosophical underpinnings of Hinduism, particularly the doctrine of karma, reincarnation and theodicy. Instructor(s): A.

<P>SALC 25310. Extinction, Disaster, Dystopia: Environment and Ecology in the Indian Subcontinent. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course aims to provide students an overview of key environmental and ecological issues in the Indian subcontinent. How have the unique precolonial, colonial, regional and national histories of this region shaped the peculiar nature of environmental issues? We will consider three major concepts-&quot;extinction&quot;, &quot;disaster&quot; and &quot;dystopia&quot; to see how they can be used to frame issues of environmental and ecological concern. Each concept will act as a framing device for issues such as conservation and preservation of wildlife, erasure of adivasi (first dwellers) ways of life, environmental justice, water scarcity and climate change. The course will aim to develop students' ability to assess the specificity of these concepts in different disciplines. For example: What methods and sources will an environmental historian use to write about wildlife? How does this differ from the approach an ecologist or literary writer might take? Students will analyze various media: both literary and visual, such as autobiographies of shikaris (hunters), graphic novels, photographs, documentary films, ethnographic accounts and environmental history.

<P>SALC 25311. The Harem: Gender, Family and Power in Early Modern and Modern South Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Even today, the word &quot;harem&quot; evokes orientalist imaginings of an exotic east. Popular images drawn from colonial-era representations continue to define our understanding of this complex institution. In this course we will work to complicate this understanding through considering the harem as a site of interplay between gender, family ties, and power. Taking into account influences from the larger Islamicate world as well as more local, Indic practices, we will historicize the harem, tracking its changes over the course of this long period, and critiquing its various (mis)representations. We will explore how the harem constituted a diverse space including not only elite women and their male relatives, but also other figures such as slave girls, eunuchs and guards. We will furthermore look at how this space was transformed in the era of European expansionism and colonial rule in the subcontinent, becoming a flash point over questions of social reform and Indian nationalism. Materials will include not just secondary literature but also excerpts from contemporary historical accounts, paintings, short stories, photographs, and films. No prior knowledge of South Asian history required. Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 25311, HIST 26612 </P>

<P>SALC 25312. India between Empires: Regions, Remembrance, and Representation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is a course on South Asia in transition. It is also a course on the representation of that transition. The Mughal Empire-which had been the dominant power in India for nearly two hundred years-underwent a process of decentralization in the early eighteenth century. The ensuing years saw the rise of regional powers across much of the Indian subcontinent; some modeled their institutions of state on those of the weakened Mughal center, while others asserted their sovereignty by cultivating a distinctive identity. Although the British East India Company would gradually integrate these polities into its expanding network of political and economic interests, the memory of the once-grand Mughal Empire and its mighty regional heirs loomed large over the colonial experience and endures today. Instructor(s): Andrew Halladay Terms Offered: Autumn </P>

<P>SALC 25706. Problems in the Study of Gender and Sexuality: Inequality. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course analyzes inequality and the overt and covert violence that results from it. These inequalities are often grounded in gender and sex but also result from a complex intersection of gender, sex, and other identities. Inequality is what produces the experience of differential citizenship, a topic that exercises scholars the world over. In particular, those interested in issues of feminism, community, and ethnicity have studied why women (some women more than others) or particular social groups such as gay or trans groups, experience disenfranchisement more than their counterparts, even when, officially, many cultures/ nation states grant their members/citizens formal legal equality. Many of the examples around which this course is framed emerge out of South Asia, but our analyses will be structured through an engagement with theoretical texts that address issues of gendered oppression and discrimination in other parts of the world. Readings will include historical, anthropological, literary texts. Key themes of the course include: debates on parite in France and differential citizenship for religious minorities in India; caste based violence in India studied comparatively with debates on violence against aboriginal in Australia and Canada; rape and human rights; the politics of homosexuality; violence around popular and high culture; the panic around &quot;family values&quot;. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program, Inequality. Instructor(s): Rochona Majumdar Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): GNSE 31106, GNSE 11006 </P>

<P>This seminar course will survey interactions between empires and Islam from the early nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century. It will consider the varied responses of Islamic polities to the expansion of European empires, their role in proliferating networks of travel and communication, as well as the place of religion in anti-imperial and anticolonial movements. Geographically we will cover Asia very broadly defined: from the Ottoman Empire in the west, through the Middle East and Central and South Asia, to Indonesia and Malaysia to the east. Individual classes will focus, for instance, on imperial connections, the emergence of pan-Islamism, Sufi networks, oceanic travel, subaltern social and political movements, and Cold War-era Muslim ideologues. The course will conclude with a look at the rise of more militant Islamic ideologies in recent years. Investigating this two-century long history will help students understand the complex role that Islam has played in the making of the modern world. Course readings will be on the whole recent scholarship on these subjects, with key primary texts introduced in class. Instructor(s): F.

<P>SALC 26804. Frontiers and Borders in South Asia. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sometimes the frontline of empires and nation-states, sometimes neglected or inaccessible, peripheral spaces are often of core concern to the central state. The aim of this upper-level undergraduate seminar is to examine the history of borders, borderlands, and frontiers as political and social concepts and as produced spaces. We will examine an array of case studies in addition to more theoretical scholarship that spans the disciplines of history, environmental studies, political science, anthropology, and geography. While using South Asia (itself a rather recently invented &quot;area&quot;) as the primary geographic and historical focus this course will not be bound exclusively to it. The first goal of the course is to explore the evolution of key concepts such as space, territory, frontier, and borders/borderlands. The second goal is to develop methods for analyzing subjects that are simultaneously physical spaces and political, social, and historical ideas. Finally, it seeks to introduce students to areas that often fall beyond the penumbra of historical surveys centered on the nation-state. No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed. Weekly readings will average 150 pages. Note: No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed. Equivalent Course(s): GEOG 26400, HIST 26804, GLST 26804 </P>

<P>Few parts of the world can lay claim to such a diverse array of ethno-linguistic, religious, and regional identities as South Asia. Not surprisingly, these identities have never been static. This course considers the modern history of ethnic, religious, and racial identities across South Asia with particular attention to their representation in literature and film. We will begin with the colonial-era &quot;ethnographic&quot; state and the development and reification of caste-, religion-, and race-based classifications. We will then shift to Independence, Partition, and South Asian diasporas. We will conclude with contemporary articulations of nationalism, with particular attention to the case of Kashmir. Throughout the course we will focus on the social and political means through which ethnic, racial, and other identity categories are constructed-including colonial re-articulations of caste and the creation of the so-called &quot;martial races.&quot; We will also pay attention to moments of trans-national comparison, for instance Ambedkar's correspondence with W.E.B.

<P>From the early 19th century onward, the debate on the status of Indian women was an integral part of the discourse on the state of civilization, Hindu tradition, and social reform in colonial India. This course will explore how Indian authors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries engaged with the so-called &quot;women's question." Caught between middle-class conservatism and the urge for social reform, Hindi and Urdu writers addressed controversial issues such as female education, child marriage, widow remarriage, and prostitution in their fictional and discursive writings. We will explore the tensions of a literary and social agenda that advocated the 'uplift' of women as a necessary precondition for the progress of the nation, while also expressing patriarchal fears about women's rights and freedom. The course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Basic knowledge of Hindi and/or Urdu is preferable, but not required. We will read works by Nazir Ahmad, Premcand, Jainendra Kumar, Mirza Hadi Ruswa, and Mahadevi Varma in English translation, and also look at texts used in Indian female education at the time.

<P>SALC 28510. Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The Indian city of Bombay and the Mumbai it has now become has been referred to as the &quot;imagined&quot; city, the &quot;kinetic&quot; city, the &quot;cosmopolitan city,&quot; and &quot;the city of slums.&quot; What do these labels mean to the practice of sociality and politics in Bombay/Mumbai; how does the urban experience in South Asia differ from that in other parts of the world; and how do gender, religion and class influence the different experiences of the city? Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics is an interdisciplinary course that will address these and several related issues. Using the city of Mumbai as its lens it introduces students to the ways in which urban subjects and urban life are constituted in a globalizing South Asia. The course explores the city of Mumbai through an urbanculturalist perspective and problematizes the ways in which the built environment of the city: its transportation, streets, slums, neighborhoods, tenements, markets, malls and businesses animate and are animated by the everyday life and politics in the metropolis. It encourages students to think about the ways in which Mumbai's past and present patterns of urban informality, capitalism, consumption, criminality and urban dislocations mediate very particular experiences of politics, sociality, class, gender and globalization. The course uses a range of historical, theoretical, literary, and ethnographic readings as well as films, photography, and music to highlight the connections between place, space and everyday life in Mumbai.

<P>This course introduces students to the rich traditions of aesthetic thought in South Asia, a region that includes (among others) the modern-day states of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. By engaging with theories of art, literature and music from the Indic and Indo-Persian traditions, we will attempt to better understand what happens in an aesthetic experience. A central concern will be thinking about how much any aesthetic tradition, be it South Asian or other, is rooted in the particular epistemic and cultural values of the society that produced it; we will therefore explore how ideas from the South Asian tradition can help us to understand not only South Asian material, but art in other societies as well, and to re-think the boundaries of 'aesthetic' thought. Class discussion, small group work, and individual presentations will be regular features of the class. Two sessions will include performances by, and discussions with, performing artists (dancers and musicians). We will also make one visit to the Art Institute Chicago.

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The modern science of statistics involves the development of principles and methods for modeling uncertainty, for designing experiments, surveys, and observational programs, and for analyzing and interpreting empirical data. Mathematics plays a major role in all areas of statistics, from probability theory to data analysis. Statistics is an appropriate field for students with strong mathematical and computational skills and an interest in applying these skills to problems in the natural and social sciences. A program leading to the bachelor's degree in Statistics offers coverage of the principles and methods of statistics in combination with solid training in mathematics and some additional training in computation. The major can provide appropriate preparation for graduate study in statistics or in other subjects with strong quantitative components. Students considering graduate study in statistics or related fields are encouraged to discuss their programs with the Departmental Adviser for Majors at an early stage, whether or not they plan to receive an undergraduate degree in Statistics. </P>

<P>Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Statistics and are encouraged to discuss their course choices with the Departmental Adviser for Minors. Information on the minor follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>General Course Information </P>

<P>Courses at the 20000 level are designed to provide instruction in statistics, probability, and statistical computation for students from all parts of the University. These courses differ in emphasis on theory or methods, in mathematical level, and in the direction of applications. </P>

<P>Introductory Courses and Sequences </P>

<P>To begin their studies in statistics, students can choose from several courses. Students and College advisers are encouraged to contact the Departmental Adviser for Introductory Courses for advice on choosing an appropriate first course. </P>

<P>For students with little or no math background who do not intend to continue on to more advanced statistics courses, STAT 20000 Elementary Statistics is an introductory course that emphasizes concepts rather than statistical techniques. STAT 20000 Elementary Statistics may not be taken by students with credit for STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications, STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, or more advanced courses in the Department of Statistics. STAT 20000 Elementary Statistics does not count toward the major or minor in Statistics. </P>

<P>Students with at least MATH 13100 Elem Functions and Calculus I or placement into MATH 15100 Calculus I are encouraged to take STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications instead of STAT 20000 Elementary Statistics. Students with three quarters of calculus may choose either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods. Students may count either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, but not both, toward the forty-two credits required for graduation. </P>

<P>STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications is a general introduction to statistical concepts, techniques, and applications to data analysis and to problems in the design, analysis, and interpretation of experiments and observational programs. A score of 5 on the AP Statistics exam yields credit for STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications, although this credit will not count toward the requirements for a major or minor in Statistics. STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications can count toward the minor in Statistics, but for students matriculating in Autumn Quarter 2016 and after, cannot count toward the major in Statistics. </P>

<P>STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods covers much of the same material as STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications, but at a somewhat higher mathematical level. The course is a one-quarter introduction to statistics that is appropriate for any student with a good command of univariate calculus including sequences and series. STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods can count toward the minor in Statistics, but for students matriculating in Autumn Quarter 2016 and after, cannot count toward the major in Statistics. </P>

<P>Students cannot hold credit for both STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications and STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods. Students completing either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods forego their AP Statistics credit for STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications. </P>

<P>STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II is recommended for students who wish to have a thorough introduction to statistical theory and methodology. STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II is more mathematically demanding than either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods. STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I assumes some familiarity with multivariate calculus, and STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II assumes some familiarity with linear algebra. </P>

<P>STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa is an alternative version of STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II that requires STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability (or STAT 25150 Introduction to Mathematical Probability-A) as a prerequisite and that replaces some probability topics with additional statistical topics not normally covered in STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I</P>

<P>II. STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa is particularly well-suited for students with a strong mathematical background who are interested in more extensive coverage of probability and statistics. Students may count either STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I or STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia, but not both, toward the 4200 units of credit required for graduation. Similarly, students may count either STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II or STAT 24510 Statistical Theory and Methods IIa, but not both, and they may count STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability or STAT 25150 Introduction to Mathematical Probability-A, but not both, toward the 4200 units of credits required for graduation. </P>

<P>Students considering a major in Statistics are encouraged to begin with either STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II or with the alternative sequence consisting of STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability and STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa, rather than with STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods. Although students with a strong mathematical background can and do take either STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II or the alternative sequence (STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability and STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa) without prior course work in statistics or probability, some students find it helpful to take either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods as preparation. </P>

<P>The core of the Statistics major consists of three courses: STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability and either STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II or STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa. Either of these is recommended as a three-quarter cognate sequence for students in the quantitative sciences and mathematics. Note that STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability may be taken before, after, or concurrently with STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II, though it is a prerequisite for STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa. </P>

<P>Additional Courses in Statistical Theory, Methods, and Applications </P>

<P>For students interested in continuing their study of statistics beyond the introductory level, STAT 22200 Linear Models And Experimental Design, STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis, STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data, STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, and STAT 26700 History of Statistics are recommended. Note that because there is some overlap between STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data and STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, only one of these two courses, not both, may be counted toward a major or minor in Statistics. The courses STAT 22200 Linear Models And Experimental Design, STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis, STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data, and STAT 26700 History of Statistics may be taken in any order. Each presumes two quarters of calculus (except STAT 26700 History of Statistics) and a previous course in statistics (STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or higher). STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods has STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis as a prerequisite. </P>

<P>For students who have completed STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II and are interested in more advanced statistical methodology courses, STAT 24620 Multivariate Statistical Analysis: Applications and Techniques, STAT 26100 Time Dependent Data, STAT 27400 Nonparametric Inference, STAT 27850 Multiple Testing, Modern Inference, and Replicability, and STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods are recommended. Many other graduate courses in Statistics offer opportunities for further study of statistical theory, methods, and applications. For details, consult the instructor or the Departmental Adviser for Majors, or visit the Graduate Announcements (http://graduateannouncements.uchicago.edu/departmentofstatistics). </P>

<P>Courses in Probability </P>

<P>Students interested in probability can begin with STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability, which can be taken separately from any Statistics courses and can be supplemented with more advanced probability courses, such as STAT 25300 Introduction to Probability Models or MATH 23500 Markov Chains, Martingales, and Brownian Motion. Students with a strong mathematical background can take STAT 31200 Introduction to Stochastic Processes I, STAT 38100 Measure-Theoretic Probability I, and STAT 38300 Measure-Theoretic Probability III. Note that because there is some overlap between MATH 23500 Markov Chains, Martingales, and Brownian Motion and STAT 31200 Introduction to Stochastic Processes I, only one of these two courses, not both, may be counted toward a major in Statistics. </P>

<P>Courses in Machine Learning </P>

<P>A student with a strong computer science background and some knowledge of elementary statistics could take STAT 27725 Machine Learning. Other courses in the category of machine learning include the advanced statistical methodology courses STAT 24620 Multivariate Statistical Analysis: Applications and Techniques and STAT 27400 Nonparametric Inference. Graduate course offerings in machine learning include STAT 37601 Machine Learning and Large-Scale Data Analysis and STAT 37710 Machine Learning. </P>

<P>Courses in Optimization </P>

<P>A student with a strong mathematical background could take STAT 28000 Optimization. Graduate course offerings in optimization include STAT 31015 Convex Optimization and STAT 31020 Mathematical Computation IIB: Nonlinear Optimization. </P>

<P>Grading </P>

<P>Students who are majoring or minoring in Statistics must receive a quality grade of at least C in all of the courses counted toward their major or minor program in Statistics. In addition, students who are majoring in Statistics must receive quality grades of at least C+ in both STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I and STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II (or at least C in both STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia and STAT 24510 Statistical Theory and Methods IIa). Subject to College and divisional regulations, and with the consent of the instructor, students may register for either quality grades or for P/F grading in any 20000-level Statistics course that is not counted toward a major or minor in Statistics. A grade of P is given only for work of C– quality or higher. </P>

<P>The following policy applies to students who wish to receive a mark of I for a Statistics course. In addition to submitting the official Incomplete Form required by the College, students must have completed at least half of the total required course work with a grade of C– or better, and they must be unable to complete the remaining course work by the end of the quarter due to an emergency. Students requesting a mark of I for STAT 20000 Elementary Statistics, STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications, or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods must obtain approval from both the current instructor and the Departmental Adviser for Introductory Courses. </P>

<P>Program Requirements for Majors </P>

<P>The requirements for the BA and BS in Statistics were updated in 2017. Students who matriculated prior to Autumn 2017 may choose to follow these updated requirements; otherwise, they should consult the archived catalog from their year of matriculation (or, at their option, any later year) for the degree requirements in Statistics. All students who matriculated in Autumn 2017 or later should follow the updated requirements described below. </P>

<P>Every candidate must obtain approval of his or her course program from the Departmental Adviser for Majors. Students majoring in Statistics should meet the general education requirement in mathematical sciences with courses in calculus. The major program includes four additional prescribed mathematics courses, four prescribed statistics courses, and two prescribed computer science courses. Students are advised to complete the four mathematics courses by the end of their third year. Additional requirements include four approved elective courses in Statistics. The BS also requires an additional prescribed mathematics course and an approved, coherent, three-quarter sequence at the 20000 level in a field to which statistics can be applied. Students who are majoring in Statistics must receive quality grades of at least C+ in both STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I and STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II (or at least C in both STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia and STAT 24510 Statistical Theory and Methods IIa), and at least C in all other courses counted toward the Statistics major. A grade of P is not acceptable for any of these courses. </P>

<P>Prescribed Mathematics Courses </P>

<P>The prescribed mathematics courses include a Calculus III requirement (MATH 13300 Elementary Functions and Calculus III or MATH 15300 Calculus III or MATH 16300 Honors Calculus III) and a Linear Algebra requirement (STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra or MATH 20250 Abstract Linear Algebra). Note that MATH 19620 Linear Algebra may not be used to meet the Linear Algebra requirement. </P>

<P>For the BA, one of the following pairs of courses is required: MATH 20000-20100 Mathematical Methods for Physical Sciences I-II or MATH 20400-20500 Analysis in Rn II-III or MATH 20800-20900 Honors Analysis in Rn II-III or the pair consisting of MATH 20000 Mathematical Methods for Physical Sciences I and STAT 28200 Dynamical Systems with Applications. </P>

<P>For the BS, students must take one of the following three courses: MATH 20000 Mathematical Methods for Physical Sciences I or MATH 20500 Analysis in Rn III or MATH 20900 Honors Analysis in Rn III; and, in addition, one of the following three courses: MATH 20100 Mathematical Methods for Physical Sciences II, MATH 27300 Basic Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations, or STAT 28200 Dynamical Systems with Applications; and, in addition, one of the following two courses: STAT 28000 Optimization or MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis. </P>

<P>Students who are completing majors in both Statistics and Economics should follow the same mathematics requirements as Statistics majors. Students who have already taken MATH 19520 Mathematical Methods for Social Sciences and MATH 19620 Linear Algebra should discuss with the Departmental Adviser for Majors how best to meet the mathematics requirements for the Statistics major. For example, such students can petition to meet the requirements for the BA in Statistics by taking all three of MATH 20100 Mathematical Methods for Physical Sciences II, STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra, and STAT 28200 Dynamical Systems with Applications. </P>

<P>Prescribed Statistics Courses </P>

<P>The four prescribed Statistics courses are STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability, STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II (or STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa), and either STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis or STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods. </P>

<P>It is recommended that students who have had some multivariable calculus begin the major by taking either STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability or STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I as their first course in probability and statistics. An alternative route to beginning the major would be to first take either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, neither of which count toward the major, but which could serve as a prerequiste for courses such as STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis, STAT 22200 Linear Models And Experimental Design, and STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data, which do count toward the major. This second path is recommended for students who need additional time to complete multivariable calculus and linear algebra prerequisites and who want to get started on the major in the meantime. </P>

<P>Electives </P>

<P>Candidates for the BA are required to take four electives, at least two of which must be on List B below. The remaining two electives may be from either List B or C. Students may count either STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data or STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, but not both, toward the BA. Similarly, students may count either MATH 23500 Markov Chains, Martingales, and Brownian Motion or STAT 31200 Introduction to Stochastic Processes I, but not both, toward the BA. </P>

<P>Candidates for the BS are required to take four electives. A candidate for the BS who has not taken STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods as one of the four prescribed statistics courses must take at least one elective from List A below, a second elective from List B, and the remaining two electives may be from either List B or </P>

<P>C. A candidate for the BS who has taken STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods as one of the four prescribed statistics courses must take at least two electives from List B and the remaining two electives may be from either List B or C. For the BS in Statistics, STAT 28000 Optimization counts as a List C elective only if MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis is also included in the program. In other words, students cannot double-count STAT 28000 Optimization toward both the four-elective requirement and the requirement to take one of STAT 28000 Optimization and MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis. Students may count either STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data or STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, but not both, toward the BS. Similarly, students may count either MATH 23500 Markov Chains, Martingales, and Brownian Motion or STAT 31200 Introduction to Stochastic Processes I, but not both, toward the BS. </P>

<P>BS Requirement of Three-Quarter Sequence in a Field to Which Statistics Can Be Applied </P>

<P>Candidates for the BS (but not the BA) are required to take an approved, coherent, three-quarter sequence at the 20000 level in a field to which statistics can be applied. Generally this sequence should be in the natural or social sciences, but a sequence in another discipline may be acceptable. Courses in MATH or CMSC may not be used for this requirement. Sequences in which earlier courses are prerequisites for later ones are preferred. Example sequences include BIOS 20198 Biodiversity-BIOS 20196 Ecology and Conservation-BIOS 23406 Biogeography; CHEM 22000-22100-22200 Organic Chemistry I-II-III; CHEM 26100-26200-26300 Quantum Mechanics; Thermodynamics; Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics; ECON 20000-20100-20200 The Elements of Economic Analysis I-II-III; GEOS 21000 Introduction to Mineralogy-GEOS 21100 Introduction to Petrology-GEOS 21200 Physics of the Earth; and PHYS 23400-23500 Quantum Mechanics I-II-PHYS 23700 Nuclei and Elementary Particles.

<P>* Credit may be granted by examination. ** A candidate for the BS who has not taken STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods as one of the four prescribed statistics courses must take at least one elective from List A, a second elective from List B, and the remaining two electives may be from either List B or C. A candidate for the BS who has taken STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods as one of the four prescribed statistics courses must take at least two electives from List B and the remaining two electives may be from either List B or C. For the BS in Statistics, STAT 28000 Optimization counts as a List C elective only if MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis is also included in the program. In other words, students cannot double-count STAT 28000 Optimization toward both the four-elective requirement and the requirement to take at least one of STAT 28000 Optimization and MATH 21100 Basic Numerical Analysis. Students may count either STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data or STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, but not both, toward the BS. Students may count either MATH 23500 Markov Chains, Martingales, and Brownian Motion or STAT 31200 Introduction to Stochastic Processes I, but not both, toward the BS. *** Generally, this sequence should be in the natural or social sciences, but a sequence in another discipline may be acceptable. Courses in MATH or CMSC may not be used for this requirement. Sequences in which earlier courses are prerequisites for later ones are preferred. Example sequences include BIOS 20198 Biodiversity-BIOS 20196 Ecology and Conservation-BIOS 23406 Biogeography; CHEM 22000-22100-22200 Organic Chemistry I-II-III; CHEM 26100-26200-26300 Quantum Mechanics; Thermodynamics; Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics; ECON 20000-20100-20200 The Elements of Economic Analysis I-II-III; GEOS 21000 Introduction to Mineralogy-GEOS 21100 Introduction to Petrology-GEOS 21200 Physics of the Earth; and </P>

<P>PHYS 23400-23500 Quantum Mechanics I-II-PHYS 23700 Nuclei and Elementary Particles. All sequences must be approved by the Departmental Adviser for Majors. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>The BA or BS with honors is awarded to students with Statistics as their primary major who have a GPA of </P>

<P>3.0 or higher overall and 3.25 or higher in the courses in the major and also complete an approved honors paper (STAT 29900 Bachelor's Paper). This paper is typically based on a structured research program that the student undertakes, with faculty supervision, in the first quarter of his or her fourth year. Eligible students who wish to be considered for honors should consult the Departmental Adviser for Majors before the end of their third year. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the bachelor's paper or project requirement in another major or course. NOTE: Credit for STAT 29900 Bachelor's Paper will not count towards the courses required for a major in Statistics. </P>

<P>Joint BA/MS or BS/MS in Statistics </P>

<P>This program enables unusually well-qualified undergraduate students to complete an MS in Statistics along with a BA or BS during their four years at the College. Although a student may receive a BA or BS in any field, a program of study other than Statistics is recommended. </P>

<P>Only a small number of students will be selected for the program through a competitive admissions process. Participants must apply to the MS program in Statistics by June 1 of their third year for admission to candidacy for an MS in Statistics during their fourth year. To be considered, students should have completed almost all of their undergraduate requirements, including all of their general education and language competence requirements, by the end of their third year. They should also have completed, at a minimum, STAT 24400-24500 Statistical Theory and Methods I-II (or STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia-IIa) with A or A-grades and all the mathematics requirements for the Statistics major with very high grades. While these are the minimum criteria, admission is competitive, and additional qualifications may be needed. Interested students are strongly encouraged to consult both the Departmental Adviser for Majors and their College adviser early in their third year. </P>

<P>Participants in the joint BA/MS or BS/MS program must meet the same requirements as students in the MS program in Statistics. Of the nine courses that are required at the appropriate level, up to three may also meet the requirements of an undergraduate program. For example, STAT 24410-24510 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia</P>

<P>IIa and STAT 34300 Applied Linear Stat Methods, which satisfy requirements for the MS in Statistics, could also be used to satisfy requirements of a BA or BS program in Statistics. </P>

<P>Other requirements include a master's paper and participation in the Consulting Program of the Department of Statistics. For details, visit the Department of Statistics Admissions page (http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/ admissions/featured). </P>

<P>Minor Program in Statistics </P>

<P>The Statistics minor focuses on statistical methodology, in contrast to the Statistics major, which has a substantial theoretical component. The minor in Statistics requires five courses, some prescribed and some elective, chosen in consultation with the Departmental Adviser for Minors. By the end of Spring Quarter of the student’s third year, a student who wishes to complete the Statistics minor must complete the Consent to Complete a Minor Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) and obtain approval from the Departmental Adviser for Minors. </P>

<P>The core of the Statistics minor consists of STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis and either STAT 22200 Linear Models And Experimental Design or STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data (or both). These three courses may be taken in any order after meeting the prerequisite of at least two quarters calculus and introductory statistics: STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications, STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II, STAT 24510 Statistical Theory and Methods IIa, or AP credit for STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications. </P>

<P>An approved substitute for STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data is STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, which requires STAT 22400 Applied Regression Analysis as prerequisite and is offered by the Department of Public Health Sciences. Students may count either STAT 22600 Analysis of Categorical Data or STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods, but not both, toward the Statistics minor. STAT 22700 Biostatistical Methods does not count against the limit of no more than two electives from outside the Department of Statistics. </P>

<P>To complete the five-course minor, students must choose from among the approved electives listed below. No more than two electives may be satisfied by courses offered by departments other than the Department of Statistics. Students may petition the Department Adviser for Minors to include more than two electives from outside the Department of Statistics. Regardless, at most one elective can be satisfied by a course offered by the Booth School of Business. </P>

<P>Either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, but not both, may be used as an elective if taken prior to any other courses for which at least STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods is prerequisite. If either STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications or STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods are used to fulfill a requirement for any major(s), other minors, or general education requirements, then neither course may be used to fulfill a requirement in the Statistics minor. Students may not use AP credit to meet a requirement for the Statistics minor. </P>

<P>The list of courses approved for the minor may change from time to time as courses change and new courses are added. Please consult the Departmental Adviser for Minors for approval of your minor program plan. Students may petition the Departmental Adviser for Minors for approval of another course. Such courses must have a minimum statistics prerequisite of introductory statistics (STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications, STAT 23400 Statistical Models and Methods, STAT 24500 Statistical Theory and Methods II, or STAT 24510 Statistical Theory and Methods IIa) and cannot substantially overlap with the topics covered in departmental courses or other courses in the student's minor program. </P>

<P>No courses in the Statistics minor can be double counted with the student's major(s), other minors, or general education requirements. An approved elective must replace any course required for the Statistics minor that is used to meet the requirements for any major(s), other minors, or general education requirements. </P>

<P>The following 20000-level courses offered by the Department of Statistics cannot be included in a Statistics minor: STAT 20000 Elementary Statistics, STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra, STAT 24400 Statistical Theory and Methods I, STAT 24410 Statistical Theory and Methods Ia, STAT 25100 Introduction to Mathematical Probability, STAT 25150 Introduction to Mathematical Probability-A, STAT 25300 Introduction to Probability Models, STAT 27725 Machine Learning, STAT 28000 Optimization, STAT 28200 Dynamical Systems with Applications, STAT 29700 Undergraduate Research, or any graduate courses in probability. </P>

<P>Students who are minoring in Statistics must receive a quality grade of at least C+ in all of the courses counted toward the minor. A grade of P is not acceptable for any of these courses. More than half of the courses counted toward the Statistics minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Students may not use AP Statistics credit for STAT 22000 Statistical Methods and Applications to meet a requirement for the Statistics minor. </P>

Specific topics include maximum likelihood estimation, posterior distributions, confidence and credible intervals, principles of hypothesis testing, likelihood ratio tests, multinomial distributions, and chi-square tests. Additional topics may include diagnostic plots, bootstrapping, a critical comparison of Bayesian and frequentist inference, and the role of conditioning in statistical inference. Examples are drawn from the social, physical, and biological sciences. The statistical software package R will be used to analyze datasets from these fields and instruction in the use of R is part of the course.

<P>STAT 26300. Introduction to Statistical Genetics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>As a result of technological advances over the past few decades, there is a tremendous wealth of genetic data currently being collected. These data have the potential to shed light on the genetic factors influencing traits and diseases, as well as on questions of ancestry and population history. The aim of this course is to develop a thorough understanding of probabilistic models and statistical theory and methods underlying analysis of genetic data, focusing on problems in complex trait mapping, with some coverage of population genetics. Although the case studies are all in the area of statistical genetics, the statistical inference topics, which will include likelihood-based inference, linear mixed models, and restricted maximum likelihood, among others, are widely applicable to other areas. No biological background is needed, but a strong foundation in statistical theory and methods is assumed. Prerequisite(s): STAT 24500 or STAT 24510 </P>

<P>STAT 26700. History of Statistics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the problems of multiple testing and statistical inference from a modern point of view. High-dimensional data is now common in many applications across the biological, physical, and social sciences. With this increased capacity to generate and analyze data, classical statistical methods may no longer ensure the reliability or replicability of scientific discoveries. We will examine a range of modern methods that provide statistical inference tools in the context of modern large-scale data analysis. The course will have weekly assignments as well as a final project, both of which will include both theoretical and computational components. Equivalent Course(s): STAT 30850 </P>

<P>STAT 28000. Optimization. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This is an introductory course on optimization that will cover the rudiments of unconstrained and constrained optimization of a real-valued multivariate function. The focus is on the settings where this function is, respectively, linear, quadratic, convex, or differentiable. Time permitting, topics such as nonsmooth, integer, vector, and dynamic optimization may be briefly addressed. Materials will include basic duality theory, optimality conditions, and intractability results, as well as algorithms and applications.

<P>TAPS 10100. Drama: Embodiment and Transformation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Students examine the performance and the aesthetics of two dramatic works in contrasting styles but with unifying themes. The goal of this course is to develop an appreciation and understanding of a variety of techniques and of the processes by which they are theatrically realized. Rather than focus on the dramatic text itself, we concentrate on the piece in performance, including the impact of cultural context on interpretation. To achieve this, students are required to act, direct, and design during the course. Instructor(s): D. New, P. Pascoe, S.Bockley, S. Murray, D. DeMayo, D.

<P>TAPS 10300. Text and Performance. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course offers an introduction to a number of significant dramatic works and seminal figures in the theorization of theater and performance. But the course's aspirations go much further: we will be concentrating upon the intersection of interpretation and enactment, asking how these pieces appear on stage and why. This will not be merely descriptive work, but crucially it will be interpretive and physical work. Students will prepare and present applied interpretations-that is, interpretations that enable conceptual insights to take artistic form. Throughout, we will be searching for that elusive combination of philological rigor, theoretical sophistication, and creative inspiration-probing the theoretical stakes of creativity and testing the creative implications of analytic insights. Instructor(s): D. Levin, L. Kruger, S.Bockley, S. Murray, J. Muse Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter Note(s): Attendance at first class meeting is mandatory. Experience in dramatic analysis or performance not required. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>TAPS 10500. Staging Terror. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course meets the general education requirement in the dramatic, musical, and visual arts. This course explores the interplay between horror, terror, and pleasure through in-class discussions of theoretical works and the possibilities of practical creative application. The paradox of the attraction to repulsion will be considered as well as the values of shock, suspense, and subtlety. Texts will include Grand Guignol, Shakespeare, Gothic novels, and horror films. Instructor(s): H. Coleman Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Attendance at the first class is mandatory. This course is offered in alternate years. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>TAPS 10600. Staging Desire. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores the interplays between romance, attractions, and distractions through in-class discussions of theoretical works and the possibilities of practical creative application. The paradox of instant gratification and prolonged desire will be considered as well as the values of shock, suspense, and subtlety. Texts will include classic and contemporary drama, vampire cult fiction, fairy tales, films, and theoretic source material. Working 4-dimensionally, we will examine how theorized stagings can evoke and undermine sentimentality. This course will constantly question how analysis itself can be a performative practice and how performance can serve as a critical endeavor.The course will culminate in a series of original scenes to be shown at the end of the quarter. Experience in dramatic analysis or performance not required. Instructor(s): H. Coleman Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Attendance at first class meeting is mandatory. Course offered in alternate years. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>TAPS 10700. Introduction to Stage Design. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Course explores the application of the visual and aural arts to the varied forms of design for the stage (i.e., scenic, lighting, costume, sound). We pay particular attention to the development of a cogent and well-reasoned analysis of text and an articulate use of the elements of design through a set of guided practical projects. Instructor(s): K. Boetcher Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Note(s): Lab fee is required. Attendance at first class meeting is mandatory. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts. </P>

<P>TAPS 15500. Beginning Screenwriting. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces the basic elements of a literate screenplay, including format, exposition, characterization, dialog, voice-over, adaptation, and the vagaries of the three-act structure. Weekly meetings include a brief lecture period, screenings of scenes from selected films, extended discussion, and assorted readings of class assignments. Because this is primarily a writing class, students write a four- to five-page weekly assignment related to the script topic of the week. Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 27102 Instructor(s): J. Petrakis Terms Offered: Autumn,Winter </P>

<P>TAPS 20100. Twentieth-Century American Drama. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Beginning with O'Neill's 'Long Day's Journey into Night' through the American avant-garde to the most recent production on Broadway, this course focuses on American contemporary playwrights who have made a significant impact with regard to dramatic form in context to specific decade as well as cumulatively through the twentieth century. Textual analysis is consistently oriented towards production possibilities, both historically and hypothetically. Instructor(s): H. Coleman Terms Offered: TBD Note(s): Attendance at first class meeting is mandatory. This course is offered in alternate years. </P>

<P>TAPS 20600. Adapting the Unadaptable. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Fiction has always provided rich source material for drama. But much 20th and 21st century fiction can seem unadaptable-it is often sprawling, poetic, interior, fragmentary, or cerebral (or all of the above!). This hands-on course will challenge students to approach modern and contemporary literature with unconventional tools of staging, editing, and design. Students will also be introduced to the work of contemporary theater companies and productions that have taken on seemingly impossible adaptation projects, and closely study adaptations of Jorge Luis Borges, Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf and others. Instructor(s): S. Bockley Terms Offered: TBD Note(s): Attendance at first class is mandatory. </P>

<P>TAPS 20610. Adaptation &amp; Translation in Theater-Making. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course combines seminar and studio practices to investigate the ways in which theater and performance-makers create work in relation to shifting contexts. How are theatre adaptations and translations shaped by aesthetics, geography, socio-economic conditions, cultural transition, shifting formulations of race, ethnicity, and gender? How do theatre-makers conceive and realize the resonance of their work within local and across transnational spaces? This course explores these and other questions through practical experiments in adaptation and translation, case studies of artists, attending performances, critical readings on adaptation and translation theory, and discussions of the relationship between art and national and transnational political imaginaries. At the center of the course is a visit from the artistic directors of two theater companies working with translations and adaptations of &quot;World Literature&quot; for a (post)Soviet context, one based in Uzbekistan and the other in Kazakhstan. We hope the exposure to their working processes will animate the questions of the course in exciting and unpredictable ways. For their final project, students will have the option of writing a critical paper, writing a proposal for a speculative work, or creating an artistic work. Instructor(s): L. Danzig, L. Feldman Terms Offered: Autumn Note(s): Attendance at first class session is mandatory. Equivalent Course(s): HMRT 20610, HMRT 30610, CMLT 20610, CMLT 30611, TAPS 30610, ENGL 30610, ENGL 20610 </P>

<P>TAPS 20700. Dramaturgy and Dramatic Criticism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is an orientation and practicum in contemporary dramaturgy. After surveying Enlightenment treatises that occasioned Western dramaturgical practices, students will critically engage present-day writings that consider the objectives and ultimate raisons d'être for the production dramaturg. Students then undertake dramaturgical research, exploring different methodologies and creative mind-sets for four representative performance genres: period plays; new plays; operas or musicals; and installations or performance art. Special attention will be given to cultivating skills for providing constructive feedback and practicing dramaturgy as an artistic collaborator and fellow creator.

<H3>Tutorial Studies </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64373">Program of Study </P>

<P>Tutorial Studies is a program only in an administrative sense; it serves as an alternative for students who propose a coherent course of studies that clearly will not fit within a regular major. Students in the College may be admitted to Tutorial Studies at any point in their careers; their requirements will then be written to fill the time they have left until graduation. On the whole, the New Collegiate Division prefers to admit students to this format late rather than early: for a senior year in Tutorial Studies rather than a two-year program and for two years rather than three. Admission to Tutorial Studies is handled separately from admission to other New Collegiate Division programs. </P>

<P>Students in Tutorial Studies are held to all College requirements and to the New Collegiate Division requirements, including the production of substantial written work. Tutorial Studies makes no other requirements of students admitted to the program, but particular students may be held to certain requirements judged appropriate by the tutor or the program chairman. </P>

<P>Students in Tutorial Studies have no major; instead, all students have a tutor. A tutor is a member of the Chicago faculty who has agreed to take responsibility for their work. An individual student's education is worked out between the student and the tutor under the general supervision of the program chairman. Because of the special burden placed on the tutor, the rule states: the student and the tutor are admitted together. Students may enter Tutorial Studies only when they have found a tutor and after there has been sufficient discussion among student, tutor, and program chairman to establish to the satisfaction of all three that: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>the student knows what he or she wants to do </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>the tutor understands it and wants to take charge of it </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>it is something worth doing and something that will constitute an appropriate segment of a College education </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>it can be done with the available resources </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>it cannot be done effectively within any existing College program. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>A student in Tutorial Studies, like other New Collegiate Division students, takes both regular courses and reading courses. Reading courses may be taken with members of the faculty other than the tutor. </P>

<P>In the past, successful Tutorial Studies students have generally belonged to one of two categories: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>students who wish to focus on some relatively narrow topic (the poetry of Baudelaire, for example) but in a rather broad way, that is, in terms of poetics, culture history, psychology, and so on. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>students who wish to construct some more conventional program that the College does not offer: American studies, for instance, or education. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>Admissions to Tutorial Studies are made by the master of the New Collegiate Division upon the recommendation of the program chairman. In the nature of the case, requirements in Tutorial Studies can hardly be specified. It is expected that thirteen courses will be devoted to the immediate purposes of the student's project, of which several will be individual study courses with the principal tutor or other faculty members. NOTE: Courses used to meet requirements for the Tutorial Studies major must be chosen in consultation with the faculty tutor and completed subsequent to admission into the program. </P>

<P>Grading, Transcripts, and Recommendations </P>

<P>The independent study and major papers required by the New Collegiate Division are best evaluated in faculty statements on the nature and quality of the work. In support of the independent study grades of Pass, Fail, and Incomplete, faculty supervisors are asked to submit such statements to student files maintained in the New Collegiate Division office. Responses to the major papers and copies of the papers themselves are also available in this collection of statements, which is used to support graduate applications and to evaluate New Collegiate Division candidates for Phi Beta Kappa, College honors, and other awards. Students should request statements of reference from faculty with whom they have worked. </P>

<P>Honors </P>

<P>Honors are awarded in all the New Collegiate Division majors. In Tutorial Studies the essential requirement for honors is an exceptionally distinguished senior paper. Papers considered worthy of honors by the initial readers are referred to a third reader whose identity is unknown to the student. In addition, honors depend on the student's grades, especially in the Tutorial Studies program; a 3.50 GPA is roughly the floor but, because a </P>

<P>good deal of New Collegiate Division work tends to be ungraded, the GPA standard cannot be stated precisely. Faculty evaluations of ungraded work are taken into account along with grades. </P>

<H3>Visual Arts </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64374">Department Website: http://dova.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>Program of Study </P>

<P>The Department of Visual Arts (DoVA) is concerned with art making as a vehicle for exploring creativity, expression, perception, and the constructed world. Whether students take courses listed under ARTV to meet a general education requirement or as part of a major in visual arts, the goal is that they will develop communicative, analytical, and expressive skills through the process of artistic production. The following three courses meet the general education requirement in the arts: ARTV 10100 Visual Language: On Images, ARTV 10200 Visual Language: On Objects, and ARTV 10300 Visual Language: On Time and Space. Most advanced courses require one of these as a prerequisite. (See individual course listings for specific prerequisites.) </P>

<P>Range of Course Offerings </P>

<P>The following courses introduce visual communication through the manipulation of various traditional and nonart materials, engaging principles of visual language while stressing the relationship between form and meaning. Readings and visits to local museums and galleries are required. </P>

<P>ARTV courses numbered 21000 to 29700 include media specific courses that teach technical skills and provide a conceptual framework for working in these media (e.g., painting, photography, sculpture, video). Also included are more advanced studio courses designed to investigate the vast array of objects, spaces, and ideas embedded in the contemporary artistic landscape. ARTV courses numbered 20000 to 20999 are not studio-based and may not be counted toward studio requirements for the major or minor. ARTV courses in the 20000 to 20999 range may be counted toward the two electives relevant to the major. (See Program Requirements for more information.) </P>

<P>Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in visual arts. Information follows the description of the major. </P>

<P>Program Requirements </P>

<P>The BA program in the Department of Visual Arts is intended for students interested in the practice and study of art. DoVA's faculty consists of a core of artists and other humanists interested in making and thinking about art. Students who major in visual arts take an individually arranged program of studio, lecture, and seminar courses that may include some courses outside the Humanities Collegiate Division. The program seeks to foster understanding of art from several perspectives: the practice and intention of the creator, the visual conventions employed, and the perception and critical reception of the audience. In addition to work in the studio, these aims may require study of many other subjects, including but not limited to art history, intellectual history, criticism, and aesthetics. </P>

<P>All students take ARTV 10100 Visual Language: On Images, ARTV 10200 Visual Language: On Objects, or ARTV 10300 Visual Language: On Time and Space in the first two years of their studies. After completing one of these general education courses but no later than Winter Quarter of their third year, students meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to plan the rest of their program. At least six of the courses beyond the general education requirement in the arts must be drawn from the second level of studio-based offerings (studio art courses numbered 21000 and above). Please note that only courses that are primarily focused on art making can be applied toward this requirement. Students may take up to two studio-based independent study courses (ARTV 29700 Independent Study in Visual Arts) toward their six studio requirements. Two of the remaining three electives may include any intellectually consistent combination of visual arts studio courses, visual arts critical and theory courses, and any other relevant offerings in the College. One elective must be a 20000-level (not meeting the general education requirement in the arts) course in Art History (ARTH). </P>

<P>Students take ARTV 29600 Junior Seminar in their third year. At the end of the Junior Seminar, students may choose to apply for the visual arts studio track. Places in the studio track are limited. Applicants will be reviewed by a faculty committee at the end of their third year, and studio track decisions will be announced before the start of the Autumn Quarter of fourth year. Students in the studio track present their work in a thesis exhibition and may be eligible to receive shared studio space in their senior year. (See “Studio Track” section below for more details.) </P>

<P>Students who wish to study abroad in their third year should contact the department as soon as possible to discuss options for taking the Junior Seminar, which is generally only offered one quarter per year, in the Spring Quarter. Junior Seminar can sometimes be taken in the second year with permission from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. </P>

<P>All visual arts majors must take ARTV 29850 Senior Seminar in the Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. Students in the studio track are required to take an additional course, ARTV 29900 Senior Project, which serves </P>

<P>as a critical forum to prepare for the thesis exhibition in the spring. (See “Studio Track” section below for more details.) </P>

<P>ARTV 15500. A Curating History: The Documenta Case. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course proposes a reading of recent art history as seen through the periodical prism of one of the field's most important, signature events - the five-yearly Documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany. Starting with the landmark 1972 edition organized by Harald Szeemann and ending with the 2017 edition which I worked on as a member of its curatorial team, the course will discuss one Documenta edition per class to touch upon key issues of contemporary art practice and theory: the dynamics of globalization; gender and identity; the vagaries of market influence; history and memory; the pressures of the political; questions of aesthetics and beauty. As a history of exhibition making and curatorial practice, the course will also draw on recent developments of the biennial model (in Venice, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, the Whitney etc.), and will be recounted in part from the perspective of actual exhibition-making experience. The class will consist of hands-on curatorial experimentation, as well as writing and reading assignments that mirror and follow the 45-year arc of our historical periodization. Instructor(s): D. Roelstraete Terms Offered: Winter Note(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.

<P>ARTV 20002-20003. History of International Cinema I: Silent Era; History of International Cinema II: Sound Era to 1960. </P>

<P>This sequence is required of students majoring in Cinema and Media Studies. Taking these courses in sequence is strongly recommended but not required. </P>

<P>ARTV 20002. History of International Cinema I: Silent Era. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course provides a survey of the history of cinema from its emergence in the mid-1890s to the transition to sound in the late 1920s. We will examine the cinema as a set of aesthetic, social, technological, national, cultural, and industrial practices as they were exercised and developed during this 30-year span. Especially important for our examination will be the exchange of film techniques, practices, and cultures in an international context. We will also pursue questions related to the historiography of the cinema, and examine early attempts to theorize and account for the cinema as an artistic and social phenomenon.

<P>ARTV 20008. Ways of Curating and Collecting. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar takes stock of contemporary currents in curating and collecting practices at a time when we are experiencing rapid expansion of the museum sector internationally, and witnessing the growing ubiquity of &quot;curation&quot; within the spheres of leisure, culture, entertainment and tourism. Using institutions across campus, the city of Chicago and beyond as our primary locus, we will explore curatorial and collecting strategies employed by a variety of visual arts institutions and platforms from the scale of the single-room/single curator gallery, to the museum and the international biennial. We will consider how curatorial and exhibition-making practices have evolved from the latter half of the 20th century to the present day. We will consider the sociocultural and political implications of curatorial work, and reflect on the shifting status of the art object within collecting and non-collecting institutions. Together we will explore significant curatorial projects at a local, national and international level; we will undertake site visits as well as play host to visiting curators, artists and thinkers. Course readings will feature the writings of seminal international curators as well as selections from historians and theorists in the field of curatorial studies. Students will work through a series of independent and collaborative assignments as well as a final project that integrates curatorial theory and practice. Instructor(s): Y. Umolu Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ARTV 30008, ARTH 26110, ARTH 36110 </P>

<P>ARTV 20010. Contemporary Art in Paris. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we will explore important institutions and contexts for exhibiting contemporary international art in the city of Paris. Our approach will be ethnographic as well as aesthetic and take place at various scales: from national museums to arts foundations, galleries, artist studios, and alternative spaces and artists' &quot;squats." Of special interest will be how different architectures and spaces of installation affect our reception and understanding of art. Video and moving image installation will be a special emphasis where possible. Course work will include presentations and weekly contributions to a public blog. Possible field trips could include the Musée d'art moderne de la ville de Paris, la Cinémathèque Française, Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Galerie Marion Goodman, Les Frigos, and the Paris Art Fair at the Grand Palais. </P>

<P>ARTV 20012. A Curating Case-Study: The Hut. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course - part curatorial practice, part art theory - will be taught in tandem with an exhibition titled &quot;The Hut&quot;, opening at the Neubauer Collegium gallery in the spring of 2019. We will be using this exhibition project, originally conceived for the 2018 Venice architecture biennial, as a framework, test site and occasional hut-sized classroom for hands-on curatorial exercises as much as artistic and philosophical debate. Both seminar and exhibition center on three philosophers' huts; these act as platforms to discuss a wide range of issues pertaining to modern and contemporary art debates: Ludwig Wittgenstein's hut in Norway, Martin Heidegger's hut in the Black Forest, and a Ian Hamilton Finlay sculpture titled &quot;Adorno's Hut&quot; (after Theodor Adorno). The course will map the relationships between these three philosophers and the shadows they cast across 20th century aesthetics and art theory, as well as consider topics related to escape and escapism, exile and retreat, habitation and homelessness, as seen through the prism of architecturally inflected contemporary art practices. The seminar's bibliography will be shaped in large part by readings of said philosophers. We will also be studying artworks, meeting artists and visiting exhibitions and sites of architectural interest. A final project, consisting of writing & construction work, will seek to expand the scope of philosophical architecture and building philosophy. Instructor(s): D. Roelstraete Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 26790, ARTV 30012, ARTH 36790 </P>

<P>ARTV 20210. Imagining Chicago's Common Buildings. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This class is an architectural studio based in the common residential buildings of Chicago and the city's built environment. While a design project and architectural skills will be the focus of the class, it will also incorporate readings, a small amount of writing, and some social and geographical history. We will: (1) give students interested in pursuing architecture or the study of cities experience with a studio class and some skills related to architectural thinking, (2) acquaint students intimately with Chicago's common residential buildings and built fabric, and (3) situate all this within a context of social thought about residential architecture, common buildings, housing, and the city. Instructor(s): L. Joyner Terms Offered: Autumn Equivalent Course(s): AMER 24190, ARTH 24190, GEOG 24190, ENST 24190 </P>

<P>ARTV 20300. Introduction to Film Analysis. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course introduces basic concepts of film analysis, which are discussed through examples from different national cinemas, genres, and directorial oeuvres. Along with questions of film technique and style, we consider the notion of the cinema as an institution that comprises an industrial system of production, social and aesthetic norms and codes, and particular modes of reception. Films discussed include works by Hitchcock, Porter, Griffith, Eisenstein, Lang, Renoir, Sternberg, and Welles. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter Note(s): Required of students taking a major or minor in Cinema and Media Studies. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 10800, ARTH 20000, CMST 10100 </P>

<P>ARTV 20400. Theories of Media. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the concept of media and mediation in very broad terms, looking not only at modern technical media and mass media, but at the very idea of a medium as a means of communication, a set of institutional practices, and a habitat in which images proliferate and take on a &quot;life of their own.&quot; The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the &quot;unmediated&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot;? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of &quot;metapictures&quot; or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become &quot;mixed&quot; in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T. Mitchell Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Any 100-level ARTH or COVA course, or consent of instructor. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 32800, CMST 27800, AMER 30800, ARTH 35900, ENGL 12800, ARTH 25900, CMST 37800 </P>

<P>Equivalent Course(s): CRWR 12121 </P>

<P>ARTV 20663. Urban Studies: Placemaking. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course considers the values that drive neighborhood transformation, how policy is shaped and implemented, and the role that arts and culture can play in mindful city-building. Classroom hours will be spent with Theaster Gates, professor, Department of Visual Art, in addition to other UChicago faculty, discussing key principles in guiding city redevelopment in mindful and equitable ways. Students will gain field experience working with Place Lab, Gates's multidisciplinary team that documents and demonstrates urban ethical redevelopment strategies initiated through arts and culture. Working across a variety of projects, students will be exposed to programming, data collection, development, community building, strategy, and documentation. Weekly site visits will give students the opportunity to see analogous projects and meet practitioners throughout Chicago. Equivalent Course(s): PBPL 25663 </P>

<P>ARTV 20700. Alternate Reality Games: Theory and Production. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Games are one of the most prominent and influential media of our time. This experimental course explores the emerging genre of &quot;alternate reality&quot; or &quot;transmedia&quot; gaming. Throughout the quarter, we will approach new media theory through the history, aesthetics, and design of transmedia games. These games build on the narrative strategies of novels, the performative role-playing of theater, the branching techniques of electronic literature, the procedural qualities of video games, and the team dynamics of sports. Beyond the subject matter, students will design modules of an Alternate Reality Game in small groups. Students need not have a background in media or technology, but a wide-ranging imagination, interest in new media culture, or arts practice will make for a more exciting quarter. Instructor(s): Patrick Jagoda, Heidi Coleman Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing. Instructor consent required. To apply, submit writing through online form at http://bigproblems.uchicago.edu; see course description. Once given consent, attendance on the first day is mandatory. Questions:mb31@uchicago.edu.

<P>ARTV 20704. Photo/Modernism/Esthetic. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course presents the history of photographic practices in the United States, beginning in the late 19th century and extending into the 1980s, aimed at gaining an audience for photographs within museums of art. The issues under study include the contention over claims about medium specificity, notions of photographic objectivity, a peculiarly photographic esthetics, the division of photography into two categories-art vs. documentary-and the role of tradition and canon formation in the attempted definition of the photographic medium. Instructor(s): J. Snyder Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): ARTH 37304, ARTV 30704, ARTH 27304 </P>

<P>ARTV 20805. Framing, Re-framing, and Un-framing Cinema. 100 Units. </P>

<P>By cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible band called film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to new media and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels and reassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the most radical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between the OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving image for more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologies to explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrial forces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use new computer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developed for and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching, analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless of previous programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture. Equivalent Course(s): ARTV 30805, CMST 37805, CMST 27805 </P>

<P>ARTV 21002. Life Drawing. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is designed to introduce the student to observational drawing of the human figure. The subject of the course will be the live nude model. The object of the course is to see through proportions and the anatomy of the human body and draw out a likeness, rendering present the body as seen in its materiality, its structure, its finitude. Lectures on anatomy and the history of drawing will be ongoing and stitched into this studio course, as will the critique of drawings generated in class. Instructor(s): D.

<H3>Big Problems </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64376">Department Website: http://bigproblems.uchicago.edu </P>

<P>The Big Problems courses that follow are among a growing number of capstone experiences offered as electives to fourth-year students in the College. Under special circumstances involving senior project needs, third-year students may petition for permission to register for a Big Problems course. </P>

<P>&quot;Big problems&quot; are characteristically matters of global or universal concern that intersect with several disciplines and affect a variety of interest groups. They are problems for which solutions are crucially important but not obviously available. </P>

<P>Big Problems courses emphasize process as well as content: learning how to creatively confront difficult intellectual and pragmatic problems wider than one's area or expertise and to consider how to deal with the uncertainty that results. This often points to the importance of working in groups. If the core curriculum provides a basis for learning and the majors develop more specialized knowledge, the Big Problems experience leads to the development of skills for thinking about and dealing with the important but unyielding issues of our time. </P>

<P>Big Problems courses encourage linkage to BA papers, research experiences, or internships. They use interdisciplinary team teaching, seeking to cross disciplines and divisions and to transcend familiar models of content, organization, and instruction. </P>

<P>Each year a Big Problems Lecture Series features outside speakers and additional workshops for interested students. </P>

<P>BPRO 28200. Narrating Migration. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Human migration is one of the most pressing global problems of our time, though it is not a new phenomenon. It has shaped societies throughout time, and the degree to which it is perceived as a &quot;problem&quot; or an &quot;opportunity" changes radically according to circumstances and ideologies. In this course, we will analyze the different ways in which migration has been perceived, understood, and experienced. We will focus on two intense episodes in the global history of migration: migration from early nineteenth-century Britain; and migration to late 20th and 21stcentury America. Our emphasis throughout will be on the ways in which migration is narrated: the stories that societies tell about the migration of themselves and others. We will cover a wide range of migration narratives, including those of creative writers and artists, and will consider them through the lenses of literary criticism, history, theory, and also artistic practice itself.

<P>BPRO 28300. Disability and Design. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Disability is often an afterthought, an unexpected tragedy to be mitigated, accommodated, or overcome. In cultural, political, and educational spheres, disabilities are non-normative, marginal, even invisible. This runs counter to many of our lived experiences of difference where, in fact, disabilities of all kinds are the &quot;new normal.&quot; In this interdisciplinary course, we center both the category and experience of disability. Moreover, we consider the stakes of explicitly designing for different kinds of bodies and minds. Rather than approaching disability as a problem to be accommodated, we consider the affordances that disability offers for design. This course begins by situating us in the growing discipline of Disability Studies and the activist (and intersectional) Disability Justice movement. We then move to four two-week units in specific areas where disability meets design: architecture, infrastructure, and public space; education and the classroom; economics, employment, and public policy; and aesthetics. Traversing from architecture to art, and from education to economic policy, this course asks how we can design for access. Instructor(s): M. Friedner, J.

<P>BPRO 28400. Thinking Psychoanalytically: From the Sciences to the Arts. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Since Freud's seminal investigation into the nature of the mind, psychoanalytic thinking has offered a unique approach to unconscious, relational, and meaningful dimensions of human experience. Despite assaults on the field from numerous quarters, psychoanalytic thinking remains central to the work of practitioners across an array of disciplines. After an introduction to key psychoanalytic concepts including the unconscious, repression, and transference, we will investigate some of the ways in which these ideas are mobilized within clinical practice, neuroscience, anthropology, education, philosophy, literary studies, and the visual arts through a series of lectures presented by specialists from these fields. Along the way, we will gain an appreciation for some of the ways in which psychoanalytic perspectives continue to inspire a variety of current scientific and humanistic projects. Instructor(s): A. Beal; Staff Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Third or fourth-year standing Equivalent Course(s): ANTH 24316 </P>

<P>BPRO 28700. Alternate Reality Games: Theory and Production. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Games are one of the most prominent and influential media of our time. This experimental course explores the emerging genre of &quot;alternate reality&quot; or &quot;transmedia&quot; gaming. Throughout the quarter, we will approach new media theory through the history, aesthetics, and design of transmedia games. These games build on the narrative strategies of novels, the performative role-playing of theater, the branching techniques of electronic literature, the procedural qualities of video games, and the team dynamics of sports. Beyond the subject matter, students will design modules of an Alternate Reality Game in small groups. Students need not have a background in media or technology, but a wide-ranging imagination, interest in new media culture, or arts practice will make for a more exciting quarter.

<P>BPRO 28800. From Fossils to Fermi's Paradox: Origin and Evolution of Intelligent Life. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course approaches Fermi's question, &quot;Are we alone in the universe?,&quot; in the light of recent evidence primarily from three fields: the history and evolution of life on Earth (paleontology), the meaning and evolution of complex signaling and intelligence (cognitive science), and the distribution, composition and conditions on planets and exoplanets (astronomy). We also review the history and parameters governing extrasolar detection and signaling. The aim of the course is to assess the interplay between convergence and contingency in evolution, the selective advantage of intelligence, and the existence and nature of life elsewhere in the universe - in order to better understand the meaning of human existence.

<P>BPRO 28900. Inequality: Origins, Dimensions, and Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>For the last four decades, incomes in the United States and across the globe have grown more unequal. That fact has attracted worldwide attention from scholars, governments, religious figures, and public intellectuals. In this interdisciplinary course, participating faculty members drawn from across the University and invited guest speakers will trace and examine the sources and challenges of inequality and mobility in many of its dimensions, from economic, political, legal, biological, philosophical, public policy, and other perspectives. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Inequality. Instructor(s): A. Sanderson and Staff Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing Note(s): ECON 24720 or ECON 22410 may be used as an Economics elective, but only one of the two may be used toward Economics major requirements.

<P>BPRO 29000. Energy and Energy Policy. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course shows how scientific constraints affect economic and other policy decisions regarding energy, what energy-based issues confront our society, how we may address them through both policy and scientific study, and how the policy and scientific aspects can and should interact. We address specific technologies, both those now in use and those under development, and the policy questions associated with each, as well as with more overarching aspects of energy policy that may affect several, perhaps many, technologies.

<P>BPRO 21500. What is Civic Knowledge? 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is civic knowledge? Although civic rights and duties are supposedly universal to all citizens in a &quot;democratic&quot; nation, their implementation often depends on the strength of community connections and the circulation of knowledge across racial, class, and social boundaries. Focusing on the city of Chicago, we ask how citizens (in their roles as citizens) forge communities, make urban plans, and participate in civic affairs. How does the city construct the public spheres of its residents? Are the social practices of Chicagoans truly &quot;democratic?&quot; Could they be? What does &quot;Chicago&quot; stand for, as a political and cultural symbol? For both Chicagoans and their representatives, the circulation of knowledge depends not only on conventional media but also on how the city is constructed and managed through digital media.

<P>BPRO 22200. Boundaries, Modules, and Levels. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course investigates conceptual problems arising in the attempt to analyze the structure of complex systems in a variety of biological, psychological, social, and technological contexts, and how the answers may vary with how the boundaries are drawn. We confront descriptive, critical, and normative puzzles arising from questions such as the following: Is a society just a collection of people, an organized collection of people, or something more? Can a corporation have rights and responsibilities? Can groups have identities? Why are minds in the head, or are they? And are genes the bearers of heredity? Instructor(s): W.

<P>BPRO 22400. The Ugly American Comes Home. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The aims of this course are to interrogate not only the experience of studying abroad, but also the condition of coming &quot;home&quot; and facing a range of needs to assimilate and articulate your experience. We address being abroad and afterward through a range of reading materials, including travel writings, philosophies of education, and considerations of narrative and perception. Writing assignments will explicitly address the challenge of integrating study abroad with other forms of knowledge and experience that characterize collegiate education. Instructor(s): J. Ketelaar, M.

<P>BPRO 22800. Drinking Alcohol: Social Problem or Normal Cultural Practice? 100 Units. </P>

<P>Alcohol is the most widely used psychoactive agent in the world, and, as archaeologists have recently demonstrated, it has a very long history dating back at least 9,000 years. This course will explore the issue of alcohol and drinking from a trans-disciplinary perspective. It will be co-taught by an anthropologist/ archaeologist with experience in alcohol research and a neurobiologist who has experience with addiction research. Students will be confronted with literature on alcohol research from anthropology, sociology, history, biology, medicine, psychology, and public health and asked to think through the conflicts and contradictions. Selected case studies will be used to focus the discussion of broader theoretical concepts and competing perspectives introduced in the first part of the course. Topics for lectures and discussion include: What is alcohol? The early history of alcohol; Histories of drinking in ancient, medieval, and modern times; Alcohol and the political economy; Alcohol as a cultural artifact; Styles of drinking and intoxication; Alcohol, addiction, and social problems; Alcohol and religion; Alcohol and health benefits; Comparative case studies of drinking.

<P>BPRO 23000. Cosmos and Conscience: Looking for Ourselves Elsewhere. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Science and religion are two ways, among many others, that people can seek to know about reality: how do we construct ordered pictures of the whole-cosmos or civilization-and how do we relate to them in terms of action? How do we know what we do not know, and what does that kind of &quot;knowledge&quot; mean for the orientation and direction of human existence? How would cultural biases be affected by knowing that there are others &quot;out there" in the universe, should we discover them? From various perspectives, this course addresses these questions of the origins, structures, and ends of reality as we look for ourselves-seek understanding of the human condition-in the cosmos but also in complex religious and cultural traditions. Whereas in our popular culture, science is often identified with the realm of knowledge and religion is simply &quot;belief&quot; or &quot;practice,&quot; the course also seeks to trace the rational limits of science and the rational force of religion with respect to the ethical problem of the right and good conduct of human life. Instructor(s): W. Schweiker, D. York Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing. Equivalent Course(s): RLST 23603, ASTR 23000 </P>

<P>BPRO 23400. Is Development Sustainable? 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines alternative concepts and theoretical grounds for notions of sustainable development. We analyze core issues underlying population growth, resource extraction, &quot;sustainable consumption," environmental change, and social transformation through a consideration of economic, political, scientific, and cultural institutions and processes. The course, based on orienting lectures and intensive class discussion of core texts, focuses on the sustainability problems of both highly industrialized countries as well as of developing nations. Previous exposure to environmental or development issues, although useful, is not required. Instructor(s): A. Kolata Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Note(s): This course qualifies as a &quot;Discovering Anthropology&quot; selection for Anthropology Majors.

<P>BPRO 23500. The Organization of Knowledge. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course explores several structures of knowledge that students may have encountered in their core and specialized education, with the goal of enabling students to identify and explore the implications of these different structures. We ask whether all knowledge is relative, and if so, to what? When things are structured differently, does that mean that knowledge is lost? Or are there several diverse ways of structuring knowledge, each of which may be viable? We read a wide range of classical and modern thinkers in various disciplines. Instructor(s): W. Sterner, Staff Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing Equivalent Course(s): HIPS 23000, HUMA 23502 </P>

<P>BPRO 23600. Social Context, Biology, and Health. 100 Units. </P>

<P>We take for granted our relationships with other people as fundamental. Yet when these connections are absent or disrupted, our minds and biology are likewise disrupted. Epidemiological studies have now clearly established a relationship between social isolation and both mental and physical health. This course adopts an integrative interdisciplinary approach that spans the biological to sociological levels of analysis to explore the interactions involved and possible mechanisms by which the social world gets under the skin to affect the mind, brain, biology, and health.

<P>BPRO 23760. The Social Brain: Social Isolation and Loneliness. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The past two decades have witnessed a remarkable rise in the number of investigations published on the social brain. The discoveries conveyed by the titles of many of these reports (e.g., the neural basis of love, altruism, morality, generosity, trust) have piqued the interest of young investigators, funding agencies, the media, and laypeople alike. Such attention is a double-edged sword, however, as errors are exaggerated in importance, and oversimplifications create false expectations and, ultimately, disillusionment in what the field can contribute. It is, of course, one thing to assume that neural processes underlie all psychological phenomenon, it is another to claim that a given brain region is the biological instantiation of complex psychological functions like the self, empathy or loneliness. The purpose of this course is to examine opportunities and challenges in this field primarily through research on two of the most important topics in the field: social isolation and empathy. Instructor(s): J. Cacioppo, L. Hawkley Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing. This course does not meet requirements for the biological sciences major. Equivalent Course(s): PSYC 23760, BIOS 29324 </P>

<P>BPRO 23800. The Affect System. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The term &quot;affect&quot; typically refers to feelings beyond those of the traditional senses, with an emphasis on the experience of emotions and variations in hedonic tone. The structure and processes underlying mental contents are not readily apparent, however, and most cognitive processes occur unconsciously with only selected outcomes reaching awareness. Over millions of years of evolution, efficient and manifold mechanisms have evolved for differentiating hostile from hospitable stimuli and for organizing adaptive responses to these stimuli. These are critically important functions for the evolution of mammals, and the integrated set of mechanisms that serve these functions can be thought of as an &quot;affect system.&quot; It is this affect system-its architecture and operating characteristics, as viewed from neural, psychological, social, and political perspectives-that is the focus of the course.

<P>BPRO 23900. Biological and Cultural Evolution. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course draws on readings in and case studies of language evolution, biological evolution, cognitive development and scaffolding, processes of socialization and formation of groups and institutions, and the history and philosophy of science and technology. We seek primarily to elaborate theory to understand and model processes of cultural evolution, while exploring analogies, differences, and relations to biological evolution. This has been a highly contentious area, and we examine why. We seek to evaluate what such a theory could reasonably cover and what it cannot. Instructor(s): W. Wimsatt, S. Mufwene Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing or consent of instructor required; core background in evolution and genetics strongly recommended.

<P>BPRO 24000. Understanding Wisdom. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It's often used with a meaning more akin to &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;clever.&quot; Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom-how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy. Instructor(s): A. Henly, H. Nusbaum Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Note(s): See PSYC 24055 The Psychological Foundations of Wisdom. Equivalent Course(s): HUMA 24005, RLST 24050, PSYC 24050 </P>

<P>BPRO 24100. Science and Religion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we explore some aspects of the relations between science and religion in Western culture (e.g., Christian, Jewish, Islamic). Questions include: What are science and religion? Are they competing intellectual systems for making sense of the world? What are social institutions? Can they be in conflict with one another? Can they support one another? Each of the instructors treats these questions by examining certain historical episodes and texts to add different perspectives to the material.

<P>BPRO 24150. Romantic Love: Cultural, Philosophical, and Psychological Aspects. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This double-credit course combines humanistic and social scientific disciplines to examine the phenomenon of romantic love-a &quot;big problem&quot; in practical, theoretical, and cultural senses. The course starts by comparing representations of romantic love experiences in visual, musical and literary arts and myths. After exploring what may be specific to this form of love, we address two further issues: the role and sources of non-rational experience in romantic love, and the role of romantic love in modern marriage. Illumination of these topics is sought through the discussion of humanistic and social scientific texts and cinematic presentations. Instructor(s): D. Orlinsky, Staff Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019 Prerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing Note(s): The class meets for six hours a week.

<P>BPRO 24160. Love and Tragedy in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Tolstoy's great novel Anna Karenina may be the finest and most compelling depiction in literature of the diverse aspects and outcomes of romantic love. Combining humanistic and social scientific perspectives, this course undertakes an intensive study of the novel to examine the joys and sorrows of romantic love, and the successes and tragedies that follow from it, as well as the aesthetic achievement of the novel as a major work of art. Resources for understanding the development of the novel's characters and the fate of their relationships are drawn from Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis and other works. Bases for a critical appreciation of the novel are drawn from Aristotle's Poetics and Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy. Instructor(s): D.

<P>BPRO 24300. Globalization and Neo-Liberalism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Developments over the past decade have led a number of former leading enthusiasts of globalization to raise basic criticisms of the neo-liberal paradigm. In doing this, they have echoed and drawn attention to the results of economists and historians whose work undercuts the basic premises of neo-liberalism. This course explicates a varied collection of this work, viewed as a critique and alternative to neo-liberalism, by economic historians (e.g., Hobsbawn, Williams, Arrighi, Polanyi) and economists (e.g., Palley, Taylor, Stretton, Marglin, Eatwell, MacEwan, Blecker, Brenner).

<P>BPRO 24400. Concepts of the Self from Antiquity to the Present. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This seminar explores the evolution of ideas about the nature and formation of selfhood from classical antiquity to the present. Along the way, we look at Greek tragedy, Stoic philosophy, early Christian texts, and the conceptual models of selfhood and self-understanding behind Descartes, Kant, Freud, Foucault, and others. Students should be prepared to deal extensively with scholarship on self, ethics, and community across the fields of philosophy, anthropology, psychology, and social history. Instructor(s): S.

<P>BPRO 24500. Language and Globalization. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Globalization has been a buzz word in our lives over the past few decades. It is also one of those terms whose varying meanings have become more and more challenging to characterize in a uniform way. The phenomena it names have been associated with important transformations in our cultures, including the languages we speak. Distinguishing myths from facts, this course articulates the different meanings of globalization, anchors them in a long history of socioeconomic colonization, and highlights the specific ways in which the phenomena it names have affected the structures and vitalities of languages around the world. We learn about the dynamics of population contact in class and their impact on the evolution of languages. Instructor(s): S.

<P>Atheism is as old as religion. As religion and its place in society have evolved throughout history, so has the standing and philosophical justification for non-belief. This course examines the intellectual and cultural history of atheism in Western thought from antiquity to the present. We are concerned with the evolution of arguments for a non-religious worldview, as well as with the attitude of society toward atheism and atheists. Instructor(s): S.

<P>BPRO 24700. From Neo-Liberalism to Neo-Imperialism. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course examines the thesis advanced by a number of recent thinkers on the organic ties between neo-liberal doctrine and the rise of a new imperialism. In False Dawn, noted conservative political theorist John Gray gives a critique of the global free market. In Capital Resurgent: Roots of the Neoliberal Revolution, two important left critics, economists Gerard Dumenil and Dominique Levy, investigate the economic roots of neo-liberalism. Finally, in reading two recent works by the economic geographer David Harvey (A Brief History of Neo-Liberalism and The New Imperialism) we consider in depth the link between neo-liberalism and imperialism.

<P>Why do we pray? Why do we experience prayer practice as reaching out towards an intentional being whom we cannot (except in representation) touch, see, or hear? This course approaches an answer to that question by looking at the way we pray, particularly in a Christian context. What kinds of bodily engagement do we find in prayer; what impact might prayer practice have upon our bodies; what bodily features of prayer might help to explain why its practice has been so compelling to so many for so many years?

<P>BPRO 25400. Jews and Christians in the Middle East. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Minorities around the world today invite questions about the prospects of pluralism and tolerance in modern societies. This course will explore these long-studied questions by examining the case of Jews and Christians in the Middle East, as well as its tangled histories with Muslims and Jews in Mediterranean Europe. Co-taught by a historian of Jews in Iraq and an anthropologist of Copts in Egypt, we will explore histories and ethnographies to consider the political, social, and religious dimensions of minority communities. Our syllabus also blends various literary genres and forms of media with academic scholarship to explore various voices in the conversation about Jews and Christians in the Middle East-from novels, films, and poetry to theological tracts and political treatises. We raise the following questions throughout our course: What terms for coexistence have governed Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Mediterranean? How are religious practices and traditions linked to histories of rule? How do ideologies (e.g., nationalism, secularism, communism) shape the way minorities understand themselves and how society understands them? Instructor(s): O. Bashkin, A.

<P>This seminar-style course will explore historical and contemporary interventions in visual and performative artistic practices with human rights. Co-taught by a historian and theater-maker, the course will consider various paradigms for looking at how artists work on human rights. Course work will include critical readings, viewings of artistic work, and direct conversations with artists. Students will also participate in a multi-day summit on campus (April 29-May 2) that will bring distinguished artists from throughout the world to address the question &quot;What is an artistic practice of human rights, conceptually, aesthetically and pragmatically?&quot; Students will be given the option to produce either an academic or artistic final project.

<P>BPRO 26030. The Nuclear Age. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Seventy-five years ago a group of scientists launched the first sustained nuclear chain reaction, commonly known as CP-1, at the University of Chicago under Stagg Field. This course will be part of the commemoration and reflection taking place across the University this fall. Its goal will be to explore the ensuing Nuclear Age from different disciplinary perspectives by organizing a ring-lecture. Each week's lecture, delivered by faculty from fields across the university (for instance, Physics, Biomedicine, Anthropology, and English), will be followed by a discussion section to synthesize and integrate not only the material from the weekly lectures, but the many events happening at the University this fall. CP-1 was not only a scientific achievement of the highest magnitude, but also a civilization-changing event that remains at the boundary of the thinkable. Instructor(s): D. L.

<P>This course focuses on the manner in which we make use of the past, the personal past, the collective past, and the place of social and historical change in retelling and rewriting life-history and history. The course begins with a discussion of memory, conceptions of the personal and historic past, and such related issues as nostalgia, mourning, and the significance of commemoration in monument and ritual. These issues are explored in a number of topics such as twentieth-century war memorials, high school and college reunions, and the Holocaust and its representation in contemporary European society.

<P>BPRO 26102. War. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course, we ask such questions as: Why do humans go to war? What is the experience of war like? How does war affect the individual and his society? What is a just war? An unjust war? Can we conceive of a world without war? We read and discuss texts such as Homer's The Iliad, Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, Tolstoy's War and Peace, Jonathan Shay's Achilles in Vietnam, and Glen Gray's The Warriors. The readings serve primarily as a starting point for the discussion of the above questions and any other issues raised by the class that are related to war.

<P>This course makes sense of globalization as a historical phenomenon focusing primarily on the long twentieth century, but with a look back into the &quot;deep history&quot; of the making of the contemporary world. While the course has a theoretical bent, it should be taken as an introduction into modern history. It has three goals in particular: </P>

<P>(1) It introduces the main concepts and theories of globalization. (2) It explores key moments, processes, and events in the annals of globalization. (3) It highlights the nature of contentions over the terms of global order. Instructor(s): M.

<P>BPRO 26400. Movies and Madness. 100 Units. </P>

<P>We propose to investigate representations of madness in fictional, documentary, and experimental film. We divide the topic this way to emphasize the different dimensions of cinematic address to questions of mental illness, and the ways that film genres imply distinct formal and epistemological conventions for the representation of insanity. Documentary ranges from instructional and neutral reportage, to polemical, essayistic interventions in the politics of psychiatry and the asylum, the actual conditions of mental illness in real historical moments. Documentary also includes the tendency in new media for &quot;the mad&quot; to represent themselves in a variety of media. With experimental film, our aim will be to explore the ways that the cinematic medium can simulate experiences of mania, delirium, hallucination, obsession, depression, etc., inserting the spectator into the subject position of madness. We will explore the ways that film techniques such as shot-matching, voice-over, montage, and special effects of audio-visual manipulation function to convey dream sequences, altered states of consciousness, ideational or perceptual paradoxes, and extreme emotional states. Finally, narrative film we think of as potentially synthesizing these two strands of cinematic practice, weaving representations of actual, possible, or probable situations with the special effects of mad subjectivity. Our emphasis with narrative film will be to focus-not simply on the mentally ill subject as hero. Instructor(s): W. J. T. Mitchell, J. Hoffman Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019.

<P>BPRO 26500. Picturing Words/Writing Images (Studio) 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the relationship between reading and looking? Images in mind and images on paper-words in mind and on the page-we will explore the intersection of these different ways to think, read, and look, as we make poems, drawings, paintings, etc., in class. We will investigate the problem of representing language as it is expressed in the work produced in class. Studying works by contemporary visual artists like Jenny Holzer and Ann Hamilton, and practicing poets such as Susan Howe and Tom Phillips will inform our investigation. The course will feature visits to our studio by contemporary poets and visual artists, who will provide critiques of student work and discussion of their own ongoing projects. These visitors will help to frame our artistic and literary practice within the ongoing conversation between word and image in modern culture. We will ask, what are the cognitive, phenomenological, social, and aesthetic consequences of foregrounding the pictorial/visual aspect of alphabetical characters? (C, H) Instructor(s): J.

<P>BPRO 26600. Antonioni's Films: Reality and Ambiguity. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this in-depth study of several Antonioni films, our eye is on understanding his view of reality and the elements of ambiguity that pervade all of his films.

<P>BPRO 26700. Mythical History, Paradigmatic Figures: Caesar, Augustus, Charlemagne, Napoleon. 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is the process by which some historical figures take on mythical proportions? This course examines four case studies of conquerors who attained sovereign power in times of war (conquest, civil war, revolution), who had a foundational role in empire-building, and who consciously strove to link themselves to the divine and transcendent. Their immense but ambiguous legacies persist to this day. Although each is distinct as a historical individual, taken together they merge to form a paradigm of the exceptional leader of epic proportions. Each models himself on exemplary predecessors: each invokes and reinvents myths of origin and projects himself as a model for the future. Basic themes entail mythic history, empire, the exceptional figure, modernity's fascination with antiquity, and the paradox of the imitability of the inimitable. Instructor(s): M. Lowrie, R.

<P>BPRO 26750. Anxiety. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock. We will also have guest speakers from the fields of clinical psychiatry, geriatric medicine, philosophy, and comparative anthropology. Instructor(s): M. Sternstein, A.

<P>Taught by an imaging scientist and an art historian, this course explores scientific, artistic, and cultural aspects of imaging from the earliest attempts to enhance and capture visual stimuli through the emergence of virtual reality systems in the late twentieth century. Topics include the development of early optical instruments (e.g., microscopes, telescopes), the invention of linear perspective, the discovery of means to visualize the invisible within the body, and the recent emergence of new media. We also consider the problem of instrumentally mediated seeing in the arts and sciences and its social implications for our image-saturated contemporary world. Instructor(s): P.

We compare the accounts of the beginning in Genesis, Hesiod's Theogony, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Bhagavad Gita, the Maya's Popol Vuh, and other sources, including Native American ones. We explore the ways cosmic creation has been imagined in world culture. We also delineate human literary creativity and ask about the relationship between individual creativity and the cultural myths of creation.

<P>BPRO 28000. Terror, Religion, and Aesthetics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Through our contemporary experiences of terrorist acts, we apprehend the no-citizens' land of life without a social contract, of the violent &quot;state of nature&quot; among people. In varied genres (e.g., poems, plays, novels, memoirs, essays), we engage with the transformative powers of diverse aesthetics (e.g., catharsis, the sublime, theatre of cruelty, realism, fable, satire) and of religious faiths (e.g., deism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Sufism, Buddhism) to counteract terror and redeploy our civil status in society.

<P>BPRO 28100. What is Enlightenment? 100 Units. </P>

<P>What is enlightenment? How does one become enlightened, and who is enlightened? In Euro-American civilization, the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment championed the powers of human reason against religion and superstition to achieve scientific progress. Buddhism in the nineteenth century was represented by the heirs of Enlightenment as a religion for the Enlightenment to the point of not being a religion at all. Both traditions offer pathways to freedom (or liberation?) that draw on our rational capabilities, and both sponsor the production of knowledge that re-visions our place in the world. But they seem to be opposed: how could reason reject &quot;religious&quot; beliefs but also take part in &quot;religious&quot; traditions that aim to bring certain kinds of persons into being? We compare the mental models, discourses, methods of analysis, world-images, and practices of these traditions of enlightenment to assess the kinds of disciplines that their theoreticians and practitioners acquire and use.

<P>BPRO 28500. Sex and Ethics. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sex is a big problem. How do we think about sex in proximity to considering the ethics of risk, harm, and the potential for good? Developing an account specifically of an ethics of sex requires thinking about the place of sex and sexual vulnerability in social life with an eye toward understanding what's good and what might count as abuses, violations, disruptions, or deprivations of specifically good things about sex. In popular discussion, for example, &quot;consent&quot; often demarcates ethically good sex from bad sex. This course inquires whether consent is an adequate metric for sexual ethics; if it is necessary or sufficient; if certain factors (e.g., age, gender, violence) vitiate its normative force; and whether its legal definition conflicts, coheres with, or contributes to its general cultural reception. These issues require us to think about the ways people do, do not, and cannot know what they're doing in sex, and complicate the aspiration to have an ethics in proximity to sex. This year's version of the course focuses on political theory/policy/popular scandal in relation to aesthetics and sex theory archives. We talk about sex in proximity to modes of comportment in love, scandal, prostitution, stranger intimacy, political freedom and discipline, impersonality, and experimentality. Instructor(s): L.

<P>BPRO 28600. Health Care and the Limits of State Action. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In a time of great human mobility and weakening state frontiers, epidemic disease is able to travel fast and far, mutate in response to treatment, and defy the institutions invented to keep it under control: quarantine, the cordon sanitaire, immunization, and the management of populations. Public health services in many countries find themselves at a loss in dealing with these outbreaks of disease, a deficiency to which NGOs emerge as a response (an imperfect one to be sure). Through a series of readings in anthropology, sociology, ethics, medicine, and political science, we will attempt to reach an understanding of this crisis of both epidemiological technique and state legitimacy, and to sketch out options.

The twenty-first century opened with publication of the draft human genome sequence, and there are currently over 3,000 species whose genomes have been sequenced. This rapidly growing database constitutes a test of nineteenth- and twentieth-century theories about evolution and a source of insights for new theories. We discuss what genome sequences have to teach us about the relatedness of living organisms, the diversity of cellular life, mechanisms of genome change over evolutionary time, and the nature of key events in the history of life on earth. The scientific issues are related to the history of evolutionary thought and current public controversies about evolution. Instructor(s): J. A. Shapiro, M.

<P>The global energy and climate challenge is one of the most important and urgent problems society faces. Progress requires identifying approaches to ensure people have access to the inexpensive and reliable energy critical for human development, without causing disruptive climate change or unduly compromising health and the environment. The course pairs technical and economic analysis to develop an understanding of policy challenges in this area. Lecture topics will include the past, present, and future of energy supply and demand, global climate change, air pollution and its health consequences, selected energy technologies such as solar photovoltaics, nuclear power, unconventional oil and gas, and an analysis of theoretical and practical policy solutions in developed and emerging economies.

Questions we will address include how do we constitute and navigate these collections? How do we conceive of digital tools in ways that speak to humanists and humanistic social scientists? How do we incorporate these tools and approaches into discursive argumentation and other traditional humanistic and historical modes of inquiry.

<P>As a partnership with the University’s Office of Civic Engagement (http://civicengagement.uchicago.edu), Chicago Studies offers and curates co-curricular experiences (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/events) that introduce students and faculty to events, resources, and organizations throughout the Chicago region. Students in the College can also obtain advising and resources to connect their programs of study with partners and communities across the city. Chicago Studies works closely with Career Advancement (http:// careeradvancement.uchicago.edu), the Institute of Politics (http://politics.uchicago.edu), the Pozen Family Center for Human Rights (http://humanrights.uchicago.edu), and other Civic Engagement– and University Community Service Center–sponsored programs such as Summer Links (https://ucsc.uchicago.edu/page/summer-links-2018) to connect students with substantive internship and research fellowship opportunities with organizations engaged in the life of the city. </P>

<P>Chicago Studies Quarters </P>

<P>The Chicago Studies Quarters offer a cohesive set of courses that join classroom instruction with experiential learning opportunities, using the city and the region as a laboratory. </P>

<P>The Chicago Studies Quarter (CSQ) (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/quarter) is a selective, quarter-long academic program that allows a small cohort of students to devote an entire term to the intensive study and exploration of the distinctive folkways and civic codes that distinguish Chicago as a world city. Admitted students enroll in three interrelated courses with a common theme, taught by distinguished scholars in various disciplines. Like Study Abroad courses, CSQ courses utilize excursions within the city, guest speakers, and engagement with civic groups and leaders to enrich class readings and assignments. Participants in the CSQ are required to take all three course offerings, but may register for a fourth course of their choosing provided it does not conflict with the required classes or the mandatory excursions held on Fridays. </P>

<P>Chicago Studies Quarter: Calumet (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/calumet) focuses on topics of human land use in the Calumet Region just south and east of the city. It is a full-time, one-quarter experience intended to help students bridge theory and practice in environmental studies. The program features four integrated courses, projects, field trips, guest lectures, and presentations. </P>

<P>The Chicago Studies Quarters are designed for undergraduates in good academic standing who have completed at least two quarters of study in the College. While the program stipulates no minimum grade-point average, an applicant’s transcript should demonstrate that the applicant is a serious student who will make the most of this opportunity. The Chicago Studies Quarters are open to University of Chicago undergraduate students only; applications from outside the University are not accepted. For more information, please contact Sabina Shaikh (sabina@uchicago.edu) or Emily Talen (talen@uchicago.edu), faculty directors for Chicago Studies. </P>

<P>Courses about Chicago </P>

<P>In addition to the Chicago Studies Quarter, the College offers other courses that explore aspects of Chicago's ecology, culture, politics, history, social structure, and economic life. Many of these courses are cross-listed between departments, meaning many of them may fulfill requirements in multiple academic programs; most are integrated into the Urban Environments track of the Environmental and Urban Studies major. Some of them may also contribute to students’ completion of the academic requirements of the Chicago Studies Certificate Program (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/courses). The courses listed here represent a sample of what is </P>

<P>often available, depending on departmental offerings. Current, thematic listings of such courses are also available on the Chicago Studies website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/courses). </P>

<P>Chicago Studies Certificate Program </P>

<P>Undergraduate students who wish to integrate their academic inquiry with positive impact in Chicago through sustained community engagement, urban scholarship, and creative expression, now have the opportunity pursue a certificate in Chicago Studies. </P>

<P>Students may begin pursuing the Chicago Studies Certificate Program (CSCP) at any time during their College careers. This will require an initial (and highly preliminary) proposal for how one hopes to fulfill the requirements and an advising session to discuss the plan and resources available to support it. That mandatory advising is provided by the Chicago Studies staff within the Office of Civic Engagement (http:// chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/about), with a second required meeting before proposal of the capstone project. </P>

<P>Students who complete the certificate will have that designated on their transcript. The transcript designation and the certificate itself are standalone recognitions, conferred by the College and the Office of Civic Engagement without reference to students’ formal degree programs. However, completion of the Chicago Studies Certificate does fulfill the internship/field study requirement of the Environmental and Urban Studies major. </P>

<P>The Chicago Studies Certificate Program includes the following components: </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>1. Introductory Civic Impact Training Experiences (at least 3) </P>

<P>These not-for-credit, non-curricular introductory experiences—some of which are facilitated by external organizations—expose students to local civic actors, civic leadership skills, and Chicago social issues, and are open to all University of Chicago students. As a first stage of the certificate, students must participate in three of these to help them frame, focus, and reflect on the kind of impact they hope to have as engaged scholars. At the end of this, students declare a focus for their certificate work: an issue, an organization, a neighborhood, a population. </P>

<P>A list of currently available civic impact trainings (“modules”) may be found on the Chicago Studies Certificate Program website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/modules). A number of existing programs sponsored by the Office of Civic Engagement and its partners (both internal and external) may also fulfill one or more of these requirements; students should discuss this during their initial advising appointment with Civic Engagement’s Chicago Studies team (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/enroll). </P>

<P>2. Chicago-Focused Courses (at least 3) </P>

<P>Each academic year, the University offers a wide range of courses that study Chicago in some capacity (see Courses about Chicago above for examples and the Chicago Studies Certificate Program website (http:// chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/courses) for details). </P>

<P>The Chicago Studies Certificate requires completion of three such courses with a C– or above. Successful completion of any of the Chicago Studies Quarters will satisfy this requirement. Otherwise, students will need to propose and receive faculty approval for a specific theme and receive subsequent approvals for each course chosen along the way. </P>

<P>Petitions should be made in advance of enrollment and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in relation to the petitioner’s stated rationale for including specific courses in their program of study and </P>

<P>engagement. The General Petition Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/ GeneralPetition.pdf) is available on the College website and should be directed to Dr. Sabina Shaikh (sabina@uchicago.edu) (Sabina@uchicago.edu)), faculty director for Chicago Studies. Advising on this academic component and selection of appropriate courses is available through the Program on the Global Environment (https://pge.uchicago.edu) and accessible via the Chicago Studies Certificate Program website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/courses). </P>

<P>3. High-Impact Community Engagement </P>

Information about available and forthcoming engagement opportunities, as well as the mechanisms for their approval and documentation, can be found on the Chicago Studies Certificate Program website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/engagement). </P>

<P>4. Capstone Project </P>

<P>A Capstone Project is a high-impact learning practice that requires students to integrate, apply, and articulate their learning across a sequence of experiences. Many capstones will be completed during the fourth year of study, but it is possible to complete a capstone earlier. </P>

<P>To receive the Chicago Studies Certificate and transcript designation, program participants must successfully produce a major paper, project, or product (e.g., a discipline-based research project, investigative journalism series, creative production, action research product, etc.) that: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>integrates aspects of the student's academic and community-based learning throughout the student's fulfillment of previous certificate components; AND </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>takes Chicago either as its focus OR uses it as a significant example (for works focused on broader urban themes); AND </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>responds to a community-defined priority or question, including being presented as such to one or more relevant publics. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Advising on and approval of capstone project proposals is run by the Chicago Studies team within the Office of Civic Engagement (http://civicengagement.uchicago.edu), which can assist students in identifying appropriate community partners, issues, and audiences for capstones from Civic Engagement’s citywide network of collaborators. Completed capstone projects are adjudicated and validated by a small committee of faculty, staff, and community partner readers. Students are required to present their capstones at the annual Chicago Studies Symposium. </P>

<P>In the case of capstone projects based on or closely related to a student's formal academic work (e.g., a BA thesis), the adjudication committee will assess only the capstone’s successful integration of the student's academic and community-based learning, as required for the certificate. Such evaluations should not be taken as direction of the student's formal discipline-based academic research. </P>

<P>In addition to the required participation in the Chicago Studies Symposium, students should also, whenever possible, directly present their capstones to relevant publics in the broader community as an expression of reciprocal benefit to those whose community-based knowledge has helped to inform their completion. Where </P>

<P>appropriate, capstone projects may also be submitted for potential inclusion in the Chicago Studies Annual (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/annual). </P>

<P>Questions about the Chicago Studies Certificate Program may be directed to Chris Skrable (cskrable@uchicago.edu), associate director for community-based research and experiential learning in the Office of Civic Engagement.

<P>Examples of Previously Offered Undergraduate Courses </P>

<P>CCTS 21003. Topics in Clinical Research. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course provides an overview of clinical research subject matter from the history and ethics of clinical research to the types and practice of contemporary clinical research. How does clinical research differ from other research traditions? What is special about clinical research? What types of questions can be answered by clinical research (what questions not)? What types of ethical oversight over the responsible conduct of research have arisen over the years? We will learn how to read and critique clinical research, survey the major types of clinical research designs, and the differences between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide an overview of the mechanics of developing and implementing clinical research, including grant writing, regulatory issues, and quality assurance. Along the way, we will be teaching core statistical concepts including prevalence, risk ratios, and sensitivity and validation techniques. The objectives are for students to obtain an understanding of how and why to perform clinical research and to do so in an ethical and responsible manner. Instructor(s): Valerie Press Terms Offered: Spring. Last offered 2017 Prerequisite(s): Completed general education requirement in the social sciences. This course does not meet requirements for the Biological Sciences major. Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 29327 </P>

<P>CCTS 21004. Christian Traditions and Medicine in the Late Modern World. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The course rests on the assumption that contemporary challenges in medicine stem from a moral pluralism reflecting the cultural conditions of late modernity, as well as from a growing inability to maintain clinical excellence in an increasingly complex and bureaucratic health care system. Throughout American history, Christians have often worked toward cultural change in various vocational spheres in order to align their practices in the world toward a religious and spiritual ideal. This course will explore a theological foundation for a different paradigm of active cultural engagement in medicine and bioethics. First, students will examine traditional Christian accounts both of medicine and of moral formation, to consider how they might inform answer to the question, How does one become (and remain) a good physician? Students will study sacred texts, traditions, and practices of Christianity to search for moral, spiritual, conceptual and practical resources within the tradition that physicians might draw upon to recover ways of practicing medicine as a vocation, as a sacred calling. Second, students will examine the empirical literature from vocational psychology on work motivation, focusing particularly on the construct of calling and its application to the pursuit of clinical excellence in medicine. Third, students will also examine recent research in the field of moral psychology that is shaping contemporary views regarding moral and professional formation and identity. Lastly, after surveying the contemporary challenges in medicine through the above interdisciplinary analyses, students will explore various Christian theological perspectives that attempt to re-imagine what &quot;faithful presence&quot; might entail in the current vocational sphere of medicine. Students will explore the diverse theological perspectives of Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy and bring them to bear on the following questions: &quot;What religious and spiritual resources does their Christian tradition bring to bear on the challenges and opportunities in the vocational sphere of medicine and bioethics? What would it mean to exhibit a &quot;faithful presence&quot; in medicine&quot;? What it might mean for the institutions that shape medicine to truly enhance the communities in which they live?" Instructor(s): John Yoon Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): RLST 26315 </P>

<P>Examples of Previously Offered Co-Undergraduate/Graduate Courses </P>

<P>CCTS 20400. Health Disparities in Breast Cancer. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Across the globe, breast cancer is the most common women's cancer. In the last two decades, there have been significant advances in breast cancer detection and treatment that have resulted in improved survival rates. Yet, not all populations have benefited equally from these improvements, and there continues to be a disproportionate burden of breast cancer felt by different populations. In the U.S., for example, white women have the highest incidence of breast cancer but African-American women have the highest breast cancer mortality overall. The socioeconomic, environmental, biological, and cultural factors that collectively contribute to these disparities are being identified with a growing emphasis on health disparities research efforts. In this 10-week discussion-based course students will meet twice weekly and cover major aspects of breast cancer disparities. Instructor(s): Eileen Dolan, Suzanne Conzen Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): BIOS 25108 Equivalent Course(s): CCTS 40400, BIOS 25327 </P>

<P>CCTS 21005. The Making of the &quot;Good Physician&quot;: Virtue Ethics and the Development of Moral Character in Medicine. 50 Units. </P>

<P>This multi-disciplinary course draws insights from medicine, sociology, moral psychology, philosophy, ethics and theology to explore answers to the unique challenges that medicine faces in the context of late modernity: How does one become a &quot;good physician&quot; in an era of growing moral pluralism and health care complexity? Students will engage relevant literature from across these disciplines to address issues regarding the legitimate goals of medicine, medical professionalism, the doctor-patient relationship, vocation and calling, the role of religion in medicine, and character development in medical education. The course will first introduce the challenges that moral pluralism in contemporary society presents to the profession of medicine along with the subsequent calls for a renewed pursuit of clinical excellence in today's complex health care system. It will then survey the resurgence of a philosophical discipline (virtue ethics) that has begun to shape contemporary debate regarding what types of &quot;excellences&quot; are needed for a good medical practice dominated by medical science and technology. Instructor(s): John Yoon Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): This course is limited to those who have been accepted into the Emerging Scholars Cohort in Bioethics (Hyde Park Institute, https://hydeparkinstitute.org/esc). Depending on space availability, other students interested in enrolling will need prior approval from Course instructor(s). Equivalent Course(s): CCTS 41005 </P>

<P>CCTS 40006. Pharmacogenomics: Discovery and Implementation. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Pharmacogenomics is aimed at advancing our knowledge of the genetic basis for variable drug response. Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals-&quot;personalizing medicine.&quot; The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted. The ethics and economics of pharmacogenomics are also discussed. Instructor(s): R. S. Huang, B. Stranger Terms Offered: Spring Prerequisite(s): Undergraduates (third- and fourth-years only) must have taken BIOS 20187 and are required to email instructors for approval (bstranger@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu and rhuang@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu) prior to registering. Equivalent Course(s): CABI 47510 </P>

<P>CCTS 43100. Topics in Global Health. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course is a continuation of Introduction to Global Health (CCTS 43000). It is designed to address specific medical issues of global significance including maternal and child health, communicable and non- communicable diseases, and emerging diseases; the course will also address the impact of population growth, migration, environmental decay, and humanitarian disasters on health. Finally, the course will discuss research and career opportunities within the field of global health. Instructor(s): C. S. Olopade Terms Offered: Winter Prerequisite(s): This course does not meet the requirements for the Biological Sciences major. Equivalent Course(s): BIOS 29279 </P>

<H3>Course Clusters </H3>

<P id="LinkTarget_64379">The College is launching a new, innovative curricular initiative. The Course Cluster Initiative (https:// college.uchicago.edu/academics/college-course-clusters) is designed to continue the thematic focus and multidisciplinary perspective of the general education curriculum; to expose students to ideas from the vantage point of different disciplines across the humanities and the social, physical, and biological sciences; to stimulate and cultivate the student’s intellectual curiosity and sense of academic adventure; and to help students structure their electives without imposing programmatic strictures and limiting the freedom of intellectual exploration. </P>

<P>Course clusters consist of three or more courses on a common topic or issue that are offered over a span of two to three years. Course clusters can be made up of existing courses or encourage the creation of new courses. Courses within a cluster can have different formats. They can be smaller seminars or larger lecture courses. The only prerequisite is that they have no prerequisites and not be designed primarily for minors/majors (even though they can count towards major requirements). </P>

<P>Please review the College Course Clusters page (https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/college-courseclusters) for updated information regarding the Course Cluster Initiative, including courses belonging to each cluster. </P>

<P>The following are examples of course clusters currently offered: </P>

<Sect>
<H6>Climate Change, Culture, and Society </H6>

<P>The planetary scale of anthropogenic climate change challenges us to reassess many central questions in the humanities and social sciences from justice and power to truth and art. This course cluster encourages students to explore the problem of climate change from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Courses in history, political science, classics, English, philosophy, and other disciplines from the social sciences and the humanities complement courses in the physical and biological sciences. In addition to learning about the science of climate change in the latter, the former will ask a host of questions: What were the historical roots of fossil fuel use? What can the human past teach us about our ability to cope with climate change? How will we ensure justice and human rights in the face of a threat that affects poor people and future generations disproportionately? In what ways might literature and art help understand and communicate climate change, and shape our sense of agency and hope in facing an uncertain future? </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Economic History, from Sumer to the Global World </H6>

<P>The course cluster &quot;Economic History, from Sumer to the Global World&quot; will propose every year up to three courses in economic history. We wish to cover a broad time span and a wide range of cultures. The courses will put a special emphasis on the methodology of economic history. The students will thus also be able to acquire a deep knowledge of the questions that are currently debated in this field. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>History of the Law </H6>

<P>The development of law and legal systems is one of the defining hallmarks of societies from antiquity to the present. Abundant written evidence survives from the societies of the ancient Mediterranean, the Near East, South Asia, and East Asia. This cluster of courses will include deep dives into individual legal systems known from ancient societies in Greece, Rome, Babylonia, Assyria, Israel, Egypt, China, and India, as well as comparative investigations informed by historical and anthropological literatures. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Inequality </H6>

<P>The problem of inequality has been an abiding concern in the social sciences and humanities. In recent years it has attracted heightened attention and inspired scholarly innovation, fostering real ferment among those seeking to understand the mainsprings of the modern world. To understand such an abiding aspect of social and cultural organization requires a broad set of analytical resources and intellectual perspectives. Drawing on a range of methodologies, students will trace and examine the sources and challenges of inequality and mobility in many of their dimensions, selecting from courses in economics, history, political science, gender and sexuality studies, public policy, and other disciplines across the divisions. The broad, considered lens offered by this approach will allow students in the cluster to understand more fully the dynamics and consequences of inequality in modern culture and society, and its roots in persistent patterns of distribution of wealth, income, education, and social and other kinds of capital. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H6>Urban Design </H6>

<P>Urban design concerns the proactive effort to create human settlements of a particular character and quality. The study of urban design is an opportunity to evaluate the difference between ideal and actuality, gaining an understanding of what urban designers are trying to do and why and evaluating the reasons behind apparent successes and failures. Students will explore the history, theory, and practice of urban design from multiple perspectives, from historical surveys to more contemporary investigations of urban interventions and their effect on social change, in courses offered through art history, geographical studies, history, anthropology, sociology, comparative human development, and other disciplines from the social sciences and humanities. Whether urban design is capable of balancing social equity, aesthetic achievement, economic growth, and </P>

<P>environmental stewardship is of key interest within the field, practice, and study of urban design. How do we leverage meaningful public engagement in the urban design process? How do we balance individual expression and a sense of the collective? Students will engage with these fundamental problems in diverse contexts across the cluster. </P>

<P>The institute's Faculty and External Faculty Group are committed to investigating all aspects of the processes by which cultures claim to know what they know. Where are the boundaries between knowledge and belief? What techniques do cultures deploy to encode and verify information, and how do technological developments —in forensics and measurement, for example—impinge on these areas? What awareness do societies show regarding what is contingent about their deepest commitments? These questions may be put historically and cross-culturally. They also need urgently to be posed about those who work in notionally rational modern institutions, such as the university and the lab. </P>

<P>The Stevanovich Institute joins these faculty with fellows at every stage of the career from graduate and post-graduate to senior visiting scholars, in the context of the extraordinary resources of the University of Chicago, to question and enrich each other, in conversation about the past, present, and future of human knowledge. </P>

<P>KNOW courses are offered by the faculty (https://sifk.uchicago.edu/directory-page) and fellows (https:// sifk.uchicago.edu/directory-page/postdoctoral-fellows) of the Stevanovich Institute on the Formation of Knowledge at both the graduate and the advanced undergraduate levels. Courses are cross-listed with a variety of departments, so students can enroll in them as a major course with their department's course number or as an elective with the KNOW course number. </P>

<P>KNOW 17403. Science, Culture, and Society in Western Civilization II: Early Modern Period. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Section 1, offered by Robert J. Richards - &quot;Renaissance &amp; Enlightenment.&quot; This lecture-discussion course examines the development science and scientific philosophy from the mid-fifteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. The considerations begin with the recovery of an ancient knowledge in the works of Leonardo, Vesalius, Harvey, and Copernicus. Thereafter the course will focus on Enlightenment science, as represented by Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Hume. The course will culminate with the work of Darwin, who utilized traditional concepts to inaugurate modern science. For each class, the instructor will provide a short introductory lecture on the texts, and then open discussion to pursue with students the unexpected accomplishments of the authors under scrutiny. Section 2, offered by Margaret Carlyle - &quot;Revolutions in Astronomy &amp; Anatomy.&quot; This course explores scientific developments in Western Europe from the sixteenth-century Scientific Revolution to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. During this period, European understandings of the natural world-and ways of achieving such understandings-underwent a series of radical and far-reaching transformations that are often called the Scientific Revolution.

<P>KNOW 21415. Evolution Before Darwin. 100 Units. </P>

<P>This course will explore the emergence and development of evolutionary thought prior to Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). We will pay particular attention to the way in which transformism was a feature of nineteenth-century thought more generally, connecting natural history to astronomy, theology, and the study of humanity. Natural philosophers and later scientists who wished to make arguments concerning nature's deep past and hidden or obscured processes (such as the long-term transformations of stars, strata, and organic species) faced an essential problem: the power of observation and experiment was limited. Our class will interrogate this problem, and examine the way in which the development of evolutionary thought prior to Darwin was intimately connected to contentious debates regarding speculation and scientific method. We will conclude by contemplating the ways in which the ideas and challenges raised by transformism and evolution influenced the reception of Darwin's work, and the way in which these ideas and challenges remain embedded within seemingly disparate fields of study today.

<P>KNOW 21416. Reproduction and Motherhood in Multimedia (1800-present) 100 Units. </P>

<P>What do artificial wombs, monstrous creations, and dystopian medical landscapes have in common? Answers to these questions are the subject of this interdisciplinary course in which we explore the many ways in which human reproduction has entered multimedia from the eighteenth century through present. In our course, the concept of &quot;reproduction&quot; will be problematized through film, advertising, texts, literature, and objects. Through these sources, we will critically explore how popular representations of human reproduction have shaped the status of the female body and notions of motherhood over time. We will also see how the liberating potential of new forms of multimedia have often served to reinforce--rather than resist or re-imagine--longstanding motifs and beliefs surrounding the maternal body and womanhood, from the image of the hysterical woman to that of the monstrous mother. Themes covered include the science of reproduction, hysteria, monstrosities, maternal imagination, artificial life, race, contraception, in/fertility, and sex education.

<P>KNOW 24112. Screening India: Bollywood and Beyond. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Cinema is, unarguably, the medium most apposite for thinking through the complexities of democratic politics, especially so in a place like India. While Indian cinema has recently gained international currency through the song and dance ensembles of Bollywood, there remains much more to be said about that body of films. Moreover, Bollywood is a small (though very important) part of Indian cinema. Through a close analysis of a wide range of films in Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, and Urdu, this course will ask if Indian cinema can be thought of as a form of knowledge of the twentieth century.

<P>KNOW 25308. Lab, Field, and Clinic: History and Anthropology of Medicine and the Life Sciences. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In this course we will examine the ways in which different groups of people--in different times and places--have understood the nature of life and living things, bodies and bodily processes, and health and disease, among other notions. We will address these issues principally, though not exclusively, through the lens of the changing sets of methods and practices commonly recognizable as science and medicine. We will also pay close attention to the methods through which scholars in history and anthropology have written about these topics, and how current scientific and medical practices affect historical and anthropological studies of science and medicine.

<P>KNOW 25425. Censorship, Info Control, &amp; Revolutions in Info Technology from the Printing Press to the Internet. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The digital revolution is triggering a wave of new information control efforts and censorship attempts, ranging from monopolistic copyright laws to the &quot;Great Firewall&quot; of China. The print revolution after 1450 was a moment like our own, when the explosive dissemination of a new information technology triggered a wave of information control efforts. Many of today's attempts at information control closely parallel early responses to the printing press, so the premodern case gives us centuries of data showing how diverse attempts to control or censors information variously incentivized, discouraged, curated, silenced, commodified, or nurtured art, thought, and science. This unique course is part of a collaborative research project funded by the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and is co-organized with digital information expert Cory Doctorow. The course will bring pairs of experts working on the print and digital revolutions to campus to discuss parallels between their research with the class. Classes will be open to the public, filmed, and shared on the Internet to create an international public conversation. This is also a Department of History &quot;Making History&quot; course: rather than writing traditional papers, students will create web resources and publications (print and digital) to contribute to the ongoing collaborative research project.

<P>KNOW 27004. Babylon and the Origins of Knowledge. 100 Units. </P>

<P>In 1946 the famed economist John Maynard Keynes declared that Isaac Newton &quot;was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians.&quot; We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, Ibn Khaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful and reverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in the historical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? How did the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge? And is it reasonable to draw, as Keynes did, a line that begins with Babylon and ends with Newton? In this course we will take a cross comparative approach, investigating the history of the ancient city and its continuity in the scientific imagination. Instructor(s): E.

<P>KNOW 28900. Magic, Science, and Religion. 100 Units. </P>

<P>The relationship between the categories of magic, science, and religion has been a problem for modern social science since its inception in the nineteenth century. In the first half of this course, we will critically examine some of the classical and contemporary approaches to these concepts. In the second half, we will explore a number of detailed historical and ethnographic studies about modern phenomena that call some of the fundamental assumptions behind these categories into question.

<P>KNOW 29629. Tutorial: Romantic Bodies: Theater in the History of Science and Medicine. 100 Units. </P>

<P>It seems that science and theater have longed shared an ambiguous treatment as amoral yet bordering the ethically suspect. Scientific, medical, and technological advancements alter our everyday lives in profound ways and theater can play with the development and repercussions of these advancements, altering our memories of history. This stimulates a line of questioning for historians who view &quot;science plays,&quot; or plays that use science as the basis of their content and often also their form. In this tutorial, we will explore how these plays can (or cannot) fit into intellectual history as well as social and cultural histories of science. We will investigate how these plays can act as vehicles for remembering (or reconstructing) histories of science, reminding ourselves that the moral quandaries and ethical dilemmas that we juggle in science and medicine are as recurring as the theatrical productions are.

<P>KNOW 29630. Tutorial: History and Philosophy of Social Science. 100 Units. </P>

<P>Sociology and anthropology are highly self-reflexive disciplines. Their own contested histories have been taught and critiqued as a matter of course in the majority of sociology and anthropology departments in the US and Europe since their inception--hardly a surprise, given how dense, kaleidoscopic, and political they are. Meanwhile, the philosophy of social science has been gaining popularity in philosophy departments, apparently independently of the centuries-old reflection on social scientific methodologies that can be found within sociological and anthropological texts2. In true interdisciplinary fashion, this course seeks to marry these areas of scholarship, bringing together readings in philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and classical social theory, under the common themes that unite (and divide) them. We will cover debates on the epistemological priority of the individual or of society, the priority of naturalist or humanist perspectives, and the generalisability or spatio-temporal specificity of social scientific explanations.
