<P>ANTH 1797 - MOUNTAINS AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 India is a social,political and economic environment in which a broad range of South Asian medical systems have grown and developed overthe course of several years. In the past 150 years these systems have been institutionalized andprofessionalized within the framework of colonial and national medical and public health policy. Many of these systemsare intimately connected tothe environment, and to the conceptualization, categorization, productionandconsumption of natural resources. This course focuses on non-biomedical systems of medicine: Ayurveda, Unani, siddha, Tibetanmedicine, yoga and nature cure and homeopathy,as each one of these is supported and regulated by the government of India. The purpose of the course is not to evaluate the effectiveness or medical value ofthese systems; it is to understand how these medical systems fit into a range ofsocial, political, ecological, botanical and economic contexts. Given thata number of these medical systems are intimately linked to Himalayan botanical andenvironmental knowledge, the course will focus on the relationship between South Asian medical systems and mountain ecology.

<P>ANTH 1798 - RELIGION AND ECOLOGY </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 The Himalayas have inspiredmore religious thought, given rise to more forms of religious practice andare more distinctively featured ina spectrum of epic religious literature, than almost any other geographic region in the world, with the possible ' but unlikely `exceptionof a small parcel of relatively dry hilly ground between Jerusalem and mecca. In any case, Siddhartha Gautham was born and taught in the shadow of the lower Himalayas, where Buddhism emerged inthe 4th century BCE. Many specific mountains, lakes andrivers, as well as the broader geography ofthe Himalayas' most notably sacredrivers ' define the landscape ofHindu mythology, pilgrimage and ritual. The practice of yoga asa metaphysical philosophy is intimately linked to the idea of mystical Himalayan masters. The Western watershed of the Punjab, including theiponymous five rivers ' Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, RAVI and Sutlej ' is the heartland of Sikh cultural and religious identity. In addition to being a center of medieval Hindu literary learning, Kashmir and the Western Himalayas, extending through the Hindu Kush, have defined routes of exchange, communication, conversion and confrontation between Greeks, Persians, Buddhist monks, and Mongol armies. More recently ' in terms of centuries ' Tibetan Buddhism has emerged out of a history of development in Lhasa ' relocated to McLeod Ganj in the early 1960s '-that combines elements of tantra from the southeastern Brahmaputra region with transmutations of Buddhism that have taken shape in greater china. Although not inspired by the Himalayas per se, Islam inSouth Asia has been shaped by geography and the environment in specific ways, and the development ofa particular interpretationof the Koran inasmall center of learning in the town of Deobandi ' close to where the epic battle of the Bhargava Gita is said to have been waged in Kurukshetra ' implicates the geography and geopolitics of the Himalayas inthe emergence of reform oriented, Orthodox Islam.

The goal of this course is to gainan understanding of this diversity, with a focus on ecology. More specifically wewill examineecology andecosystems in terms of biosemiotics ' how and why organisms within anecological niche communicate with one another, and how these patterns andstructures of communication define different kinds of interdependence. Within the framework of standard classificatory schemes ' mammals, birds, reptiles, insects ' we will focus on particular species and specific niche systems for more detailed biosemiotic/behavioral analysis.

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 IT does not matter it's what you do with IT! Business in the 21stcentury runs on IT. However,competitive advantage seldom comes from having exclusive or proprietary access to a technology. Rather, IT comes frommore effectively utilizingtechnologies to which everyone - including the competition -has access. The implications ofthis reality are many. First, it isnecessary to understand what technologies are available in the marketplace and their capabilities. Next, and farmore challenging, it is necessary to understandhow these capabilities may positively (ornegatively) interact with business strategy. Business transformation is the alignment of process, people, and technology such that IT canboth support and innovate business strategies. Given that technologies evolve anddevelop at a rapid pace, IT is necessary for managersto understand what technologies can do (bothestablished and new) and how IT can be leveraged to create real value.

Unit four thenlooks at the environmental movement as it becomes truly global, beginning symbolically with the first'earth day' activities, protests andteach-ins in 1970, which have continued annually to this day. Unit five will look at the acrimonious 1980s dispute between the new 'deep ecology' movement and the more mainstream environmental lobbying organizations like the sierra club, the nature conservancy etc. which focus primarily on lobbyingcongress for environmental reforms, rather than advocatinga complete revolution in the wayeach individual human lives.

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 The mockumentary- a fictionalfilm made to &quot;look like&quot; a documentary -became popularized as a term to describe a distinct genre in coverage of Rob Reiner's 1984 film This is Spinal Tap, a fictionalized, behind-the-scenes account of a heavy metal band's concert tour. Since then, the genre has evolvedto treat a variety ofsubjects through a range of styles -including straightforward hoaxes (The Blair WitchProject), social parodies (Best in Show, Waitingfor Guffman), and sharp criticisms of nonfictional form (The Falls, The Daily Show with John Stewart).

<P>ENGFLM 1694 - THE AUSTRALASIAN NIGHTMARE </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 The classicAmerican horror is derived fromagothic heritage,an inheritor of a European context and its tropes; the falling apart ofcivilization through wars, disease, economic collapse, and a deconstruction of society. The horror that the current, post 9/11 generation has produced is inherently different; it playsupon central themes that pull from an Australasian context, driven from the horror films of Australia, Japan, and Korea. These films have been made and distributed outside of an American context but then repackaged to the west in remakes and revisits that awaken an American audience to themes of horror that are decidedly non-European in identity. This course will examine these films, comparing and contrasting European and Australasian tropes for horror as well as their reflection and impact on society.

We will also explore how the generic modes and conventions of film noirhave been incorporated into other media such ascomics, animations, and videogames (e.g. Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, LA Noir and Heavy Rain).

<P>GSWS 1235 - LANGUAGE, GENDER AND SOCIETY </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 </P>

<P>As a field ofresearch, language and gender studies is interdisciplinary andrelatively new.These studies seemto discover the nature of gender-related differences in language and theircausesand effects. Gender here refers to socialcategoriesbasedon sex but encompassing behavior, roles and images that, although not biologically determined, are regarded by a society as appropriate toits male orfemale members. What is seen as appropriate to each gender thus differs indifferent societies and eras. Explanations for gender thus differ in different societiesanderas. Explanations for almostall observed male/female languagedifferences are to be found less in the biologicalconstitution of the human body and more in the social and psychological formation of the human subject.These are theissues we will beconcerned with in this course. Is women's language use in systematic waysdifferent from that ofmen? If it is different, how is it different? Why is it different, what sortsof explanations are there? And maybe most important, does a difference of language use matter? Academic Career: Undergraduate Course Component: Lecture Grade Component: LG/SNC Elective Basis </P>

<P>HIST 1157 - HISTORY OF MAPS AND SPATIAL REPRESENTATION </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 It has been famously been observed that &quot;themap is not the territory.&quot; Any usefulmap must omit a great deal of information about the territory it represents,andmust generalize information about the real worldinto a small number of highly schematized categories. All mapsare based on particular technological affordances, executedwithin a certaincultural, political and historical context. Humans think visually about space, and almost every society, past and present, has developed some form of map making. However, theappearance ofmaps, the information that they include, and the purposes to which they have been put have all varied dramatically. Moreover, people often reject mapsaltogetherin favor oftravel guides, gazetteers and itineraries. Once written on paper, these now take the form of apps inour cars and on our phones. Inspite of theirdiversity, all spatial representations encode some imagination about the world. All of them reinforce it on behalf of some group of people, and frequently at the expense of some others. This course explores how people have depicted the world, and with what consequences, from the stone carvings of the Neolithicera tothe global positioning systems of today. Inthis course, students will create paper and digital maps, write papers, makepresentations and engage in discussion in order to: 1) Reveal that representation of the world and its constituentplaces is historically andculturally specific. 2) Demonstrate how every mode ofspatial representationreinforcesparticularsocialinterests. 3) Detail how particularmaps and changes in cartographic techniques have changed history. 4) Describe transformations in cartography and the way that they result fromnew technologies, politics, and ideologies.

Stemming from Paul's fateful decision to evangelize the Gentiles, Christianity has long sought to achieve a global network of believers, who now comprise about 20% of the world's population. We will study Christian globalization in the twentieth and twenty-firstcenturies and focus on two Christian traditions, Catholicism and Pentecostalism, as examples of religions that have deliberately and successfully globalized. We will ask if thecontemporary values ofand pluralism relativism are good for religions and religious people. And, where religion is no longer a powerful cultural force, what are the prospects for a purely humanitarian approach tocommon problems in a globalizing world?

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 Was the worldof Europe and the Middle East before the Enlightenment a period of unending religious conflict and intolerance? Were Jewsthe victims of severe persecution and violence everywhere duringthis period? Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasingreligious wars? The answer toall three of these questions is no. While the MiddleAges were a period of conflict and competitionbetween the three major western religious groups, they were also a time of coexistence and cooperation. Thisclass shifts from extreme dichotomiesand simplistic stereotypes to deeply examine the period in allof its complexity: what were the theological, political, and legal contexts in whichChristians, Muslims, and Jews interacted in both Christian Europe and the Muslimworld? How did these deeply religious societies organize themselves to toleratethe religious &quot;Other&quot;? When and why did toleration break down and lead to expulsion, forced conversion, or violence? What kinds of cross-cultural exchangesand cooperation take place in economic, cultural, intellectual, and social life? We willalso look atnewideas of toleration (and intolerance) that emerged at the end of the Middle Ages and examine aspects of inter-religious encounters and dialogues today. We will discuss not onlythe significance of Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but also assess these encounters as a case study in the broader history of religious diversity, pluralism, and conflict.

We will begin our study of the Jewish encounter with urban life in the 19th century,as millions of Eastern European Jews migratedfrom the small villages of their birth to cities acrossthe globe. Thiscourse will trace this Eastern European Jewish diaspora to urban destinations around the world, before training its lens on the Jewish encounter with American cities. We will pay close attentionto how patterns of Jewish urbanization changed regionally and overtime; how urbanization affected Jews' home-life, leisure time, religious practices and occupational choices; how differences in genderandclass affected Jews' experiences in urban spaces;and how Jews interacted with other ethnic groups in diverse, urban environments. Delving into the history, built environment, and archival sources pertaining to the Jewish experience in Pittsburgh will provide uswith a dynamiccase study for this crucial relationship between Jews and the city.

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 This course will examine architecture, city planning, interior design, and gardening in eighteenth-century Europe as the product ofsocial, industrial, administrative, and intellectual transformations that began to radically challenge traditionalspatialconfigurations and conventional approaches to building. Incosmopolitan centers like London and Paris, an unprecedented explosion of print media, rapid risesin literacy,and the development of a public sphere outside official power structures opened debate in the arts to previously marginal figures. A range of new voices thus emerged that impacted policydecisions in the urban realm andproffered advice and guidance inthinking about aesthetics and artistic production. The rise of science held out the possibility that cities and institutions could be reshaped to improve human welfare through better hygiene and the expansion of commerce. Influential new classesdefined by wealth or specialized knowledge generated the creation of buildingtypes for a rangeof new activities. Elite domestic space inparticular reflects a wholesale transformation of social prioritiesmotivated by the novel conceptof privacy. Narrowly defined Renaissance discourses on the arts founded exclusively on the model ofancient Rome collapsed under anavalanche of datagatheredin remote sites around the Mediterranean and through contact with more far-flungcivilizations around the world. New intellectual paradigms reconfigured the relationship between individual and nature, between modern present and historical past. Consequently, the purpose of architecture mutated in the course ofthe eighteenth century as a bewilderingrange of newpossibilities for shaping building and reshapingsocial relations were explored. Well before political revolutionrocked European governments and toppled traditional hierarchies, the built environmentserved as a laboratory for experimentationand as a forum for reimagining society.

The lens ofhousing will allow us to consider modernism in different geographic contexts (East and West); under different political conditions (in the colonial periphery, in the heart of empire, as partof state-sponsored redevelopment projects, andas part of the nation-buildingprocess in the developing world) and through a range of theoretical vectors (i.e. The modernist house as a manifesto for a new way of living; the attention received by vernacular building traditions and various schemes to replicatethem as part of the modern project; the role of post-war technology in prefabricated housing; and the role of museums, such as the MOMA and otherinstitutions such as the united nations in calcifying modernismin various locales around the world). This course is designed to give students a strong foundation in the theoretical, aesthetic and historical expressions of architectural modernism. It is also designed to expand the range of architectural modernism beyond the traditional Euro-Ameri-centric canon to include alternative modernisms across global geographies.

Archaeology in the Holy Land has long been driven by a desire to shed light on-or evenauthenticate-the Bible, while the &quot;exotic Orient&quot; was explored in the 19thand early 20th centuries through western expeditions and excavations that served to further colonial interests. These religious and political motivations persisteven if their manifestations have shifted with time. Through site tours, museum visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even aday participating in an archaeological excavation, students will gain direct experience withthe places that have aroused controversy because of their problematic relationship to biblical and other ancient texts and/or because of their locationin politically contested space.

The genre's success on theworldstage is closely connected with the Romani (gypsy) minority rights movement, which has strengthened on local, national, and international levelsdue to increased education opportunitiesfor roam, and more positive representation in the media. The present proliferation andpopularization of a great varietyof musical styles marketed as'gypsy' pointsto the fact that Romani musical expressions draw their musical characteristics from Romani and non-Romani elements. Styles are differentiated according to time, place, and cultural influences with regard to ornamentation,language choice,vocal timbres, and choice of instruments. This course analyzes the musical varieties within genres marketed as 'gypsy' and offers broaderpolitical, economic, and historical perspectives on a variety of factors rooted in race, ethnicity, gender, and class relations that have contributed to contemporary understandings of'gypsy' music Academic Career: Undergraduate Course Component: Lecture Grade Component: LG/SNC Elective Basis </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 The myths of the ancient Near East are among the earliest written interpretations of the world and human existence. They are also among the most enduring, although they have only been unearthed in the last 200 years. In this course, we read myths from ancient Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and Israel. We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ideasand issues of the original cultural context in which they were shaped. These myths offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient NearEast, as well as societal and political issues. We examine themes such as the presentation of the life of the gods, the relationship between the human and divine worlds,the issues of mortality and immortality, existence, fertility, kingship, and ethics. The primary goal of this course is to better understand these myths as they existed anddeveloped in their ancient settings. Of course, because the myths are expressions of human thought, wemay find that in studying them we also come to better understand ourselves.

Despite claims that the nation was becoming less religious, at least seven new religions were founded in the U.S. After the civil war, while millions of migrants from southern and eastern Europe brought large numbers of Catholics and Jews to challenge the dominance of protestants. We seek to understand how religions have both shapedandreflected economic, social, and cultural conditions in the unitedstates.

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 Alexis de Tocqueville famously called theUnited States &quot;a nation with the soul of a church.&quot; Ironically, his observationrefers to a nationwhose constitution forbids theestablishment of any official religiousidentity (while simultaneously allowing for &quot;free,&quot;voluntary,religious &quot;exercise&quot;). The result--a vibrant spiritual marketplace characterized both by diversity and innovation and a clinging to traditionalidentities--has marked American culture and the broader stories it tells about itself. In this course we'll read closely in&quot;secular&quot; literary texts(including novels , graphic novels, short stories, poetry, drama, film, and music) with some attention to short, relevant readings in religious thought, practice, and history, aiming for two related objectives: 1) to observe the overt ways religions appear in and contribute to these texts--symbolically,rhetorically, schematically, etc.--and 2) to consider how presumably &quot;secular&quot; literature functions religiously, giving form and coherence to the ambiguities of American experiences, identities, and crises that remain in flux, constantly under revision. Readings will include both&quot;classic&quot; andmore contemporary works by Gwendolyn Brooks, Willa Cather, MarkTwain, Flannery O'Connor, William Styron, Oscar Hijuelos, Art Speigelman, August Wilson, James McBride, the Cohen Brothers, and/or others.

Yet the history of the idea is shroudedin myth. Students in this course will usearchaeological andtextual evidence to trace the evolution of the God of Israel from a mountaintop deity of the southern Levant in thelate second millenniumBCE to a supreme deity worshipped by a small group of absolute monotheists based in Jerusalem in the mid-first millennium BCE. The cultural milieu in which God arose was marked byfluid and highly ritualized religious experiences¿a kind of theological diversity that would be stamped out by the authors of the latest strata ofthe Hebrew Bible. In modernity the characterof the ancient deity has proven problematic to theologians, particularly onissues of LGBTrights, women's rights, and the environment.

<P>RELGST 1142 - THE CONSTRUCTION OF EVIL IN WESTERN RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 Why is there evil in the world and who or what is responsible for it? How can we reconcile a beliefin a good God with the existence of evil? Even without the theological underpinning, in secular terms, evil poses a problem about the worlds intelligibility. This course undertakes a historical analysis of the various waysin which ancient and medieval minds pondered these questions and their solutions to the problem. We begin our survey with the monism of Hebrew Scriptures then move to the changesbrought on by Persian culture and the Hellenization of the Mediterranean basin after the conquests of Alexanderwith the introduction of Dualism. Dualism is a theoryor system of thought that recognizes two independent and mutually irreducible principles, which aresometimes complementary and sometimes in conflict. The course focuses on the polarities of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; (and the methods bywhich &quot;evil&quot; is defined), specifically highlighting the evolutionof the emergence of theDevil in Judaism and Christianity and the social construction of good and evil in the Western tradition.

<P>RELGST 1143 - DEATH IN THE NAME OF GOD </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 The roman empire understood Christianity to be an illegal and superstitious movement, and a threat to the traditions of their ancestors.

Who were these people who voluntarily embraced their own deathsas a vindicationof their faith, and how didRome justify their extinction? How were they understood by their pagan and Jewish neighbors? This course explores the cultural, political and religious context of Christianmartyrs, beginning in second temple Judaism. We then analyze their stories (martyrologies), imperial transcripts and legislation, and examine thelater(Christian)imperial legislation against&quot;heretics.&quot; this background helps motivate discussions of contemporary &quot;martyrs,&quot; such as &quot;suicide bombers,&quot; the political ramifications of such behavior, who getsto decide if someone is a martyr, and reactions to the public spectacle of dying as the ultimate religious act.

Our focus will be on the major archaeological sites of Israel-Palestine, particularly in Jerusalem and its environs. We will explore the politicaland religious issues that have emerged from or surround their excavation. Archaeology in the Holy Land has long been driven by a desire to shed light on -or even authenticate -theBible, while the &quot;exotic Orient&quot; was explored in the 19th and early 20th centuries through western expeditions and excavations that served to further colonial interests. These religious and political motivations persisteven if their manifestations have shifted with time. Through site tours, museum visits, student-led discussions, talks with local experts, and even aday participating in an archaeological excavation, students will gain direct experience withthe places that have aroused controversy because of their problematic relationship to biblical and other ancient texts and/or because of their locationin politically contested space.

It doesn't matter even if you're Catholic; if youlive in New York you're Jewish.&quot; In this course, we will discover why LennyBruce -- and so many other observers of Jewishlife -- came to understand urbanity as a core component of the Jewish experience. We will begin our study of the Jewish encounter with urban life in the 19th century,as millions of Eastern European Jews migratedfrom the small villages of their birth to cities acrossthe globe. Thiscourse will trace this Eastern European Jewish diaspora to urban destinations around the world, before training its lens on the Jewish encounter with American cities. We will pay close attentionto how patterns of Jewish urbanization changed regionally and overtime; how urbanization affected Jews' home-life, leisure time, religious practices and occupational choices; how differences in genderandclass affected Jews' experiences in urban spaces;and how Jews interacted with other ethnic groups in diverse, urban environments.

<P>RELGST 1455 - ISLAM IN EUROPE </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 Since 9/11 Europe has become increasinglyanxious about its multi-racial and multi-religious populations, the result of successive waves of non-European immigrants who have, since the end of WWII, made Europe their home. At the heart of these concerns isthe question whether followers of the Muslim faith can successfully be integrated into a European society that identifies culturally as Judeo-Christianand defines its social order as secular. The different public debates triggered by this anxiety center on the question of the legitimate limits ofcultural differencewithin liberal democratic societies, thereby alsoreflecting a growing unpopularity of multicultural ideals. Political discourses stress the need for a robust defense of liberal values that migrant communities (especially Muslimcommunities) must accept. In order to achieve that, various governmental techniques have been deployed, which are now considered asan essential part of European counter-terrorist strategies, along with security policies and stricter migration controls. Interestingly, many of these government techniques involve gender andsexual politics, which are at the heart ofpolicies and discourses around integration and multiculturalism. The course will look critically at these various developments through an interdisciplinary approach that combines anthropological studies with readings from political and social theory, feminist and queer studies inorder tothink about the issues at stake around Islam, religious pluralism and secular governance in Europe. As additionalcourse material, the class will draw on a variety of audio-visual material, such as fiction films, documentaries, or youtube clips.

The very constructionof Nature as a concept, and its reverence in the context of the sustainability movement, can be informed by theoretical discourse from the fieldof Religious Studies. After a survey of approachesto the natural worldin major religious traditions, students will focus on themes such as garden spiritualties, gendered Nature reverence, and eco-justice.

By looking cross-culturally at the materials on saints selected for this course and discussing (problematizing) the notion of sainthood itself, we examine religious themes, ideas and symbols found in them. These diverse writings are often markedby a very personaltone, adeeply felt relationwith the divine(sometimes reflecting asaint), inner struggles, sometimes his/her mystical experience of union), but also by pleas and calls for social and/or religious reforms. Our examples of devotional literature include Hindu, Muslim, and Christian sources, medieval as well as modern.

The course is structured around three central themes: 1) God asMystery: negative theology (Hindu and Orthodox ways of unknowing the divine). 2) God as Person: the Hindu notion of avatar and Orthodox understanding ofincarnation, and 3) God as Prayer: two selectedmethods of contemplation (Hindu yoga and Orthodox hesychast prayer). The course is based largelyon reading and discussion of primary sources (in English translation) supplemented with selected secondary sources to help enhance students' understanding of the comparative method, on the one hand, and symbolic, often enigmatic and sometimes &quot;upside-down&quot; language of the mystical texts,on the other.

<P>URBNST 0400 - CRIME, PUNISHMENT, JUSTICE, REINTEGRATION </P>

<P>Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 This course will focus on the concept of punishment as a response to a criminal act. While in religiously-grounded societies punishment is seen as a retribution for an evil act, tendencies in modernity (andpost-modernity) privilege the use of punishment as a tool for social reintegration. With the rise of human rights-based doctrines, the characterizationof punishment as retribution has provento be more and more difficult to justify. Evenif sayings such as &quot;paying my debtto society" are still inuse, it is becoming more and more evident - especially in atime of massincarceration -how incarceration as punishment cannot be the only solution. This course exposes students to ideas of justice as a process aimed at reintegratingwrongdoers in society through a path of reconciliation and re-socialization, so that the end of the process will produce fellow citizensrather thanex-felons.
