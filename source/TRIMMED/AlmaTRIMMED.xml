<P>Program Considerations for Art History Minor </P>

<P> Students who have had little or no studio experience are strongly encouraged to complete at least one studio course from the 100-200 level series. </P>

<P> Because graduate programs in Art History typically require proficiency in at least two foreign languages, students who are considering advanced studies in this discipline should plan to include at least four terms of foreign language coursework in their curriculum. </P>

<P> A Program of Emphasis (P.O.E.) in Art History or in Arts or Gallery Management is also available in consultation with the Art History faculty. Art History courses are supplemented with other appropriate courses in coordinate disciplines (Business, Anthropology, History, Religious Studies, etc.). Each P.O.E. is tailored to the student's particular interests and goals. </P>

<P> Completion of a senior thesis is strongly encouraged if student is considering graduate school. </P>

<P>Transfer Credits in Studio Art </P>

<P>Up to three studio art courses may be included in the major by transfer from an accredited institution. Transfer of upper level studio work will require Departmental review. </P>

AH 4 cr UL The powerful Irish tradition of dinnseanchas, or  place name poetry has ensured that Ireland's  landscape is vividly literary - every place we  will visit resonates with multiple layers of  ancient stories, stories that have taken form in  both literature and the visual arts.  As we  explore why and how ancient and later monuments  articulate the status and power of the landscape  - its control, and its bounty - we will also  investigate the stories written by later  inhabitants who sought to explain and appropriate  such monuments even as they added their own art  and architecture at or near those sites.  From  the early myth cycles to William B. Yeats, James  Joyce, and Seamus Heaney, the dinnseanchas reveals in Ireland's landscape artifacts of  culture, mythology, and natural wonder. </P>

<P>2. Select Area of Concentration:  Chemistry: eight credits from CHM-251, 300 or 400 level courses, BCM-321 or 422. At least four credits must be at or above the 300 level.  American Chemical Society Certified Degree: CHM-313 and 314; BCM-321; and four credits chosen from CHM-399, 411, 499, or BCM-422. </P>

<P>3.  Successful completion of CHM-450 </P>

<P>Program Considerations  Potential majors are advised to schedule MTH-121 and 122 and PHY-121 and 122 (or PHY-112 and 113) in the freshman and sophomore years so they may enroll in CHM-331 and 332 in the junior year.  Completion of an independent research project normally culminating in a senior thesis is recommended. Students bound for graduate school should make careful course selections to support their particular area of emphasis; participation in research, completion of CHM-313, 314 and 411, MTH-210 and 211 should be considered.  Experience with calculus based physics (PHY- 121 and 122) is preferred over PHY-112 and 113.  Students bound for medical school should elect CHM-115 in the fall of the freshman year so that BCM-321 can be completed in advance of taking the MCAT at the end of the Junior year (CHM-115, 223, 224, 230 and BIO-121 are prerequisites to BCM-321).  To be a competitive medical school applicant, the Chemistry Department strongly recommends students completing a Chemistry major also take genetics and physiology, in addition to considering upper level electives from Biology, Biochemistry or Integrated Physiology and Health Science. </P>
