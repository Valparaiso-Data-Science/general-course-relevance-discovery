<P>POLS 4519 - Genocide </P>

<P>(3 /0/ 3) Prerequisite: POLS 1101 The commission of genocidal acts represents the height of human inhumanity to human. Human history is filled with cases of groups-the state, elites, dominant ethnic groups, among others-committing genocidal crimes against other groups-marginalized racial, ethnic, religious and other groups-based on the perennial &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; serving as the motor force. Although, the international community has committed itself to the prevention of genocide as reflected in the famous expression &quot;Never again!,&quot; the rhetoric commitment has not been matched by consistent action. Accordingly, there have been cases of the commission of genocidal crimes as a recurring phenomenon-from the Holocaust to Sudan's Darfur region. Against this background, this course will seek to explore the various issues that underlie genocide, such as the explanations for the commission of genocidal acts, the typology of genocide, context, international norms, the efforts to prevent and punish genocidal crimes, and various case studies.
