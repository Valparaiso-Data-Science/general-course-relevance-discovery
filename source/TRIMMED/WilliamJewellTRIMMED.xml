<P>CTI 230 Religious Diversity in</P>

<P>Early Modern Drama	 (4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>In the late sixteenth century, “the Islamic world overlapped with Christendom, and the Ottoman Empire included a huge Jewish population. The Turkish empire was a porous body politic, allowing the entry and exit of various Christians, Jews and Muslims who participated in its economic life” (Daniel Vitkus, Turning Turk, 18). In the early modern period, international commerce introduced England to the Mediterranean world and thus shaped English identity not only through firsthand contact with but also through representation of different cultures and religions. This course will investigate early modern representations of three major faith traditions – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – through the study of literary texts and contemporary critical methodologies. Because international trade informed and shaped much of the early modern experience with the Muslim world, economic contexts will inform the study of literary texts.

After a brief introduction to slavery in the ancient and medieval eras, the first section of the course surveys the rise and fall of slavery in the Atlantic world from the 16th century to the 19th. The second section adopts a more global focus and concentrates on the late 20th century and early 21st century, exploring why forced labor and human trafficking continue to thrive and what steps are being taken to reverse that trend. Students will draw on disciplines including history, economics, political science, literature and law. Close attention will be paid to how inequalities of power in the global economy have fueled the expansion of slavery and how globalization and technology have provided tools for anti-slavery activists to combat slavery and seek justice for its victims.

<P/>

<P>CTI 288 Philosophy of Power, Sex and Gender	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>This course is an introduction to contemporary feminist theory, taught in a seminar format. We will consider the philosophical implications of claims made in other fields, including anthropology, political science, sociology, psychology and biology. Questions we will consider include: What is the relationship between sex and gender? How has the discipline of philosophy generally understood women, and presupposed a particular attitude toward gender? What are liberal feminism, radical feminism, Marxist feminism, multicultural feminism, post-modern feminism and how do they differ from one another? What are some important arguments made by feminist ethicists and feminist epistemologists? How are contemporary feminist philosophers contributing to the debate on micro-inequities and implicit bias? Students will gain familiarity with current feminist philosophical scholarship while developing their own scholarly abilities and skills of critical analysis.

<P/>

<P>CTI 405 Endangerment:</P>

<P>Species, Languages and Cultures	 (4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>This course will explore biological and ethnolinguistic diversity and endangerment. It will explore the following questions: What are the mechanisms by which species and ethnolinguistic groups have come into being and how can we know this? To what degree are these underlying mechanisms similar or not? What are the causes of biological and ethnolinguistic endangerment and are they similar or not? What are the ethical foundations for conservation of both species and ethnolinguistic groups? What should our responses to biological and ethnolinguistic endangerment be given the answers to the above questions? The class will explore these questions through the primary literature and independent research on the relationship between biological and ethnolinguistic diversity.</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 406 Death by Any Means? 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>This course will examine the current debate surrounding capital punishment. Students in this course will examine arguments in favor of and against the death penalty in the United States, and will also investigate the differing religious opinions, both Christian and non-Christian, that exist concerning this topic.

<P/>

<P>CTI 408 Health Care at Any Cost? 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>As health care costs stretch our national resources, we are faced with choices about personal and societal health. In this course, students will explore the current U.S. healthcare system and how health values are shaped by and shape consumerism. We examine justice in healthcare and how current trends will impact future healthcare delivery. Students will critically appraise selected issues relating to healthcare and use a research process for analyzing cost in managed health care situations.</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 409 Immigration: E Pluribus Unum? 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>This course will examine the issue of U.S. national identity as found in our conceptions of citizenship and national boundaries. We will raise these questions: What does it mean to be an American? What should it take to enter the United States legally? What does it mean to acquire United States citizenship? The goal of this examination will be to understand how various conceptions of national identity, citizenship and national borders shape the current debates over immigration policy. After exploring the ethical, economic, biological and social issues regarding immigration, students will create an immigration policy. That policy will be assessed as to its internally consistency, fit with the U.S. Constitution, moral soundness and comprehensiveness in defining the bounds of legal immigration as well as consequences of illegal entry.</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 410 Private Solutions for</P>

<P>Public Problems: In Billionaires We Trust 	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<P>Increasingly, high profile individuals and corporations are using their dollars and influence to try to solve social problems. In doing so, they are effectively creating public policy despite their status as private citizens. This course examines the role of private philanthropy in solving public problems. The ethics and values of philanthropy rooted in the evolution of the third sector, primarily in the United States, will be analyzed. Attention will be given to legal and philosophical issues associated with philanthropic endeavors, including the social responsibility of the corporation, looking at how profit motive interacts with social causes. We will discuss models of philanthropic and charitable organizations, their operational practices and issues arising from their existence and activities. In order to frame our discussion on philanthropy, each semester a major global issue currently being impacted by private philanthropy will be addressed, such as climate change or the global AIDS epidemic.</P>

<P/>

<P>CTI 411 Well-being by Design? 	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>This course will explore what structural attributes are needed to make a community strong and sustainable. We will survey some influential social justice philosophies while asking if it is possible to plan for the equitable, sustainable well-being of the members of an urban community. How can these philosophies be practically applied in actual communities in a way that protects individual happiness, community values and environmental capital? We will examine real-world proposals for community planning that attempt to answer questions such as: How are the values of that community translated into a healthy development plan for that community? What factors must be considered in designing the infrastructure that underlies healthy neighborhoods and communities within the urban context? </P>

<P>Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry (ACT-In)</P>

<P/>

<P>Associate Dean: Professor Gary Armstrong</P>

<P/>

<P>&gt;&gt; www.jewell.edu/act-in</P>

<P/>

<P>Goals for Student Learning</P>

<P>Students seeking a major in Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry (ACT-In) will couple the requirements for the Academic Core Curriculum, Critical Thought and Inquiry (CTI), with applied learning experiences from three areas: Disciplinary Scholarship, Reflective Citizenship and Active Engagement. The learning goals for the Academic Core Curriculum are listed in the previous section of the catalog. The goals of the applied learning experiences are:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>to enable students to integrate interdisciplinary intellectual skills and studies with practical activities beyond the CTI classroom;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>to strengthen campus engagement by encouraging individual and collective partnerships, careful reflection and sustained impact on our community; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>to allow students to demonstrate successfully through action the benefits of a high quality liberal arts education by purposefully and specifically making connections between the classroom and the world.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>The required applied learning experiences complement the Core experience by providing opportunity for students to “do” critical thought and inquiry in three additional settings valued by the College. Students will be required to ACT-In the discipline, ACT-In the world and ACT-In the community (campus and local). The major is constructed to strengthen the relationship between (1) the Academic Core Curriculum and the academic majors by connecting the two through applied learning in disciplinary scholarship, (2) the Academic Core Curriculum and programs that lead toward reflective citizenship via the second applied learning experience and (3) the Academic Core Curriculum and experiential learning opportunities via the third applied learning experience. The intent is to reinforce the value-added nature of these experiences in contributing to the overall educational experience of a William Jewell College student.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Major</P>

<P>(ACT-In cannot be a student’s primary major.)</P>

<P>Requirements:</P>

<P>To obtain a major in Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry, a student is required to:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Complete the curricular requirements in the Critical Thought and Inquiry Core Curriculum with a grade of C- or better in each course,</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Complete a minimum of 16 CTI hours in residence (through William Jewell courses), and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>Complete successfully three applied learning experiences, one from each of the following categories:</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Disciplinary Scholarship:</P>

<P>Evidenced by completion of an upper-level seminar or research course in the student’s program of study (other than ACT-In) that offers the opportunity for inquiry through discovery, integration or application using the appropriate intellectual tools for the discipline or program of study. This requirement can also be fulfilled by completion of a college Honors Project or of an appropriate undergraduate research project funded by a Journey Grant.</P>

<P/>

<P>Reflective Citizenship:</P>

<P>Evidenced by a student’s actively engaging another culture or issues/challenges of our contemporary world, which may include but are not limited to challenges associated with racial and ethnic differences, social inequities (gender, sexuality, economic), global concerns, environmental or sustainability concerns, or other contemporary citizenship issues through completion of a service-learning project, mission trip, study away, or of an appropriate project funded by a Journey Grant.</P>

<P/>

<P>Active Engagement:</P>

<P>Evidenced by sustained engagement with one’s community (local or college), including activities such as a leadership experience (multiple options), an internship, a practicum (e.g., nursing clinical or student teaching), participation in college- sanctioned co-curricular endeavors, completion of an appropriate project funded by a Journey Grant, etc. The intent of this category is to provide students with the opportunity and encouragement to apply the abstract in settings that have meaning and motivation for them, thus strengthening the learning that occurs in the academic setting of the core curriculum.</P>

<P/>

<P>A complete list of approved activities can be found on the Moodle page for ACT-In or by contacting the Associate Dean. Students’ completion of the applied learning experiences in the three categories is recorded in the office of the Associate Dean for the Core Curriculum. </P>

<P/>

<P>The department offers two majors (Biology and Oxbridge Science: Molecular Biology) and contributes to courses required for the Biochemistry major. For further information on the majors other than biology, refer to other sections of the catalog. Those who select biology as a second major must complete all requirements for the BA degree.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Major</P>

<P>BIOLOGY</P>

<P>The major in biology leads to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Upon completion of a biology major, a student will have been exposed to a broad background in biology while having had the opportunity to explore specific areas of interest through a senior thesis project. A degree in biology allows a student to pursue careers in education, research, medicine, biotechnology, conservation and industry either through immediate entry into the career or after further study at the graduate level. For biology majors, formal admission into the degree program requires the completion of three biology courses of at least 4 credit hours each, including BIO 133 and 134 or the equivalent; a GPA minimum of 2.5 in biology and 2.5 overall; and a formal application including a self-assessment form. Only after admission into the program can students enroll in BIO 360 and begin their four-semester Senior Thesis.</P>

<P/>

<P>The department also offers opportunities for study outside the traditional major. Those interested in careers in a health-related field may pursue a premedicine minor or may add courses appropriate for preparation for graduate work in the biomedical field of interest. Further information is available in the pre-professional section of the catalog.</P>

<P/>

<P>For those interested in applied professions relating to the environment, William Jewell offers a three-two program with Duke University leading to a Master of Forestry degree or a Master of Environmental Management degree. Applicants for this liberal arts/environment program should indicate their intentions at the time of enrollment in college, since careful curricular planning will be necessary. Further details of the program are available in the pre- professional section of the catalog.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who wish to receive certification to teach biology in grades 9-12 in the state of Missouri must complete a major in secondary education along with either a major in biology or a minor in premedicine. Additional course requirements and procedures to be followed in obtaining teacher certification are included in the Student Handbook for Teacher Certification. Specific course requirements for all certification programs may be obtained from the Education Department.</P>

<LBody>advance equity and justice.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Teacher education is a professional program of study that leads to teacher certification and acquisition of the skills and knowledge required for intentional, effective teaching. Teachers prepared at William Jewell College view teaching as a moral activity that requires reasoned teaching practice including reflection about multiple factors that influence the learning of K-12 students. To produce effective, intentional teachers, the Department of Education collaborates with other academic departments in the College and with schools in the community to provide an integrated sequence of high-quality courses and developmental fieldwork experiences in K-12 schools. This program of study thus produces the following outcomes in students who complete the program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Learning Outcomes</P>

<P>Teachers who graduate from William Jewell College’s Elementary teacher education program will:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>design coherent, standards-based instruction (lesson plans, unit plans, assessments) using high leverage teaching strategies (as indicated by research) that consider the needs of students and is likely to promote student learning;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell teacher education programs have been approved by the Missouri State Board of Education in the following fields:</P>

<P>Biology 9-12	</P>

<P>Chemistry 9-12</P>

<P>Elementary 1-6</P>

<P>English 9-12 </P>

<P>Mathematics 9-12</P>

<P>Music K-12 (Vocal &amp; Instrumental)</P>

<P>Physics 9-12</P>

<P>Social Studies 9-12 </P>

<P>Spanish K-12 </P>

<P>Speech/Theatre 9-12</P>

<P/>

<P>Successful completion of any of these programs of study leads to Missouri teacher certification in that field/ grade level and a Bachelor’s degree. Elementary teacher education requires completion of the elementary education major plus content area instruction applicable to the elementary school curriculum and consistent with Missouri DESE certification requirements. Secondary and K-12 teacher education majors must complete a primary major in the content field in which they intend to teach and a second major in secondary education if their teaching field is English, Spanish, music, or social studies. Students whose teaching field will be mathematics or one of the sciences have the option of either completing a primary major in the specific content field and a second major in secondary education or having a primary major in secondary education with a minor in the teaching field. Students who wish to be certified in Speech and Theatre Education must select a primary major in secondary education and minors in both communication and theatre. Advisors in education can provide more information on these options.</P>

<P/>

<P>Because teacher education is a professional program of study, there are many policies and procedures with which students must comply. The Student Handbook for Teacher Education, which contains those policies and procedures, can be found on the Department of Education’s website. State teacher certification requirements change frequently and the Student Handbook contains the most current and accurate information about requirements. Due to the frequent changes in the profession, all education courses must be taken within seven years prior to applying for teacher certification. In addition, courses in education that are more than seven years old will not normally count toward a major. Specific “Requirements for Initial Teacher Certification” check sheets are available in the Education Department.</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional specific course requirements from other disciplines (including specific content courses in the content major or minor teaching field) are required for certification. For further information, refer to the Student Handbook for Teacher Education.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Pursuing a Teacher Education Program</P>

<P>Because of the two layers of requirements (completion of a degree as well as certification as a teacher), the Department of Education asks prospective students to contact them as soon as possible so that they can receive the most timely, accurate advising. As soon as a student decides to pursue teacher certification, the student should declare a major in education and request an academic advisor from education. Any student can declare the major at any time but, in order to enroll in upper division education course work, the student must first be admitted to a teacher education program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Admission to Teacher Education Programs </P>

<P>Because teacher certification is regulated by the state, teacher education students must be admitted to a teacher education program in addition to declaring a major in education. Procedures for teacher education admission are found in The Handbook for Teacher Education. If students are not admitted to a teacher education program by the end of the second semester of their sophomore year, they will be unable to complete teacher education within a four-year degree program.</P>

<P/>

<P>To be admitted to teacher education, the student must meet multiple standards for admission including grade point average requirements, Missouri state examination requirements and positive recommendations from faculty and field experiences. Students may not enroll in 300-level education coursework until they are admitted to a teacher education program. Students who fail to complete all requirements for certification within a seven-year period must re-apply for admission under the policies and regulations that are in effect at the time of the new application.</P>

<P/>

<P>Transfer Students/Change of Major</P>

<P>Because teacher education is a professional program, education majors are governed by Missouri teacher education program approval and certification requirements (in addition to William Jewell College requirements and our department policies).Thus, there are program requirements beyond what most college majors are required to meet. Students changing majors or transfer students planning to pursue teacher education should declare an education major and see an academic advisor in education immediately. Those students who transfer into or change their major to include teacher education will often need one or more additional semesters beyond a traditional course of study to complete teacher education.</P>

<P/>

<P>The acceptance of courses taken at other institutions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Decisions about transferred courses will be made in such a way that upholds the integrity, quality and rigor of the William Jewell College teacher education program.</P>

<P/>

<P>General Requirements for all Teacher Certification Programs</P>

<P>All teacher education students must meet the requirements of the William Jewell College Core Curriculum. In addition, please note the following certification requirements:</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional Content Courses: Elementary education (1-6) students are required to complete content courses related to the elementary curriculum consistent with Missouri certification requirements. See the Student Handbook for additional information on current requirements.</P>

<P/>

<P>Writing Standard: All teacher education students must demonstrate competence in English composition. The student must successfully complete CTI 102, Written Communication, or the equivalent. If a student does not demonstrate writing competence, the department will require the student to seek services from the Academic Achievement Center and file a Care Team form (see Handbook), and the student will be counseled.</P>

<P/>

<P>Oral Communication Standard: All teacher education students must demonstrate oral communication competence. This requirement can be met either through successful completion of COM 100, Fundamentals of Speech Communication (2), or the equivalent. Each student must continue to exhibit strong oral presentation skills in education course work. If a student does not demonstrate such skills, the instructor will file a Care Team form, and the student will be counseled.</P>

<P/>

<P>Numeracy Standard: All teacher education students must demonstrate basic mathematical competence. In addition to successful completion of the math requirement in the college’s Core Curriculum, the student must continue to exhibit knowledge and accurate use of mathematics in education course work. If the student does not demonstrate those skills, the department will file a Care Team form and the student will be counseled.</P>

<P/>

<P>Advising for Elementary and Secondary Teacher Education Students</P>

<P>All elementary teacher education majors must be advised by an elementary education advisor each semester. K-12 and secondary (9-12) teacher education majors must be advised by both content area and education advisors each semester.</P>

<P/>

<P>Entering education students should enroll in 200-level education courses as soon as is practicable. Teacher education students may not enroll for 300-level education courses until they are admitted to a teacher education program. Please see the Student Handbook for current admission requirements and procedures.</P>

<P/>

<P>Teacher education students will complete a number of fieldwork experiences in schools during their teacher education program. There are varying background checks that must be completed in order to do fieldwork in K-12 schools. At two points during the teacher education program students will be required to undergo background checks, for which there are fees.</P>

<P/>

<P>Formal admission to the teacher education program is a prerequisite to applying for student teaching. Students must submit the Application for Student Teaching form by December 15 for student teaching in the following academic year. Student teacher applicants will receive instructions about how and when to have the background check done as part of the admission process. The criteria for admission to student teaching are stated in the Student Handbook. As noted in the Student Handbook, some state testing requirements must be met prior to student teaching. Student teaching application forms are available in the Education Department office and on the Department’s internal website. A student must be approved for student teaching before enrolling in any of the following courses:</P>

<P>Application for Missouri Teacher Certification</P>

<P>Students must complete the official Application for Missouri Teachers Certificate form on the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website during the last semester of their teacher education program. Students must also provide official transcripts from all colleges that they have attended, as well as evidence of a passing score on the required teaching content test(s) and the required teaching performance assessment as required by the State of Missouri. In addition, the state requires an FBI background check. One of these screenings will be done prior to student teaching, but the process is different for certification, so the student will have to submit to another background check at application for teacher certification.</P>

<P/>

<P>Test Information</P>

<P>The State of Missouri requires multiple examinations and protocols to be successfully completed prior to completion of teacher education/certification. Each teacher education student must attain a qualifying score on each of these instruments in order for William Jewell College to recommend him/ her for teacher certification. Failure to pass early examinations or protocols may prevent a teacher education student from progressing in the program. Failure to pass late examinations or performance instruments may prevent William Jewell College’s Department of Education from recommending a graduate for teacher certification.</P>

<P/>

<P>Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification</P>

<P>The Post-Baccalaureate Certification Program allows those persons who already possess a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university in a secondary teaching field to complete the education coursework required for teacher certification. Applicants to the post-baccalaureate certification program must have already passed required state content examinations and completed required protocols. Specific requirements for admission can be found in the Student Handbook. Post-baccalaureate candidates meet the same requirements and do the same course work as regular teacher education students but can be given credit for requirements met during work on their earlier baccalaureate degree as long as satisfactory grades were achieved, any completed education field work was done successfully, the overall academic record is strong and the course is not mandated to be done in residence at Jewell. The following courses must be completed at Jewell (rather than being transferred from another institution) for post-baccalaureate teacher certification: EDU 270, 275, 280, 299, 305, 308, 311, 315, 316, 401, 410/411, 420/421, 425/426 and 501.</P>

<P/>

<P>Participants in the Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification program should be aware that students who enter William Jewell with the intent of earning a bachelor’s degree and who already hold a bachelor’s degree from a different regionally-accredited institution are exempt from all Core Curriculum requirements, if at least 90 semester hours of their work is applicable toward a bachelor’s degree at William Jewell. (For an explanation of what transfer work can count toward a degree at Jewell, refer to the earlier section on “Requirements for Transfer Admission”. Note that credit transferred from a community college can be included only in the first 64 hours of the 90 transferrable hours needed by a student to be exempted from Jewell’s Core Curriculum.)</P>

<P>PRE-ENGINEERING PROGRAM DUAL DEGREE OPTIONS</P>

<P>Advisor: Patrick Bunton, Professor of Physics</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College is one of a limited number of liberal arts colleges that have entered into an agreement with Washington University in St. Louis for a “three-two” dual-degree program in engineering. After three years in residence at William Jewell College and two years at the Washington University School of Engineering, the student can achieve both the BA degree from Jewell and the BS degree in engineering. William Jewell College also maintains similar dual-degree plans with Vanderbilt University, Columbia University in New York, Missouri University of Science and Technology and (only for electrical engineering) the University of Kansas. While in residence at Jewell, students should consider a major in physics, chemistry or mathematics, with the choice depending upon the type of engineering program in which they plan to complete their studies. Since the semester-hour load is heavy, students are advised to plan their work very closely with the official advisor for this specialized program. Care is needed since the student must meet all of Jewell’s core requirements and most, if not all, of the requirements of a major while still in residence at Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>In order to be eligible to use credit from an affiliated engineering program toward graduation from Jewell, the pre-engineering student must complete—before leaving Jewell—the following:</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>all requirements of Jewell’s core curriculum;</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>at least 90% of the hours required in the primary major; and</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>a total of 90 or more hours that count toward completion of a bachelor’s degree, at least 30 of which must have been earned while at Jewell.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P/>

<P>Any exceptions must be approved by the Registrar, who may consult with the Provost and appropriate department chairs. The student, with the assistance of the advisor, should plan to include in the work at Jewell the prerequisites needed for the particular engineering program the student desires to enter.</P>

<P/>

<P>The student must arrange, while in the engineering program at the other institution, to take courses that can be used to meet all remaining requirements of the student’s academic program at Jewell. The student must check with officials at the engineering school to determine whether credits that are going to be counted toward any requirements remaining at Jewell can also be employed toward the engineering degree.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students contemplating entry into an engineering program following a period at Jewell should be aware that admission to and/or financial aid for the engineering program may depend on whether a degree has or has not been completed at Jewell. For further information, contact the pre-engineering advisor.</P>

<P/>

<P>Pre-Engineering Program of Studies </P>

<P>Courses that are required for entry into an engineering program vary by partner school and by field of engineering. Hence, it is essential that you meet with an advisor who is knowledgeable about preparation for engineering to be sure that you are on track for meeting the requirements. However, most fields of engineering will require the following courses:</P>

<P/>

<P>Students wishing to declare an English major should consult with their advisor. Formal admission to the major requires completion of a minimum of two college-level literature courses or one college-level literature course and one college level writing course, at least one of which must be ENG 330,Introduction to Textual Study. The minimum acceptable GPA in the courses presented for admission to the major is 2.75.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students majoring in English may receive certification to teach English in grades 9-12 in the State of Missouri by majoring in both English and secondary education and by fulfilling all requirements of a certification program in English that has been approved by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Procedures to be followed in obtaining teacher certification are included in the Student Handbook for Teacher Certification. Specific course requirements for all certification programs may be obtained from the Education Department.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Curriculum</P>

<P>Introductory courses: 200-level courses</P>

<P>200-numbered literature courses (225, 245, 255) are suitable for any student with an interest in literature. They cover a wide range of readings and provide instruction in methods of critical analysis and interpretation of written and other texts. They are divided into three categories: Types, Periods, and Topics. Typically, one of these courses is offered each semester and is open to English majors and non-majors. Students may take more than one of the courses within each category if the content differs. These courses do not meet a requirement of the English major.</P>

<P/>

<P>The core: 300-level courses</P>

<P>300-level creative writing courses offer workshops in fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction. The introductory courses are open to anyone; the advanced courses in fiction and poetry are open to students who have completed the introductory courses in those genres. Two creative writing courses are required for English majors.</P>

<P/>

<P>300-level critical theory courses offer the study of contemporary literary theory. ENG 330 is open to all students and is required for English majors; ENG 390 is open to students who have completed 330 and is required for English majors.</P>

<P/>

<P>300-level literature courses emphasize extensive reading within a broad historical span. Their common purpose is to develop the ability to analyze and contextualize literary works within characteristics of historical periods and literary movements, informed by an understanding of critical methodologies. English majors must complete three literature courses at the 300 level, one each in British, U.S., and World literatures. English majors are expected to complete ENG 330, Introduction to Textual Study, before enrolling in any other 300-level literature course, although course instructors may waive this prerequisite under certain circumstances. Non-majors wishing to take any 300-level literature course must have successfully completed at least one 200-level literature course at Jewell or the equivalent at another college or have the instructor’s permission, before enrolling.</P>

<P/>

<P>Advanced literary studies: 400-level courses </P>

<P>400-level courses offer seminar-type intensive study of a specific topic, writer or theme, founded in the practice and methods of literary theory and primary research. Intended primarily for English majors, these courses provide opportunities for students to complete an independent research project in collaboration with a member of the English Department faculty. English majors must have been formally admitted to the major and have completed ENG 330, Introduction to Textual Study, and at least two other 300-level courses before enrolling in any advanced studies course. Typically, 400-level advanced studies courses are open only to seniors; however, any qualified English major who has the instructor’s consent may take an advanced studies course as an English elective during the junior year, in addition to the two required advanced studies courses to be taken during the senior year. Non-majors may occasionally be admitted to 400-level courses under special circumstances, with the consent of the instructor.</P>

<P>Goals for Student Learning</P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student engages in historical analysis and interpretation. Therefore, the student is able to:
•	understand the beliefs, motives and interests
	of individuals and groups in the past and draw
	meaningful conclusions about them;
•	demonstrate a careful appreciation of historical
	context when judging historical figures and avoid
	viewing the past solely from the perspective of
	present-day values; and
•	evaluate cause-and-effect relationships and 
	competing historical narratives, noting the 
	importance of individuals, larger historical forces 
	and contingency in driving historical change.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student conducts historical research. Therefore, the student is able to:
•	formulate historical questions from encounters 
	with primary historical sources and secondary
	scholarly accounts of the past;
•	obtain historical data from a variety of sources, 
	including: library and museum collections, online 
	databases, libraries, historic sites and oral 
	testimony from living witnesses; and
•	interrogate historical data by uncovering the 
	social, political and economic context in which it 
	was created; evaluating the source for its credibility, 
	authority, authenticity, internal consistency and 
	completeness; and detecting and evaluating bias, 
	distortion and propaganda by omission, 
	suppression, or invention of facts.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3.	</Lbl>

<LBody>The student presents the results of his/her analysis and research in written and oral formats that conform to the standards of the discipline. Therefore the student is able to:
•	support interpretations with primary and 
	secondary historical evidence in closely reasoned 
	arguments, reaching a persuasive conclusion;
•	present the results of analysis and research in 
	written essay(s) that use correct English and the 
	Chicago notes and bibliography style for citations; 
	and
•	deliver an oral presentation to his/her peers that 
	is well organized, appropriate for the audience and 
	clearly delivered in the allotted time.</LBody>

<P>The Department of Languages offers programs in three languages representing the peoples, cultures and literatures of the Western World (French, Latin and Spanish) and in one language critical to an understanding of the present world beyond the West (Arabic). Students may choose to study one of these languages to complete the College’s World Languages Requirement.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Department of Languages also offers a major and a minor in Spanish. (A grade of C- or higher is required in each course in the major and minor.) Committed to the College’s promise to provide “open, rigorous intellectual pursuit,” the Spanish Program seeks to: increase students’ socio-cultural understanding of Spanish-speaking countries and communities; foster critical thinking through literary and cultural analysis; and, concurrently, develop Spanish language proficiency through listening, speaking, reading and writing. Further, the Spanish major and minor prepare students to engage with our increasingly globalized world and our culturally diverse country through their varied academic and professional choices and paths.</P>

<P>All six majors in Oxbridge lead to the Bachelors of Arts (BA) degree and require the successful completion of OXA 100 before the rest of the major is officially entered. Extensive explanations of the policies of the Oxbridge program are provided in the Oxbridge Handbook, which is available from the Oxbridge Administrative Assistant. Under certain conditions, Oxbridge students who do not fully meet the requirements for an Oxbridge honors major may be graduated with a BA degree, a major in Liberal Arts and a reference on the transcript to the discipline they emphasized while in the Oxbridge program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Course Descriptions</P>

<P>OXA 100 Introductory Seminar	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>An introduction to reading, interpretation, critical analysis, writing and discussion at the college honors level and in preparation for tutorial study. The subject matter may vary, but students will in all cases be engaged intensively, with significant critical analysis and writing. OXA 100 may substitute for CTI 102 in the College’s core curriculum. Prerequisite: acceptance into the Oxbridge Honors Program. Successful completion of the seminar is a prerequisite to tutorial study.</P>

<P/>

<P>Tutorial Credits</P>

<P>The number in the first set of parentheses following each tutorial’s title indicates the credit hours that will be awarded following the successful completion of the course (i.e., by participation in the tutorial sessions and through activities described in the syllabus). Upon successful completion of the activities of a tutorial, an equal number of credit hours will be included on the transcript with the (neutral) grade of IP (In Progress) to indicate that further credit can be awarded after successful completion of the comprehensive exams at the end of the senior year. Ultimately, the total credit shown in the second set of parentheses is expected to be earned by the student who completes all aspects of the major successfully.</P>

<P/>

<P>Full credit for a tutorial, including a tutorial taken elsewhere during the Junior-year studies in the major subject, is achieved only when the collection (special examination) paper or related comprehensive examination papers have been successfully completed. A student who for any reason, including transfer out of the college or withdrawal from the program, satisfactorily finishes syllabus assignments and participates in tutorial sessions but does not finish the complete work of the tutorial by satisfactory performance on the collection or examination will have earned only the first number of credit hours shown. Any tutorial included in a student’s Oxbridge major must be related to the comprehensive examination fields of the major.</P>

<P/>

<P>Oxbridge studies in the junior year are in tutorials at a college of Oxford University or in alternative studies, all of which will involve rigorous and challenging academic activities, with a preference for depth over breadth, with the expectation for substantial independence and significant complexity of reading and writing, and with affiliation at an institution of established excellence. Studies in the junior year other than in established programs in Oxford must be approved by the Oxbridge Committee after application by a student and the coordinator of the student’s Oxbridge major.</P>

In the course of its inquiries into global literatures, the tutorial engages in a sustained examination of contemporary theories and debates of the “global,” “post-coloniality,” and “empire.”The course, therefore, examines theoretical debates on – as well as the literary and aesthetic conventions and strategies through which global literatures map and re-map – questions of the nation, empire, (anti-)colonialism, “post-colonialism,” national struggle, history, decolonialization, the post- or trans-nationality, imperialism, identity, hybridity, otherness and sub-alterity, race, class, gender, the cultural politics of representation, power relations and the emerging “global” culture and social and economic relations.</P>

<P/>

<P>OXE 260/460 Medieval</P>

<P>Devotional Literature	(2 cr. hrs.) (4) </P>

<P/>

<P>OXE 489 Advanced Critical Theory	(2 cr. hrs.) (4) </P>

<P>This tutorial undertakes rigorous, critical and comparative examination of critical literary and cultural theory – that is, diverse conceptual methods of reading, interpreting and analyzing literary and cultural texts. Students will analyze and critically compare diverse frames of reading and analysis in a range of primary theoretical texts in, for example, liberal humanism, new criticism, new historicism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, feminism, Marxism, cultural materialism, transnationalism, cyber theories … . The tutorial places emphasis of critical and comparative examination of concepts that have become significant in contemporary critical theory: “theory,” “representation,” “author/ity,” “reading,” “pleasure,” “critique,” “discourse,” “ideology,” “culture,” “material reality,” “difference,” “alterity,” “supplementarity,” the “virtual,” “race,” “gender,” “class,” “aesthetics,” “politics,” … . In doing so, it addresses the cultural and conceptual assumptions of diverse theories, the historical conditions within which diverse theories have emerged, and the social consequences of different and conflicting modes of reading literature and culture.</P>

<P>OXM 205 Music and Culture –</P>

<P>Past, Present, and Future	(2 cr. hrs.) (4) </P>

<P>The Classical music tradition has a long and rich history, marked by both sudden and gradual change in its relationship to surrounding cultures. This tutorial will explore this relationship. Theoretical treatises, critical commentaries, original sources and performance practices will shed light on the ways in which this tradition both rebels against and adapts to cultural trends in any given era. Students will gain a foundational knowledge for future study while learning to question their assumptions about music’s role in society. Prerequisite: OXA 100.</P>

<P/>

<P>OXM 223/423 The Operas of Mozart 	(2 cr. hrs.) (4) </P>

<P>This tutorial will investigate the ways in which Mozart responded to the changes around him through his compositions of one particular genre–opera. By studying the thematic material, musical devices, cultural settings, vocal and instrumental styles the tutorial will reveal the elements of the classical style that are critical for understanding music history from that time forward.</P>

<P>OXS 247 Protein Structure and Function	(2 cr. hrs.) (4) </P>

<P>Protein Structure and Function is an in-depth survey of proteins. Cells are comprised of molecules, and macromolecules called proteins that perform cell functions. Thus, proteins had to adapt to the special properties of water. The conversations will be directed toward addressing the following major question: “What determines the “Native” state of protein in its natural cellular environment?” Accordingly, we will begin the tutorial with a review of the properties of water. Then we will review the structures and properties of amino acids that are the “building blocks” of proteins. Proteins perform most cell functions. Hence, we will focus on protein structure and how changes in protein structure cause changes in protein function. We will emphasize interactions between protein molecules and small water-soluble molecules called ligands. Importantly, these interactions lead to changes in protein and therefore cell function. The laboratory section of the tutorial will cover techniques of protein visualization and protein function. Students will get a broad overview of laboratory techniques to monitor protein/protein interactions and how the correct structure and function are critical for cellular function and survival (Gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, Immunofluorescence techniques).</P>

<P/>

<P>PHI 339 Trust, Betrayal and Forgiveness 	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>The course will inquire into the nature and value of trust, betrayal and forgiveness or, more generally, in the field of personal relationships, relation, perturbation and reconciliation. It will approach these topics through philosophical analysis and literary methods. Students will read and develop philosophical analyses of the key concepts and write scenarios (biographical, autobiographical, historical and/or imaginative) that implicate the three main themes. The scenarios will be critiqued for their adequacy in light of the demands of philosophical coherence, and the philosophical analyses will be critiqued in light of their capacity to deal with the nuances of the scenarios. This approach will be extended through reading and analyzing selected works of literature. Students will also consider the nature of relations of the methods, philosophical and literary, that are used for understanding and appreciating human relations. Cross-listed with CTI 215. It is recommended that students enrolling in this course be eligible to take Level-II CTI courses.</P>

<P/>

<P>PHI 351-363 Seminars</P>

<P>Intensive reading and discussion of problems, thinkers and movements in philosophy. As seminars are intended to advance a student’s knowledge and competence beyond the introductory level, it is recommended that students complete PHI 202 or PHI 215 before enrolling in a seminar. Two seminars are usually offered each semester.</P>

<P/>

<P>PHI 351 Philosophy of Law	(4 cr. hrs.) </P>

<P>This course is an examination of the philosophical foundations of law and of the relationship of law to morality. Fundamental questions concerning the concept of law as presented in the natural law tradition, legal positivism, legal realism and critical legal studies will be considered. The course will also investigate the nature of legal reasoning and important normative issues including theories of justice, equality, the structure and content of rights, responsibility and punishment. Students will read classic works by Aquinas, Marx and Mill, as well as contemporary writings by Hart, Dworkin, Fuller and others. Philosophy of law will be of interest not only to students considering a career in law, but to anyone concerned with the nature, purpose, scope and justification of law.</P>

<P/>

<P>PHI 352 Existentialism	(4 cr. hrs.)</P>

<Story>
<P>William Jewell College offers a number of pre-professional courses of study leading to programs at various graduate and professional schools. Admission to these programs at other institutions requires separate application procedures in addition to completion of the types of curricula suggested below. Students interested in these programs of study should contact the chair of the appropriate William Jewell department or program.</P>

<P/>

<P>PRE-DENTISTRY</P>

<P>See Premedical Study later in this section.</P>

<P/>

<P>PRE-ENVIRONMENTAL</P>

<P>MANAGEMENT OR FORESTRY</P>

<P>Rose Reynolds, Associate Professor of Biology</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell College is a member of the Cooperative College program at the Nicholas School for the Environment at Duke University. This program (hereafter referred to as the Duke 3-2 Program) allows for qualified William Jewell College students to attend 3 years at William Jewell and 2 years at Duke University and emerge with a BA degree from William Jewell College and a professional Master’s degree in either Environmental Management or Forestry from Duke University. While there is no requirement for the student to be enrolled in a particular undergraduate major, there are certain prerequisites for the program that must be met prior to matriculating at Duke. In order to qualify, students must communicate to the Department of Biology their intention to enter into this track during their first year (preferably first semester) so the Program Advisor can assist the student’s curricular planning and can help to ensure that the student has prepared adequately for the transition to graduate study.</P>

<P/>

<P>The expectation is that the student will complete all requirements of the core curriculum and of an academic major before leaving William Jewell and that hours earned at Duke will count as electives toward graduation. Any exceptions must be approved by the Registrar.</P>

<P/>

<P>The basic prerequisites of the program are listed below:</P>

<P>PRE-LAW</P>

<P>Gary Armstrong, Professor of Political Science</P>

<P/>

<P>The Pre-Law Advising Program at William Jewell aims to assist students who seek admission to law school and a career in the law. Students interested in the legal profession must obtain admission to law schools after successfully taking the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Any student from any major may seek admission to law school. Most law schools strongly recommend taking a rigorous undergraduate program that builds skills in reading complex material and high quality writing. The Pre- Law Program:</P>

<P>PREMEDICAL STUDY</P>

<P>Jason Morrill, Professor of Chemistry</P>

<P/>

<P>Students interested in the study of allopathic medicine (M.D.), dentistry (D.D.S., D.M.D.), optometry (O.D.), osteopathic medicine (D.O.) or veterinary medicine (D.V.M.) should consult with the director of the Premedical Advisory Program. The purpose of the program is not only to help students prepare for graduate study in the health professions, but also to support the College’s mission of providing a sound liberal arts education. The Premedical Advisory Committee encourages students to take advantage of the opportunities available to them, not only on-campus but also off- campus. The challenge to the student is to become a thoughtful and self-disciplined person, who is responsive and sensitive to the needs of society.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Premedical Advisory Program provides advising for students interested in preparing for doctoral work in the health professions. This guidance typically begins in the first semester of study at William Jewell through a course entitled “So, You Want to Be a Premed Student?” (BMS 111). This course is designed to help students better understand their intended career, as well as how to prepare a compelling application for professional schools. All first-year students interested in becoming medical professionals are encouraged to enroll in this class. Regardless of having taken BMS 111 or not, all students interested in the health professions are supplied additional information about their chosen career path, as well as alternatives.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students normally apply for formal admission to the advisory program during their second year of college. Only students who have been admitted to the program are offered a letter of recommendation sent under the auspices of the Premedical Advisory Committee. The committee also provides these admitted students with mock interviews when the time approaches for interviews at the professional schools.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students who expect to be admitted to a professional school must maintain a strong scholastic record. The typical course requirements are as follows: chemistry, 20 to 25 semester hours including labs; biology, 10 to 20 semester hours including labs; physics, 10 semester hours including labs; English, 4 to 10 semester hours; math, 4 to 8 semester hours. Students should consult catalogs for the schools that they expect to attend for more specific lists of prerequisites.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Minor</P>

<P>PREMEDICINE</P>

<P>Students who are interested in pursuing graduate- level studies in medicine or related fields take core science classes to help them prepare for the admission process of professional programs. The courses in biology and chemistry that most frequently are recommended make up the premedicine minor.</P>

<P/>

<P>Required Courses </P>

<P>CHE 122	General Chemistry II (4)</P>

<P>CHE 301	Organic Chemistry I (4)</P>

<P>CHE 302	Organic Chemistry II (4)</P>

<P>BIO 233	Cell and Molecular Biology (4)</P>

<P>BIO 234	Genetics (4)</P>

<P>BMS 250	Human Physiology (4)</P>

<P/>

<P>Additional coursework, and not just the classes required for the minor, will be necessary for students to be prepared to begin the competitive application process. (For example, a two-semester sequence in physics is required by most professional schools, and courses like biochemistry, histology, microbiology, human anatomy and psychology are likely to be recommended – if not required – by some programs.) It is also important to note that, while only lecture components of courses are required for this minor, students at William Jewell are normally required to enroll in both lecture and laboratory components. Furthermore, professional schools will expect lab components to be present in these courses.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students with majors in biochemistry or Oxbridge molecular biology are not eligible for the premedicine minor because the requirements overlap too extensively.</P>

<P/>

<P>Coordinated Programs in Medicine</P>

<P>Partners Program through KCUMB (Osteopathic) </P>

<P>William Jewell College, in cooperation with the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences (KCUMB) offers a seven-year coordinated program in medicine (three years at William Jewell and four years at KCUMB) leading to both the bachelor of arts and doctor of osteopathic medicine degrees. Participation in this Partners Program is competitive and is meant to recognize the academic potential of students pursuing a career in medicine. Students who are interested in this program should seek a BA with a major in chemistry, biochemistry or biology in order to be able, in three years, to meet the prerequisites for medical study while taking all courses needed to meet specific requirements for a degree from Jewell.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Premedical Advisory Committee, in cooperation with KCUMB, will select up to two students per year for this program. Interested students are required to participate in an application process during the beginning of the sophomore year. A competitive candidate must have a minimum composite ACT score of 28. The committee will also consider a student’s first-year academic performance, community service, college and high school activities and knowledge of and dedication to the field of osteopathic medicine. The Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) will not be required for admission through the Partners Program. In order to remain in the program, students must maintain an overall GPA of 3.25 and a science coursework GPA of 3.5. Failure to maintain such an average will result in the dismissal of the student from the program. Students selected for the Partners Program must complete a minimum of 90 semester hours of coursework at William Jewell College before matriculation at KCUMB.</P>

<P/>

<P>Students can pursue professional study at KCUMB after completing a biology major or a biochemistry major or a chemistry major at Jewell. All requirements of the major and the Core Curriculum must be completed while at William Jewell College, with the first year at KCUMB counting as elective credit toward completion of the BA degree. (Any exceptions to this plan must be approved by the Registrar.) </P>

<P/>

<P>Still Scholars Early Acceptance Program through ATSU/KCOM (Osteopathic)</P>

<P>The Still Scholars Program is designed to provide admission opportunities to outstanding students of William Jewell College who aspire to become Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine. The program is conducted under the joint collaboration of William Jewell and A.T. Still University, Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine (ATSU/KCOM).</P>

<P/>

<P>Under this program, William Jewell students apply to ATSU/KCOM toward the end of the sophomore year. A maximum of two students from Jewell will be awarded reserved admissions to ATSU/KCOM at the beginning of their junior year. Students complete their junior and senior years and earn a bachelor’s degree prior to matriculating at ATSU/KCOM. The advantage for those students accepted into the program is to have a reserved seat (without being required to take the MCAT) in ATSU/KCOM’s entering class upon graduation from Jewell. Still Scholars will be awarded an academic scholarship from A.T. Still University, Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine.</P>

<P/>

<P>William Jewell students may enroll in any major. Applications are available from the Premedical Advisory Program at Jewell and must be submitted to the Premedical Advisory Committee by April 1 of the sophomore year. Eligibility criteria for the program include a minimum of a B in all prerequisite courses for ATSU/KCOM and a minimum GPA of 3.4 overall and 3.4 in the sciences. A minimum of 75% of ATSU/KCOM’s prerequisites must be completed before beginning the Still Scholars Program.</P>

<P/>

<P>Selection will be based upon fulfillment of all academic and course requirements, commitment to osteopathic medicine, community service/leadership positions held and a successful interview at ATSU/ KCOM. All prescribed courses in the baccalaureate program of the applicant’s choice must be taken at William Jewell College. Any deviation from the required courses requires written approval from the William Jewell College Premedical Advisor and from ATSU/KCOM. Participants must complete graduation requirements for William Jewell College in the four years prior to matriculating to ATSU/KCOM. ATSU/ KCOM reserves the right, at any time, to reject a student deemed unsuitable for the program. In addition, acceptance will be withdrawn if application is made to another medical/osteopathic school, if an academic, ethical or moral violation occurs, or if a personal change in career choice is made.</P>

<P/>

<P/>

<P>The department offers one major, which leads to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. A maximum of 40 hours of psychological science courses may be applied toward graduation requirements. A grade of C- or higher is required in each course in the major. Students whose primary major leads to a Bachelor of Science degree and who wish to add psychological science as an additional major may follow the core requirements for the BS degree.</P>

<P/>

<P>The Major
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE</P>

<P>Introductory courses lay the groundwork for an understanding and overview of psychological science’s major areas. Higher-numbered courses typically delve into one or two key areas introduced in the entry course. The Capstone in Psychological Science returns to a unified and integrated perspective.</P>

<P/>

<P>Because a number of psychological science majors continue their education in graduate school, working toward masters’ or doctoral degrees, the department strives to prepare students for the rigors of graduate study. The psychological science curriculum strives to balance theoretical and practical dimensions by providing the opportunity for more specialized experiences through independent studies or internships. Students have the option of participating in a community mental health intervention program.</P>
