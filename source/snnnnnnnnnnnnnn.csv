43,2011Cornell,ENGL 2901 Utopia: From Thomas More to Philip K. Dick (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Mann. A “utopia” is an imaginary world, a fantastical “no-place” that conveys important truths about the real world. This course surveys the literary genre of utopia from the Renaissance to today, focusing on writers who invent new worlds through fiction. In Thomas More’s Utopia, we explore utopia’s emergence in the 16th century in response to European political upheaval and New World exploration, then turn to how British and American writers transform utopian visions in the following centuries. Finally, we consider how utopia is reworked in science fiction’s paradoxical emphasis on both fantasy and realism. Topics include the politics of gender, technology in a perfect society, and the wildly inventive forms of utopian fiction by Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, Jonathan Swift, Aldous Huxley, Ursula LeGuin, and Philip K. Dick."

Topics include multiple testing and closed testing (the cornerstone of multiple testing), family-wise error rate, false discovery rate (FDR) of Benjamini and Hochberg, and Storey’s papers relating to pFDR. Also discusses the shrinkage technique or the Empirical Bayes approach, equivalent to the BLUP in a random effect model, which is a powerful technique, taking advantage of a large number of populations. A related technique, which allows use of the same data to select and make inferences for the selected populations (or genes), is discussed. If time permits, there may be some lectures about permutation tests, bootstrapping, and QTL identification."
