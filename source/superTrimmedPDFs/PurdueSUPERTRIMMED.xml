You will soon see that every field in the College of Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind? What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels?

<P>ECON 36700 - Law And Economics </P>

<P> Credit Hours: 3.00.

<P>POL 33500 - China And The Challenges Of Globalization </P>

<P> Credit Hours: 3.00. Globalization is a very popular topic, resulting in a lot of loose and poorly thought-through talk and writing around the subject. The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the &quot;century of shame.&quot; Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! Typically offered Fall Spring Summer. </P>

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.
