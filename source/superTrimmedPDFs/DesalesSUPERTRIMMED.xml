<P>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION </P>

<P>Experiences in Schools </P>

<P>Candidates in the professional educator program participate in numerous observation and practice-based field experiences beginning in freshman year through the student teaching experience. Candidates should be prepared to complete a minimum of 170 clinical field hours before student teaching. Field experiences are conducted in public and nonpublic schools within a 20-mile driving distance of the University’s Center Valley campus. The purpose of the program is to further develop, demonstrate, and assess the competencies of the certification program, thereby preparing the candidate for student teaching and eventual full-time employment as a professional educator. The field program strives to develop sensitivity and culturally responsive attitudes in working with diverse student populations: races, genders, religious beliefs, national origins, and socio-economic backgrounds. All clinical field experiences and student teaching experiences will include field-based reports, evaluation, and feedback by cooperating teachers, University supervisors, and/or peers. See the Field Experiences Guide for Students for additional detail. </P>

<P>Legal Clearances: Requirements for Observation, Field Experiences, and Student Teaching </P>

<P>All students conducting observations or engaged in field experiences must obtain updated legal clearances before engaging in any fieldwork or entering schools.

<P>The Department of Nursing and Health adopts the Pennsylvania Nursing Articulation Model (1994) as the framework that guides its RN to BSN student articulation. Forty three-credit hour courses must be successfully completed to graduate from DeSales University with a BSN degree. Students who graduated from the nursing programs at community colleges must take a minimum of ten of these courses at DeSales University, with the option of taking the remaining courses at either DeSales University or their original community college as per preexisting articulation contracts between the University and these respective community colleges. All other RN to BSN students must take all remaining courses at DeSales University once they are accepted as DeSales University students. Students may be given transfer credit for alternative/elective courses only if the transfer of all analog courses has been approved. </P>

<P>RN to BSN General Progression Policies </P>

<P>All nursing (NU) courses with a required laboratory or clinical component must be completed at DeSales University. Didactic nursing courses, specifically NU 305 Therapeutic Nutrition, NU 310 Concepts of Professional Nursing Practice for RNs, and NU 325 Evidence-Based Nursing for RNs, are eligible for transfer consideration provided the courses were completed with a grade of “C+” or higher, were taken at an institution accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), and were completed within the last five years of the student’s matriculation into a DeSales BSN program. The BSN program’s prerequisite science courses are eligible for transfer consideration provided the courses adhere to the transfer policy detailed in Section 4 of the Undergraduate Catalog. </P>

<P>Required Nursing Courses: Phase I </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students are required to take the following nursing courses and attain a grade of C+ or higher. Courses equivalent in credits hours and content may be accepted for transfer: Nursing 305, 310, 315, 325, 441. </P>

<P>Any student who receives less than a C+ can repeat a maximum of one nursing course one time throughout their course of study. Failure of a nursing course is defined as any grade below the minimum progression requirement of C+. Failure of a second nursing course will result in dismissal from the program. </P>

<P>Nursing Credits by Advanced Course Validation </P>

<P>RN to BSN students will receive credit for ten courses for the following courses upon satisfactory completion of Phase I nursing courses. At that time, credits for analogous completion of these courses will be awarded and designated upon students’ transcripts without assigning a numeric grade equivalent: Nursing 205, 220, 230, 335, 340, 350, 365, 370, 430. </P>

<P>Required Nursing Courses: Phase II </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students will take the Phase II nursing courses after successfully completing Phase I nursing courses and receiving advanced nursing course validation. These students are required to take the following nursing courses and attain a grade of C+ or higher: NU 451, NU 456. Any student who receives less than a C+ can repeat a maximum of one nursing course one time throughout their course of study. Failure of a nursing course is defined as any grade below the minimum progression requirement of C+. Failure of a second nursing course will result in dismissal from the program. </P>

<P>Required Non-Nursing Courses </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students are required to take the following courses. Previously completed courses that are equivalent in credit hours and content may be accepted for transfer if they have been completed at an accredited college or university with a grade of C- or higher: CH 107, BI 252, TH 262, PL 109, PS 109, PS 240, MA 111, Humanities 3 and Humanities 4 Electives, Values Seminar Elective, and free electives (of 3 credits or more) as needed to fulfill the forty course requirement for graduation. </P>

<P>General Requirements </P>

<P>All RN to BSN students must satisfactorily meet all the health, background, drug, and clearance requirements outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog under the section “BSN Clinical Requirements;” all items must be satisfactorily met prior to taking any nursing course with a project component. All RN to BSN students must adhere to and abide by content in the RN-BSN/ MSN Nursing Student Handbook. Any deviation or failure to comply with the content may warrant dismissal from the nursing program. All RN to BSN students must abide by the nursing progression requirements outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time of acceptance into the nursing program. Additionally, students must meet all other graduation requirements outlined by DeSales as necessary to be awarded a bachelor’s degree. </P>

<P>Philosophy Major Program </P>

<P>Liberal arts education has traditionally placed strong emphasis on the importance of philosophical reflection for the formation of the human person. The philosophy program at DeSales University recognizes this fact and strongly promotes it. This program seeks to encourage the development of the intellectual and moral virtues, helping students not only to think clearly about reality and to know the greatest truths, but also to understand how to conform their practical activity to this knowledge; philosophy at DeSales regards the entire person in his or her humanity. This program is designed to enable students to see philosophy as a dialogue among persons seeking truth, and to promote personal participation in that search. The philosophical insights that result from this search should help students to discriminate and relate the different kinds of knowledge that make up the sum of human learning, and hence enable them to interpret their study of the sciences and the humanities in their significance for the human race. This training takes place within the Christian intellectual tradition and DeSales University’s dedication to Salesian spirituality and Christian Humanism. </P>

<P>The Division of Performing Arts offers a degree program in Theatre that presupposes the fact that the theatre does and will continue to exert a tremendous influence on the intellectual life and cultural development of civilization. In view of that presupposition, the goals of the department are to offer its majors the broadest knowledge of drama and the most valid experience of theatre that its resources will allow. </P>

<P>The division believes that the theoretical approach to theatre must be supplemented with practical experience. Therefore, theatre students are required to participate as actors and/or crew members for all productions of ACT 1 and participate in Studio Theatre productions (ACT 2). So that theatre students receive credit and evaluation for performance and crew work on ACT 1 productions, they must complete TR 361 and TR 362. (See entries corresponding to these course numbers.) </P>

<P>The program requires all students to take a group of courses that provide a broad based understanding of the major areas of theatre practice. The program also requires that each student, in consultation with his/her advisor, select one of the following tracks for specialized study: (1) acting for the stage and screen, </P>

<P>(2) musical theatre performance, (3) design/technology, and (4) communications-theatre. All programs lead to the Bachelor of Arts degree in theatre. </P>

<P>Admission into the theatre major is twofold. The applicant must be accepted by the University and must successfully audition and/or interview separately for the major. </P>
