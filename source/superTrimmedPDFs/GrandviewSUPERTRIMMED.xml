<P>GAME 201 Introduction to Theory of Play 3 credits </P>

<P>While games are often thought of as an entertainment medium, they are frequently more complicated than simple vehicles for enjoyment. This class explores the fundamental aspects of games as interactive play.

Offered Fall. </P>



<P>GAME 301 Theory of Play 3 credits </P>

<P>Moving beyond basic constructions of interactivity, games are about complex representational systems that seek to achieve particular rhetorical purposes. Games are &quot;affective&quot; in the sense that they move us towards actions in how they ask us to interact with them. They offer us information and data in procedural or ludic representations and open up the possibility of choice in relationship to that information. This class explores these relationships by building theoretical models of interaction that can serve as simulations or representations of experiences. In short, we will be making games. This class will not be about making digital games, though. Instead we will focus on refining our foundational knowledge of interactive mechanics and representational systems to make non-digital ludics.
