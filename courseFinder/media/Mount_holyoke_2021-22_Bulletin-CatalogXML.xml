The ﬁrst of the Seven Sisters —the female equivalent of the once predominantly male Ivy League —Mount Holyoke offered a rigorous program of study at a time when higher education for women was a revolutionary idea. The school quickly became synonymous with academic excellence and brilliant teaching and became a model for many other women’s colleges. In 1893, the seminary curriculum was phased out and the institution’s name was changed to Mount Holyoke College. </P><P>Today, Mount Holyoke is a highly selective, nondenominational, not-for-proﬁt, residential, independent, research liberal arts college for women that is gender-diverse and located in the Connecticut River Valley of western Massachusetts. The College’s approximately 2,200 undergraduate students hail from 50 states and 50 countries. Twenty-six percent of undergraduate students are international citizens. Twenty-ﬁve percent of domestic students identify as African American, Asian American, Latina, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Paciﬁc Islander, or multiracial. Its 212 continuing full-time and part-time instructional faculty are devoted to undergraduate teaching and cutting-edge research. Over half of the faculty are women; a quarter are individuals of color; over half speak a language other than English and over a quarter earned a degree from an institution abroad. With a student-faculty ratio of 9 to 1 and with most classes averaging 10-19 students, faculty and students collaborate closely on academic course work and research. </P><P>The College typically operates on a semester calendar, with an optional January Intersession offering to undergraduates opportunities for research, independent study, projects of students’ own choice, travel, internships, and study. </P><P>The College’s Professional and Graduate Education program offers graduate degree programs and non-degree opportunities for study at the graduate level. 121 graduate students are enrolled in master's degree programs; additional non-matriculated graduate students enroll in graduate-level courses throughout the year. Graduate programs follow the semester calendar, supplemented by a January term and a summer term comprised of two primary summer session periods. </P><P>Mary Lyon’s famous words—“Go where no one else will go, do what no one else will do”—continue to inspire the College’s students and its 38,200 living alumnae. By offering a distinctive combination of a rigorous liberal arts education, an unusually diverse and international community, a lifelong global network, and a legacy of educating leaders, Mount Holyoke is powerfully positioned to graduate women who will be successful and contribute to a better world. </P><Sect><H2>Seal of Mount Holyoke College </H2><P>On August 23, 1838, Mount Holyoke awarded certiﬁcates to its ﬁrst three graduates. A seal attached by a ribbon to the diploma bore a design that had been the subject of long and careful consideration by the Board of Trustees. Created by Orra White Hitchcock (wife of Edward Hitchcock, an original trustee of the College), the seal design depicted a centering cluster of palms, a palace in the background, and a block of stone in the </P><P>foreground. It cited the text of Psalms 144.12: “That our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace.” </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Mission of the College </H2><P>Mount Holyoke’s mission is to provide an intellectually adventurous education in the liberal arts and sciences through academic programs recognized internationally for their excellence and range; to draw students from all backgrounds into an exceptionally diverse and inclusive learning community with a highly accomplished, committed, and responsive faculty and staff; to continue building on the College’s historic legacy of leadership in the education of women; and to prepare students, through a liberal education integrating curriculum and careers, for lives of thoughtful, effective, and purposeful engagement in the world. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Accreditation </H2><P>Mount Holyoke College is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc., through its New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). This accreditation was approved in 2018 for continuation. </P><P>Inquiries regarding the accreditation status by the New England Association should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution. Individuals may also contact: New England Commission of Higher Education, New England Association of Schools and Colleges, 3 Burlington Woods Drive, Suite 100, Burlington, MA  01803-4514, email: <Link>cihe@neasc.org</Link>. </P><P>Mount Holyoke College is located in Western Massachusetts on the ancestral land of the Nonotuck people. It is also important to acknowledge the neighboring Indigenous nations who continue to be connected to this land: the Nipmuc and the Wampanoag to the East, the Mohegan and Pequot to the South, the Mohican to the West and the Abenaki to the North. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Facilities </H2><P>Mount Holyoke College’s 600-acre contiguous campus is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful in the nation with its neo-Gothic buildings, spacious greens, two small lakes, and a magniﬁcent tree canopy. It is home to more than 40 academic buildings and residence halls. The main campus is an arboretum with a diverse collection of trees and shrubs, while a nature preserve spans more than 300 acres and serves as a &quot;living lab&quot; for the community. </P><P>The College celebrated the grand opening of the College's new Community Center in Fall 2018, a $50-million expansion and enhancement of the Blanchard Campus Center. The Community Center features the Dining Commons, a 34,000-square-foot one-story addition which serves as the campus' centralized dining facility. Other components of the Community Center include a concert venue, a student art gallery, a student-life hub with ofﬁces for advising, residential life, student government, diversity programming, and religious life, a pub and grab-and-go store, and the Weissman Student Commons which serves as a base for Mount Holyoke's 100+ student organizations. </P><P>Sustainability is a top priority at Mount Holyoke College. The College has set a goal of carbon neutrality by 2037, the College's 200th anniversary. Mount Holyoke is committee to training the next generation of environmental leaders while also taking signiﬁcant measures to reduce its own carbon footprint, improve the sustainability of its campus operations and foster a campus culture of sustainability. The new Dining Commons presented a leap forward in sustainable operations </P><P>Full PDF </P><P>by consolidating six dining halls into one and featuring innovative energy-saving technologies and menus focused on locally-sourced food. The campus boasts ﬁve buildings certiﬁed through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program developed by the </P><P>U.S. Green Building Council; these include one of the nation's ﬁrst LEED-certiﬁed science centers, the new Dining Commons built to silver LEED standards, and our newest residence hall, opened in 2008, which was awarded a Gold LEED certiﬁcation. A photovoltaic array was installed on the Kendall Sports and Dance complex in November 2018 to generate approximately 6% of campus electricity use annually. An online database for faculty and staff research projects houses decades of student and faculty monitoring obtained from ﬁfteen permanent water sampling stations, ﬁve weather stations, and additional ecological ﬁeld sites across campus. </P><P>The Fimbel Maker &amp; Innovation Lab, begun as the Makerspace in 2015, moved into a completely renovated space in Prospect Hall in January 2019. The new 8,000-square-foot space provides a broad array of tools in teaching, collaboration and work spaces which students and faculty from across the curriculum can use in academic courses, workshops and events to explore the role of designing and making objects and other products, to test their ideas, and to bring them to life. The Fimbel Lab features 3D printers, a laser cutter, soldering stations, a vacuum former, a vinyl cutter, a wood- and metal-working shop, and other tools such as sewing machines. The physical space brings together people, resources, and tools to support hands-on curricular and co-curricular programming that feeds the expanding maker culture on campus from a central hub. </P><P>A $36-million expansion and renovation of Mount Holyoke’s science facilities was completed in 2003 to foster interdepartmental interaction, collaborative research, pedagogical innovation, and curricular planning. Students beneﬁt from hands-on work with sophisticated instrumentation often reserved for graduate students at other institutions. The equipment inventory includes a solar greenhouse, a state-of-the-art microscopy facility, two nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, a mass spectrometer, extensive molecular biology and genomics instruments, solar cell fabrication technology, a high-speed video system, an atomic force microscope and other instrumentation for characterization and fabrication of nanomaterials. </P><P>Other facilities at Mount Holyoke include a center for foreign language study, two theatres for theatre performances, a 250-seat auditorium for music performance, specialized computer labs, the 900-seat Abbey Chapel with its Interfaith Sanctuary, a meditation garden and teahouse, a facility offering child care and child study opportunities, and the Talcott Greenhouse, a 6,000-square-foot complex used for teaching, research, ornamental display, and plant propagation. </P><P>Mount Holyoke’s library has a physical library collection of more than 700,000 volumes. The library also licenses access to more than 200 scholarly research databases as well as thousands of ebooks and ejournals. In addition, it shares a catalog with other members of the Five College Consortium; the combined collections provide students and faculty with direct access to more than eight million volumes. The library also features several innovative multipurpose venues for collaboration, research, and technology support. </P><P>The Mount Holyoke College Art Museum is among the nation’s leading collegiate art museums, with a comprehensive permanent collection encompassing more than 24,000 works from antiquity to the present. The museum offers students work/study and internship opportunities, functions as a “cultural laboratory” for the campus and is actively </P><P>used in teaching by faculty and students, and brings to the community imaginative and diverse exhibitions that often attract signiﬁcant national media attention. </P><P>Kendall Sports and Dance Complex houses a swimming pool and a diving well, a gymnasium with basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts, a weight room and cardiovascular area, as well as a one-acre ﬁeld house with indoor track and tennis courts, squash courts, racquetball courts, and studios for dance, aerobics, yoga, and other activities. In 2007, the College completed construction of a new track and ﬁeld facility, featuring a multipurpose synthetic turf ﬁeld with lights, surrounded by an eight-lane track with a nine-lane straightaway. In 2009, two new dance studios, a renovated dance performance theater and a renovated and expanded ﬁtness center opened. In 2010, the College opened a new 4,750 square foot boathouse situated on the nearby Connecticut River. The equestrian center, one of the nation’s largest collegiate facilities, features a 69stall barn, two indoor arenas, an outdoor show ring, a full cross country course, and a regulation-size dressage ring. Outdoor cross-country courses for riders cut through 120 acres of woods, ﬁelds, and streams. The Orchards, Mount Holyoke’s 18-hole championship golf course, was designed by the legendary Donald Ross and was the site of the 2004 U.S. Women’s Open. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Statement of Nondiscrimination </H2><P>Mount Holyoke College is a women’s college that is gender diverse. The College is committed to providing equal access and opportunity in employment and education to all employees and students. In compliance with state and federal law, Mount Holyoke College does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, genetic information, sex, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, ancestry, veteran or military status, or any other legally protected status under federal, state or local law. </P><P>Undergraduate Learning Goals and Degree Requirements </P></Sect></Part><Part><Sect><H1>UNDERGRADUATE LEARNING GOALS AND DEGREE REQUIREMENTS </H1><Sect><H2 id="LinkTarget_84749">Overview </H2><P>The undergraduate degree Mount Holyoke confers is the bachelor of arts (A.B.) degree.

A normal schedule is four 4-credit courses per semester, each course meeting from one to four times a week. Toward the 128 credits required for graduation, a student may apply a maximum of: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>16 credits of independent study and honors work. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>12 credits earned from any combination of Mount Holyoke curricular support courses (CUSP) and Mount Holyoke, Five College, or transferred non-liberal arts courses, whether taken before or after the student’s matriculation at the College. </LBody></LI></L><P><Link>Transfer credit limits are detailed with other transfer information </Link>(<Link>p. 26) in the Academic Regulations section of the catalog. </Link></P><Sect><H4>Residency Credits and Semesters </H4><P>Sixty-four of the 128 credits must be taken while at Mount Holyoke during the sophomore, junior, and senior years. Also during those years, students must be registered at Mount Holyoke for a minimum of four semesters. No programs abroad or away from Mount Holyoke count toward the Residency requirement, including Mount Holyoke's own study abroad <Link>programs or exchange programs. Courses taken through the Five College </Link><Link>Interchange (p. 26) during Fall and Spring semesters while at Mount </Link>Holyoke do count towards the residency requirement. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Outside the Major Credits </H4><P>At least 68 credits of the 128 required for the degree must be in courses outside the student’s major ﬁeld of study unless the student elects and completes a second major, a Special (interdisciplinary individually-<Link>designed) major, or a designated interdisciplinary major (p. 10). </Link></P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Minimum G.P.A. </H2><P>Students must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00. <Link>Full details on the grading system and related options (p. 28) are </Link>found in the Academic Regulations section of the catalog. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>A First-Year Seminar </H2><P>All entering ﬁrst-year students must complete a First-Year Seminar in their ﬁrst semester at Mount Holyoke. Transfer students and Frances Perkins Scholars who enter with sophomore or junior standing are exempt from this requirement, although they may elect to take a First-Year Seminar particularly when one is offered at the 200-level in their entering semester. </P><P>The First-Year Seminar Program welcomes students to Mount Holyoke College, inviting them to join in the pleasure of an intellectually adventurous education in the liberal arts. In these small, discussion-based seminars, students work with faculty to achieve the ﬁrst Learning Goal of the Mount Holyoke curriculum, which will form the foundation for their education here: the ability to think analytically and critically by questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and articulating well-reasoned arguments. All ﬁrst-year seminars are writing-intensive. </P><P>First-year seminars do not meet other graduation requirements and must be approved courses at Mount Holyoke. They are all offered under the FYSEM subject designation. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Foreign Language, Ancient or Modern </H2><P>Each student must complete one course in a language other than English that has been designated to satisfy the College's Language requirement. </P><P>In the case of a student whose ﬁrst language is not English, an exemption may be granted by the dean of studies to those with at least one of the following: </P><Sect><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>documented attendance at a secondary school for at least one year at which instruction was conducted in a language other than English. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>documented attendance at a secondary school outside of the </LBody></LI></L><P>U.S. where the language of instruction was English, but the student elected a language or literature course taught in the student's native language. </P><P>• an O-level, A-level, or GSCE language result (for students from India, this would be a Grade X or Grade XII) or an ofﬁcial record of satisfactory completion of a college-level language or literature course in the student's native language. </P></Sect><P>A course used to fulﬁll the language requirement may not also be used to fulﬁll a distribution requirement (e.g. Humanities), though it may <Link>be applied to any other requirement. Further information about the </Link><Link>regulations on double-counting courses (p. 28) is available in the </Link>Academic Regulations chapter. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Multicultural Perspectives </H2><P>Each student must complete one 4-credit course designated as meeting the Multicultural Perspectives requirement.  Mount Holyoke’s </P><Sect><P>Undergraduate Learning Goals and Degree Requirements </P><P>Multicultural Perspectives Requirement encourages students to engage intellectually with the complexities of the world and its peoples. Multicultural Perspectives courses are devoted primarily to the study of some aspect of: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>the peoples of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East; or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>peoples of color in Australia, Europe, or North America; or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>peoples in North America whose primary  language is other than English. </LBody></LI></L><P>The course must incorporate a diversity of perspectives. </P><P>With the approval of the dean of studies, a course taken off-campus may be used to fulﬁll this requirement. </P><P>The course applied to satisfy the Multicultural Perspectives requirement <Link>may also count towards another graduation requirement. Further </Link><Link>information about the regulations on double-counting courses (p. 28) </Link>is available in the Academic Regulations chapter. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>The Distribution Requirements </H2><P>Every student must complete one designated course in each of these three curricular divisions: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Division I: Humanities </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Division II: Science and Mathematics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Division III: Social Sciences </LBody></LI></L><P>These courses must carry at least 4 credits within one semester and be designated as fulﬁlling the distribution requirement. </P><P>A course used by a student to fulﬁll any distribution requirement may not also be used to fulﬁll the language requirement, though it may be applied <Link>to any other requirement. Further information about the regulations </Link><Link>on double-counting courses (p. 28) is available in the Academic </Link>Regulations chapter. </P><P>Independent study (295 and 395 courses) will not satisfy any distribution requirement. </P><P>Students seeking to fulﬁll distribution requirements with courses taken at another institution must obtain approval from the appropriate <Link>department chair at Mount Holyoke on a permission form (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/sites/default/ﬁles/registrar/docs/permission.pdf</Link>). </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Physical Education </H2><P>Students must earn 4 physical education units. These are expected to be completed within the student’s ﬁrst four semesters at the College. </P><P>Students admitted as transfer students or as Frances Perkins Scholars need only complete 2 physical education units at Mount Holyoke, as they receive a waiver of the other 2 physical education units expected of all undergraduates. </P><P>Physical education units are not academic credits and do not count toward the 128 academic credits required to graduate.  Satisfactory completion of physical education units is noted on students' transcripts as an S grade followed by the number of physical education units earned, such as: S1, S2. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>The Major </H2><P>Every student must complete a major. Each student must declare their major in the sophomore year no later than the end of the eighth week of </P></Sect><P>classes of the second semester. At that time, with the help of a faculty advisor, the student will create a careful academic plan for the next two years. Students declaring Special (self-designed majors) have one additional year beyond the usual deadline to ﬁnalize their written plan, as noted below. A student may ﬁle a change of major request with the Registrar at any time, provided there is time to complete the program before graduation. </P><P>The major may be of any of these three types: </P><Sect><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Departmental Major. Departmental majors require at least 32 credits in the major ﬁeld, including a minimum of 8 credits in advanced work at the 300 level. Students with single departmental majors must also complete the “outside the major” requirement, so must complete at least 68 credits in course work outside their major ﬁeld of study. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Interdisciplinary Major. Interdisciplinary majors can be declared in the following areas of study: Africana studies, biochemistry, classics, critical social thought, data science, environmental studies, East Asian studies, international relations, Latin American studies, Middle Eastern studies, neuroscience and behavior, psychology and education, Romance languages and cultures, Russian and Eurasian studies, and South Asian studies. Interdisciplinary majors are structured enough to emphasize the central theme of a topic of study, but flexible enough to allow for a range of interest within a given topic. Their requirements include a minimum of 40 credits in the approved program. At least 12 credits must be at the 300 level, divided between two or more departments or programs. Students who declare one of these interdisciplinary majors or a special major automatically fulﬁll the “outside the major” requirement. Note: the majors in ancient studies, in gender studies, and in ﬁlm, media, theater are interdisciplinary in nature, but students in these majors do not automatically fulﬁll the “outside the major” requirement. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Special Major. Students whose interests cross department lines in an area for which no interdisciplinary major exists may plan a special major incorporating work in two or more departments. Students must work closely with faculty advisors to create a plan that is academically and educationally rigorous. A written plan must be submitted to and endorsed by two members of the faculty and the dean of studies. The plan must be submitted no later than the end of the eighth week of classes of the second semester of the student’s junior year. Students must earn a minimum of 40 credits in the approved program. At least 20 credits must be at the 300 level, divided between two or more departments. Students who declare a special major automatically fulﬁll the “outside the major” requirement. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><P><Link>Current majors offered by the College are included on the Areas of Study </Link><Link>list (p. 44). Regulations governing the double-counting of courses </Link>(<Link>p. 28) towards a major and any other degree requirements are </Link>available in the Academic Regulations chapter. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Additional Options </H2><P>In addition to their major, students may also elect -- but are not required -to complete any number (or none) of the following: </P><Sect><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>a second major or a minor (but not both a second major and a minor), </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>a Five College certiﬁcate, and/or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>a Nexus program. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><P>No course used to fulﬁll a requirement in a student’s major may also be used to fulﬁll a requirement of the student's minor, though a course may <Link>be applied to a minor and a certiﬁcate and/or a Nexus. See complete </Link></P><Sect><P><Link>details regarding double counting (p. 28) in the Academic Regulations </Link>section of the catalog. </P><P>The speciﬁc requirements of each minor, Nexus program, and certiﬁcate are detailed in this catalog. Current minors, Nexus programs, and <Link>certiﬁcates offered by the College are included on the Areas of Study list </Link>(<Link>p. 44). </Link></P><P>A student’s minor or certiﬁcate must be approved by a designated member or members of that department or program if any of the courses to be applied to it are done elsewhere, if it differs from requirements outlined in the catalog, or if the proposed minor department or program so speciﬁes. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Graduation </H2><Sect><H4>Awarding of Degrees </H4><P>Each candidate for graduation is personally responsible for obtaining clearance for graduation from the registrar. Also, all graduating students should be sure to meet all required ﬁnancial obligations to the College as prescribed by Student Financial Services, to ensure eligibility to receive Commencement tickets, their diplomas, and continued access to ofﬁcial transcripts. </P><P>Mount Holyoke College confers degrees three times per year: on dates in October, March, and during the annual Commencement ceremony in May. Students completing all degree requirements and having their degrees conferred in May, as well as those whose degrees were conferred the preceding October or March, are invited to participate in the May Commencement ceremony -- unless they had participated, through exception criteria, in the previous May's ceremony. </P><P>The exception criteria allow undergraduate seniors to apply to participate fully in Commencement exercises before their actual degree conferral if they have completed at least 120 credits towards the Mount Holyoke degree (108 if they had been a spring admit) and have a solid plan, approved by the Registrar, for completing their remaining requirements. There is a formal application process to apply for early participation in Commencement. Students interested in participating through this exception route in lieu of participating after they have completed all degree requirements should contact the Registrar's Ofﬁce in the winter of their senior year for application procedures. If approved, these students will robe, process into the Commencement ceremonies and sit with the graduating students, have their names called and cross the stage individually like the graduating students, though they will neither actually graduate on that date nor receive their diplomas. These students are then ineligible to participate at all in the following year's Commencement and Commencement weekend activities, since they participated the year before. </P><P>No student can participate in the Commencement ceremony or any degree conferral if they are currently suspended or withdrawn from the College. The only students eligible to participate in the May Commencement ceremony are those who have completed the degree requirements in May and are having their degrees conferred that day, those whose degrees were conferred the preceding October or March, and those ofﬁcially approved for early participation. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4>Honors </H4><P>The degree is awarded cum laude on the basis of a 3.50 cumulative average, magna cum laude on the basis of a 3.75 cumulative average, and summa cum laude on the basis of a 3.75 cumulative average and the completion of an exceptional honors thesis or project. Students </P></Sect><P>who complete a satisfactory honors thesis or project will receive the degree with honor in the department in which the thesis was completed. Students who complete an excellent honors thesis or project will receive their degree with high honor in the department in which the thesis was completed. Those who graduate summa cum laude or with high honor in their major department are called Mary Lyon Scholars. Students in approximately the top 15 percent of the class at the end of sophomore year (with two years of work at Mount Holyoke) are designated Sarah Williston Scholars. </P><P>Recognition of academic excellence may include election to the following honorary societies: Phi Beta Kappa for excellence in the liberal arts and sciences (the Mount Holyoke chapter was established in 1905); Sigma Iota Rho for scholarship and service in international relations; Sigma Pi Sigma for outstanding scholarship in Physics; Mu Sigma Rho, the national honor society for statistics, and Delta Phi Alpha for excellence in the study of German. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Graduation Rate </H4><P>As per Public Law 101–542, The Student Right to Know and Campus <Link>Security Act, graduation rate information is available from the Mount </Link><Link>Holyoke College Factbook (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/iresearch/ </Link><Link>factbook/</Link>) published by the Ofﬁce of Institutional Research. </P><Sect><P>Other Programs and Resources </P></Sect></Sect></Sect></Part><Part><H1>OTHER PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES </H1><P><Link>Other Degree and Certiﬁcate Programs (p. 12) </Link></P><P><Link>Special Programs and Resources (p. 15) </Link></P><P><Link>The Five College Consortium (p. 20) </Link></P><P><Link>Academic and Career Advising (p. 22) </Link></P><Sect><H2>Other Degree and CertiﬁcatePrograms </H2><P><Link>Other Undergraduate Degree Programs (p. 12) </Link></P><P><Link>Graduate Degree Programs (p. 12) </Link></P><P><Link>Certiﬁcate and Licensure Programs (p. 13) </Link></P><P><Link>Bachelor's/Master's Accelerated Programs (p. 13) </Link></P><P><Link>Nonmatriculated Students and Auditors (p. 14) </Link></P><Sect><H2>Other Undergraduate Degree Programs Dual-Degree Programs </H2><P>Mount Holyoke offers several undergraduate dual-degree opportunities described below.

For each of them, it is important to begin planning in the ﬁrst year. </P><P><Link>The Nexus in Engineering (p. 167) program is also offered, preparing </Link>science or math majors for future graduate work in engineering or employment in engineering-related ﬁelds. </P><P>For more information about the dual-degree engineering programs, contact Kathy Aidala (physics), Naomi Darling (architectural studies) Maria Gomez (chemistry), Audrey St. John (computer science), or Dylan <Link>Shepardson (mathematics), or visit the programs' website (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/engineering/dual_degree/</Link>). </P><Sect><H5>Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College </H5><P>Students who choose the Dartmouth program spend their junior year at Dartmouth College taking engineering courses. They return to Mount Holyoke for their senior year and earn their A.B. from Mount Holyoke. Following graduation, students spend an additional year at the Thayer School to be eligible to earn a bachelor’s of engineering (B.E.). Admission to the program is through both an internal Mount Holyoke application for the dual degree and a direct application to Thayer. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>California Institute of Technology (Caltech) </H5><P>Admission to Caltech is through its admission committee. Accepted students will spend their fourth and ﬁfth years at Caltech and, after successful completion of that program, will receive both a bachelor of science degree from Caltech and the bachelor of arts from Mount Holyoke. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>School of Engineering at UMass Amherst </H5><P>This program allows a Mount Holyoke student to earn a second bachelor’s degree, in engineering, to be awarded by the University of Massachusetts, in the year following graduation from Mount Holyoke. Students may major in chemical, civil and environmental, electrical, industrial, mechanical, or computer systems engineering. </P><P>Ordinarily, the student will spend the junior year at UMass, registered in the appropriate engineering courses through Five College cross-registration. After the fourth year at Mount Holyoke, the student will attend UMass for the ﬁfth year. The programs in computer and electrical engineering require three years at Mount Holyoke followed by two years at UMass. The program is administered by an advisory committee consisting of one member from each participating MHC science department, including mathematics/statistics, as well as a similar committee at UMass, consisting of one member from each participating engineering department. </P><P>A student pursuing the dual-degree program must have an MHC advisor from the committee and a UMass advisor no later than the fall of the sophomore year. In consultation with these advisors, the student maps out a plan of study for the sophomore, junior, senior, and postsenior years. The plan must satisfy all graduation requirements at both schools and be approved by both advisors. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>The Second Bachelor’s Degree </H4><P>Mount Holyoke welcomes students interested in earning a second bachelor’s degree. Candidates must submit an ofﬁcial college transcript with conferred degree veriﬁcation, an autobiographical essay, a proposed plan of study, and two letters of recommendation. </P><P>Candidates for a second bachelor’s degree are not eligible for ﬁnancial aid from Mount Holyoke College but may qualify for federal student loans. </P><P>Candidates seeking to earn a second bachelor’s degree must spend a minimum of four semesters at Mount Holyoke. They must earn a minimum of 64 Mount Holyoke academic credits (beyond their ﬁrst undergraduate degree), and complete College and distribution requirements, as well as the requirements of their declared major. </P><P>Applicants should contact the Ofﬁce of Admission for details about the application process. </P><P>Applications are accepted throughout the academic year. Two entrance dates are available: September and late January, with a preferred application deadline of March 1 for fall entrance and November 15 for spring. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Graduate Degree Programs </H2><Sect><H4>Master of Arts in Teaching </H4><P>Mount Holyoke, through its Professional and Graduate Education division, offers three different programs issuing a Master of Arts in Teaching <Link>degree: the Master of Arts in Teaching (p. 421) program referred to </Link><Link>as the &quot;M.A.T. program&quot;, the Master of Arts in Mathematics Teaching </Link>(<Link>p. 436) program referred to as the &quot;M.A.M.T program&quot;, and the Master </Link><Link>of Arts in Teacher Leadership (p. 440) program referred to as the </Link>&quot;M.A.T.L program&quot;. </P><P>The Committee on Graduate Work — consisting of the dean of studies and representatives from each program offering graduate work — approves thesis proposals and theses, adjudicates petitions for exceptions and waivers to the requirements, and reviews graduate </P><P>requirements and procedures, forms, fees, and stipends. Each program has a graduate advisor, appointed by the department. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Certiﬁcate and Licensure Programs Teacher Licensure Programs </H2><P>The teacher licensure programs at Mount Holyoke enable students to apply for a Massachusetts (and NASDTEC Interstate Contract) “initial” license. Undergraduate students may pursue licensure in the areas listed <Link>in Psychology and Education (p. 365). For additional information about </Link>undergraduate Mount Holyoke College Teacher Licensure Programs, <Link>please see the Teacher Licensure Programs page (p. 368) within </Link>Psychology and Education. </P><P><Link>The Master of Arts in Teaching (p. 421) (M.A.T.) allows graduate </Link>students to pursue initial teacher licensure as part of the program. Graduate students who wish to independently pursue additional <Link>license types can gain preparation through add-on licensure (p. 449) </Link>coursework. More information on the M.A.T. and special education are <Link>found in the Professional and Graduate Education chapter (p. 419). </Link></P><Sect><H4>International Visiting Student Program </H4><P>International students who wish to study in the United States for a period of one semester or one year may apply as an International Visiting Student. Attending Mount Holyoke as a non-degree-seeking student provides an excellent opportunity to explore a particular ﬁeld of study in depth, to explore a wide range of disciplines, and to become familiar with the United States and its educational system. </P><P><Link>For more information, visit the Admission website (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/admission/</Link>). </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Certiﬁcate for International Students </H4><P>Exchange students and international guest students who are enrolled in nondegree programs may select courses that will enable them to qualify for the Certiﬁcate for International Students. The program requires a minimum of one year in residence and a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for 20 credits of work. </P><P>Students may earn a certiﬁcate in general studies or in a particular ﬁeld, such as international relations or English. Students may choose a ﬁeld from any of the majors or minors offered at the College and may want to consult with their academic advisor or with the dean of international students about their course selections. </P><P>Students choosing to earn a certiﬁcate in a speciﬁc ﬁeld must complete at least 12 of 20 credits of graded course work in that ﬁeld with satisfactory academic standing. Students who complete their program of study with a cumulative average of 3.5 or better receive the certiﬁcate with distinction.

CBL enhances understanding of public concerns and fosters leadership, citizenship, organizing, and advocacy skills while advancing positive social change. CBL courses and independent studies bring together students, faculty, and area community organizations to work on projects that provide intellectually rigorous experiences for students and tangible beneﬁts for community partners. Working as interns with area organizations, CBL fellows work 8-10 hours/week to apply academic knowledge to concrete community challenges and offer creative solutions. CBL mentors support faculty teaching CBL courses by facilitating their community partnerships, monitoring ﬁeld sites and providing in-class support to students. Students also pursue CBL research projects as independent studies for credit, in partnership with </P><P>Special Programs and Resources </P><P>organizations and individuals in area communities. CBL fellows, mentors, and independent study/volunteer students enroll in concurrent CUSP-202 and CUSP-203 courses that facilitate reflective practice, collaboration, and networking, and build skills for community impact. </P><P>The CBL Program also manages the College's &quot;Off-Campus Work-Study" program, in which students may choose to work in a community service position in one of the College’s partner organizations in Holyoke, South Hadley, and the region. Eligible students must receive federal work-study funds as part of their ﬁnancial aid packages, and must have completed a semester of work-study in an on-campus position. </P><P><Link>See the CBL website at www.mtholyoke.edu/cbl (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/cbl/</Link>). </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Leadership and Public Service </H5><P>The Weissman Center sponsors the Leadership and Public Service (LAPS) program for students interested in being part of the solution to problems in the world, their countries, or their communities, by running for public ofﬁce, working for government at any level, or advocating for public policy. Inspired by the Women in Public Service Project, a collaboration of the U.S. State Department and the Sister Colleges, LAPS offers students experiential learning opportunities including internships in government ofﬁces and at national and state-based advocacy organizations; professional networking, site visits, and seminars on public policy in Washington, D.C. and other cities; an opportunity for non-partisan training to run for public ofﬁce or work on political campaigns; and a course in Leadership and Public Service that exposes students to a range of topics, skills, and accomplished professionals in the public service realm, as well as research and policy brief writing as a core course component. </P><P><Link>See the LAPS website at www.mtholyoke.edu/wcl/leadership-and-public</Link><Link>service (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/wcl/leadership-and-public-service/). </Link></P></Sect><Sect><H5>Speaking, Arguing, and Writing </H5><P>The Speaking, Arguing, and Writing Program (SAW) strives to empower students to be leaders who can think critically and creatively as well as to speak and write persuasively and effectively. SAW peer mentors partner with faculty in designated courses. SAW peer mentors also staff the SAW Center where they are available to students from across the disciplines for individual sessions. The SAW program offers campus-wide workshops; collaborates with other college ofﬁces to support writing, speaking, and leadership-related activities; offers a library of print resources and materials for students and faculty; and provides pedagogy resources for faculty. </P><P>In cooperation with the Department of English and embedded within SAW, the English Speakers of Other Languages program offers courses to support students who are multilingual or whose native language is not English, as well as individual or group-level support opportunities, and consultation for faculty.

Particular areas of emphasis include: inclusive teaching and advising practices with diverse students, technology-supported teaching innovations, and experiential learning. TLI's vision is to become a hub that brings the campus together around excellence in teaching, advising, and learning. A new faculty mentoring program is also supported in collaboration with the Dean of Faculty’s Ofﬁce. The TLI program administrative ofﬁce is in the Weissman Center for Leadership in Dwight Hall.

McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives </H4><P>We live in a world where capital and information cross national  borders at growing speed, where unprecedented human development and technological achievements exist hand-in-hand with abject poverty, deprivation, and inequality within and among countries, where unchecked economic growth is posing a growing threat to the environmental balance sustaining human livelihood, and where homogenizing global forces draw into sharper relief cross-national and cultural differences in understanding the world and its challenges. </P><P>A liberal arts education has to prepare students for these challenges of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Building on Mount Holyoke College’s long tradition of international engagement, the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives was founded in 2004 to unite Mount Holyoke’s wealth of international programs and people and advance a coherent vision for education for global competence and citizenship. Through its far-reaching initiatives, the center aims to weave engagement with a global world into the very fabric of a Mount Holyoke education. Some of the main initiatives are described below; more information is available at <Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/go/global (http://www.mtholyoke.edu/go/global/). </Link></P><Sect><H5>Engagement with Global Issues on Campus </H5><P>Many departments and programs are already offering courses which investigate — from their own disciplinary vantage points — different dimensions of globalization and ask questions whose scope reaches beyond national boundaries. The center complements these offerings with initiatives that explore global issues, their origins, and their legacies from cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and cross-national perspectives. </P><Sect><H5>Global Scholar-in-Residence Program </H5><P>The Carol Hoffmann Collins ’63 Global Scholar-in-Residence program brings to campus renowned international experts who engage the community in dialogue on important issues through public lectures, classes, and informal gatherings. Daniela Schwarzer was the 2018 Carol Hoffmann Collins Global Scholar-in-Residence. A former member of the executive team of the German Marshall Fund of the United Stated and opinion page editor for the ﬁnancial times, Dr. Schwarzer is the Otto Wolff Director of the Research Institute of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. Her focus was on the future of the European project, the end of the West, and global power shifts. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Biennial Conference on Global Challenges </H5><P>Each conference focuses on a speciﬁc global challenge, bringing together scholars and practitioners from around the world to analyze global challenges from cross-disciplinary and cross-national perspectives. The McCulloch Center also offers a team-taught 2-credit interdisciplinary course on the topic, leading up to the conference. </P><P>The course and conference in February 2018 was focused on &quot;Global and Local Inequalities: Social Change for Sustainable Communities." </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H5>Learning Experiences Abroad </H5><P>Learning abroad proves to be a transformative experience for many students. Immersion in another country and culture encourages students to understand the world through a different lens and to question their own assumptions and beliefs. The McCulloch Center aggressively expands learning opportunities abroad for all Mount Holyoke students, through traditional study abroad as well as summer internships and research and mentored independent projects. </P><Sect><H5>Study Abroad </H5><P>Each year about 200 Mount Holyoke students study for a semester or academic year at universities and programs around the world. Students may choose to study with a Mount Holyoke-sponsored or afﬁliated program or exchange, or with one of the 150 other programs that we approve in more than 50 countries. MHC currently offers programs and exchanges for full year or semester study in China, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Germany, and the UK, along with a summer program in China. </P><P>We expect each student to work closely with their faculty advisor in choosing the country and program that best ﬁt into their plan of study. The McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives facilitates the application and approval process so that students are assured of receiving credit upon the successful completion of their program of study abroad. Though most students study abroad as juniors, study abroad in the sophomore year, or even the fall of senior year, is possible and sometimes ﬁts better into a student’s overall program. </P><P>Mount Holyoke does not charge home school fees for study abroad. Except for Mount Holyoke’s own programs and exchanges, students pay program costs directly to their abroad university or program sponsor. Mount Holyoke charges an administrative fee of $900 per semester of study abroad. Eligible students may use federal and state loans and grants toward the cost of study abroad. Because the majority of programs abroad cost less than a semester or year at Mount Holyoke, many students ﬁnd that those resources, in addition to their family contribution, will be sufﬁcient to cover their costs. For students whose family contribution and federal/state aid are not sufﬁcient to cover the cost of study abroad, Mount Holyoke offers need-based Laurel Fellowships for for study on Mount Holyoke programs and exchanges as well as for approved programs and universities designated as &quot;Laurel Preferred.&quot; Eligible students who are selected for most of Mount Holyoke’s own programs and exchanges are guaranteed Laurel Fellowships, provided they apply by the deadline and meet all ﬁnancial and academic criteria. Mount Holyoke typically approves more than 95 percent of qualiﬁed applicants for Laurel Fellowship funding. For more information about study abroad programs, Laurel Fellowships, the <Link>application process, and deadlines, visit www.mtholyoke.edu/global/ </Link><Link>study_abroad (http://www.mtholyoke.edu/global/study_abroad/). </Link></P></Sect><Sect><H5>International Internships </H5><P>The McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives promotes opportunities for students to participate in international internships. The center maintains resources on experiential learning opportunities abroad and advises students on strategies for designing their own international internship. Additionally, the center sponsors the Mount Holyoke Connect-Global Internship Program (MHConnect Global), a network of funded internship opportunities available exclusively for Mount Holyoke College sophomores and juniors. Established through contacts of the Mount Holyoke community (alumnae, faculty, parents and friends of the College), </P><P>Full PDF 17 </P><P>these competitive internships provide students with unique connections and the opportunity to apply their analytical skills in a cross-cultural context. In the summer of 2019, 35 students were placed in MHC-IIP internships in 11 countries, including through internship &quot;hubs&quot; in Costa Rica and Ghana, while the McCulloch Center supported numerous other students for international self-designed internships, faculty-mentored research, and creative projects. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Global Competence Award </H5><P>The McCulloch Center offers a Global Competence Award to graduating seniors who have demonstrated signiﬁcant achievements in learning another language, cultural immersion, global perspective taking and cross-cultural learning. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Social Innovation Initiative </H5><P>The McCulloch Center provides support, mentorship, and seed funding to student innovators who are developing and implementing projects to address some of the world’s most vexing challenges. It advances this agenda in collaboration with multiple units across campus, most importantly Entrepreneurship, Organizations, and Society. Under the Social Innovation Initiative (SI2), students advance projects that are grounded in the community, informed by the curriculum, and build student capacity for “effective and purposeful engagement in the world” </P><P>– chiefly in the ﬁelds of education, environment and climate change, peace and human rights, poverty alleviation, and public health. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H5>International Diversity on Campus </H5><P>Mount Holyoke College boasts a uniquely diverse international faculty and student body, which provides a powerful setting for education for global citizenship, in and out of the classroom, on a personal and intellectual level. For more than 175 years, Mount Holyoke College has attracted students from many backgrounds and cultures. Currently, over 600 international students from over 70 countries attend Mount Holyoke. Most are studying toward a bachelor’s degree and enter as ﬁrst-year, transfer, or Frances Perkins students. The McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives provides orientation, advising, special programming, and information about immigration regulations to international students. The center also administers a special program for students who are selected to spend a year at the College as international exchange students or international guest students. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>The Leslie Miller and Richard Worley Center for the Environment </H4><P>The Miller Worley Center for the Environment (formerly the Center for Environmental Literacy) was established in 1998 with the goal of making environmental literacy a central part of Mount Holyoke students’ education through the use of the campus as a natural laboratory. In 2010, in recognition of a generous gift from Leslie Miller and Richard Worley, the Center was renamed the Leslie Miller and Richard Worley Center for the Environment. </P><P>The Center for the Environment prepares students to think critically, creatively, and globally — to tackle the worlds’ most complex issues as environmental leaders. It advances a culture of sustainability and justice on campus and beyond through community building, programming that encourages environmental literacy, and opportunities for sustainable action and leadership in service of all generations. Situated within a world-class liberal arts college on an exceptional landscape in the heart of western Massachusetts, the Center promotes an inclusive, just, equitable, and anti-racist campus and society in all its programs. </P><P>Special Programs and Resources </P><Sect><H5>Sustainability </H5><P>The Miller Worley Center encourages students to understand and study the connection between sustainability on campus and local and global communities — both in terms of the people moving through the institution and the resources it consumes. Mount Holyoke aims to foster a healthy environment with equitable distribution of resources by reducing the impact of human activity, implementing ethical economic development and promoting social justice. Recognizing that climate change is threatening people and ecosystems around the globe, and that without intervention, that impact will continue to escalate, the College has set a goal of Carbon Neutrality by 2037, the College’s 200th anniversary. As an educational institution, Mount Holyoke is in a position to lead by educating students and the broader community on the science of climate change, as well as on the political, economic and social factors influencing it. The Miller Worley Center works across the College to advance sustainability as a core value in all aspects of the campus, including academic programs and research, campus planning and operations, co-curricular student opportunities, and engagement with the local community. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>The Campus as Living Laboratory </H5><P>The Miller Worley Center manages Mount Holyoke’s Campus Living Laboratory. Inspired by a diversity of ecosystems and a culture of sustainability, the living laboratory transforms Mount Holyoke’s natural and built landscape into an exciting destination for hands-on, multidisciplinary undergraduate research and teaching. More than 300 acres of Mount Holyoke’s 800-acre campus are an undeveloped nature preserve — of reservoirs, streams, forests, marshes, shrub wetlands, forested wetlands, pastures, meadows and vernal pools. This remarkable diversity of environments exists in close proximity to areas of rapid development, providing Mount Holyoke students with opportunities to study a variety of ecological processes and their responses to human activities. </P><P>For decades, the Center has maintained several long-term water, climate and forest monitoring systems and routinely collects data on the rich array of environmental phenomena that occur in the College’s undeveloped and built environments. These datasets are stored online in the College’s Institutional Data Archive and are made publicly available. Various science courses use the datasets to study subjects ranging from weather and water quality to forest succession, biodiversity and community structure. Students can also use the Center’s data for their own independent research projects. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Internships and Grant Funding for Environmental Study </H5><P>The Miller Worley Center offers curated internships and grant funding that provide students opportunities to explore environmental issues across disciplines, communities, cultures and landscapes while developing career skills and professional contacts. Miller Worley internships focus on topics from biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration to energy efﬁciency and sustainable agriculture, and the Center partners with a diverse group of local and national organizations to provide students both local and global opportunities. Grant funding enables students to travel to conferences, embark on environmental research projects, and promote campus sustainability initiatives. (Faculty curriculum development grants are also available through the Miller Worley Center.) Students are encouraged to integrate their Miller Worley curated internships and grant-funded opportunities with their academic coursework. Frequent collaboration with Mount Holyoke academic departments, programs, and centers, including <Link>the Nexus: Curriculum to Career (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/ </Link><Link>nexus/</Link>) program, the Weissman Center’<Link>s Community-based Learning </Link>(<Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/cbl/</Link>) program and the McCulloch </P><P>Center’<Link>s Global/Local Fellowship (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/global/ </Link><Link>internships/global_local/</Link>) program, provides students well-rounded and interdisciplinary co-curricular experiences. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Environmental Awareness within the Community </H5><P>Outside the classroom, the Miller Worley Center works to increase environmental awareness within the community at large. Each semester, the center presents lectures on important environmental issues. Recent guest speakers have included Robert Musil, President and CEO of the Rachel Carson Council; Shaughnessy Naughton, chemist, science advocate, and former Congressional aide; and Sarah duPont, founder of the Amazon Aid Foundation. The Center also organizes alumnae career panels and environmental ﬁlm festivals. </P><P>The Miller Worley Center for the Environment is located in Dwight <Link>Hall, 2nd Floor.

LITS endeavors to support students of all backgrounds, to help them thrive in their academic and co-curricular goals. </P><P>LITS represents both a physical place and virtual gateway to information and technology resources critical for student success, providing access to the physical library collection of more than 700,000 volumes, direct access to the eight million volumes in the Five College library system, as well as a global library network at their ﬁngertips. Complementing the physical library collection is a rich selection of digital information sources, such as art images, electronic books and journals, streaming video, and music. Students also have access to archival records, manuscripts, and rare books housed in our Archives and Special Collections, encouraging active engagement with primary sources. </P><P>Teaching and learning happen in classrooms, enhanced through connections with the Five Colleges, community practitioners, and experts around the world. Faculty use Moodle (MHC’s learning management system) to facilitate sharing of course materials and to foster discussions outside of the classroom. Student research and technology support is offered through course-integrated instruction, consultations, and personalized assistance. </P><P>Computer labs across campus offer students high-end technology. Students may also borrow a wide range of equipment, such as laptops, video/DSLR cameras, and projectors. To protect student computers and the campus network, the College provides antivirus software to all students. LITS staff assist faculty, staff, and students with computer and technology issues that may arise. </P><P>The LITS complex includes many places to study and work, outﬁtted with comfortable furniture, quiet nooks, places to meet, and the library’s coffee shop, the Frances Perk. </P><P><Link>Please visit the LITS website for more information: lits.mtholyoke.edu </Link>(<Link>http://lits.mtholyoke.edu/</Link>). </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Internships and The Lynk </H2><P>A central goal of Mount Holyoke’s The Lynk initiative is to ensure that each MHC student has the opportunity to explore her career interests, gain practical experience and begin to develop a professional network through a summer internship. </P><P>Students can ﬁnd internships through Mount Holyoke College internship programs, existing job postings with external employers, or develop their own internship opportunity by contacting an organization and offering to work as an intern. </P><P>The Career Development Center and other Academic Centers like the Miller Worley Center for the Environment and the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives supports preparation for internships in the United States and abroad through individual advising, workshops, networking and other opportunities. </P><P>Mount Holyoke supports qualiﬁed, substantive, supervised opportunities and emphasizes the connection between the liberal arts and career and personal development. </P><P>Credit for internships is granted if a student enrolls in independent study as a practicum associated with the internship (295P or 395P. See <Link>Independent Study (p. 19) later in this chapter). A student can also </Link>receive credit in a department capstone or in the post-internship class COLL-211. Many students also present publicly on their internship at Mount Holyoke’s LEAP (Learning through Application) Symposium or present research done in their internship in department poster sessions, at Five College conferences, or at the Senior Symposium. </P><P>Mount Holyoke provides funding for sophomores and juniors to pursue unpaid or low paid internship and research opportunities through The Lynk Universal Application Funding (UAF) program. More information <Link>about The Lynk is available in the advising chapter (p. 22) and The </Link><Link>Lynk website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/lynk/). </Link></P></Sect><Sect><H2>Other Special Programs and Resources </H2><P>Foreign Languages at Mount Holyoke College </P><P>Encouraging Mount Holyoke students to become proﬁcient in languages other than English is an essential part of the College’s goal of fostering engaged, global citizenship, both abroad and in the U.S. At Mount Holyoke, language learners become educated speakers of languages other than English with deep translingual and transcultural competence, so that they can understand and participate in our interconnected world and compete in the ever-changing global job market. As part of its Living Learning Communities initiative, the College offers students the opportunity to live in a community of students that promotes a supportive and congenial environment of language immersion for its residents. The languages for the 2021-22 academic year Living Learning Communities are Chinese (Mandarin), Italian, German, and French. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Domestic Study Away </H4><P>Mount Holyoke offers its own Mount Holyoke Semester in D.C. program for eligible students who wish to spend a semester in Washington D.C. Further information about this program is available below or from Janet Lansberry in the Weissman Center for Leadership. </P><P>Other students may apply for academic leave from Mount Holyoke College to pursue up to two semesters (full-time equivalency) of study at any of the College's other approved domestic study away programs listed below or at another accredited U.S. institution as a visiting student.

Moving beyond the textbook toward practical application, hands-on research, and personal experience, SEA Semester® prepares students to take a more active role in solving today’s environmental problems. Several semester-long options in different regions around the globe are offered. While the academic focus varies, each program offers an interconnected suite of courses designed to explore a speciﬁc ocean-related theme using a cross-disciplinary approach. </P><P>The Five College Consortium </P></Sect><Sect><H5>MHC Semester in D.C. </H5><P>The MHC Semester in D.C. program combines an intensive internship with rigorous coursework in government, policy, advocacy, and related ﬁelds. This program is available to both juniors and seniors to spend the Fall semester in the nation’s capital at top-ranked American University <Link>in its Washington Semester Program (https://www.american.edu/ </Link><Link>spexs/washingtonsemester/</Link>), studying alongside ambitious and diverse students from the United States and beyond. Much of each students' work will center around an internship they arrange requiring three to four days of internship work per week. In addition to that intensive work experience, students enroll in a total of 13 credits, completing: two multidisciplinary seminars (8 credits total) taught by American University faculty and Washington area experts, a 4-credit independent study taught by the Mount Holyoke faculty director for MHC Semester in D.C., and a 1-credit internship course. For details of the application process and <Link>deadline, see the program's website at https://www.mtholyoke.edu/wcl/ </Link><Link>mhc-semester-dc (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/wcl/mhc-semester-dc/). </Link></P><P>The per-student cost for a semester in this program for fall 2021 will be the same as if attending Mount Holyoke College. </P><P>MHC Semester in D.C. program participants will be able to use most outside aid, including federal direct student loans, parent loans, Pell grants, some state aid, and outside scholarships. Please note: federal work-study and Mount Holyoke aid will not be applicable. This includes need-based aid, leadership awards, other merit awards, town grants, tuition assistance grants and employment-based aid such as tuition exchange. For those selected to participate in the program, MHC Semester in D.C. consults with the Student Financial Services ofﬁces to develop a ﬁnancial package appropriate to each student based on need and the ﬁnancial offer they receive. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Intersession </H4><P>Intersession, sometimes referred to as January Term, is an optional period for undergraduates in January during which they may pursue independent research with a faculty member, apply to take a graduate-level credit-bearing course through Mount Holyoke’s Professional and Graduate Education (PaGE) program, or explore new interests through nonacademic courses and workshops. Many students use this period as an opportunity to travel, participate in an extensive two- to three-week internship off campus, work, take a short-term course for transfer credits, or relax at home. </P><P>Housing and meals for Intersession are only available to eligible students who apply in advance to the Ofﬁce of Residential Life and are approved. Qualiﬁcation criteria include participating in an approved activity such as undertaking a PaGE course, a Five College course, an independent study with a faculty member, a required athletic commitment, off-campus or on-campus employment, or being an international student. Applications due to hardship are also considered. </P><P>Students who completed their degrees at Mount Holyoke at the end of the fall semester, students going on a spring semester leave, or students returning from a fall semester leave are not eligible for Intersession housing or meals. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Independent Study </H4><P>Mount Holyoke values independent-minded students who seek to develop and pursue a course of study that satisﬁes a particular intellectual curiosity. Projects may range from independent research in areas as diverse as protein folding, copyright law, rural development, literary </P><P>analysis, and second language acquisition to original compositions in music, sculpture, and ﬁction. </P><P>All requests to undertake independent study are rigorously assessed and must be approved by the student’s independent study faculty advisor. </P><P>A maximum of 16 credits of independent study and honors work may be used toward the 128 credits required for graduation. A maximum total of 8 credits of independent study may be elected in the sophomore and junior years. </P><P>Independent work with a practicum component in a professional or volunteer setting, and a substantial academic component supervised by a Mount Holyoke faculty member, may be designated 295P (Practicum) or 395P (Practicum). When the practicum takes place during the summer or January, the bulk of the credit-bearing work will normally take place during the following semester. Practicum designation ordinarily requires consultation with a faculty member prior to commencement of the practicum. Independent work with a practicum component is governed by the same policies as all other independent work. </P><P>Courses with practicum components bearing the word Practicum in their title may qualify international students with an F-1 visa for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). Students seeking CPT should contact the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Honors Thesis </H4><P>During the senior year, qualiﬁed students can elect to write an honors thesis based on research and in-depth study of a particular subject. Ordinarily, students write an honors thesis in their major department. A student may write an honors thesis in another ﬁeld with the approval of that department and the dean of studies. To qualify to write an honors thesis, a student must have maintained a cumulative average of 3.00 in College work or a 3.00 average in the major ﬁeld prior to the senior year. The thesis must be approved by the department concerned. Students who write an honors thesis must earn at least 8 credits in independent study (or an alternative course sequence pre-approved by both the department and the Academic Administrative Board) over two semesters. </P><P>An honors thesis or project that does not culminate in a recommendation for a degree with honor is recorded on the transcript as independent study. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2 id="LinkTarget_84753">The Five College Consortium About the Consortium </H2><P>The Five College consortium recently celebrated its 50th anniversary of collaboration, one of the country’s most successful academic consortia. Through Mount Holyoke’s participation in the consortium, Mount Holyoke students can take advantage of opportunities at three other outstanding colleges (Amherst, Smith, and Hampshire) and a major research university (the University of Massachusetts at Amherst). </P><Sect><H2>The Five College Interchange </H2><P>Students in good academic standing may take eligible courses for credit at any of the other four institutions during the fall and spring semesters at no additional tuition cost, through the Five College Interchange. Normally, students may start taking courses at the other campuses after the ﬁrst semester of their ﬁrst year. Courses need to be beneﬁcial to an overall academic plan and must be approved by an advisor. <Link>Explore the courses offered through the other campuses (http:// </Link><Link>www.ﬁvecolleges.edu/sites/courses/</Link>). To enroll in a course at one of the </P><P>other campuses, students complete registration procedures through the Mount Holyoke College registrar.

The Center also offers courses in Spoken Arabic dialects for students who have learned Modern Standard Arabic in the classroom. The Center encourages students to embark on language study during their ﬁrst year of college so that they can achieve the fluency needed to use the language for work in their major ﬁeld. </P><P>Each language offered by the Center is available in one of three course formats depending upon the resources available for that language. Mentored courses provide the highest level of structured support for learning and cover all four primary language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). Independent Plus courses focus on speaking and listening skills, plus the development of basic literacy in the language. Supervised Independent courses focus only on oral skills and rely on more independently organized learning than the other course formats. </P><P>All courses emphasize development of oral proﬁciency through weekly conversation practice sessions. Conversation sessions focus on using the language in the types of situations one might encounter in everyday life. Students commonly engage in role plays, question and answer activities, description, narration, and problem-solving exercises. More advanced students practice expressing opinions, giving reasons in arguments, and discussing current events and cultural issues. </P><P>A standard course through the Center is a half course. Half courses require one hour a day (seven hours per week) of individual study plus weekly conversation and/or tutorial sessions. It takes four half courses (levels I, II, III, and IV) to complete the equivalent of one year of study in a traditional elementary-level classroom course. Some languages offered in the Mentored format are also available as full courses allowing students to progress at the same rate as in traditional classroom courses. Full courses require two hours per day (14 hours per week) of individual study plus conversation and tutorial sessions. </P><P>Students interested in studying a language through the Center should read the informational websites thoroughly and follow the application instructions. While the application process is handled by the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages, the tutorial and conversation sessions are held on all ﬁve campuses. </P><P>Academic and Career Advising </P><P><Link>For program information and application forms, go to http:// </Link><Link>ﬁvecolleges.edu/fclang</Link> (<Link>http://ﬁvecolleges.edu/fclang/</Link>).

The individual sessions allow each student to get help with his/her particular questions and concerns. The language mentor goes over written homework, explains grammatical concepts, and engages the student in skill-building activities. Language mentors also work with students who are already fluent speakers of a language but who need to learn to read and write in the language. </P><P>Currently offered in Mentored format: </P><P>• American Sign Languages (upper-level courses), Hindi, Persian, Swahili, Turkish </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Independent Plus Courses </H4><P>Students in Independent Plus courses have a modiﬁed version of the weekly individual tutorial that involves a one-on-one meeting with a peer-tutor who is a well-educated native speaker of the language.

Starting from their ﬁrst year, students are encouraged to connect their academic interests with cocurricular learning opportunities. The Lynk is Mount Holyoke’s signature approach to connecting curriculum to career. The Lynk connects each Mount Holyoke student’s academic work with practical applications of the liberal arts and sciences. Each student’s Lynk experience is unique, reflecting the student's values and aspirations. Through rigorous coursework, advising, alum mentoring, professional development, and experiential learning on and off campus, students are empowered to achieve their immediate goals while being equipped to navigate a lifetime of career opportunities and challenges. </P><P>At the Lynk's core are intentional reflection and assessment, tools for discerning students' interests and developing long-term goals. From their ﬁrst semester to their last, students are challenged to think critically about ideas and events while reflecting upon them intellectually and personally. They work closely with faculty, staff, and peer advisors on honing their ability to assess and translate knowledge. </P><P>The Lynk facilitates shared experiences such as industry site visits and a wide range of pre-professional and job skills workshops — while also connecting students to thousands of accomplished alums who open <Link>doors for each other. See internships (p. 22) and The Lynk website </Link>(<Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/lynk/</Link>) for further information. </P><Sect><H4>Lynk Resources </H4><P>Rather than follow a prescribed program, students shape their own Lynk experience with a number of resources the College makes available: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Integrated advising with faculty, staff, and peer mentors from the ﬁrst semester to graduation. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>First-year seminar program introducing students to the academic and intellectual life of the College. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>The Academic Centers at Mount Holyoke which empower students to become agents of change. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Living-learning communities fostering higher levels of academic self-conﬁdence and increased involvement. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Study abroad offering a powerful experience to advance a student’s academics and build global competence. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Career Development Center where students learn to map their unique paths to success. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Sophomore Institute, a conference introducing and building professional career skills. </LBody></LI></L><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Universal Application Funding guaranteed for all students for a domestic or international summer internship or research experience ($3,000 for domestic; $3,600 for international). </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>COLL-211 course connecting learning in the world, learning on campus, and taking action. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Learning from Application (LEAP) symposium, for students completing summer internships. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Nexus, offering nine tracks that enable students to link their liberal arts education with their career goals. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Alum networking events connecting the global Mount Holyoke community on campus and off. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Community-Based Learning linking students with communities and combining learning and analysis with action and social change. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Industry and ﬁeld site visits through Lynk on the Road and Career Development Center trips. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Senior Symposium presentations showcasing intellectual passions, independent projects, and scholarly research. </LBody></LI></L><P><Link>For more information, consult The Lynk website (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/lynk/</Link>). </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Academic Advising </H2><P>All ﬁrst-year students and sophomores are assigned a faculty advisor who offers guidance about everything from course selection to meeting requirements and planning a major. The College’s Orientation program and the Class Dean for New Students offer supplementary programming to introduce all ﬁrst-year students to the academic life of the College. </P><P>Midway through the second semester of their sophomore year, students declare their major. From that point on, they work with a faculty advisor in their major or interdisciplinary department. Students who pursue a special major work with a faculty committee of advisors. In addition to offering advice about the major, advisors offer valuable counsel about Five College study, other off-campus study options, and preparation for graduate and professional school. Each academic department or program also identiﬁes one or more student departmental liaisons who are helpful peer academic resources to students interested or already majoring in that ﬁeld. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Career Advising </H2><P>The Career Development Center (CDC) offers a variety of career exploration, networking, internship, and job search services as well as prelaw advising. These programs and services are designed to assist students in connecting their education in the liberal arts with long-term success in the professional world, preparing students to navigate future career transitions as well as the internship and job searches they conduct while at the College. </P><P>The CDC provides individual career advising to all students throughout each stage of the career development process, from self-assessment and information gathering to exploration and decision making. The CDC maintains a helpful career resource library and a variety of online information sources. </P><P>Students are encouraged to explore career options and gain experience in areas of interest through internship and research opportunities. Funding is available to students for unpaid summer internships and research experiences through the Lynk Summer Funding Program. To be eligible for Lynk funding, students must follow the published policies and deadlines. </P><P>Full PDF 23 </P><P>Within the CDC, students will ﬁnd the student employment ofﬁce, which serves as a clearinghouse for all on-campus jobs for students and local part-time jobs. The student employment ofﬁce also serves as a resource to students and supervisors in making on-campus employment a valuable learning experience. Student employees are encouraged <Link>to familiarize themselves with the College's Code of Ethical Conduct </Link>(<Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/policies/code-ethical-conduct/</Link>) which identiﬁes principles, policies, and laws that govern the activities of the college and identiﬁes expectations for every member of the community who conducts business on behalf of the College regarding proper professional and ethical conduct that reflects the College’s values. </P><P>In addition, the CDC fosters connections with professionals in a wide variety of ﬁelds in order to provide opportunites and to support students in developing professional networks. The CDC’s recruiting program facilitates access to hundreds of employers through its on-line job search and on-campus recruiting programs. Recruiting programs include interviews, information sessions, and job fairs on-campus and with Five College institutions as well as other consortia. Students also have opportunities to connect with alums and professionals in a variety of ﬁelds through on-campus programming and off-campus site visits. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Pre-Medical and Pre-Health Advising </H2><P>Pre-health advising is available to all interested students, primarily through the Ofﬁce of Pre-Health Programs. </P><P>The Pre-Health Programs Ofﬁce and the faculty Chair of the Committee on the Health Professions cosponsor information sessions early every fall semester for students interested in learning about careers in the health professions and the advising system that is available. A robust schedule of programming offered throughout  the year includes workshops, information sessions and alum panels, and visits by admission staff from health professions programs throughout the country. </P><P>Pre-Health advising is available beginning in the ﬁrst semester, primarily through the Ofﬁce of Pre-Health Programs. Faculty members from the Committee on the Health Professions are also available to assist with aspects of identifying and preparing for a career in the health professions. Often, Committee members are the professors teaching the science courses which are prerequisites to health careers. As students enter the application process, typically in the spring of the junior or senior year, each student should plan to ask a member of the Committee, or any other faculty member who knows the student’s work well enough, to serve as the author of the Committee’s letter of Recommendation. The Committee’s letter is a composite letter of recommendation, a comprehensive summary of all aspects of the student's preparation, including coursework, internships, research, entrance exam scores, and comments contained in the student's individual recommendation letters. The Committee also conducts a practice interview of the student. </P><P>All students who are applying to post-graduate programs in the health professions should formally declare their intentions to the Committee no later than March 31 of the year in which they are planning to begin their application. Students declare their intent by completing a preapplication packet, available at the Pre-Health Programs ofﬁce. This packet is intended to help optimize the student’s efforts in completing an application that will be successful, and to aid the committee in supporting the student’s application. Students who fail to submit a preapplication packet by the deadline may not receive the full support of the committee. </P><P>Academic and Career Advising </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Engineering Advising </H2><P>Students interested in pursuing a career in engineering should contact a member of the Committee on Engineering as soon as possible after arriving on campus. The College offers three dual-degree programs (see<Link>Other Degree and Certiﬁcate Programs (p. 15) for details) for </Link>students interested in earning an undergraduate degree in engineering as well as their Bachelor of Arts from Mount Holyoke. These programs all have a large number of required courses, so it is in a student’s best interest to take both a math and a physics course in each of the ﬁrst three semesters. </P><P>The Nexus in Engineering program offers an alternative route to prepare for future graduate work in engineering or employment in engineering-related ﬁelds. Students should consult with a Nexus advisor in planning their courses and the summer internship in the ﬁeld of engineering which the Nexus requires. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Graduate School Advising </H2><P>Throughout the academic year, faculty advise students about graduate study in speciﬁc ﬁelds and about ways to meet graduate admission requirements. Students can also receive guidance about researching graduate programs, preparing application materials, ﬁnancing graduate study, and readying themselves for entrance examinations by consulting with an advisor in the Career Development Center. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Competitive Fellowships and ScholarshipsAdvising </H2><P>Fellowships at Mount Holyoke (FMH) offers developmental and progressive advising to students of promise intent on furthering their academic and aspirational goals by competing for nationally and internationally prestigious, merit-based awards. Fellowship advising begins early in a student’s college career with a focused intake interview that emphasizes goal-setting and self-reflection. FMH recruits explore competitions aligned with their aspirations, prioritize strategic attributes that will develop their competitive edge, and work through a talking-and-writing program to establish a feasible and viable candidacy. </P><P>For a school of its size, Mount Holyoke has won a signiﬁcant number of top national and international fellowships and scholarships, including Fulbright, Goldwater, Boren, Beinecke, Churchill, Gates Cambridge, and Truman awards. While demonstrating Mount Holyoke students’ high abilities, the large number of awards also reflects the College’s exceptional support system for students who apply. Eligible students receive extensive support and guidance from the National Fellowships Advisor, the Committee on Fellowships, and mentoring staff and faculty. </P></Sect></Sect></Part><Part><H1>ACADEMIC REGULATIONS </H1><P id="LinkTarget_84755">Mount Holyoke students are expected to be fully acquainted with the policies affecting their academic and nonacademic lives on campus. Policies are published in this Bulletin, the Student Handbook, and in Faculty Legislation. New policies are published on the College’s website. </P><Sect><H2>Academic Responsibility </H2><P>The decision to join this academic community requires acceptance of special rights and responsibilities that are essential for its effective <Link>functioning and the realization of its mission (p. 6). </Link></P><P>All members of the community share the responsibility to uphold the highest standards of academic and personal integrity, community engagement, and commitment to principles of equity and inclusion that are central to the mission of the College. Failure to accept and act on this responsibility threatens the rights of the rest of the community by undermining the trust upon which the community is built. </P><P>Students, faculty, staff, and administrators assume a commitment to the academic community that supports teaching and learning in an open environment based on mutual trust, respect, and concern. All members of the community have the right to careful and constructive analysis of their work, and they have the responsibility to provide a serious response to the work of others. </P><P>Each member of the academic community has the right to beneﬁt from its collective knowledge and resources as well as the responsibility to contribute to them. </P><Sect><H4>Honor Code </H4><P>Mount Holyoke students take great pride in and responsibility for upholding the College’s honor code, which has been articulated by the Mount Holyoke College Student Government Association. </P><P>I will honor myself, my fellow students, and Mount Holyoke College by acting responsibly, honestly, and respectfully in both my words and my deeds. </P><P>The honor code plays a role in both academic and social life at the College. While allowing for a signiﬁcant degree of individual  freedom, it relies on students to conduct themselves with maturity and concern for the welfare of other members of the College community. </P><P>The commitment students and faculty have made to teaching and learning in an open environment based on mutual trust, respect, and concern is the foundation for Mount Holyoke’s unusual system of self-scheduled examinations. </P><P>Plagiarism or other forms of scholarly misconduct can have no purpose or place in the academic life of the College. Each student is responsible for observing established procedures in the preparation of assignments and the writing of papers and examinations, and for submitting as one’s own, only that work that she or he has originated. Each instructor is responsible for making clear what procedures are acceptable in the work of a course and for guiding students toward appropriate methods and standards of research for production of student work. </P><P>Additional information on the honor code, examples of violations, the process for reporting suspected violations, the procedures through which the Academic Honor Board adjudicates suspected violations, <Link>and potential penalties for its violation are available at this site (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/academicdeans/academic-honor-board/</Link>). All </P><Sect><P>members of the Mount Holyoke community are encouraged to utilize <Link>The Proper Use of Sources Tutorial (http://www.mtholyoke.edu/lits/ </Link><Link>ris/Plagiarism/</Link>), which provides information on the different forms of plagiarism, proper scholarly procedure, and links to helpful websites for further information. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Audio/Visual Recordings in the Classroom </H4><P>To encourage active engagement and academic inquiry in the classroom, as well as to safeguard the privacy of students and faculty, no form of audio or visual recording in the classroom is permitted without explicit permission from the professor/instructor or without a letter from AccessAbility Services, signed by the faculty member, authorizing the recording as an accommodation. Authorized recordings may only be used by a student who has obtained permission and may not be shared or distributed for any reason. Violation of this policy is an infraction of the Mount Holyoke Honor Code and academic regulations and will result in disciplinary action. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Registration and Class Attendance </H2><P>Students register for the next semester following academic advising periods. Courses may be added only during the ﬁrst ten days of classes. </P><P>Students may withdraw from courses through the ﬁrst ten weeks of classes. Through the ﬁfteenth day of classes, courses from which the student has withdrawn will not appear on the student’s academic record. After the ﬁfteenth day of classes, withdrawals from courses require the approval of the instructor and will appear on the student’s record, with the notation “W.” After the ﬁftieth day of classes, students may withdraw from courses only with the approval of the instructor and authorization from the director of health services, the director of the counseling service, or AccessAbility Services when granted as an accommodation. Courses recorded with the notation “W” will not affect a student’s grade average. </P><P>Deadlines for adding and withdrawing from courses that begin midsemester, such as half-semester physical education courses, fall <Link>midway through the term and are listed on the academic calendar (p. 4) </Link>available in the catalog or on the registrar’s website. </P><P>Regular class attendance is expected of all students unless an individual instructor suspends this expectation. </P></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4>Religious Observance </H4><P>In support of our religiously diverse student population and in compliance with Title XXI Chapter 151C Section 2B of the General Laws of Massachusetts, students seeking a religious accommodation because their religious observance will determine they will miss a class or work and who need an extension, rescheduled exam, or make-up materials to complete work due on these dates are advised to contact their professors (or staff employer in relation to campus jobs) well in advance of the holiday or fasting period -- preferably at the start of each semester. </P><P>Section 2B of Chapter 151C of the General Laws of Massachusetts reads: &quot;Any student in an educational or vocational training institution, other than a religious or denominational educational or vocational training institution, who is unable, because of his religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination or study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study, or work requirement which he may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such school. No fees of any kind shall be </P><P>Academic Regulations </P></Sect><P>charged by the institution for making available to the said student such opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his availing himself of the provisions of this section." </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Load and Credits </H2><P>The normal program for undergraduates is 16 academic credits per semester. Undergraduate students carrying fewer than 12 credits are considered part-time. (Undergraduate students carrying 9 credits will be certiﬁed as having three-quarter time enrollment status for the term. Those with 8 credits will be certiﬁed as having half-time enrollment status for the term. Those with fewer than 8 credits will be certiﬁed as less than half-time.) Students are expected to earn 128 credits in eight semesters of work. Physical education units are not counted towards this total, nor towards enrollment status. Credit is not awarded for a course in which students are not formally registered or in which they are an auditor, even if they have completed the full work of the course. </P><P>Undergraduate students wishing to carry more than 20 credits in a semester must obtain approval from an academic dean. A reduced course load may be authorized by the director of AccessAbility Services when that is determined to be an appropriate accommodation for a student with a disability. Non-resident Frances Perkins Scholars may elect a part-time course load of no fewer than 8 credits in a semester. Other undergraduate students who wish to carry fewer than 12 credits must obtain advance approval from the dean of studies; eligibility in these cases is restricted to those who have exceeded the College’s eight-semester funding limitation, who will take no fewer than 8 credits (or 1–2 physical education units, if required) and who receive the dean’s approval. </P><P>All courses completed satisfactorily before the student declares a major/ program count towards the College's degree requirements -- the 128 semester credits required for the degree. </P><P><Link>Graduate students should refer to speciﬁc Professional and Graduate </Link><Link>Education programs (p. 420) for details about the expected plan of </Link>study in their program. Graduate students carrying 8 or more credits will be certiﬁed as having full-time enrollment status for the term. Graduate students carrying 5 to 7 credits for the term are certiﬁed as three-quarter time. Those carrying 4 are half-time and those with fewer than 4 are less than half-time. Enrollments in summer sessions will be added to determine the total summer term enrollment for certiﬁcation purposes. </P><Sect><H4>Credit Hour Deﬁnition </H4><P>Mount Holyoke College complies with federal regulations deﬁning a credit hour. For Mount Holyoke, a four-credit course involves 12 hours per week of academic engaged time over the course of the semester. Academic engaged time is generally three class or contact hours per week plus 9 additional hours of academic work for the course. For courses carrying more or fewer than four credits, the federal requirement and Mount Holyoke expectation is one contact hour and two hours of outside work for each credit. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Five College Interchange Enrollment </H2><P>Only students in good academic standing may enroll in a course at Amherst College, Hampshire College, Smith College, or the University of Massachusetts at Amherst through the Five College Interchange. The Interchange operates during the fall and spring semesters. Students in the ﬁrst semester of their ﬁrst year need permission from the ﬁrst-year class dean to enroll. Normally, students may not register for more than two courses at any one institution. They are limited to requesting a total of two courses in advance of the semester. </P><Sect><P>Students taking a course through the Five College Interchange are, in that course, subject to the academic regulations, including the calendar, deadlines, and academic honor system, of the host institution. It is the responsibility of the student to be familiar with the pertinent regulations of the host institution, including those for attendance, academic honesty, grading options, and deadlines for completing course work and taking examinations. The exception is that students follow their home institution’s deadlines for adding and dropping courses. </P><P>Courses offered through the UMass University Without Walls (continuing education) division are not available through the Five College Interchange. Students may not register for these courses through the interchange system. Students may receive credit for appropriate University Without Walls courses offered during January and summer by submitting a University of Massachusetts transcript directly to the Mount Holyoke College Registrar’s ofﬁce. Coursework will be treated as transfer <Link>work and subject to the Mount Holyoke College transfer policy (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/registrar/transferap/</Link>). Students should carefully read the Course Credits information below in addition to the transfer policy. </P><Sect><H4>Course Credits </H4><P>During the fall and spring semesters for courses taken through the Five College Interchange, course credit is generally awarded by the Registrar according to the value awarded by the institution offering the course. Credits may vary for courses of unusual format or duration and, for some Five College courses, no academic credit is granted at Mount Holyoke so these may be taken only on an audit basis. (Prior to Fall 2017, 3-credit academic courses at Hampshire and the University of Massachusetts and science courses with labs were usually awarded the equivalent value of similar courses at Mount Holyoke, almost always four credits. Starting Fall 2017, credits have been typically awarded to match the value offered at the course's home institution -- e.g. a 3-credit course taken through the interchange is awarded 3 credits at Mount Holyoke.) </P><P>Individual departments at Mount Holyoke determine if and how Five College courses may be applied to satisfy a requirement of their major, minor, and/or Nexus. Students should contact the chair of their major/ minor department to seek advice and/or ofﬁcial permission before registering for Five College courses, to determine whether it may apply to the major/minor. The department then signs a Permission form which the student then submits to the Registrar's Ofﬁce, to record the permission ofﬁcially. </P><P>For Intersession January courses, the maximum credit awarded for a class is 2 credits, with the exception of some approved intensive language courses. </P><P>Courses taken at University of Massachusetts through University Without Walls during the Summer or at other points are generally transferred at face value -- e.g. a 3-credit Summer or January University of Massachusetts course is generally awarded 3 transfer credits at Mount Holyoke. Courses of unusual format or offered on compressed schedules may be awarded fewer credits. </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit and Other Advance Placement Credit </H2><P><Link>Students are advised to consult the registrar’<Link>s website (https:// </Link></Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/registrar/transferap/</Link>) for further information and speciﬁcs on earning credit through transfer work or other advance placement study. </P></Sect><P>Credit is awarded only when ofﬁcial documentation (ofﬁcial transcript, ofﬁcial test score report) is submitted to the Registrar from the external institution. </P><P>During their post-matriculation fall and spring semesters, students: </P><Sect><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>may not earn transfer credit unless they are on an approved Leave of Absence. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>may not simultaneously enroll for credit at another institution while registered at Mount Holyoke. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><P>Once posted, transfer course work will not be removed from the student's academic record. </P><Sect><H4>Credit Limits </H4><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>No more than 64 credits will be awarded to students for external work, whether taken pre- or post-matriculation, from eligible college-level courses, from Advance Placement work, from study abroad, summer or January study, study while on leaves, and/or work transferred from Mount Holyoke's Professional and Graduate Education courses. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Within the 64 limit, no more than 32 credits will be granted for all advance placement work such as A-levels, the International Baccalaureate, the AP program of the College Board, etc. No more than 16 credits may be transferred from each semester of study abroad, academic leave, or non-academic leave including medical leave. </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>No more than 12 credits may be transferred from all of the summers and January intersessions between the student's matriculation at the College and graduation. </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Within this 12-credit allowance, the limit is a maximum of 8 credits per summer and 3 credits per January. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Students admitted as ﬁrst-year Spring entrants may transfer as many as 8 additional summer school credits during their years at Mount Holyoke, provided the total of these additional credits and any transferred credits earned elsewhere in the Fall semester before their matriculation does not exceed 16. </LBody></LI></L></L></L></Sect><Sect><H4>Advance Placement Work </H4><P>Within the maximum allowance of 32 credits for all advance placement work and as long as the student does not earn credit in the corresponding courses at Mount Holyoke, credit will be granted as follows: </P><Sect><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Advanced Placement program of the College Board: 4 credits per exam graded 4 or 5. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Caribbean Advanced Examinations: 8 credits per CAPE exam for liberal arts subject units with a score 1, 2, or 3. One non-liberal arts subject may be awarded 4 credits. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>French Baccalaureate: 4 credits per eligible exam (score of 10 or above and coefﬁcient of 4 or higher), up to a maximum of 16 credits total. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>General Certiﬁcate of Education (A-Levels): A maximum of 32 credits will be granted if a student completes four or more exams with grades of C or better in liberal arts subjects. Credit is not awarded for O-Levels, AS-Levels, nor for the General Paper, nor for “Project Work”, nor for “Knowledge and Inquiry”. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>German Abitur: A maximum of 16 credits for receipt of this degree. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>International Baccalaureate: Credit may be granted only for higher level exams awarded a grade of 6 or 7. If the points total is below 36 or any grades are below a 6, the College may grant 8 credits per higher-level exam graded 6 or 7. If three higher levels and grades in all exams </LBody></LI></L><P>Full PDF 27 </P><P>taken (including subsidiary) are 6 or 7, and 36 or more total points </P><P>were earned, 32 credits may be granted. </P><P>Advance placement credit cannot be applied to fulﬁll College requirements, such as distribution requirements, the foreign language requirement, the ﬁrst-year seminar requirement nor the multicultural perspectives requirement. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4>Transfer Work </H4><P>Transfer credit, unless the student was granted an academic leave of absence from the College to study elsewhere, is generally granted on a semester credit-for-credit basis. That is, a 3-credit course taken on a typical semester schedule will usually be awarded 3 credits at Mount Holyoke College. Credits earned at schools not on the semester calendar will be converted to semester credits (e.g., a quarter credit will be awarded .66 semester credits at Mount Holyoke). Credits earned in courses taught in condensed, intensive, or alternative formats often transfer to Mount Holyoke at less than full credit-for-credit value. </P><P>Academic credit is generally granted for liberal arts courses completed with letter grades of C- or better. Students who entered the College in fall 2008 or later may be granted up to 12 credits total of non-liberal arts and Mount Holyoke curricular support course work. Students who entered earlier are limited to one non-liberal arts course. </P><P>Academic credit is never granted for: physical education courses; internships; courses with a pass/fail grade; courses taken at U.S. schools without regional accreditation or international institutions without comparable Ministry of Education recognition; CLEP or placement exams given by other institutions; courses that are not of college level (such as algebra courses); and courses not granted academic credit by the institution or which do not appear on their ofﬁcial transcript. </P><P>Academic credit is not usually granted for: independent study coursework, computer science courses (without written permission of the Mount Holyoke computer science department chair), nor for music performance courses without written permission of the Mount Holyoke music department chair.  No credits are awarded for music performance studies, including individual instrument study, choir, orchestra or other ensemble study. </P><P>In general, transferability of credit is determined by the registrar, while the applicability of transfer work to degree requirements of all kinds falls in the purview of the applicable Mount Holyoke department. </P><P>Online courses are eligible to transfer, as long as they meet all other conditions for transfer and the following eligibility restrictions: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Students whose ﬁrst term at the College was Fall 2013 or later are eligible to transfer online courses taken before or after their matriculation at the College. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Students who entered the College before Fall 2013 are eligible to transfer online courses taken post-matriculation, but not any prematriculation coursework. </LBody></LI></L><P>Students who are granted an academic leave of absence to study at another accredited college or university in the U.S., or with an approved program abroad, may earn a full year (32 credit hours) or semester (16 credit hours) if they satisfactorily complete (grades of C- or better) a standard  full-time degree course load of liberal arts courses. Students should note that the minimum required to meet that standard varies from institution to institution. Normally, a full year’s credits equal one-quarter of the total needed to graduate from an institution with a four-year undergraduate degree program. For institutions on the quarter </P><P>Academic Regulations </P></Sect><P>system (quarter credits transfer as two-thirds of a semester credit), a student may have to complete three quarters to earn a full year of Mount Holyoke College credit. The semester limit for Mount Holyoke’s program in Shanghai through the Alliance for Global Education is 18 credits. </P><P>If planning summer study at another institution, a student should, in advance, review the particulars of the plan with the registrar’s ofﬁce and seek preapproval for speciﬁc nonelective courses from the departments concerned. </P><P>Grades for transferred courses will not appear on the Mount Holyoke College transcript, nor will they affect the Mount Holyoke GPA. Work exceeding transfer limits will not be evaluated nor posted to a student’s record. Per-course credit values are assigned to the internal record but do not appear on the ofﬁcial transcript. The ofﬁcial transcript displays only the name of the originating institution, the total credits transferred to Mount Holyoke for a given period and, in the case of study abroad only, the titles of courses transferred. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Applying a Single Course to MultipleRequirements </H2><P>A frequently asked question is whether a student may use a particular course to satisfy more than one degree requirement -- that is, to “doublecount” a course towards two or more requirements.

However, may be allowed in speciﬁc majors or minors if clearly speciﬁed in their requirements. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Prescheduled and Self-Scheduled Examinations </H2><P>There are two kinds of ﬁnal exams at Mount Holyoke—prescheduled and self-scheduled. For a few courses, particularly when audiovisual materials are needed, there is one prescheduled session that all students in the course must attend. Prescheduled examinations are held during the ﬁrst nine examination sessions. The majority of exams are “self-scheduled,” giving students the flexibility to decide during which session they want to take each exam. Students report at the beginning of a session, complete an examination, and turn it in by the end of that session. </P><P>All ﬁnal exams must be taken during the ofﬁcial examination period, <Link>which is published in the College’s academic calendar (p. 4). In general, </Link>there are no exceptions to the exam schedule and students should make their travel arrangements accordingly. Those with truly exceptional situations may consult the dean of studies, well in advance of the ofﬁcial </P><Sect><P>exam period, if seeking approval to take a ﬁnal exam before the exam period. All students expecting a degree or certiﬁcate at commencement must complete all course work, including examinations, no later than the ninth session of the spring examination period in the year of their graduation. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Course Evaluation </H2><P>As the semester draws to a close, students are required to submit an online course evaluation for each of their courses. This requirement is a reflection of the importance the College places on students and faculty supplying each other with timely, thoughtful feedback. Students who do not submit their evaluations on time will be blocked from access to their degree audit, unofﬁcial transcript, and grades until they have submitted the overdue evaluations or, at minimum, until they record a “decline to evaluate” response. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Grading System </H2><P>A cumulative grade point average of 2.00 is required for graduation. The grading system and conversion equivalents used at Mount Holyoke are as follows: </P><Table><TR><TH>Grade </TH><TH>= </TH><TH>Points </TH></TR><TR><TD>A </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>4.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>A</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>3.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B+ </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>3.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>3.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>2.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C+ </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>2.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>2.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>1.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D+ </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>1.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>1.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>0.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>F </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>0 </TD></TR></Table><P>Other notations appearing on student records are: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>IP (in progress) for a course sequence continuing for more than one semester </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>I (incomplete) for courses in which an incomplete extension has been granted </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>W (withdrawal from a course) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>CR (credit) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>NC (no credit) </LBody></LI></L><P>To receive credit for a course, the course grade must be either a CR or a grade of D- or higher. Prior to fall 2007, DR (dropped) was noted for courses dropped after 15 days of classes; and W (withdrawn) was noted for withdrawals approved by the College. </P><P>Recognizing that any system of grading is a cryptic form of evaluation, the faculty (for the work within courses) interprets a grade on individual pieces of work with detailed commentary aimed at assisting the student in evaluating that work. </P><P>Physical education courses do not earn academic credit; satisfactory completion is noted on the ofﬁcial record by S followed by the number of physical education units earned, such as: S1, S2. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Ungraded Option </H4><P>Each undergraduate student may elect to take a total of four courses (or 16 credits) on an ungraded basis under the following conditions: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>The election for MHC courses must be recorded in the Registrar's Ofﬁce no later than the ﬁftieth academic day of classes.

Students are graded according to the system in effect at the host institution. </P><P>Courses given by Five College faculty appointees will be graded A through F including pluses and minuses. This policy permits Five College faculty to use a single grading system at all institutions. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Incomplete Work </H4><P>“Incomplete” indicates that a student did not complete all the work of a course by the end of the semester for reasons of a health or other emergency that occurs at the end of the semester and could not have been anticipated. No later than the last day of the exam period, students must request the incomplete from, as appropriate, the director of Health Services or of the Counseling Service, or from an academic dean, or from the Director of AccessAbility Services. </P><P>If the incomplete is authorized and is then approved by the instructor, the student will be given a date by which to complete the course work. This date should be as early as possible and should only rarely extend </P><Sect><P>Full PDF 29 </P><P>beyond the ﬁrst day of classes of the following semester. The instructor may provide the student with a “guaranteed” grade that is a letter grade based only on the work the student has already completed in the course. </P><P>If a student does not complete the course work by the assigned date (unless the student has applied to and been granted an additional extension by the dean of studies), the registrar will record the guaranteed grade if one was provided, a failure for the course, or, if the extension has been authorized by the director of Health Services or the Counseling Service, a “W.” </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Course Repeats </H2><P>A student who has received credit for a course may not elect the course for a second time, unless the course is fundamentally different in subject matter or method. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Class Standing and Academic Deﬁciencies </H2><P>To enter the sophomore class, students must pass at least 24 credits within two semesters; to enter the junior class, at least 56 credits within four semesters; and to enter the senior class, at least 92 credits within six semesters. Students with fewer than the required credits will ordinarily receive a warning on credits and be reclassiﬁed. </P><P>At the end of each semester, the Academic Administrative Board reviews the records of all undergraduate students who do not meet these credit standards, those who complete substantially fewer than normal credits in one or more semesters, those whose cumulative or semester grade averages fall below 2.00, and those who are already on academic probation. The records of postbaccalaureate and certiﬁcate students are included in the review. Students found to have academic deﬁciencies may be issued a warning, be placed on academic probation, be suspended for a semester or year, or be required to withdraw. Students will not be placed on probation or warned for insufﬁcient semester credits when credit standards are not met solely on the basis of a reduced courseload approved by AccessAbility Services. </P><P>Probation. Students placed on academic probation must meet with their academic dean for an evaluation conference in order to plan a program of support to bring the quality of their work up to graduation level. Probation is not recorded on the transcript. </P><P>Suspension. Students who have been suspended for academic deﬁciencies for a semester or a year shall be on academic probation for one semester after their return. During the suspension, their transcripts shall bear the notation “Suspended for (period) for academic deﬁciencies.” This notation will be removed when the student returns or after one year, whichever is sooner. However, the notation will be retained on the internal record. </P><P>Required Withdrawal. Students who have been required to withdraw may apply for readmission to the Academic Administrative Board, but they may not return before one academic year has passed. Their transcripts shall bear the notation “Required to withdraw for academic deﬁciencies on (date). Eligible to apply for readmission after one academic year.” This notation will be removed when the student returns or after one year, whichever is sooner. However, the notation will be retained on the internal record. </P><P>Questions about the reapplication process should be directed to the dean of studies. </P><P>Academic Regulations </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Academic Progress </H4><P>To enter the sophomore class, a student must pass at least 24 credits within two semesters; to enter the junior class, at least 56 credits within four semesters; and to enter the senior class, at least 92 credits within six semesters. Students with fewer than the required credits will ordinarily receive a warning on credits and may be reclassiﬁed. </P><P>At the end of each semester, the Academic Administrative Board reviews the records of all undergraduate degree-seeking, postbaccalaureate, or certiﬁcate students who do not meet these standards: those who complete substantially fewer than normal credits in one or more semesters, those whose cumulative or semester grade averages fall below 2.00, or those who are already on academic probation.  The board may warn students about their academic standing, place them on academic probation, suspend them for a semester or year, or require them to withdraw. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Leave of Absence </H2><P>Students may apply for a leave of absence for a variety of reasons, such as to work, travel, deal with a family situation, or study at another institution of higher education. </P><P>Students wishing to take an academic leave must receive approval from the dean of international studies who coordinates study abroad or the Ofﬁce of Academic Deans for study in the U.S. Academic leaves are ordinarily granted to students in good academic standing, with a cumulative average of at least 2.70, who present a plan of full-time study suitable for credit transfer, and who will meet the residence requirements of the College before graduation. Students who plan to be on leave during their junior or senior year must have the approval of their major department concerning completion of major requirements. See “Special Programs and Resources” for information about Mount Holyoke programs and exchanges abroad and in the U.S. </P><P>Sophomores, juniors, and seniors in good academic standing may apply for leaves of absence to work away from campus on independent projects related to the degree provided that the projects are fundamentally academic in character; that is, they require disciplined work in recognized ﬁelds of study such as those listed in the catalog. For more information, consult the dean of studies. </P><P>A student may earn a limited number of credits toward a Mount Holyoke degree by studying at another institution of higher education in the United States or abroad, or by studying independently. A maximum of 32 credits for an academic year's study at another institution may be counted toward the total required for the degree. Sixteen credits is the usual limit for a single-semester leave, but upon pre-approval of the Academic Priorities Committee, a Mount Holyoke Program may have an alternate credit limit. </P><P>Students wishing to take a nonacademic leave for personal reasons or to work or travel should apply to the Ofﬁce of the Academic Deans. Students wishing to take a nonacademic leave for reasons of health should apply to the director of health services or the director of the counseling service. Students on nonacademic leave who wish to earn credits while abroad must receive advance approval from the Academic Administrative Board; approval will be limited to part-time study only. During a non-academic leave, a student may earn a limited number of credits to transfer toward a Mount Holyoke degree by studying at another institution of higher education in the United States. Sixteen credits per </P><Sect><P>semester is the maximum number of credits which may be transferred for approved course work. </P><P><Link>For full information on credit limitations, consult the transfer/external </Link><Link>credit regulations (p. 26). </Link></P><P>When a leave is effective the ﬁrst day of classes or later, withdrawn courses will remain on the transcript with a “W” notation, effectively withdrawing from the program for the term. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Withdrawal and Readmission </H2><P>A student wishing to withdraw from the College must, if on campus, meet with one of the academic deans. The academic dean will assist the student in completing the required online withdrawal form available in my.mtholyoke. If off campus, the student should contact the Ofﬁce of Academic Deans before submitting the withdrawal form. Any refund for the semester’s tuition and board charges will be based on the date when the withdrawal request is approved by the Ofﬁce of Academic Deans. <Link>(For information on refunds (p. 36), see the Tuition and Fees chapter.) </Link>When a withdrawal is effective the ﬁrst day of classes or later, withdrawn courses will remain on the transcript with a “W” notation. </P><P>The College reserves the right to require a student to withdraw for academic deﬁciency, nonpayment, nonattendance, failure to register, illness, or disciplinary infraction. </P><P>A student who has withdrawn from the College and wishes to <Link>return should consult the readmission information (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/academicdeans/withdrawals-readmission/</Link>) and <Link>then complete the readmission application (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>sites/default/ﬁles/academicdeans/docs/application.pdf</Link>) available on the academic deans' website.

The act also generally prohibits the release of personally identiﬁable information (other than “directory information” deﬁned below) about students without their written consent other than to teachers and other College ofﬁcials who have legitimate educational interests; to ofﬁcials of other institutions in which the student intends to enroll; to certain authorized state and federal ofﬁcials; to appropriate parties in connection with ﬁnancial aid to the student; to organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the College; to accrediting organizations; to comply with a judicial order or lawfully ordered subpoena; and to appropriate ofﬁcials in the case of health and safety emergency. </P><P>A school ofﬁcial is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research or support staff position (including law enforcement personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using College employees or ofﬁcials (such as an attorney, auditor, IT specialist, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student or appointed volunteer serving on an ofﬁcial committee or assisting another school ofﬁcial in performing his or her tasks. A school ofﬁcial has a legitimate educational interest if the </P></Sect><P>ofﬁcial needs to review an education record in order to fulﬁll his or her professional responsibilities for the College. </P><P>The regulations of the act make clear that, in the case of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes, information from the education records of the student may be disclosed to parents without the student’s prior consent. The College may notify the student’s parents in writing of academic probation, required withdrawal, and suspension. In communications with parents concerning other matters, it is normally College policy to respect the privacy of the student and not to disclose information from educational records without the student’s prior consent. </P><P>Requests for review of speciﬁc records must be made in writing. A student who seeks to review only health or career records should ﬁle a written request to do so with the director of health services, the director of the counseling service, or the Career Development Center. All other requests should be made at the Ofﬁce of the Dean of the College. </P><P>The Privacy Act gives Mount Holyoke College the right to make public at its discretion, without prior authorization from the individual  student, the following personally identiﬁable directory information: name; class year; home/permanent, off-campus/local, and College addresses; home, local, and residence hall telephone numbers; College electronic mail address; identiﬁcation photograph; dates of attendance at Mount Holyoke College; enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate; full- or part-time; on leave); date and place of birth; major(s); degrees, honors, and awards received; participation in ofﬁcially recognized sports and activities; status as student employee; and previous educational institution most recently attended. An individual student may limit release of the above information for any given year by ﬁling such a request with the registrar by July 1 of that year; requests received after this date will be put into effect as quickly as possible,  but directory information already released cannot be recalled. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Access and Inclusion </H2><P>Mount Holyoke College is a women’s college that is gender diverse.

The College also offers graduate degrees, dual degree, second bachelor’s, and other certiﬁcate programs. </P><Sect><H2>Undergraduate Admission </H2><P>Mount Holyoke College is looking for intellectually curious, motivated students who understand the value of a liberal arts education. The College believes in the educational, social, and ethical value of diversity and actively recruits students who have different interests and talents and who come from a wide spectrum of ethnic, geographic, and economic backgrounds. </P><Sect><H4>The Admission Process </H4><P>Admission is determined by a student's overall record of achievement. Successful candidates demonstrate a very strong academic foundation. The College seeks students who have consistently challenged themselves by taking honors and Advanced Placement (AP) courses, or their equivalent, or enrolled in an International Baccalaureate (IB program). A typical academic program includes a minimum of three years in core classes (English, mathematics, foreign language, laboratory science, history) that reflect increasing rigor. Please note that while this proﬁle is typical, variations are common and will be considered. </P><P>While the greatest weight is attributed to school records and evaluations, consideration is also given to the student's entire portfolio, which includes special talents, particular goals, and unique experiences. The College greatly values how students express themselves in writing, and the admission committee looks closely at all student essay submissions. Finally, the College seeks students whose interests and aspirations match the opportunities offered by Mount Holyoke. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Standardized Testing: Optional </H4><P>Since fall 2001, Mount Holyoke has made it optional for applicants to submit standardized tests for admission purposes.

To facilitate the application process, the College advises home-schooled candidates to contact the admission ofﬁce early in the process. In addition to completing the Mount Holyoke application forms, candidates must submit two letters of recommendation that speak to the candidate’s academic and personal qualiﬁcations. Students who feel that their application may be enhanced by including traditional measures like standardized test scores may choose to submit either the SAT or ACT.

For more information, please contact Student <Link>Financial Services or visit the website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/). </Link></P><Sect><H5>Parent PLUS Loan </H5><P>The Federal Parent PLUS loan is a non-need-based, ﬁxed-interest, federally guaranteed education loan for families of all income levels. The origination fee and interest rate are available on the Student Financial Services website once it is set for that academic year. Eligibility is limited to parents without an adverse credit history. Any parent may borrow up to the total cost of education less ﬁnancial aid. Repayment begins 60 days after full disbursement and can extend up to 30 years. Deferment of loan principal is also an option. A current year FAFSA must be completed for any student whose parent wishes to apply for the Parent PLUS. Either <Link>parent may apply for the PLUS loan beginning June 1 at studentloans.gov </Link>(<Link>https://www.studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action/</Link>). Parents and students must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Student Financial Services processes the approved PLUS loans starting July 1. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>MEFA Loan </H5><P>Funded by the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA), the ﬁxed or variable interest rate Undergraduate MEFA loan allows students and their families to borrow from a minimum of $2,000 up to the full cost of education less ﬁnancial aid at more than 70 Massachusetts colleges and universities. Residents of all states are eligible to apply <Link>at the MEFA website (http://www.mefa.org/collegeloans/). Students and </Link>co-borrowers must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Alternative Student Loans </H5><P>Students also have the option of applying for an alternative student loan. Various commercial lenders offer these non-need-based loans. Interest rates are generally variable and may be higher over the long term than the rates of federal need-based student loans and parent loans. These loans are not subsidized and unpaid interest will be capitalized into the principal earlier and more frequently than with federal loans. Some lenders of alternative student loans may charge an origination or disbursement fee. Repayment terms vary, often depending on the amount borrowed and the credit score of the student and/or cosigner. Alternative student loans are available to domestic and international students and usually require a creditworthy cosigner who is a permanent resident or citizen of the U.S. Alternative parent loans may also be available for parents who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The maximum amount of loan the College will certify is the cost of education <Link>minus any ﬁnancial aid. For more information visit our website (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/alternative_loans.html</Link>). These loans should be considered only after lower cost federal student or parent loan options have been exhausted. </P><P>Financial Aid for Undergraduate Students </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Refund Policy </H2><P>Students who withdraw or take a leave of absence during the semester will be refunded per the schedule outlined below. The ofﬁcial withdrawal date for a student is determined by the Ofﬁce of Academic Deans. The Ofﬁce of Academic Deans must receive written notice of the student’s intent to withdraw. Please see “Withdrawal from the College” in the <Link>Academic Regulations chapter (p. 25) for more information. </Link></P><P>Students will be refunded 100 percent of their previously paid tuition, room, and board, less the enrollment deposit for new students, if the Ofﬁce of Academic Deans receives written notice of an ofﬁcial withdrawal or leave of absence before the ﬁrst day of classes. If a student ofﬁcially withdraws or takes a leave of absence on or after the ﬁrst day of classes, refunds occur on the following schedule: </P><Sect><H4>Refund Schedule </H4><P>Tuition, room, and board refunds: </P><Sect><H6>Weeks Percentage </H6><P>Week 1 90% </P><P>Weeks 2-3 75% </P><P>Weeks 4-5 50% </P><P>Weeks 6-7 25% </P><P>There is no refund of the Student Government Association fee if a student withdraws on or after the ﬁrst day of classes. </P><P>Tuition charges for approved off-campus Frances Perkins students will be increased or decreased accordingly based on the number of credits during the add/drop period of each semester (until the end of the ﬁfteenth day of classes). No per-credit tuition adjustments will be made for classes dropped after the ﬁfteenth day of classes unless the student takes a leave of absence or withdraws from the College at which point the above refund schedule will apply. State and/or federal aid will be adjusted for students at part-time status as of the last day to drop classes. Any credits dropped after the ﬁfteenth day of classes each semester will be counted, for ﬁnancial aid eligibility purposes, toward the 128 attempted credit maximum for students charged by the credit. For more information, <Link>please see the Financial Aid chapter (p. 36). </Link></P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Title IV Financial Aid Refund (Federal Funds only) </H4><P>Per federal regulation, when a recipient of Title IV (federal) grant or loan assistance withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the College during the semester, the College must determine, per a federal formula, the amount of federal aid that the student earned and may retain as of the withdrawal date. According to the federal refund policy, federal aid the student has not earned must be returned to the federal government. Note: College grants will not be increased to cover reduced federal or state aid due to a withdrawal or leave of absence. </P><P>Up through the ﬁrst 60 percent of the semester, the amount of federal funds students may retain is based on the number of days they were enrolled in the semester. After 60 percent of the semester is over, students are eligible to retain all of their federal aid for that semester. </P><P>The responsibility to repay any federal aid is shared by the College and the student. The College’s share to repay is the lesser of the total amount of federal aid to be returned or the College charges multiplied by the percentage of aid that must be returned. The student’s share is the difference between the aid that must be returned and the College’s share. </P><P>The College’s share of federal aid must be returned to the Title IV programs in the following order: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal Direct Student Loan </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal Perkins Loan </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal Direct PLUS </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal Pell Grant </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Federal TEACH Grant </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Other Title IV loan or grant assistance </LBody></LI></L><P>The College must return its share of federal aid within 30 days after the withdrawal date. Any federal aid that the student must return resulting from a loan is subject to the conditions and terms of the promissory note. If a student must repay a share of federal grant aid, the College may allow the student to make payment arrangements with the College, in compliance with federal regulations. Sample Title IV refund worksheets are available from Student Financial Services upon request. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>State Grant Refund Policy </H4><P>State grants will be refunded according to the rules of the individual state programs. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Institutional Refund Policy </H4><P>After the federal and state refund calculations have been determined, any remaining reductions in aid will be distributed in the following order: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Mount Holyoke College grants </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Mount Holyoke College loans </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Parent/Student Alternative loans </LBody></LI></L><P>Mount Holyoke non-need based grants and scholarships will be adjusted based on the tuition refund schedule. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Tuition Refund Insurance </H2><P>The College has partnered with GradGuard, a service of Next Generation Insurance Group, to offer a tuition refund insurance plan. The plan complements and extends Mount Holyoke’s current refund policy by providing plan participants with a refund of the College’s comprehensive fee less ﬁnancial aid if an insured student is forced to withdraw from the College during the semester as a result of personal injury or other medical reasons. Tuition insurance reimburses students for up to 100 percent of tuition, room, and board costs. This policy must be purchased before the ﬁrst day of classes and covers the academic year. For more <Link>information, visit the SFS website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/cost/ </Link><Link>tuition_insurance/</Link>). </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Financial Aid for UndergraduateStudents </H2><P id="LinkTarget_84759">Student Financial Services is an important resource for families, whether or not they apply for ﬁnancial aid. The College participates in a number of parent ﬁnancing plans and offers a semester payment plan (see the <Link>Tuition and Fees (p. 34) chapter). </Link></P><P>Mount Holyoke need-based ﬁnancial aid is only available for degree-seeking undergraduate students. Federal loans and the TEACH grant are available for graduate students. More information may also be found </P><P><Link>in the Professional and Graduate Education (p. 459) section of the </Link>catalog. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Billed Costs and Total Cost of Attendance </H2><P>The total cost of attendance (also called &quot;student budget&quot;) includes the billed costs of tuition, room and board, the Student Government Association (SGA) fee, and estimated costs for personal and book expenses. Domestic students who travel from a distance may also see estimated costs for travel. </P><P>2021-2022 Budget: </P><Table><TR><TD>Expense </TD><TD>Amount </TD></TR><TR><TD>Tuition </TD><TD>$56,300 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Room and board </TD><TD>$16,580 </TD></TR><TR><TD>SGA </TD><TD>$218 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Books/personal expenses </TD><TD>$2,000 </TD></TR></Table><P>Total $75,098 </P><P>A student's ﬁnancial aid eligibility is the difference between the cost of attendance and the calculated family contribution. A student is eligible for need-based ﬁnancial aid if the family contribution is less than the cost of attendance. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Family Contribution </H2><P>The College uses a combination of institutional and federal methodologies to calculate a family contribution. The family contribution consists of a parent and a student contribution. </P><P>Factors that play a role in the parent contribution include parent taxable income and untaxed income, parent assets, the number of dependents in the household, and the number of dependent children attending four-year undergraduate institutions on a full-time basis. </P><P>The student contribution is determined after a review of student income and assets, including trusts. A minimum contribution from summer earnings of $2,750 for dependent students and $4,350 for independent students is expected. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Family Contribution from Year to Year </H2><P>The calculated family contribution will be consistent from year to year unless changes occur such as a signiﬁcant change in family income or assets, a change in the number of dependents supported, or a change in the number of dependent children attending undergraduate institutions. Students should expect to have slight increases in the student contribution each year. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Reapplying for Aid </H2><P>U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents and undocumented and DACA students must reapply for ﬁnancial aid each year to be considered for institutional need-based aid from Mount Holyoke. When only federal ﬁnancial aid is requested, U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents need only complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year and provide veriﬁcation requirements if selected for veriﬁcation after ﬁling the FAFSA. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Divorced or Separated Parents </H2><P>While Mount Holyoke will consider special circumstances, a student’s biological or adoptive parents are expected to ﬁnancially support their child’s education as much as possible regardless of separation, divorce, </P><P>or willingness to contribute. When determining eligibility for Mount Holyoke assistance, the College considers ﬁnancial information from both parents and spouses or partners of parents, regardless of marital status. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Requests for Additional Aid (Appeals) </H2><P>Student Financial Services accepts requests for reconsideration of a family contribution under certain circumstances. These circumstances include signiﬁcant changes in income, ﬁnancial support of an elderly grandparent, unreimbursed medical expenses, additional dependents who will be attending college full-time at a U.S. institution, or long-term loss of employment. Cash flow problems or business or consumer debt cannot be considered. Loss of employment may be considered at the end of the calendar year and any additional aid granted would be applied to the spring semester. </P><P>Requests for reconsideration must be accompanied by documentation. <Link>The Request for Reconsideration Form (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/ </Link><Link>forms_deadlines/</Link>) is available on the Student Financial Services website. While an increase in aid is not always possible, each request is assessed thoroughly and equitably. Students are expected to maximize all federal and institutional need-based loan eligibility before additional grant aid can be considered. </P><Sect><H4>Applying for Financial Aid New First-Year Students Who Are U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents </H4><P>Admission applicants must indicate their intent to apply for need-based ﬁnancial aid from Mount Holyoke on the admission application. Those who do not identify as aid applicants will not be considered for need-based aid from the College until they complete two semesters of enrollment at Mount Holyoke. This limit does not apply to federal ﬁnancial aid. Federal aid may be applied for at any time during the application cycle or the academic year by completing the Free Federal Application for Financial Aid (FAFSA).

Grant funding comes from institutional, federal, and state sources. </P><Sect><H5>Mount Holyoke College Need-based Grants </H5><P>Need-based College grants are awarded based on demonstrated ﬁnancial aid eligibility as determined by the College. Funding is provided by endowment earnings, the annual operating budget, and gifts from alumnae, parents, and friends. Need-based grants funded by the College include Mary Lyon Grant, Mount Holyoke Grant and the Health Insurance Grant. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Federal Grants </H5><P>Pell Grant: Students with high demonstrated ﬁnancial need, as determined by federal guidelines, are eligible for the Pell Grant. On average, students with a family adjusted gross income of $60,000 or less are eligible for the grant. Grants range from $670 to $6,495 in 2021-2022. </P><P>Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG): SEOG grants range from $500 to $1,500 and are included in the ﬁnancial aid package of students who are also eligible for the Pell Grant depending on availability of SEOG funds. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>State Grants </H5><P>Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Vermont offer scholarship and grant programs for students who reside in those states and attend school in Massachusetts. </P><P>Applicants for the Massachusetts State Grant must reside in Massachusetts for at least one year prior to receiving the grant. High school counselors or state scholarship ofﬁces can provide eligibility and deadline information. For the telephone number and address of a state’s scholarship ofﬁce, contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 800-433-3243. </P><P>Note: If a student receives a federal or state grant that was not included in the original ﬁnancial aid package, the Mount Holyoke grant is reduced by the amount of the federal, state, or provincial funding. This additional grant does not reduce the family contribution. College funding will not cover state funds if eligibility is lost due to missed deadlines as determined by the state. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Student Loans </H4><P>A federal, state or Mount Holyoke College student loan, or combination of student loans, is included in most ﬁnancial aid packages. The packaged loan amount increases approximately $1,000 each year. Total estimated student loan debt over four years will range from approximately $20,000 to $30,000 depending on institutional packaging policies and whether or not the student borrows the maximum loan amount per federal guidelines. </P><P>Links to entrance counseling and other required loan documents <Link>can be found at the Student Financial Services website (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/</Link>). Students may decline a student loan included in the ﬁnancial aid package by emailing Student Financial Services (<Link>sfs@mtholyoke.edu</Link>). </P><Sect><H5>Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) - Subsidized </H5><P>A subsidized FDSL is need-based. Eligibility is determined by ﬁling the FAFSA, and the annual amount of the FDSL is based on the year in school. The federal government does not charge interest before repayment begins or during authorized periods of deferment (postponement of repayment). Repayment of principal and interest begins six months after a student graduates or ceases being enrolled at least half time. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) - Unsubsidized </H5><P>All U.S. Citizens and permanent residents students are eligible for an unsubsidized FDSL regardless of need. The total amount of eligibility depends on the year in school. A FAFSA must be ﬁled in order to receive an unsubsidized FDSL.The federal government charges interest on the unsubsidized FDSL from the time the loan is disbursed until the loan is paid in full. There is an option to defer payment of interest during school; that interest is capitalized (added to the principal) at repayment. Repayment begins six months after a student graduates or ceases being enrolled at least half time. </P><P>All FDSLs have an origination fee which reduces the total amount borrowed. The fee amount is set by the government in October and is applied at the time the loan is disbursed to the student's account. The student borrowing the loan is required to sign a master promissory note and complete entrance counseling online. The master promissory note is signed once but covers additional FDSL borrowed in future years. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Mount Holyoke College and Global Loan </H5><P>These College funded loans are awarded to students demonstrating ﬁnancial need. The interest rate is 8% and accrues once repayment </P><P>Full PDF 39 </P><P>begins. Repayment of principal and interest begins six months after the student graduates, withdraws, takes a nonacademic leave of absence, or ceases to be enrolled at least half-time. A promissory note and federally mandated disclosures must be completed by the student prior to accepting the loan. A promissory note and disclosure notice must be completed each year a student receives a Mount Holyoke College loan. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Student Employment </H4><P>The College participates in the Federal Work-Study Program, a need-based program that funds student earnings for on-campus jobs as well as a number of off-campus positions with nonproﬁt agencies. The College also funds student employment for on-campus jobs. Annual student earnings depend on job position and hours worked. Students earn approximately $2,400 for six to seven hours of work per week while classes are in session. Students are paid every two weeks. Earnings from student jobs are paid directly to the student and may be used for books and personal expenses. </P><P>The Career Development Center coordinates the posting of on-campus jobs. Off-campus community service positions are coordinated through the Community-Based Learning ofﬁce. The College hires students in residence halls, administrative ofﬁces, academic departments, the library, and facilities management. In general, ﬁrst-year students seeking Level 1 jobs should seek employment in the summer or early fall of their ﬁrst semester. Students secure jobs using JobX, a student job board, and a Virtual Spring Job Fair (online), designed to help students with work study ﬁnd jobs for the following fall. Students with work study are eligible to apply for jobs of any level. Students without work study may apply for jobs in levels 2 through 5. While the College makes every effort to post all available jobs, students are not guaranteed employment, even if work study is included in the ﬁnancial aid package. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Merit-Based Scholarships and Grants (Non-needbased) </H4><P>Merit-based scholarships and grants (non-needbased) include: Trustee, 21st Century, J. Chin Scholarships, Posse, Mount Holyoke College Leadership and Global Perspective Awards, Frances Perkins Tuition Scholarships, Tuition Exchange, MHC Microscholarships (RaiseMe), and Tuition Assistance. </P><P>The Ofﬁce of Admission determines eligibility for merit-based awards. Students do not need to apply for need-based ﬁnancial aid to be considered for merit-based scholarships. Merit-based scholarships are not transferable for study at another institution; however, students who are eligible to study abroad and who need ﬁnancial assistance may apply for a Laurel Fellowship. Please see “Financial Aid for Study Abroad and Other Off-Campus Study” for additional information. </P><P>Non-need based funding, including merit-based scholarships, is renewed annually for up to eight semesters for ﬁrst year students provided the student is enrolled full-time and remains in good academic standing. </P><P>The Frances Perkins Tuition Scholarship for resident (on campus) Frances Perkins students has term limits based on the total number of credits accepted for transfer at any point. Credits transferred to the College due to a semester or year of study abroad or academic leave count toward the semester limit, whether or not ﬁnancial aid from the College was provided for these credits. The Frances Perkins Tuition Scholarship for commuting (non-resident) Frances Perkins students is limited to a cumulative total of 128 credits. Commuting Frances Perkins students must be enrolled at least half-time to retain eligibility. The 128credit total includes transfer credits applied toward the Mount Holyoke </P><P>Financial Aid for Undergraduate Students </P><P>degree. Frances Perkins students should plan their course of study with this in mind. </P><P>Students continuing on academic probation for more than one semester or suspended for academic reasons or behavioral reasons are ineligible to retain the non-need-based scholarship or grant. Students may also lose eligibility for honor code violations. </P><P>Non-need-based aid is refunded based on the refund schedule for tuition. <Link>(See the Tuition and Fees (p. 34) chapter.) For  </Link>example, if 25% of tuition is refunded for the semester, the scholarship will be reduced by 25% for the semester. A student who takes a medical leave during a semester may appeal for the remaining portion of that semester’s scholarship to be applied to an additional semester needed to complete course requirements. Students who need an additional semester of aid due to a medical leave may also appeal for additional need-based aid for the additional semester. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Outside Scholarships </H4><P>Mount Holyoke encourages students to apply for outside scholarships. Outside scholarships can reduce the student’s debt or help manage the family contribution. </P><P>Any outside scholarships received, per College and federal policy, must be considered part of the student's ﬁnancial aid package. Students receiving outside scholarships should notify Student Financial Services (<Link>sfs@mtholyoke.edu</Link>) as soon as possible. </P><P>If a student receives an outside scholarship(s), student’s College and federal needbased loans are reduced ﬁrst and then any student employment included in the original ﬁnancial aid package is reduced. If the outside scholarships exceed the amount of the need-based loans and student employment, the remainder reduces the College grant. The total ﬁnancial aid will remain the same unless the student requests the full Federal Direct Student Loan eligibility rather than the loan reduction. </P><P>Note: If the student's determined need is met solely by College need-based grant, such as the Mount Holyoke Grant or the Mary Lyon Legacy Grant, any outside scholarship(s) reduces College grant dollar for dollar. </P><P>International students who secure sponsorship funding prior to admission or enrolling at Mount Holyoke must notify Student Financial Services to discuss the impact on need-based ﬁnancial assistance. </P><P>Information about outside scholarships can be obtained from high school counselors and local libraries or by using scholarship search <Link>engines. More information on scholarships is available here (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/go/outsidescholarships/</Link>). Current students may also research direct apply scholarship information at the Fellowships Ofﬁce. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Employer Beneﬁt </H4><P>When a parent receives a tuition beneﬁt through an employer, this funding is treated as an outside scholarship, ﬁrst reducing need-based loans and student employment (federal and institutional) and then any College grant. Tuition grants may only cover tuition. If a combination of tuition grants or scholarships from the College and employers/scholarship agencies exceeds tuition costs, the non-need-based grants from the College will be adjusted accordingly. If a parent receives a tuition beneﬁt for student educational expenses and this beneﬁt is not listed in the ﬁnancial aid package, please notify Student Financial Services. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Veterans’ Beneﬁts (Including Yellow Ribbon) </H4><P>Veterans’ beneﬁts will be treated as other outside scholarships for the purposes of determining remaining institutional grant eligibility for dependent students. These beneﬁts include housing allowances and book stipends sent directly to the student. Mount Holyoke participates in the Yellow Ribbon program with a matching grant of up to $10,000 per student per year for undergraduates. </P><P>Those eligible for Veterans' beneﬁts may note that all eligible resident instruction is provided at the College's main campus: Mount Holyoke College, 50 College Street, South Hadley, Massachusetts 01075. The 01075 zip code therefore is used by the Veterans Administration in calculating the Monthly Housing Allowance for those who qualify for this allowance. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Financial Aid for Study Abroad and Other Off-Campus Study </H4><P>To support study abroad, Mount Holyoke offers the Laurel Fellowship which is need-based grant aid. Other Mount Holyoke scholarships and grants, including Tuition Assistance Grants or MHC Microscholarships, cannot be used for study abroad. Students studying abroad who are U.S. Citizens and permanent residents are eligible for federal ﬁnancial aid. In order to determine eligibility for the Laurel Fellowship, students must be approved by the McCullough Center for Global Initiatives, submit a consortium agreement from the study abroad program, and complete a ﬁnancial aid application. For those receiving only federal ﬁnancial aid, a consortium agreement is also required. Mount Holyoke does not charge the student MHC tuition or room and board for study abroad in most cases. Typically, students pay the program fees directly to the program. Any ﬁnancial aid (including educational ﬁnancing) will be credited to the student account and applied toward Mount Holyoke charges (e.g. Study Abroad Administrative Fee, currently $900 per semester). Any excess credit balance will be sent to the student to assist with program expenses. To receive the credit balance a student must complete a Disbursement Form, available on the Student Financial Services website. </P><P>For more information about available funds and application procedures, <Link>visit the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives website (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/global/</Link>). In addition, please see the information <Link>about study abroad in the Special Programs and Resources (p. 15) </Link>chapter under The Dorothy R. and Norman E. McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Financial Aid Policies Disbursing Funds </H2><P>Financial aid funds are disbursed on a per-semester basis and are disbursed at the beginning of each semester provided a student has completed all ﬁnancial aid application requirements including loan requirements. Students should sign in to  <Link>Financial Aid Online (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/go/ﬁnaidonline/</Link>) for information regarding missing information. </P><P>For both initial and returning applicants, a student cannot start classes or move into a residence hall until the appropriate semester fees have been paid in full or provisions for payment plans and/or loans have been approved by Student Financial Services. To order transcripts, current and former students' loans and student accounts must be in good standing with no past due balances. </P><Sect><H4>Academic Standing and Satisfactory Academic Progress </H4><P>Continued receipt of federal and institutional ﬁnancial aid depends on a student meeting the academic progress standards based on the quantitative and qualitative standards described below. The Ofﬁce of Student Financial Services participates in the Academic Advisory Board’s review of student records for satisfactory academic progress at the end of each semester. Note that institutional eligibility for satisfactory academic progress is more stringent than federal. </P><Sect><H5>Quantitative Standard </H5><P>Though Mount Holyoke College does not have an explicit maximum time frame in which all students must complete their degree program, the College monitors earned credits. Students who fall behind in credits corresponding to their grade level or class standing are reclassiﬁed into the appropriate grade level. To meet the quantitative standard, a student must fall no more than eight credits behind their expected class standing (four for seniors). Class standing is deﬁned as follows: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Sophomore standing: 24 credits within two semesters </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Junior standing: 56 credits within four semesters </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Senior standing: 92 credits within six semesters </LBody></LI></L><P>In addition, any full-time student who does not earn at least eight </P><P>(8) credits in a semester is not meeting the institutional quantitative standard. </P><P>The maximum enrollment time frame for students to maintain eligibility for federal ﬁnancial aid is 150 percent. For a four-year bachelor’s degree this is equal to six years of full-time enrollment. The maximum time frame for part-time Frances Perkins students is also equivalent to 150 percent of the time to completion based on their enrollment level. </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Full-time = 4 academic years or 6 academic years (maximum) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Three-quarter time = 5.5 academic years or 8 academic years (maximum) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Half-time = 8 academic years or 12 academic years (maximum) </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H5>Qualitative Standard </H5><P>Mount Holyoke’s qualitative standard for making satisfactory academic progress requires that students meet the 2.0 cumulative GPA required for graduation by the end of their second year and not fall below a 1.75 GPA before that. </P></Sect><Sect><H5>Consequences of Academic Deﬁciencies </H5><P>Academic deﬁciencies are reviewed by the Academic Advisory Board (AAB) after grades are posted each term. Failure to meet any of the criteria listed above could result in a range of institutional actions, from a warning on credits, placing the student on academic probation, suspension for one semester or year, or academic dismissal. A student on academic probation who fails to regain good standing after one semester may be subject to suspension or dismissal by the Academic Advisory Board. If a student demonstrates exceptionally poor academic performance, the college may suspend that student immediately, rather than ﬁrst placing the student on academic probation. Students will not be placed on probation or warned for insufﬁcient semester credits when credit standards are not met solely on the basis of a reduced course load approved by AccessAbility Services. </P><P>Students placed on academic probation are eligible for federal and institutional ﬁnancial aid for the ﬁrst semester they are on academic probation. If academic probation is continued for a consecutive semester, eligibility for federal ﬁnancial aid will be revoked. Students will be eligible for institutional ﬁnancial aid for the second semester of academic </P><P>Full PDF 41 </P><P>probation. Students will not be eligible for institutional or federal ﬁnancial aid if they remain on academic probation for a third semester. </P><P>Non-need-based scholarships, awards, or grants from the College will not be renewed if a student is placed on continued academic probation; is required to withdraw; or is suspended due to academic or behavioral reasons including violations of the honor code. Non-need-based aid cannot be reinstated once lost. Non-need-based aid includes the following scholarships and awards: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Trustee Scholarship </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Posse Scholarship </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>21st Century Scholarship </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>J.

The appeal must contain an explanation of why the student failed to make satisfactory academic progress, an explanation of what has changed so that the student can now make satisfactory academic progress, and any resources implemented to ensure the student's academic success in the next semester. Students will automatically regain institutional and federal need-based eligibility for ﬁnancial aid after achieving satisfactory academic progress and removal from academic probation. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H4>Funding Limitations </H4><P>Resident students who enter as ﬁrst-time, ﬁrst-year students are eligible for a maximum of eight semesters of ﬁnancial aid, need-based or nonneed-based, from Mount Holyoke. College funding for transfer students and on-campus (resident) Frances Perkins students is limited based on the total number of credits accepted for transfer at any point (e.g. a student who transfers in 64 credits is eligible for a maximum of four semesters of College funding). Off-campus (commuting) Frances Perkins students receive funding for up to 128 attempted credits including any credits transferred to Mount Holyoke. Credits transferred to the College due to a semester or year of study abroad or academic leave will count toward the semester limit, whether or not ﬁnancial aid from the College was provided for these credits. Students should plan their course of study with these maximums in mind. All resident students are expected to take 16 credits per semester unless approved for a reduced course load due to a medical accommodation. Regardless of the numbers of credits attempted in a semester, a semester of residence will count as 16 credits toward the 128 credit limit. Commuting Frances Perkins students must take a minimum of eight credits a semester to be considered for ﬁnancial aid. Students may appeal the loss of funding eligibility based on transferring in credits if the credits are needed to replace courses attempted at Mount Holyoke College but not earned. Students should submit appeals with supporting documentation to Student Financial Services. Please refer to the Student Financial Services website for additional information on funding limitations including a conversion table for transfer credits to equivalent semesters of funding eligibility. Students who must take a nonacademic leave for medical reasons after a semester has begun may request an additional semester of need-based funding at </P><P>Fellowships for Mount Holyoke Alumnae and Graduating Seniors </P><P>a later date, if needed, by writing to Student Financial Services with the request and authorizing Health or Counseling Services to verify the leave was for medical reasons. Student Financial Services may also request conﬁrmation from the Ofﬁce of Academic Deans that the additional semester is required to complete the degree.

The certiﬁcate of eligibility may be a &quot;Statement of Beneﬁts&quot; obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs' website, eBeneﬁts. During this period, no penalty will be imposed upon the covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her ﬁnancial obligations to the College due to the delayed disbursement of funding from the VA under chapter 33. </P><P>Penalties to be suspended during this period include assessment of late fees, denial of access to classes or institutional facilities, and any requirement that the covered individual borrow additional funds.

We take our inspiration from centuries of apprentice-style artist training in some indigenous West African societies. The evolution of oral and popular performance traditions into literary theatre has also necessitated a similar trend in the training of the modern actor. The primary object of this class is to be able to embody a plethora of idiomatic expressions. Thus, we will move to the energy of the drums, we will train the ears to transmit the complex musicality of several sonic elements and raise our voices in song and apply them in scene explorations.

Credits: 4 </P><P>One of the most signiﬁcant shifts in global history is the incorporation of the New World into the Afro-Eurasian trading system. Slowly, but surely, the Mediterranean declined as a hub of inter-continental trade, and the Atlantic Ocean gained ground. On West Africa's Shores analyzes this world-historical pivot from the perspective of West Africa. Beginning with the rise of the Ghana Empire, we study trans-Saharan cultures of exchange, the societies of West Africa's Middle Ages, and the ways that the trans-Atlantic slave trade transformed the region. A special focus on art and artefacts helps us imagine the worlds of West Africa over the course of a millennium. </P><P>Crosslisted as: HIST-242 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>E.

Over a century later, President Trump would designate COVID-19 the &quot;Chinese virus,&quot; reigniting anxieties of &quot;Yellow Peril,&quot; even as reports of anti-Asian violence spiked nationwide. This course aims to bridge these two moments by examining the social, political, and historical contexts that come to bear on contemporary Asian American experience. Focusing on East and Southeast Asian communities, we explore issues of citizenship, belonging, labor, representation and resistance, considering how theories of race, class and gender intersect with national and intergenerational identities. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Since the mid-nineteenth century, Americans have viewed Japan as the Orient's most exotic and mysterious recess, alternately enticing and frightening in its difference. Intense economic relations and cultural exchange between Japan and the U.S. have not dispelled the image of Japanese society and culture as fundamentally different from our own. In this course, we will strive for greater understanding of shared experiences as well as historical particularities. Issues covered may vary from one semester to another, but frequently focus on work, women, minorities, and popular culture. Films and anthropological works provide ethnographic examples of some key concepts. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

This course examines exchange systems cross-culturally, in order to understand their cultural signiﬁcance and social consequences. It explores how our own commodity exchange system, which appears to be no more than an efﬁcient means of distributing goods and services, in fact contains intriguing symbolic dimensions similar to the gift exchange systems of Native North America, Melanesia, and Africa. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

Indeed, during the ﬁnal decades of the twentieth century, much of the region embraced neoliberal governance and free market capitalism. However, by the turn of the millennium, many Latin American governments had made a sharp &quot;turn to the Left,&quot; as states began to intervened more directly in the economy, promote alternative imaginings of modernization, and recognize greater rights for Indigenous and Afro-descendent peoples. This course will begin with a focus on these shifts in governance, but largely focuses on the consequences of these changes within people's everyday lives. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>W.

It begins with an investigation of the proto-racial and religious categories through which Europeans in the early modern era conceived of human difference. We then trace how the encounter between Europeans, Africans, and Indigenous Peoples transformed these notions, with particular attention to how the overlapping racial and religious hierarchies that emerged were both constructed and resisted. We conclude with a series of ethnographies that highlight the contemporary entanglements of race and religion in the region. </P><P>Crosslisted as: RELIG-225LT Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>W.

In short, how can we understand the historically powerful relationship between race and nature? Drawing on anthropology and critical race theory, this course examines how race and nature work to convey &quot;timeless truths&quot;, inform notions of difference, and justify inequalities. To these ends, we analyze ideas of wilderness/wildness, biological racism, human-animal relations, and environmental disasters to explore how race gets naturalized, and nature racialized. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-249RN Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

Anthropology narrates collective feeling, gives form to the ambience. But what is late industrialism's ambience? As factory buildings crumble, we wonder whether the tap water's clean. The question of how to write the world is also a question of how to survive and even flourish. Drawing from archaeology, cultural anthropology, ecology, and literary theory, this course is a writing-oriented study of contemporary experiences of infrastructural failure, capitalist collapse, and ruination.

With an eye toward these contradictions, this course begins by asking: What is toxicity? How does it enter our awareness? Who bears the burden of its designation? From here, we consider how the uncertainty of toxic exposure shapes the politics of evidence, social difference, and assumptions about the integrity of bodies and nations. Connecting ethnographies of environmental exposure and contamination with larger contexts, histories, and settler colonial logics, we investigate relations of segregation, contingency, and kinship in uneven terrains of vulnerability and risk. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349LE Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

For many of us, the answer is obvious: the world without religious belief, or the separation of church and state, or even the &quot;really real&quot; world. In recent years, scholars in number ﬁelds have begun to question these common sense notions about secularism. In this course, we will investigate this rapidly expanding literature and the critical lines of inquiry it has opened up: Under what speciﬁc cultural and historic conditions did secularism ﬁrst emerge? Is secularism experienced today in the same way throughout the world? If not, how do they vary? What ways of being and living does secularism encourage or allow to flourish? Which does it stunt, block, or prohibit? </P><P>Crosslisted as: RELIG-331SE Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>W.

Credits: 4 </P><P>What makes a home feel like home? What makes a neighborhood feel alive and vibrant? Architects and urban planners develop elaborate designs meant for speciﬁc kinds of human uses, and yet we ﬁnd that people often use spaces for purposes quite different from those that planners intended. In this course, we will explore the ways in which people dwell in the abstract spaces of planners, turning them into inhabited places. We will also explore the ways that people navigate through and between these spaces that have been compartmentalized into politically and socially bounded units. A variety of theoretical perspectives will be applied in diverse cultural cases to better understand the ways in which peoples inhabit the world. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>There's a low buzz; we feel nervous. Is this capitalism's end? Have zombie silhouettes hit the horizon yet? Keep checking. Anthropology narrates collective feelings, gives form to the ambience. But what's the ambience of late industrialism; what's it feel like to collapse? As we watch factory buildings crumble, we wonder whether the tap water's clean. The question of how to write the world (anthropologicallyspeaking) must also be a question of how to survive, thrive, and even flourish. Archaeologists have long explored decadence, collapse, and ruins. Cultural anthropologists now ﬁnd themselves in the archaeologists' shoes. Drawing from archaeology, cultural anthropology, ecology, and literary theory, this course will be an open-ended, writing-oriented examination of contemporary experiences of ruins and ruination. One area of focus is the effects of capitalism and post-industrialism on people of color and non-English speakers in North America. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349WC Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>M.

We will examine moments of major change in the arts through close attention to speciﬁc themes, individuals, and works from the last seven centuries. The goal is not a fact-ﬁlled, comprehensive, strictly chronological overview, but rather an understanding of the ways in which the western visual legacy has profoundly shaped how we see the world around us. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>C.

In the service of domestic life, religious ritual, political agendas, commerce, and leisure, architecture reflects and shapes the natural environment, technology, economics, and aesthetic taste. While the history of Western architecture constitutes the primary touchstone, we will pursue themes that include sites and buildings, cities, and sites from around the world. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This survey outlines the arts in Italy from the late thirteenth to sixteenth centuries, a time of major cultural transformation. Our approach will be primarily geographic, focusing on individual cities and courts in order to understand the social networks that linked artists with their patrons and publics. We will also address key themes such as the functions of art; the role of women in the arts; the changing status of artists; portraiture and the fashioning of identity; the rise of print; art and ideas about faith, love, desire, and marriage; and the cross-cultural links between Italian artists and their colleagues far away. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

We will look at developments in panel painting, manuscript illumination, printmaking, and sculpture from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries-examining shifting patterns of patronage and production along with shifting styles, techniques, and media. We will consider major artists like Jan van Eyck, Albrecht Durer, and Pieter Bruegel, as well as seismic cultural shifts such as the print revolution, the emergence of the woman artist, the Reformation, and the origins of the art market. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course focuses on architecture in Italy--including churches, palaces, villas, and urban planning--from the 1400s to the 1600s. In this period, architects took their cues from the classical tradition even as they carved out their own territory, developing new techniques and perfecting old ones to realize their designs. We will trace shifting architectural practice through key ﬁgures from Brunelleschi to Bernini, and through the lens of larger cultural forces. We will also examine buildings in light of the painted and sculpted decorative programs that were often integral to their overall effect. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This class turns away from the conventional Eurocentric narrative of the Renaissance, reframing it as a time when exploration and cross-cultural encounters inspired a rich and varied array of art, architecture, and sculpture. The objects we will examine include world maps from Europe and China, West African ivories, Benin bronzes, Indian miniatures, Islamic metalwork, Mexican feather paintings, Aztec cartography, colonial Latin American buildings and murals, as well as European paintings and illustrated books. All of these items speak to expanding networks of trade and conquest. Collectively, they show just how global and connected the Renaissance world really was. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

This chronology represents one of the most important transformations in the history of art: the origins and early development of what we today call &quot;modern art.&quot; We will spend considerable time tracing this difﬁcult passage, pausing here and there to readjust ourselves to the shifting language of art and to orient art's relationship to the modern public. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>A.

Emphasizing the United States against the background of European developments, the course considers the search by architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and Frank Gehry, for a language of form and space that captures the contemporary spirit as it elevates society to a higher plane of existence. Discussion focuses on issues of technology and utopia, the skyscraper, and the collision of tradition, modernity, and postmodernism in architecture since 1945. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>M.

We will begin with both the &quot;climax&quot; and &quot;crisis&quot; of modernism in midcentury and the movements and works that the crisis spawned. In the second half of the course, we will follow art's relationship to a variety of postmodern subjects and debates. Throughout, we will measure the effects of geopolitical tensions on the visual arts. On a weekly basis, we will read a wide range of primary and secondary sources, with essays by art historians, critics, and artists. Overall, we will try to understand ambitious art's relationship with key social, political, and cultural developments during an intense four decades of worldwide change and uncertainty. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>A.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The world's ﬁrst large, vibrant, and developed cities arose in antiquity, fundamentally changing the lives of those who inhabited these ancient urban centers. Cities became places not only with large populations, but also economic and religious centers, venues in which the powerful could communicate their authority, and loci of social change. This course introduces the urban centers of the ancient Middle East, Egypt, and Mediterranean and also interrogates processes of urbanization and how urbanization affected residents of ancient cities. The city will be the lens through which we will investigate ancient politics, religion, social organizations, and cultures. We will study cities as dynamic environments, as places that were constructed by people but that also influenced the people inhabiting them. To accomplish these goals, we will make extensive use of archaeological evidence and will closely examine the public spaces, religious structures, houses, and infrastructures constructed in ancient cities. This course will begin with some of the earliest cities on earth, in Mesopotamia and Egypt, then will progress to cities of the Greco-Roman Mediterranean, and will culminate with the creation of Christian cities in late antiquity. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-239AC Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>K.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In this course we will examine how medieval European thinkers and artists theorized and visualized the body in ways that are vastly different from how the body is conceptualized today. Indeed, the &quot;medieval body" was not a monolithic entity, but rather a shifting constellation of ideas and practices that waxed, waned, and coexisted throughout the Middle Ages. A body could be understood as an earthly body -- sexed, fleshly, corruptible -- as well as a heavenly and divine body, including Christ's own. Our considerations will further contextualize representations of gendered, racialized, clerical, monstrous, animal, virginal, non-Christian, heretical, and resurrected bodies. Artworks and monuments include icons, reliquaries, altarpieces and other church decorations and liturgical objects, sculptural programs, illuminated manuscripts, prints, and incunabula. </P><P>Crosslisted as: RELIG-225MB Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>C.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Ancient peoples produced some of the most striking and signiﬁcant works of art known to man, architecture like the Great Pyramids at Giza, sculpture like the Aphrodite of Knidos and the Prima Porta of Augustus, and literature like The Iliad and The Book of Songs. We will examine materials that span the Neolithic Period to roughly 400 CE, approximately when three great empires, the Roman, the Gupta, and the Han, came to an end. We will cover a broad geographic area, including the Middle East, Egypt, Greece, Rome, India, and China. Our goal will not simply be to gain an appreciation for the aesthetic and technical excellence of works of art, but we will contextualize, analyze, and interrogate them to better understand the peoples who produced them, along with their institutions, cultures, and lived experiences. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-239QU Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>K.

This course considers &quot;the museum&quot; as an object of ethnographic inquiry, examining it as a cultural institution perpetually under negotiation and reconﬁguration. We reflect on how museum principles of classiﬁcation, practices of collection and exhibition, and the uptake of digital technologies are central to what and how we know. We investigate and analyze museums as social actors in anthropological debates on power, representation, materiality, value, authenticity, state-making, Indigenous sovereignty, and the preservation and activation of contemporary cultures. The museum is never simply a repository of artifacts, artworks, histories, or scientiﬁc inventions, but also a site of tremendous creativity and a ﬁeld of complex social relations. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ANTHR-316MU Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>S.

As we will discover, the four artists were hardly a uniﬁed group, took distinct paths away from Impressionism, and pursued projects that had limited allegiance to its main tenets or, indeed, to the ideas and practices of each other.

Many of their works, in particular, take gender and gender ideology/politics at issue, while deviating from the traditional discourse that marginalized or trivialized women, exploring creative and effective ways of literary dialogue and imagination. This course will cover women writers from both modern (1911-1949) and contemporary (1949-present) times. Some of the representative women writers include: Ding Ling, Xiao Hong, Zhang Ailing, Zong Pu, Yang Jiang, Wang Anyi, Tie Ning, etc. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>Y.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Setting their historical novels in the Middle Ages, contemporary Arab writers such as Radwa Ashour, Jurjy Zaydan, Gamal al-Ghitani and Bensalem Himmich have reflected into the past the problems of present Middle-Eastern societies. Writing from Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco, they revisited with nostalgia the extraordinary medieval heritage of the Arab-Islamic world, educating their readers while taking them on journeys to Medieval Andalusia, to the last years of the Baghdad of the caliphs, and to Cairo on eve of the Ottoman conquest. By looking into the medieval mirror, these authors challenged conservative readings of this heritage. In doing so, they contributed to the modernization of their countries and were able to escape censorship, uphold feminist values, and to criticize Western imperialism and oppressive Arab rulers. In this course, we will read their works in valuable English translations, while discussing their extraordinary lives as twentieth-century writers, intellectuals, and activists. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349MR Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>M.

We are interested not only in describing these things, but in understanding how they are formed and how they change, and, ultimately, in reconstructing the history of the universe. </P><P>This understanding is always based upon the same set of theories and practices—physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, geology, mathematics, computer science—that we use to understand the earth and its immediate surroundings. Thus, all students are strongly encouraged to base their study of the universe upon a ﬁrm grounding in one of these disciplines. </P><P>All 100-level courses are taught by Mount Holyoke faculty and staff. Courses at the 200 level and above are staffed collectively by faculty in the Five College Department (as listed above); many of them will be offered off-campus. Students are urged to consult the department to assist in planning a program of study that takes advantage of the rich variety of course opportunities. Through advising, the exact program is always tailored to the student’s particular strengths, interests, and plans. </P><P>Astronomical facilities at all ﬁve institutions are available for student use. The Williston Observatory at Mount Holyoke includes a historic Clark 8” telescope. The McConnell Rooftop Observatory at Smith College includes two computer-controlled Schmidt Cassegrain telescopes, and the Amherst Observatory has a Clark 18” refractor. </P><Sect><H4>Contact Information </H4><Sect><H6>Darby Dyar, Chair Nicole Amrani, Academic Department Coordinator </H6><P>206 Kendade Hall 413-538-2238 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/astronomy (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/astronomy/</Link>) </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Learning Goals </H2><P>Learning goals for introductory-level astronomy classes: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understand fundamental concepts in astronomy such as gravity, the nature of light, the origin of the universe, and physical characteristics of matter. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Demonstrate skills for quantitative analyses, including the ability to form a hypothesis, graphically represent and interpret data, estimate error and understand sampling bias. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Critically evaluate representations of science in all types of media. </LBody></LI></L><P>Learning goals for advanced astronomy classes: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Demonstrate proﬁciency in fundamental concepts in each of the major areas of astronomy: cosmology, planetary science, galaxies, stellar structure, and the universe. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Show a working knowledge of a broad array of physical phenomena that are based upon fundamental concepts. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Gain familiarity with instrumentation, computational methods and software resources utilized by professional astronomers. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understand the variety of career paths and opportunities that are open to students who have majored in astronomy. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Exhibit a proﬁciency in the methods of scientiﬁc inquiry in laboratory and/or research projects. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Demonstrate use of critical thinking skills in well-organized, logical and scientiﬁcally sound oral and written scientiﬁc reports. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Mount Holyoke Faculty </H2><Sect><H5>This area of study is administered by the Astronomy department and is a collaborative program through the Five College Department of Astronomy (FCAD): </H5><P>Darby Dyar, Kennedy-Schelkunoff Professor of Astronomy </P><P>Thomas Burbine, Visiting Lecturer in Astronomy </P><P>Jason Young, Visiting Lecturer in Astronomy </P><P>Full PDF 91 </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Five College Faculty </H2><P>Calzetti, Edwards, Erickson, Follette, Giavalisco, Gutermuth, Hameed, Hanner, Heyer, Irvine, Katz, Lowenthal, Mo, Narayanan, Offner, Pope, Schloerb, Schneider, Snell, Stage, Tripp (Five College chair), Wang, Weinberg, Wilson, Yun </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Requirements for the Major </H2><P>The astronomy major is designed to provide a good foundation in modern science with a focus on astronomy.

Any off-campus biology course taken to satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement requirement must have a laboratory component. Courses that are introductions to professional specialties dependent on biology (e.g., nutrition or horticulture), or are addressed to technical certiﬁcation (e.g., emergency medical technician), do not satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Introductory Biology </H4><P>The department offers introductory biology in two different forms. The BIOL-145 courses (e.g. BIOL-145AB, BIOL-145GW, etc.) are a liberal arts introduction to biology in a small-class atmosphere. Different sections emphasize different topics. BIOL-160, which must be taken concurrently with CHEM-160, offers an integrated introduction to biology and chemistry. Either one is an appropriate choice for students who are considering a major in biology, biochemistry, or environmental studies. Completion of any of these courses will allow a student to enroll in BIOL-200. Students are welcome to email the instructors to ﬁnd out more about any of the introductory courses. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Course Advice for Majors </H4><P>Majors are strongly encouraged to complete the following course work outside of biological sciences: Organic Chemistry (CHEM-202 and CHEM-302), as well as additional coursework in Physics and Computer Science. </P><P>It is not difﬁcult to major in Biological Sciences and go off-campus for one or two semesters. For instance, other places are better situated to study tropical rain forests, deserts, or the ocean. Students have also received credit toward the biology major for course work done in French at partner universities in Montpellier. Mount Holyoke College has special relationships with several other programs abroad. It is not safe to assume, however, that biology courses taken through any program off-campus will count toward requirements of the Biology major. Before enrolling in study away from the College, it is essential to talk about your goals and speciﬁc plans with the Chair of Biology or a designated faculty member. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Offerings </H2><P>BIOL-145 Introductory Biology </P><Sect><H6>BIOL-145AB Introductory Biology: 'Animal Bodies, Animal Functions' </H6><P>Not Scheduled for This Year.

Literary genres (such as epic poetry, drama, and historiography), political institutions and ideals (such as democracy and free speech), as well as principles of philosophy and science are all part of the rich legacy that the ancient Greeks and Romans bequeathed to western Europe. Many of their ideas and institutions were consciously revived in the Renaissance and Enlightenment and remain with us today. </P><P>Classics combines the study of both ancient Greek and Latin with courses in ancient history, art, philosophy, politics, and religion. The department therefore offers courses in the ancient languages at all levels as well as a wide array of courses (taught in English) approaching the culture and history of Greek and Roman antiquity from a variety of perspectives. </P><P>In addition to classics, the department offers majors in Greek, Latin, and ancient studies. Ancient studies approaches Greek and Roman civilizations from an interdisciplinary perspective with less emphasis on the ancient languages. There are also minors related to each of these majors. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Abroad </H2><P>The department encourages study abroad. In recent years a number of students in the department have spent part of their junior year at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies (ICCS) in Rome. Some have pursued their studies at Oxford, Saint Andrews, and other institutions in United Kingdom. College Year in Athens also offers one-semester programs in Greece. Students who anticipate taking an advanced degree in archaeology, ancient art history, ancient history, or classics can apply to summer sessions of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>See Also </H2><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Ancient Studies (p. 56) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Greek (p. 258) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Latin (p. 283) </Link></LBody></LI></L><Sect><H4>Contact Information </H4><Sect><H6>Geoff Sumi, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </H6><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/classics (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/classics/</Link>) </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Learning Goals </H2><P>Learning goals for students of classics and ancient studies are: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To analyze critically ancient Greek and Roman texts, in their original languages and in translation, within their literary, philosophical, and historical contexts. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To understand major monuments and artifacts within their historical and cultural settings; to develop a visual literacy of ancient art and sharpen the ability to see and express what one sees. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To imagine fully and creatively ancient cultural communities when relying on limited written and material remains. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To deepen the understanding of current problems by studying the responses of ancient Greeks and Romans to questions about the human condition, including, how to live well, and how to govern. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To write and speak more conﬁdently and effectively, and to develop well-reasoned arguments using primary evidence and/or secondary material, including print and digital resources. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To expand intellectual breadth through studying the ancient Greek and Roman worlds through different disciplines and modes of inquiry. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Faculty </H2><Sect><H5>This area of study is administered by the Department of Classics and Italian.

She may serve, therefore, as a lens through which one may view social and political tensions within Roman society over the nature of authority and empire. Readings include Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Lucan, Caesar, Sallust, Plutarch and the plays of Shakespeare and Shaw, where she is ambivalently portrayed as a woman who desires power or, contrariwise, as a romantic idealist who scorns temporal powers in fulﬁllment of private desires. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>B.

The searing question of why human societies and the human psyche repeatedly break down in tragic ruin and loss, particularly in the conflicts of war and in the betrayal of personal bonds of love and friendship, fascinated them as it still does us. The most consistent themes that emerged from such examination are the tragedy of self-knowledge and illusion, the tragedy of desire, the tragedy of crime and redemption, and tragedy as a protest against social injustice. This course examines the critical influence of the three most important Athenian dramatists, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, on the works of Nobel winner Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and important ﬁlmmakers, who have tried to recreate the powerful atmosphere and impact of the Greek tragic theater or reworked the tragic themes of classical myth for their own purposes in the modern age. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>B.

Credits: 4 Bread and circuses (panem et circenses) was a catchphrase in the Roman empire that described the political strategy of controlling an unruly populace through free bread and public entertainment. Against a backdrop of Roman social and political institutions, this course focuses on the imperial ideology, aristocratic ethos, and cultural practices that underpinned this catchphrase, as well as questions concerning the careers of entertainers--gladiators, charioteers, and actors--who were at once celebrities and social outcasts; the rules of spectatorship at the games; the use of these games as a form of social control; and the logistics of feeding the city population. </P><P>Crosslisted as: HIST-226 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

Among themes to be explored are political structures, trade, slavery, gender relations, and religion, as well as the contributions of ancient Greeks to literary genres (drama, rhetoric, historiography, philosophy) and to the visual arts. Throughout we will consider how the history of the ancient Greeks can speak to modern concerns. Sources will include works of ancient Greek literature and history (e.g., Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Plutarch) as well as archaeological and epigraphic evidence. </P><P>Crosslisted as: HIST-227 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>P.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Ancient Rome and its empire can be viewed both as a measure of human achievement and a cautionary tale of the corrupting effects of unbridled power. This course covers the history of Ancient Rome from its mythologized beginnings (753 BCE) to the rise and spread of Christianity under the Emperor Constantine (312 CE). Topics include the creation and development of Rome's republican form of government as well as its eventual transition to monarchy, the causes and consequences of the acquisition of empire, the role of the army in administering the provinces and defending the frontiers, the image of emperor, the economy, and religion. </P><P>Crosslisted as: HIST-228 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

The history of the Roman empire is replete with scandalous stories about eccentric and even insane emperors whose reigns raise questions about the nature of the emperor's power and his role in administering the empire. In this course a close study of Roman imperial biography and historiography--the source of so many of these stories of bad emperors-will be weighed against documentary and archaeological evidence in order to reveal the dynamic between the emperor, his court, and his subjects that was fundamental to the political culture of imperial Rome. </P><P>Crosslisted as: HIST-229 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

The literature and artwork of the ancient world are ﬁlled with images of the two faces of war: it conferred great glory on the combatants but at the cost of tremendous horror and suffering. In this course we will examine warfare from archaic Greece and the rise of the city-state (ca. 800 B.C.E.) to the fall of the Roman Empire in the west (ca. 476 C.E.). We will consider such topics as the culture and ethics of war and imperialism, logistics and strategies of warfare, as well as armor, weaponry and battleﬁeld tactics. </P><P>Crosslisted as: HIST-216 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The world's ﬁrst large, vibrant, and developed cities arose in antiquity, fundamentally changing the lives of those who inhabited these ancient urban centers. Cities became places not only with large populations, but also economic and religious centers, venues in which the powerful could communicate their authority, and loci of social change. This course introduces the urban centers of the ancient Middle East, Egypt, and Mediterranean and also interrogates processes of urbanization and how urbanization affected residents of ancient cities. The city will be the lens through which we will investigate ancient politics, religion, social organizations, and cultures. We will study cities as dynamic environments, as places that were constructed by people but that also influenced the people inhabiting them. To accomplish these goals, we will make extensive use of archaeological evidence and will closely examine the public spaces, religious structures, houses, and infrastructures constructed in ancient cities. This course will begin with some of the earliest cities on earth, in Mesopotamia and Egypt, then will progress to cities of the Greco-Roman Mediterranean, and will culminate with the creation of Christian cities in late antiquity. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ARTH-290AC Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>K.

We will examine materials that span the Neolithic Period to roughly 400 CE, approximately when three great empires, the Roman, the Gupta, and the Han, came to an end. We will cover a broad geographic area, including the Middle East, Egypt, Greece, Rome, India, and China. Our goal will not simply be to gain an appreciation for the aesthetic and technical excellence of works of art, but we will contextualize, analyze, and interrogate them to better understand the peoples who produced them, along with their institutions, cultures, and lived experiences. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ARTH-290QU Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>K.

In this course we will try to peer behind the &quot;Spartan mirage&quot; to determine how much the Spartans really differed from other ancient Greeks. We will then try to understand the use of Spartans as models for later polities and for groups like the Nazis and Alt-right. Topics: government, education, and citizenship; the role of women, eugenics, and slavery; the use and misuse of the image of Sparta.

In the ﬁrst half of the semester, we ground our understanding of the STEM experience at Mount Holyoke in national and global contexts, speciﬁcally looking at the way in in which gender, class, race, sexuality, and geographic upbringing might shape these experiences. We accomplish this through reading scholarly and popular literature and surveying existing evidence-based inclusive practices at a range of educational institutions. We supplement this research with interviews with members of the Mount Holyoke community. In the second half of the semester, students design their own group projects that apply the ﬁndings of their research to develop resources and encourage the STEM community, whether at the college, local, or national level.

We will gain practical hands-on experience with the many forms of microscopy and learn the procedures and tools of the trade necessary to become a proﬁcient microscopist. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Math Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive The department Prereq: 8 credits in STEM subjects. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2 id="LinkTarget_84783">Computer Science Overview and Contact Information </H2><P>Computer science is an exciting ﬁeld with applications to many disciplines across the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. The main role of a computer scientist is that of a problem solver. A degree in the ﬁeld signiﬁes formal training in computational and analytical approaches to problem solving as well as the skills necessary to develop software to tackle new challenges. These computational approaches can be applied to a wide spectrum of problems, including protein folding and flexibility, modeling and forecasting bird migration, improving the capabilities of search engines to retrieve the most relevant documents, understanding how the connectedness provided by social networks impact the lives we lead, supporting scientists in the management and analysis of the data they collect, and more. In truth, it is difﬁcult to think of a scenario in which the tools acquired in computer science do not provide a powerful advantage. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors </H2><P>To graduate with honors in computer science, a student must complete a project and write an accompanying thesis. This is often a full year commitment, during which the student works closely with a faculty member to explore a topic in depth by reading research papers, writing programs, and experimenting with ideas. Preliminary research usually begins in the summer following the junior year, with the student submitting and defending a thesis proposal early in the fall of the senior year. Upon department approval of this proposal, the student will </P><P>complete the research during the senior year, writing and defending the thesis in the spring. Some honors students attend conferences and/or coauthor papers with their mentors. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>See Also </H2><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Data Science (http://catalog.mtholyoke.edu/areas-study/data</Link><Link>science/</Link>) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Engineering (p. 167) </Link></LBody></LI></L><Sect><H4>Contact Information </H4><Sect><H6>Audrey St. John, Chair Wendy Queiros, Academic Department Coordinator </H6><P>200 Clapp Laboratory 413-538-2420 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/computerscience (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/computerscience/</Link>) </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Learning Goals </H2><P>The computer science curriculum is designed to encourage students to: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop the critical thinking skills to solve problems by designing and implementing algorithms. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop the analytical skills for reasoning about algorithmic complexity. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Be able to design, implement, test, and document computer programs that solve substantial computational problems. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Build skills for developing a working understanding of a complex code base and ability to effectively modify it. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Be able to think at multiple levels of detail and abstraction. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop a foundation that allows and encourages learning new and relevant skills and technologies as the ﬁeld evolves. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understand the interplay between theory and practice. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understand the interplay between software and hardware. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Be able to communicate clearly in written and oral form. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Be able to work effectively on a team. </LBody></LI></L><P>More speciﬁcally, students are expected to master the following concepts: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Computer programming — including working knowledge of at least two programming languages in different paradigms. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Data structures: an ability to use and implement fundamental abstract data types including queues, stacks, balanced search trees, hash tables, and graphs. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Abstraction to manage complexity. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Recursion and induction. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Algorithmic problem-solving: an ability to design, code, analyze, and prove the correctness of algorithms using recursive divide-andconquer, dynamic programming, and greedy approaches. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>The conceptual organization of computers—including both computer architecture (the hardware level) and operating system issues. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Data storage on a computer. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Applications of computing: an understanding of how computers, algorithms, programs, and/or data structures are used in several application areas. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Faculty </H2><Sect><H5>This area of study is administered by the Department of Computer Science: </H5><P>Valerie Barr, Jean E.

How might we grapple with the contradictions of the trapdoors, pitfalls, dark corners and glittering closets that structure and normalize violence for some while safeguarding violence for others? This course will center the 2017 anthology Trap Door: Trans Cultural Production and the Politics of Visibility.

Credits: 4 </P><P>A survey of philosophical, scientiﬁc, and theoretical approaches to the relation between cognition and representation. For as long as we have told stories, we have thought about how they work in conjunction with the mind. This course charts the many ways in which cognitive theory has shaped literary studies over the ages. How does ﬁction reflect the way we think? How in turn does it shape how we behave? What happens in the brain and body when we read? Starting in antiquity and working through history towards contemporary neuroscience and cognitive psychology, we will consider such matters as action and imitation; reality and fantasy; reason and imagination; aesthetics, empathy, and affect. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-268 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S.

What can exploring past and current portrayals of a cyberpunk future tell us about how we view Asia now? What can this aesthetic tell us about corporate dystopias? This course will look at ﬁlm and texts that interrogate the intersection of race, technology, history, nation, and capital flows. We will read novels such as Pattern Recognition, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, view ﬁlms such as Blade Runner, and view anime such as Howl's Moving Castle to learn about how historical and economic forces have shaped the way the future is imagined, and why the place of that reckoning resonates with Asia today. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-217CY Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

How does race, in turn, go beyond bodies to mark particular &quot;natural&quot; landscapes and nonhuman entities as other? In short, how can we understand the historically powerful relationship between race and nature? Drawing on anthropology and critical race theory, this course examines how race and nature work to convey &quot;timeless truths&quot;, inform notions of difference, and justify inequalities. To these ends, we analyze ideas of wilderness/wildness, biological racism, human-animal relations, and environmental disasters to explore how race gets naturalized, and nature racialized. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ANTHR-216RN Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Is Islam an American religion? Muslims in the United States have often been treated with suspicion and their religion viewed as foreign and incompatible with American values. Yet, Islam was present in North America since at least the 1700s in the lives of enslaved Africans. And it was theoretically included in the religions whose free exercise is protected by the First Amendment. This course traces the fraught and complex history of Islam and Muslims in North America, from the loss and preservation of Islamic practices under the regime of slavery through the reclamation of Islamic symbols and identities in African-American movements of the 20th century (e.g., The Moorish Science Temple, The Nation of Islam, and The Five-Percenters) to the rapid growth of a diverse immigrant Muslim community post-1965. Particular attention will be paid to: the intertwining of race, gender, and religion in the self-construction of Muslim identities and the policing of Muslim persons; the depictions of Islam and Muslims in U.S. society and politics; and the use of Islamic themes and symbols in contemporary popular culture, such as hip-hop. </P><P>Crosslisted as: RELIG-248 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>A.

As factory buildings crumble, we wonder whether the tap water's clean. The question of how to write the world is also a question of how to survive and even flourish. Drawing from archaeology, cultural anthropology, ecology, and literary theory, this course is a writing-oriented study of contemporary experiences of infrastructural failure, capitalist collapse, and ruination.

This course takes Hall's axiom as a starting point for considering the racial, gendered, and sexualized character of capitalist domination. Throughout the course students will explore both the political economy and the cultural imaginary of racial capitalism. One question we will grapple with is the following: if capital itself is as imperceptible and objectively real as gravity, what are the common tropes we use to apprehend its circulation? Is it the stock market ticker tape, the shipping container, or the industrial wasteland? Drawing on writers and artists of color from around the world, we will consider ways they offer cognitive maps of the gendered and sexualized contours of racial capitalism. Authors may include Octavia Butler, Chang-rae Lee, Leslie Marmon Silko, Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, and Ruth Ozeki.

What stigmas and hierarchies does the term &quot;under-development&quot; imply? Throughout Latin America, such language proves problematic not only as a material reality but also as a framework for understanding place, time, and selfhood. In this course, students rethink conventional wisdom about &quot;underdevelopment" through the study of writers, ﬁlmmakers, and painters from Latin America working at different historical junctures of the twentieth century. The course addresses works by Gabriel García Márquez, Subcomandante Marcos, José Martí, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, and others. </P><P>Crosslisted as: SPAN-350DE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

In this seminar, we will explore the relationship between Latina feminist theory, knowledge production, and social change in the United States. This interdisciplinary course explores Latina feminism in relation to methodology and epistemology through a historical lens. This will help us to better understand how Latina feminist approaches can inform our research questions, allow us to analyze women's experiences and women's history, and challenge patriarchy and gender inequality. We will explore topics related to knowledge production, philosophies of the &quot;self,&quot; positionality, inequality, the body, reproductive justice, representation, and community. Our approach in this class will employ an intersectional approach to feminist theory that understands the interconnectedness between multiple forms of oppression, including race, class, sexuality, and ability. Our goal is to develop a robust understanding of how Latina feminist methodologies and epistemologies can be tools for social change. </P><P>Crosslisted as: LATST-350FM, GNDST-333FM Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>V.

Begins with the life, work, and legacies of DuBois. Drawing on domestic and diasporic ﬁctional and nonﬁctional depictions of black life in the 'DuBoisian century' the course considers different responses to his 1903 question, 'How does it feel to be a problem?' The course examines the development and contemporary status of black modernity and postmodernity in the writings of Robinson, Smith, Davis, Ransby, YamahttaTaylor, and others. Our focus on DuBoisian thought culminates in a careful examination of the emergence of racial capitalism in the 21st century. </P><P>Crosslisted as: AFCNA-308 Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>L.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Toxins today pervade our lives and bodies. Yet they remain difﬁcult to pin down, simultaneously ubiquitous and elusive. With an eye toward these contradictions, this course begins by asking: What is toxicity? How does it enter our awareness? Who bears the burden of its designation? From here, we consider how the uncertainty of toxic exposure shapes the politics of evidence, social difference, and assumptions about the integrity of bodies and nations. Connecting ethnographies of environmental exposure and contamination with larger contexts, histories, and settler colonial logics, we investigate relations of segregation, contingency, and kinship in uneven terrains of vulnerability and risk. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ANTHR-349LE Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Housing is closely tied to quality of life and the health of neighborhoods and communities. As a main goal of the &quot;American Dream," homeownership has important signiﬁcance on an individual and societal level. For immigrants, this goal is often out of reach as a result of racism and discriminatory housing policies. This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latinas/os/x relationship to housing and homeownership by examining: 1. the history of housing policy in the United States; 2. national identity, assimilation, and housing; and 3. discriminatory housing policies/programs and housing inequality. We explore topics including immigration, housing policy, public housing, segregation, gentriﬁcation, the suburbs, homelessness, eviction, affordability, and community building. Exploring this range of topics will help us develop a clearer understanding of why housing is one of the most pressing issues for Latinas/os/x today. Students will engage in community- based research on affordable housing in communities in the Pioneer Valley. </P><P>Crosslisted as: LATST-350MC, GNDST-333MC Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Community-Based Learning, Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Setting their historical novels in the Middle Ages, contemporary Arab writers such as Radwa Ashour, Jurjy Zaydan, Gamal al-Ghitani and Bensalem Himmich have reflected into the past the problems of present Middle-Eastern societies. Writing from Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco, they revisited with nostalgia the extraordinary medieval heritage of the Arab-Islamic world, educating their readers while taking them on journeys to Medieval Andalusia, to the last years of the Baghdad of the caliphs, and to Cairo on eve of the Ottoman conquest. By looking into the medieval mirror, these authors challenged conservative readings of this heritage. In doing so, they contributed to the modernization of their countries and were able to escape censorship, uphold feminist values, and to criticize Western imperialism and oppressive Arab rulers. In this course, we will read their works in valuable English translations, while discussing their extraordinary lives as twentieth-century writers, intellectuals, and activists. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ASIAN-339 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>M.

Through animal rights? Justice? Abolition? Dismantle human exceptionalism? Animal emancipation? Companionship? Co-existence? Stewardship? What are the uses and limits of the discourses from which critical animal studies borrows conceptually, for example: antiracism, feminism, disability studies, nationalism, transformative justice, and so on. We will explore different scenarios of human-nonhuman entanglements, such as training, rescue, the animal industrial complex, the politics of extinction, hunting, infection, predation, breeding/reproduction and others. </P><P>Crosslisted as: GNDST-333MS Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>C.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The &quot;age of revolution&quot; saw revolts in the Black Atlantic world: Americans rebelled against the British; Native Americans opposed white colonists; bourgeoisie vied for power against the aristocracy; women decried patriarchal imprisonment; Latin American creoles resisted Spanish imperialists; and slaves threw off their masters. This course considers these diverse narratives of revolution as a series of social, political, and philosophical movements to change &quot;biopolitics&quot; (control of life) and &quot;necropolitics&quot; (control via death). We will read revolutionary tracts, slave narratives, and abolitionary literature alongside critical theory to consider how these authors offer ways of living and surviving Western, racial imperialisms. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-389 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>K.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Affect theory offers a varied and rich critical language to explore how emotion circulates within and among human bodies-and nonhuman ones as well. If emotions operate through bodily changes and chemical exchanges, then animals and nonhumans might similarly be seen as bodies replete with affective materials in motion and at rest. In this course we will read through an array of affect theory from cognitive science, animal studies, and posthumanist debates on the affect of objects. We will consider how humans know what they feel (and when), how animals love, how forests think, and how affects might cross human and nonhuman boundaries. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-382PW Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>K.

By studying religious body ideals and practices, we examine the possibilities and problems different kinds of bodies have posed in religious traditions. Topics include religious diet, exercise, and dress; monasticism, celibacy, and sexuality; healing rituals, and slavery and violence. We pay special attention to contemporary challenges to problematic body ideals and practices coming from feminist, disability, postcolonial, queer, and trans theorists and activists. </P><P>Crosslisted as: RELIG-352, GNDST-333RT Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S.

Credits: 4 </P><P>At once viewed as a dysfunction of normative ideas about sexuality, the family, and the nation, Black sexualities are intimately linked to and regulated by political and socioeconomic discourses. Slavery studies scholars remind us of how it has proven foundational for modern notions of race and sex by making explicit links between labor and exploitation. Thus, this course moves through themes such as slavery historicity, intersections between Black feminisms and Black sexualities, sexual labor/work, pleasure, and the erotic, in order to consider the stakes of our current critical approaches to Black sexual economies and interrogate its silences and possibilities. </P><P>Crosslisted as: GNDST-333SE, AFCNA-341SE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>S.

This course will center perspectives from various &quot;Third World Solidarity&quot; diasporas in order to challenge Western, hegemonic and inherent legacies of masculinity as modernity's (hu)man. Using critical race theory, feminist, queer/trans* of color critique (e.g., Wynter, Fanon, David Eng, José Muñoz), we will ask how whiteness (white supremacist masculinity) shapes and colors masculinity -- whether as exemplar, visible, illegible, failed, deviant and even toxic -- and what then falls outside of such a frame? </P><P>Crosslisted as: GNDST-333ST Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>R.

Credits: 4 </P><P>There's a low buzz; we feel nervous. Is this capitalism's end? Have zombie silhouettes hit the horizon yet? Keep checking. Anthropology narrates collective feelings, gives form to the ambience. But what's the ambience of late industrialism; what's it feel like to collapse? As we watch factory buildings crumble, we wonder whether the tap water's clean. The question of how to write the world (anthropologicallyspeaking) must also be a question of how to survive, thrive, and even flourish. Archaeologists have long explored decadence, collapse, and ruins. Cultural anthropologists now ﬁnd themselves in the archaeologists' shoes. Drawing from archaeology, cultural anthropology, ecology, and literary theory, this course will be an open-ended, writing-oriented examination of contemporary experiences of ruins and ruination. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ANTHR-316WC Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>M.

For example, students may learn to: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Recognize historical patterns of disease distribution, treatment, and health disparities </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Appreciate the value of integrating literature, philosophy, and the arts with studies in STEM ﬁelds (and vice versa) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop technical skills (such as research design, media literacy, gene editing, foreign languages, econometrics, doula training, or statistical analysis) to apply to health issues </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Navigate healthcare systems and be an advocate for themselves and others </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Apply contributions of multiple disciplines to the realm of public health, health promotion, cultural competence, disease eradication and global health </LBody></LI></L><P>Students learn how behavior influences disease distribution, how biomedical categories change across time and culture, and how political and socioeconomic factors affect disease and treatment. CHS students learn to interpret and communicate their results to diverse audiences. </P><P>CHS is led by a steering committee of faculty members from all ﬁve colleges and a range of disciplines. CHS students work with their campus advisors to articulate objectives, select courses, and conduct independent projects or internships. Faculty and students alike are enriched by the cross-campus connections and interdisciplinary collaborations that the Culture, Health, and Science program fosters — locally and globally. </P><P>For a complete list of CHS campus advisors, CHS-approved courses, internship opportunities, and upcoming events, see the<Link>certiﬁcate </Link><Link>website</Link> (<Link>https://www.ﬁvecolleges.edu/chs/</Link>). </P><Sect><H4>Contact Information </H4><Sect><H6>Rebeccah Lijek, Assistant Professor, Biological Sciences </H6><P><Link>https://www.ﬁvecolleges.edu/chs</Link> (<Link>https://www.ﬁvecolleges.edu/chs/</Link>) </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Requirements for the Certiﬁcate </H2><P>A minimum of seven courses and an independent research project: </P><Sect><H6>Code Title Credits </H6><P>Seven CHS-approved courses, with at least one course from each of the ﬁve categories of inquiry: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1.</Lbl><LBody> Biocultural Approaches: Interdisciplinary and/or comparative approaches that explore the interdependent influences on human health and disease </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2.</Lbl><LBody> Mechanisms of Disease Transmission: Mechanisms of disease transmission within individuals and populations </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3.</Lbl><LBody> Population, Health, and Disease: Exploring the relationships among social, behavioral, economic, and other aggregate population forces on human health and disease </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>4.</Lbl><LBody> Engaged and Humanistic Approaches: Ethical, humanistic, artistic, and engaged approaches to human health and disease, including explorations of healthcare practice, policy, and activism. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>5.</Lbl><LBody> Research Design and Analysis: Concepts of evidence, data collection, research ethics, measurement, and modes of analysis </LBody></LI></L><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_135.jpg"/></Figure><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_136.jpg"/></Figure><P>An approved independent research project, such as an internship, thesis, course project, independent study, or other activity acceptable to the student's campus CHS certiﬁcate advisor </P></Sect><Sect><H6>Total Courses </H6></Sect><Sect><H4>Additional Speciﬁcations </H4><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>No course can be used to satisfy more than one category. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>No more than three courses can “double count” toward a student’s major. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Four semesters—or the equivalent—of a second language is also recommended but not required.

Some sample pathways are described below: </P><P>Chemistry </P><P>Analytical and physical chemists often generate and analyze signiﬁcant amounts of data. Analysis methods learned in analytical or physical chemistry courses are regularly applied to organic, inorganic, or biochemical systems. Two course sequences highlighting both methods and systems could include (a) a course in analytical or physical chemistry and (b) a course with a focus on organic, inorganic, or biochemical materials. More data generation and analysis based two course sequences can be two courses in analytical and/ or physical chemistry. All ﬁrst courses in the above sub-areas of chemistry CHEM-150 General Chemistry: Foundations of Structure and Reactivity and some also require CHEM-202 Organic Chemistry I and/or MATH-203 Calculus III. </P><P>Economics </P><P>Data touches nearly all parts of economics by informing models and revealing patterns and causal relationships in data. Data science is becoming an essential part of every subﬁeld in economics. For example students interested in: (1) ﬁnance might take ECON-270 Accounting and ECON-215 Economics of Corporate Finance; (2) development might take ECON-213 Economic Development and ECON-218 ; (3) theory might take ECON-201 Game Theory and ECON-212 Microeconomic Theory. Almost all 200-level courses in economics require ECON-110 Introductory Economics as a prerequisite. </P><P>English </P><P>Digital Humanities and New Media Studies represent two humanities avenues for potential cross-pollination with data analysis. Topic modeling, text mining, and database construction for interactive editions of texts are examples of particular areas of digital humanities that lend themselves to asking interesting questions about large humanities corpora. Students interested in English and Data Science would take courses in literary analysis and at least one upper-level course in digital humanities in the Five Colleges. For example, students interested in: </P><P>(1) text analysis of literature and the environment might take ENGL-231 British Romanticism: Revolution and Reaction or ENGL-240 American Literature I and ENGL-366 Love, Sex, and Death in the Anthropocene, or Living Through the Age of Climate Change and Other Disasters. Alternately; (2) exploring large corpora might take ENGL-280 and another survey course offering breadth, e.g., ENGL-251 Contemporary African American Literature II or ENGL-241 American Literature II , ENGLISH-302 (UMass) Studies in Textuality and New Media or ENGL-390 (Amherst) Digital Humanities. Ideally, students would also take ENGL-199 Introduction to the Study of Literature. </P><P>Course Advice </P><P>The courses listed below form the core of the Data Science curriculum. In addition to core courses, students majoring in Data Science will take </P><P>courses from their selected domain areas in consultation with their Data Science advisors. </P><P>Course Offerings </P><P>DATA-295 Independent Study </P><P>Fall and Spring.

Complementing course work at Mount Holyoke are extracurricular activities and study abroad programs that broaden and deepen students’ understanding of Asia. </P><P>Language study is the core component of the major. We offer four levels of instruction in Chinese, three in Japanese, and two in Korean. Our students are expected to incorporate the humanities and the social sciences fully into their studies with classes at Mount Holyoke and the other colleges in the Five College Consortium. </P><P>On campus, our students experience regional culture at many levels, including language tables and clubs, guest lectures, performing and visual arts, ﬁlm, festivals, and regional cuisine. These activities are often initiated by and beneﬁt greatly from the diverse student population of Mount Holyoke and particularly the large numbers of students from Asian countries or with an Asian background. </P><P>Most of our students spend a semester or a summer in study abroad programs. Mount Holyoke College has afﬁliated programs or exchanges in China at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Peking University (summer), and University of Hong Kong; in Japan at the Associated Kyoto Program (year) and the Japan Women’s University; and in South Korea at the Ewha Womans University and the Sookmyung Women’s University. </P><P>East Asian Studies majors and minors graduate to pursue graduate studies and careers in ﬁelds as varied as law, education, business, NGOs, journalism, the arts, and government service. </P><P>Minors in Chinese and Japanese are available; see their own sections of the catalog. </P><P>See Also </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Asian Studies (p. 83) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Chinese (p. 111) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Japanese (p. 278) </Link></LBody></LI></L><P>Contact Information </P><P>Calvin Chen, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/asian (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/asian/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>By majoring in East Asian Studies, students should: </P><P>• Develop proﬁciency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.

The student will be in a position to apply these tools in a multitude of areas in a future career. Many of the world’s most pressing problems— discrimination, environmental destruction, inequality, inflation, poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment—are economic in nature. Economics is concerned with the study of the causes and the possible solutions to these and other economic and social problems. </P><P>Macroeconomics deals with the economy as a whole, with the forces behind economic growth, the problems occurring in the growth process (such as business cycles, inflation, and unemployment), and government policies to address these problems. Microeconomics focuses on the efﬁcient allocation of resources among alternative uses and addresses such questions as how individuals, ﬁrms, and societies decide what to produce, how to produce, and how to distribute the output. </P><P>Economists study these important issues by combining theoretical models and data analysis. The great human interest of the subject, together with the rigor of its analysis, gives the study of economics its stimulating quality. </P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Lucas Wilson, Chair </P><P>115 Skinner Hall 413-538-2432 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/economics (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/economics/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>An economics major who graduates from Mount Holyoke College will have mastered the necessary analytical tools to understand contemporary economic issues and to take reasoned positions in debates about economic and social policy. </P><P>More speciﬁcally, achievement of this overarching learning goal entails that the graduating senior: </P><P>• Has mastered the core body of economic theory, which necessitates solid quantitative, problem solving and critical thinking skills. </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understands how different theoretical approaches in economics lead to different explanations and policy conclusions. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understands how economic inquiry differs from other approaches to social inquiry. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Has conducted research on questions of economic theory and policy usually combining theoretical models and data analysis. </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Economics: </P><P>Satyananda Gabriel, Professor of Economics James Hartley, Professor of Economics Eva Paus, Professor of Economics on the Ford Foundation Michael Robinson, Professor of Economics, Teaching Spring Only Lucas Wilson, Professor of Africana Studies and Economics Sarah Adelman, Associate Professor of Economics, On Leave 2021-2022 Katherine Lande, Associate Professor of Economics, On Leave 2021-2022 Steven Schmeiser, Associate Professor of Economics, On Leave </P><P>2021-2022 Theodore Gilliland, Assistant Professor of Economics </P><P>M.

One or more of the core courses is required for each 300-level course in the department. At the intermediate level, a student can choose from a wide array of courses that apply economic theory to particular areas, drawing and building on the concepts and analytical tools developed in the introductory courses. Most 300-level courses are applied courses as well, but the level of analytical sophistication is higher, and students are expected to write substantial analytical research papers. The applied areas offered in the department cover a wide range of subjects, including corporate governance, economic development, economic history, economics of corporate ﬁnance, environmental economics, health economics, industrial organization, international economics, macroeconomic advanced game theory, Marxian economic theory, and public ﬁnance. </P><P>Requirements for the Minor </P><P>A minimum of 16 credits: </P><P>Code Title Credits </P><P>12 credits at the 200 level or above 12 </P><P>4 credits at the 300 level </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_167.jpg"/>4</Figure><P>Total Credits 16 </P><P>Additional Speciﬁcations </P><P>• Students are encouraged to consult a faculty member for advice in planning a coherent economics minor. </P><P>Course Advice </P><P>Introductory Courses </P><P>Students may begin the study of economics with Introductory Economics (ECON-110).

Credits: 4 </P><P>Empirical research has located serious flaws in the concept of rational economic decision making and efﬁcient markets. The evidence indicates that actual decision makers and markets deviate from expected rational outcomes frequently enough to require rethinking of the way decision makers think and markets behave, including unexpected market crashes and sustained market bubbles. This course is designed to examine new theoretical work that seeks to provide more accurate predictions of market behavior, improved assessments of underlying risk to portfolio holders, and better estimates of the underlying value of securities. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>S.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course introduces students to the modal interdisciplinary approach of political economy, an approach that de-centers economics from a narrow focus on optimization and hype-rationality to a broader vision of how the behavior of homo sapiens acting as economic agents is shaped by social and psychological processes. Thus, the determinants of economic outcomes are similarly impacted by emotional and social context. This course will offer a critical exploration of how the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Amartya Sen, and others have informed approaches to the study of political economy. Topics to be explored include: how socially constructed concepts of gender (as opposed to biological sex) and race/ethnicity impact value distribution; power dynamics in the workplace and larger society; and social investment thereby shaping the cultural architecture and economic processes that contribute to inequality. One of the objectives of this course is to speciﬁcally address the role of capital accumulation and mercantilist tendencies in modern capitalist economies in the diminution of productive self-employment, family businesses, and other alternatives to large-scale enterprises, leading to distorted forms of development resulting in catastrophic effects to the global ecology. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>S.

The multidisciplinary nature of the minor offers varied perspectives on contexts and historical moments that shape and deﬁne knowledge, behavior, structures, and policies both in and out of classrooms. Students planning to minor in educational studies must consult with a member of the program committee to discuss an area of interest and design a plan of study. A brief proposal and plan of study outlining the focus of the minor and the courses making up the minor must be approved by the program chair. The culminating experience of the minor is a 2-credit Educational Studies course requiring students to analyze and synthesize key ideas that have emerged from their focused study.

Our offerings range from the seventh through twenty-ﬁrst centuries and encompass multiple national, racial, and cultural identities. The department’s courses cultivate skills in close reading, critical thinking, and persuasive writing. For students interested in writing, a number of courses offer practical instruction in the techniques of ﬁction, poetry, and other literary genres, as well as journalism. The major helps prepare students for a wide range of careers, including teaching at all levels, law, business, and graduate study in literature and culture. </P><P>The department reflects in its offerings a balanced variety of historical and theoretical approaches to the study of language, literature, and culture. Many courses locate British and American literary texts within their historical contexts; many courses employ approaches drawn from gender studies, queer theory, and postcolonial theory. We regularly offer courses on African American, Asian American, and other ethnically deﬁned American literatures, as well as on writings from Africa, Asia, the Paciﬁc Rim, and Ireland. Some members of the department study </P><P>visual culture in many different media, including ﬁlm.

Speciﬁcally, our task during the semester will be to discuss the myriad ways black authors and artists attempt to interrogate the structure of racial hegemony by creating poetry and prose meant to expand notions of culture and form. We will also examine music, visual art, and advertisements from this era to have a greater sense of the black experience through various cultural representations.

Credits: 4 </P><P>A survey of philosophical, scientiﬁc, and theoretical approaches to the relation between cognition and representation. For as long as we have told stories, we have thought about how they work in conjunction with the mind. This course charts the many ways in which cognitive theory has shaped literary studies over the ages. How does ﬁction reflect the way we think? How in turn does it shape how we behave? What happens in the brain and body when we read? Starting in antiquity and working through history towards contemporary neuroscience and cognitive psychology, we will consider such matters as action and imitation; reality and fantasy; reason and imagination; aesthetics, empathy, and affect. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-249CT Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S.

'Shakespeare' comes ﬁrst, of course, both historically and as the source/inspiration for the ﬁlms. Yet each ﬁlm has its own existence, to be understood not just as an 'adaptation,' but also as the product of linked artistic, technical, and economic choices. Considering Shakespeare's plays as pre-texts (rather than pre-scriptions), we will look at early and recent ﬁlms, both those that follow closely conventionalized conceptualizations of 'Shakespeare,' and those that tend to erase or emend their Shakespearean sources. </P><P>Crosslisted as: FMT-330SF Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>H.

These include virtue, authority, nature, faith, the mind, and difference. We will read the plays and poems alongside thinkers who preceded Shakespeare and influenced his time as well as those who came after and learned from him in turn. We will encounter both established ﬁgures such as Plato, Lucretius, and Freud as well as modern critical methodologies such as new historicism, cognitive theory, and ecocriticism.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Curiosity suggests both a yearning for knowledge and the discernment of something unusual or strange. While influenced by Augustine's warning that worldly inquiry could endanger the pilgrimage of the soul, medieval literature contains many instances of curious looking. Exploring the medieval desire to know, this course considers how the period's tendencies toward spiritual and metaphysical thought are balanced against its fascinations with the observable world. We will study the ways allegories, travel narratives, romances, and dream visions intersect with natural philosophy, historiography, cartography, and architecture. Literary analysis is the basis for our investigative work to uncover the epistemological impulses that inform medieval art and literature. Some critical concepts will preoccupy us as we examine this body of literature as literature -- among them: lyric, history, romance, vernacular and secular poetry, courtly love, mysticism, and dream vision poetry. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>W.

But how did medieval historical understanding and hagiographies grapple with the mutabilities of the world at hand? This term, we will study a selection of saints' lives to consider how premodern narratives organize time, approach change, and reason through miraculous happenings. Ovid's Metamorphoses and its medieval reception will be a starting point. Readings will include selections from medieval hagiographical collections and Chaucer's Legend of Good Women alongside scholarly work on medieval metamorphosis, feminist and ecocritical theory, and phenomenology. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>W.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In Renaissance English, &quot;cunning&quot; meant many more things than it does today: guile, but also wisdom, imagination, strategic sense, inventiveness, skill. This very diverse set of abilities is on display throughout early modern literature, in which we meet all sorts of sages, schemers, illusionists, and fools. What does it mean to be smart? What forms of knowledge are privileged above others? How is the idea of intelligence culturally constructed, how inflected by religion, gender, and class? Reading widely in the period and drawing also on modern thought, we will cover such topics as mental disability, moral knowledge, social dexterity, politicking, and artiﬁcial and animal intelligence. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S.

Both Wordsworth and Eliot wrestled with how to adapt their art to these new realities: he introduced dramatically new content into poetry and experimented with a startling variety of poetic forms; she transformed the various prose genres to construct a novelistic form able to represent the totality of British society. By so doing, they forged a revolution in literary forms with the emergence of the modern lyric and the realist novel. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>N.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Race is the modality in which class is lived,&quot; wrote the late cultural theorist Stuart Hall. This course takes Hall's axiom as a starting point for considering the racial, gendered, and sexualized character of capitalist domination. Throughout the course students will explore both the political economy and the cultural imagery of racial capitalism. One question we will grapple with is the following: if capital itself is as imperceptible and objectively real as gravity, what are the common tropes we use to apprehend its circulation? Is it the stock market ticker tape, the shipping container, or the industrial wasteland? Drawing on writers and artists of color from around the world, we will consider ways they offer cognitive maps of the gendered and sexualized contours of racial capitalism. Authors may include Octavia Butler, Chang-rae Lee, Leslie Marmon Silko, Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, and Ruth Ozeki. Visual artists may include Xu Bing, Otobong Nkanga, Allan deSouza, Rodney McMillian, Mark Bradford, Takahiro Iwasaki, Anicka Yi, and Candace Lin. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349AR Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>I.

From the eighteenth century to the present, the gothic has been used to explore aspects of Irish history, in particular colonialism. The course will focus on texts that engage with three primary problems that the Irish gothic is used to explore: violence and terror, famine, and vampirism as a political metaphor. We will read novels, short ﬁction, poetry, and archival newspaper writing, including work by Maturin, Edgeworth, Lady Wilde, Mangan, LeFanu, Stoker, Joyce, Bowen, Enright, Deane, Boland, and Heaney. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-346 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>A.

Morrison is the author of eleven novels and multiple other works, including nonﬁction and criticism. In a career that has spanned over forty years and has informed countless artists and writers, Morrison's expansive cultural reach can hardly be measured accurately. In this course we will endeavor to critically analyze the arc and the import of many of Morrison's writings.

The group included artists, art critics, biographers, economists, literary critics, novelists, philosophers and translators such as Vanessa Bell, E. M. Forster, John Maynard Keynes, George Moore, Bertrand Russell, Lytton Strachey, and Virginia Woolf. We will emphasize the ways in which they sought to dismantle the artistic, political, and sexual repressions of the Victorian period and to replace them with new forms of art, community, and society. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>N.

This course will read theories of the Anthropocene alongside artistic contemplations of the shifting, ethical relations among humans, animals, and other beings of the world. How are we to live, die, and reproduce ourselves in a time when we have egregiously affected the earth? How does the critique of anthropocentrism shift our understanding of sex, gender, race, and the nonhuman?

Credits: 4 The Oxford English Dictionary deﬁnes &quot;adaptation&quot; as &quot;the bringing of two things together so as to effect a change in the nature of the objects." Rather than studying adaptation as a project that attempts to reproduce an original work in another medium, our course considers the complex relationship between narratives and their retellings and revisions. In particular, we will focus on how such retellings permanently alter their so-called &quot;source&quot; material and how each incarnation of a given narrative offers us insight into and commentary upon a particular historical moment and its unique political and ideological challenges. We will also consider the ways in which literary and visual representations differ in their communicative and affective mechanisms, and challenge where we draw the line between &quot;art,&quot; &quot;history,&quot; and &quot;entertainment. </P><P>Crosslisted as: FMT-330AD Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

This course both explores various constructs of postmodern American masculinity as they are portrayed and disseminated through contemporary ﬁlm, and seeks to understand some of what is at stake (culturally, ideologically, economically) in perpetuating certain cinematic archetypes. Of particular relevance to our investigation are the ways in which ﬁlm yokes masculinity to race, gender, and class.

If emotions operate through bodily changes and chemical exchanges, then animals and nonhumans might similarly be seen as bodies replete with affective materials in motion and at rest. In this course we will read through an array of affect theory from cognitive science, animal studies, and posthumanist debates on the affect of objects. We will consider how humans know what they feel (and when), how animals love, how forests think, and how affects might cross human and nonhuman boundaries. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349PW Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>K.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The &quot;age of revolution&quot; saw revolts in the Black Atlantic world: Americans rebelled against the British; Native Americans opposed white colonists; bourgeoisie vied for power against the aristocracy; women decried patriarchal imprisonment; Latin American creoles resisted Spanish imperialists; and slaves threw off their masters. This course considers these diverse narratives of revolution as a series of social, political, and philosophical movements to change &quot;biopolitics&quot; (control of life) and &quot;necropolitics&quot; (control via death). We will read revolutionary tracts, slave narratives, and abolitionary literature alongside critical theory to consider how these authors offer ways of living and surviving Western, racial imperialisms. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349NC Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>K.

An application for independent study must be submitted the semester prior to which the work will be completed. Note: ENGL-295 and ENGL-395 do not count toward the completion of the English major or minor. </P><P>Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take ENGL-295 for 1 to 4 credits, if suitable directors for the proposed projects are available. </P><P>Juniors and seniors who have devised projects in literary criticism and scholarship, or in writing prose and poetry, and demonstrate strong preparation, are encouraged to take ENGL-395 for 4 credits. They should discuss their ideas for projects with their academic advisor and others in the department who might serve to direct the project. In most cases, students should seek out department members with whom they have already studied; but if this is not possible, their advisors or the department chair will help ﬁnd someone to supervise the project. (Students studying off campus may pursue such arrangements by email.) The department will try to ﬁnd such advisors for students, but cannot guarantee a student will be allowed to undertake independent study. Planning ahead increases the probability of success. Again, preference is given to students who can demonstrate thorough preparation, normally through appropriate course work at the 300 level. </P><P>Seniors who have done well in one semester of ENGL-395, and who meet the College requirement of a 3.00 grade point average, may, with the approval of the director of the project, continue the independent work for an additional 4 credits, with the intent of writing a thesis to be submitted for honors. </P><P>ENGL-295 Independent Study </P><P>Fall and Spring.

Our students learn about the origins and impacts of, as well as potential solutions to, environmental issues by studying the behavior of natural systems and their interactions with political, economic, social, and cultural factors. Because the study of environmental concerns is inherently interdisciplinary, students develop integrative thinking skills and a broad foundation of knowledge in their time at Mount Holyoke College. Environmental Studies majors graduate with the intellectual tools, practical skills, and depth of understanding to confront environmental challenges of the present and future. </P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Timothy Farnham, Chair </P><P>302 Clapp Laboratory 413-538-2898 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/environmental (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/environmental/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>The department emphasizes approaches to learning that engage students more actively in the scientiﬁc, social/human, and global dimensions of environmental study. Each approach is a fundamental component of environmental literacy. </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Interdisciplinary Thinking: Students develop the ability to integrate knowledge using modes of inquiry that conceptually organize and link ideas, methods, and data from several ﬁelds. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Critical Thinking: Students cultivate the capacity to listen and think analytically and critically by questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and articulating well-reasoned arguments. They also develop quantitative and qualitative methodological expertise. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Depth of Knowledge: Students gain a solid understanding of how the natural world operates, how it has been impacted by human activities, and how it has influenced human actions and development through time. They recognize that solving environmental challenges requires knowledge of the underlying physical and biological processes involved as well as the complex ways these processes interact with cultural, historical, political, and economic forces. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Intercultural Competence: Students appreciate the diverse cultures that make human society, and develop perspectives, skills, and </LBody></LI></L><P>knowledge to engage with values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of communities other than their own in environmental education, activism, development projects, and domestic and international research projects. </P><P>• Global Consciousness: Students recognize and understand global, national, regional, and local environmental concerns, perspectives, and experiences, including the impacts of economic, cultural, and political contexts on various communities and resources. </P><P>Skills </P><P>In order to meet the above goals, the Environmental Studies curriculum places a strong emphasis on habits of critical thinking and questioning across academic disciplines: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Problem Identiﬁcation, Assessment, and Solution: Students gain analytical skills in determining the scale and parameters of environmental problems. They develop an in-depth understanding of the scientiﬁc method, employing both quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify and understand data. They become familiar with scientiﬁc, historical, and ethical analyses of environmental problems and are able to propose imaginative and creative solutions appropriate to speciﬁc issues, based on in-depth study of local to global factors. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Communication and Information Literacy: Students recognize the breadth depth of environmental information, across a range of formats and ﬁelds. They strengthen writing and communication skills and develop a broad foundation of information literacy. They learn how to formulate and articulate questions, frame research projects, locate needed resources, evaluate information, and make critical judgments about the presentation of research. They are able to synthesize, present, and use this information in a way that helps answer a question, solve a problem, or educate self or others. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Reflective Learning and Application of Knowledge: Students practice and develop their capacity for reflective learning in all courses, but especially in the capstone senior seminar. They develop the skills for peer feedback, self-reflection, and assessment of learning impacts. Experiential learning opportunities (e.g., community-based work, internships, and study abroad) allow students to increase their range of interactions with diverse peoples. They also develop leadership and decision-making skills including facility in working constructively with diverse perspectives, personalities, and groups. They develop pre-professional conﬁdence in future options for environmental work in a range of government, education, business, and non-proﬁt contexts. </LBody></LI></L><P>These core foundational approaches and skills are important in all facets of environmental studies and will serve graduates well in their post-college lives and careers. </P><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Environmental Studies with participation from faculty members of related departments: </P><P>Steven Dunn, Professor of Geology </P><P>Girma Kebbede, Professor of Geography </P><P>Michelle Markley, Professor of Geology </P><P>Thomas Millette, Director of the Geo-Processing Lab; Professor of Geography </P><P>Lauret Savoy, David B.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Can an economic system predicated on inﬁnite growth achieve sustainability on a ﬁnite planet? This question will likely deﬁne the twenty-ﬁrst century. This course aims to grapple with this paradox, examining the relationships and tensions between the globally dominant form of economy - capitalism - and global climate change. We will explore the interwoven rise of capitalism and emergence of fossil fuel energy, as well as the global expansion of capitalism and the connections between resources, economic growth, and political power. We will engage with various theoretical approaches to capitalism-environment relations, such as metabolic rift theory, the second contradiction of capitalism, and the production of nature thesis. These theories provide insight into recent forms of capitalism (i.e. neoliberalism) and the increasing degradation and commodiﬁcation of the environment. We end by studying contemporary debates, examining institutions and policies seeking to manage climate change from with liberal-capitalist frameworks, the emergence of the &quot;green economy&quot;, and the politics of climate denialism, concluding with alternatives economies and the climate justice movement.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Toxic water in Flint, Michigan. Oil pipelines through sacred sites in North Dakota. These manifestations of environmental injustice and inequality are only the most recent incarnations of larger legacies. Environments are never simply natural or given: they are imbued with unequal entanglements of gender, race, class, and power. Environmental justice asks questions about the ways in which environments are produced, and the relations of risk, harm, beneﬁt, access, privilege, domination, oppression, and liberation therein. In this course, we will study the theory and practice of environmental (in)justice in the United States. We will briefly explore histories of environmental injustice in the U.S. (from colonization and slavery, to industrialization and pollution); past and current struggles over the siting of production facilities, toxic waste, and pollution; and recent events around water (be they floods, toxicity, or protection): Hurricane Katrina, Flint, and Standing Rock. We will pay particular attention to questions of food and justice, examining gender, race, and class in agricultural labor, corporate power in agribusiness, food deserts, food access/health and white privilege, and gender in alternative community food movements. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>K.

In this research seminar we will explore how this country's still-unfolding history, and ideas of race and nature, have marked the land, this society, and each of us as individuals. We will consider Indigenous, colonial European, and African senses of Earth; origins of placenames; contested terrains; migration and displacement; and other topics revealing the place of race. We'll examine often-unrecognized connections, such as the siting of the nation's capital and the economic motives of slavery.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The concept of the Anthropocene (the &quot;human epoch&quot;) signiﬁes that human activity has become the dominant physical force on the planet. Mainstream narratives envision three phases of the Anthropocene: industrial origins (1800 - 1950); global expansion and the nuclear age (1950 - 2000+); and an emergent third phase marked by massive shifts in land-use and biodiversity. This course undertakes a critical examination of the Anthropocene concept. We will analyze debates over geological demarcation, the term itself and the &quot;anthropos&quot; it embodies, and eco-modernist conceptions of a &quot;good&quot; Anthropocene. We aim to historically contextualize the socio-technical phases of the Anthropocene (industrial revolution, post-WWII global expansion, and contemporary globalization), situating them as processes emerging within a speciﬁc political-economic context (capitalism). Finally, we examine struggles over the socio-ecological entanglements shaping its future directions: urbanization, industrialized agriculture, genetic technology, and geoengineering/Earth System management. This course explores what it means to live in an era where a subset of one species can determine the conditions of possibility for life on the entire planet. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>K.

Credits: 4 The Oxford English Dictionary deﬁnes &quot;adaptation&quot; as &quot;the bringing of two things together so as to effect a change in the nature of the objects." Rather than studying adaptation as a project that attempts to reproduce an original work in another medium, our course considers the complex relationship between narratives and their retellings and revisions. In particular, we will focus on how such retellings permanently alter their so-called &quot;source&quot; material and how each incarnation of a given narrative offers us insight into and commentary upon a particular historical moment and its unique political and ideological challenges. We will also consider the ways in which literary and visual representations differ in their communicative and affective mechanisms, and challenge where we draw the line between &quot;art,&quot; &quot;history,&quot; and &quot;entertainment. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-367AD Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

The oral theater traditions of Africa are an example of the innate human quest to perform and will eventually be the basis for understanding some of the innovations made in African literary theater. We shall also focus on writings by African writers and writers of African descent who deal with the post-colonial conditions of Black Africa and the African Diaspora. This class is designed to serve as a window into the continent of Africa: its people, its ideas, triumphs, struggles, and the complex histories emerging from its vastness and diversity. </P><P>Crosslisted as: AFCNA-341AT Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>M.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Usually, an artist produces a work, and then an audience experiences that work. However, sometimes audiences influence what a work means and even how an ongoing story unfolds. This course focuses on works of popular, serialized art in which the possibilities for artist/audience interaction are great, and so is the potential for conflict. We look at serial novels, ﬁlm series, television shows, and new media (such as TikTok), among others. What are the rights of artists to control their works? What rights do audiences have to alter or create new works based on an existing work? What should we do when these rights conflict? What makes a &quot;bad fan&quot; bad? When do audiences become artists? </P><P>Crosslisted as: PHIL-375AV Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Film critics Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott contend that &quot;movies may bemale dominated, but images of men are surprisingly narrow." This course both explores various constructs of postmodern American masculinity as they are portrayed and disseminated through contemporary ﬁlm, and seeks to understand some of what is at stake (culturally, ideologically, economically) in perpetuating certain cinematic archetypes. Of particular relevance to our investigation are the ways in which ﬁlm yokes masculinity to race, gender, and class. Films include Full Metal Jacket, No Country for Old Men, The Big Lebowski, Boyz in the Hood, Paris is Burning, Fight Club, and Moonlight.

In this course we will study representations of apocalyptic futures from illuminated manuscripts, from illustrated poetry, and from science ﬁction ﬁlms that waver between hope for escape and doomsday scenarios. Along the way we will also take seriously nonﬁction representations of global crisis, analyzing how phenomena like climate change and galactic collision are represented across media forms, including infographics, visual models, digital memes, and documentary ﬁlms. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>H.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The course considers the connections between media as channels for communication and expression, on the one hand, and mediums as those who claim to have contact with the dead, on the other. Students will study the ways communication and performance media, from Shakespearian theater, to ﬁlms and photographs of deceased loved ones, to legacy accounts on Facebook, have served as conduits of the dead and even spawned occult practices. The course will address: how do theater, ﬁlm, and other media bridge us to what has been lost and animate our connections to those who have died? How do ghostly media ask us to confront a past that has been buried? </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>H.

Breaking away from the tradition of what Robert Stam calls the &quot;art of enchantment,&quot; they call attention to themselves for reasons that range from the playful to the philosophical to the political. Some of the directors whom we will consider include: Chantal Akerman, Wes Anderson, Julie Dash, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard, William Greaves, Buster Keaton, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Fanta Régina Nacro, and Preston Sturges. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>R.

Yet each ﬁlm has its own existence, to be understood not just as an &quot;adaptation,&quot; but also as the product of linked artistic, technical, and economic choices. Considering Shakespeare's plays as pre-texts (rather than pre-scriptions), we will look at early and recent ﬁlms, both those that follow closely conventionalized conceptualizations of &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; and those that tend to erase or emend their Shakespearean sources. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-312SF Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>H.

In addition, students should be aware of and should have seen most of the ﬁlms that are deﬁnitive of the ﬁeld. The canon of Film Studies has been traditionally made up of feature-length ﬁction ﬁlms from Europe, the United States, and select other cinemas due primarily to the vagaries of distribution and preservation. However, we ask students to become acquainted with non-western traditions as well, focusing on the ways in which cinema is a global medium of expression with direct connection to contemporary issues of immigration, diaspora, and national and transnational identity. We also encourage students to become aware of ﬁlm traditions that deviate from the Hollywood model, such as experimental and documentary ﬁlm. </P><P>In order to have a full grasp of the ﬁeld, students should be familiar with the essential theoretical texts that have deﬁned the medium and the study of the medium as it has developed over the course of the 20th century. As a result of this knowledge, students should be able to intelligently engage any ﬁlm as an aesthetic object and/or as a cultural product. Although Film Studies differentiates between ﬁlm as art and ﬁlm as entertainment (as do the studies of books or physical movement, for example), Film Studies has a particular interest in the cultural role </P><P>Film, Media, Theater </P><P>FMT-131

We take our inspiration from centuries of apprentice-style artist training in some indigenous West African societies. The evolution of oral and popular performance traditions into literary theater has also necessitated a similar trend in the training of the modern actor. The primary object of this class is to be able to embody a plethora of idiomatic expressions. Thus, we will move to the energy of the drums, we will train the ears to transmit the complex musicality of several sonic elements and raise our voices in song and apply them in scene explorations.

Rather than studying adaptation as a project that attempts to reproduce an original work in another medium, our course considers the complex relationship between narratives and their retellings and revisions. In particular, we will focus on how such retellings permanently alter their so-called &quot;source&quot; material and how each incarnation of a given narrative offers us insight into and commentary upon a particular historical moment and its unique political and ideological challenges. We will also consider the ways in which literary and visual representations differ in their communicative and affective mechanisms, and challenge where we draw the line between &quot;art,&quot; &quot;history,&quot; and &quot;entertainment. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-367AD Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

This course focuses on works of popular, serialized art in which the possibilities for artist/audience interaction are great, and so is the potential for conflict. We look at serial novels, ﬁlm series, television shows, and new media (such as TikTok), among others. What are the rights of artists to control their works? What rights do audiences have to alter or create new works based on an existing work? What should we do when these rights conflict? What makes a &quot;bad fan&quot; bad? When do audiences become artists? </P><P>Crosslisted as: PHIL-375AV Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

This course both explores various constructs of postmodern American masculinity as they are portrayed and disseminated through contemporary ﬁlm, and seeks to understand some of what is at stake (culturally, ideologically, economically) in perpetuating certain cinematic archetypes. Of particular relevance to our investigation are the ways in which ﬁlm yokes masculinity to race, gender, and class.

Considering Shakespeare's plays as pre-texts (rather than pre-scriptions), we will look at early and recent ﬁlms, both those that follow closely conventionalized conceptualizations of &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; and those that tend to erase or emend their Shakespearean sources. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-312SF Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>H.

Credits: 4 </P><P>From the writings of Adam Smith in the 18th century to present-day arguments by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the beneﬁts and costs of capitalism in human society have been hotly debated. Do the beneﬁts of capitalism outweigh the costs? Is it possible or desirable to &quot;tame&quot; markets to maintain their good elements while minimizing the harm? How has a debate dominated by Europeans and North Americans considered or overlooked perspectives from the rest of the world? In exploring these questions, we will engage with some of the key thinkers on capitalism from Adam Smith and Karl Marx through major thinkers in both the developed and developing world to the present day. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>C.

Credits: 4 </P><P>One of the hallmarks of a liberal arts education is to draw on a broad base of knowledge in order to interrogate common assumptions. No one exempliﬁes this critical approach better than French philosopher Michel Foucault. One of the most influential thinkers of recent times, Foucault revolutionized several academic disciplines and even questioned the very notion of a discipline itself. He did so by revealing the history and transformations of ideas now viewed as self-evident. This ﬁrst-year seminar invites students to develop similar analytical skills. Following Foucault's lead, the course pays special attention to preconceptions about government, freedom, identity, and sexuality. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>J.

Earthquakes, volcanoes, and floods are geologic events; they are also natural hazards that pose signiﬁcant challenges to communities in high risk areas. Where are these risky areas? Why? Is it possible to predict when and where catastrophic geologic events will occur? How do we assess geological risks? Using case studies from around the world, we explore these three natural hazards in the context of evolving geologic research on plate tectonics and climate change. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>M.

Can you list them -- and, is there a list somewhere? Does it matter? Do some people in the world have more access to human rights than others? Why? This seminar examines the origins, evolution, and practices of human rights ideas, norms, and institutions in global politics. We will explore the wide range of debate and controversy regarding human rights: are human rights universal (i.e. rights inherent in all human beings) or do they originate and obtain only in speciﬁc cultural contexts. Are human rights individual or collective? Should we prioritize various types of rights over others (i.e., civil and political rights vs. social, cultural, and economic)? We will examine how concepts like state sovereignty and power affect our consideration of these questions, as well as how well states and international organizations adhere to human rights norms and institutions. We will review how non-governmental advocacy organizations mobilize around human rights and the conditions under which they are (and are not) successful. Finally, we will examine how human rights have evolved and changed over time and whose voices are, and are not, reflected in national and international debates. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>How do we represent ourselves as we document our lives and communicate with others? In this seminar we will move beyond critiques of selﬁe culture, instead analyzing self-representation as an important avenue for forming identities. We will study forms of self-representation across history and will focus on visual and new media as platforms for performing selfhood. Students will discuss the politics and aesthetics of self-fashioning across these media forms, and will execute multiple forms of self-expression, including the argumentative essay, the op-ed, the blog post, and the tweet. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>H.

How can the self -- that is to say, subjective experience, private life, identity, consciousness -- be translated into written form? How, in turn, does writing fashion and construct the self? Throughout history, authors and thinkers have engaged these questions in countless texts and textual forms -- in essays, confessions, autobiographies, and poetry. This seminar will sample influential and innovative works of literary self-portrayal from around the world, exploring how a wide variety of writers have rendered themselves in language, narrative, and text. Authors may include Augustine, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Joyce, Nabokov, and Plath. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>S.

In this course, we will explore a variety of classic texts, ranging from such authors as Plato to Karl Marx to Hannah Arendt to Martin Luther King, Jr. to contemporary feminist theorists. We will focus on developing the ability to reflect on your own beliefs, analyze authors' arguments, and to articulate and defend your own perspective. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>E.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Physics and art represent the world in seemingly different ways. They share, however, many common themes: the guiding role of symmetry, the tension between order and disorder, and the emergence of structure from many simple constituents. We will explore some of the big ideas in physics, including quantum mechanics, relativity, entropy, and chaos theory, by looking at how these underlying themes are represented in the visual arts. Islamic tessellations, Japanese Suminagashi paper marbling, and works by contemporary artists will guide us toward an intuitive understanding of some of the most exciting ideas in physics, without the need for any prior physics background. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>S.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course is a ﬁrst year seminar on the principles and practices of restorative justice. Restorative justice is a movement that seeks to reimagine justice by building on indigenous theories and practices of human community. Students examine principal restorative justice models and programs for how they understand and respond to harm, especially as they reflect the accountability of key stakeholders (victims, offenders, communities and justice systems). Restorative justice approaches are contrasted with conventional western ways of addressing harm, be they small or large ruptures in the social fabric. The ideas of key activists and theorists in restorative justice circles are critically engaged in institutional settings ranging from schools to prisons. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>L.

Credits: 4 </P><P>What is the role of governments in regulating human reproduction? How has this changed throughout the 20th and 21st century? Is reproduction an area of our private lives that should be left outside the realm of government? Or is the state actually needed to safeguard our reproductive rights? This course analyzes the history of reproductive policies in the US and compares it with cases from the global South. From family planning to population control, from woman's right to reproductive justice, we will analyze the evolution of language to name this policy arena and the way this has affected policy design. Through the use of a variety of primary and secondary sources, this course will help students improve their critical thinking, argumentative writing, and analytical skills. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>C.

This course will challenge media's coverage of three major topics -- sex, drugs, and psychopaths -- against the latest ﬁndings from neuroscience research. Through readings, podcasts, movies, and class discussions, students will challenge common misconceptions about our brains, by examining the science behind inﬁdelity, gender identity, addiction, mental health, and murder. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>J.

Our class will explore four of Shakespeare's plays through the lens of identity, both those forms extant in Shakespeare's own time and those articulated in various contemporary adaptations, both stage and screen. In particular, we will focus on BIPOC, postcolonial, and LGBTQ adaptations. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

This ﬁrst year seminar will explore these questions, focusing on the relationship between stress and resilience. We will consider different ideas about stress, adaptive coping, psychological and resilience and their relationship to psychological and physical well-being. We will consider cultural differences in approaches to stress, as well as explore the impact of stress on our lives and society. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

Shifting perspectives between European, Middle Eastern and Global studies, we will focus on how Italian writers, poets and critical thinkers, from the classic to the contemporary period, have thought about Italy among European and Mediterranean nations, religions, and cultures. We will cover some of the most important developments in Italy's culture, history and literature, and will question key concepts in geography, history and literature to explore the complexity of the Mediterranean region and of the contemporary world. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>M.

Popular culture has a lot to say about this life stage, not all of it rooted in evidence. In this course, we will examine the range of adolescent experiences in the United States and critically question common assumptions. We will consider how social context and relationships influence youth as they navigate school, college and career expectations, extracurricular activities, and social media. Our interdisciplinary approach will draw on readings from psychology, sociology, history, education as well as media resources. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>K.

Though the culprit was never identiﬁed, Jack the Ripper became synonymous with the perceived dangers of late-Victorian London. Using newspapers, periodicals, police archives, and other sources from the period, this course will set students on an historical investigation of the &quot;Whitechapel Murders,&quot; seeking to understand the event, its historical context, and the way historians have interpreted its meaning. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>D.

Taking as its premise that language gives access to new and different cultures, the program makes available to students the textual, oral, and visual products of the French-speaking world. It also offers familiarity with the interdisciplinary exchanges—art, literature, history, politics, music, philosophy—that inform French studies today. </P><P>The department offers courses in language, culture, and literature at all levels. All courses are conducted in French with the exception of the department’s ﬁrst-year seminars and the Romance Languages and Literature seminar (FREN-321). The Romance Language seminar is taught in English but all reading and writing are done in French. </P><P>In language courses students have the opportunity to work with language assistants in small supplementary conversation groups. Many culture and literature courses are either speaking-intensive or writing-intensive, and in some, writing mentors are provided. Students have access to weekly drop-in tutoring sessions as well as one-on-one tutoring. Pedagogical and technological resources and events enable French students to communicate and share ideas with the global community. A comprehensive library of classic French books and movies is maintained in the department ofﬁce. </P><P>Graduates of Mount Holyoke who have majored in French have used the analytical skills and means of expression acquired during their studies to pursue a wide range of career options: education, government service, law, international banking, publishing, and marketing, among others. Each </P><P>spring, the department sponsors a Major Tea and Career Panel inviting to campus three or four alumnae with diverse occupations who speak about the beneﬁts and opportunities that their French major has brought to their careers. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>Mount Holyoke College has its own study abroad program in Montpellier, France.

Gender studies is interdisciplinary and cross-cultural in its approaches. The goal is to provide students with multiple angles of vision that enrich their learning in and beyond the major. </P><P>At Mount Holyoke, gender studies grew out of women’s studies, with its commitment to uncovering the realities of women’s lives, understanding the nature of women’s oppression, and charting paths to signiﬁcant social change. Building on this foundation, gender studies encompasses investigations into the very nature of gender; its intersection with other forms of difference and power such as class, race, nation, sexuality, and species; and its intimate connection with myriad forms of knowledge and social practice, from scientiﬁc investigation to artistic creation and performance. </P><P>Majors are introduced to the foundations of the ﬁeld in courses on women and gender, feminist theory, and methodology. Drawing on courses offered across the Mount Holyoke curriculum and in the Five Colleges, majors then explore topics such as women’s literary and artistic production; gender in imperial and postcolonial contexts; feminist antiracism; women’s health; women and labor; violence against women; feminist science studies; queer studies; men and masculinity; transgender politics; U.S. women of color politics; women immigrants and refugees; transnational feminisms. </P><P>A ﬁeld-study seminar, taken in the junior or senior year; and a senior capstone course bring majors together to think through connections among the diverse intellectual and creative approaches they have encountered as well as between scholarship and social action. </P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Iyko Day, Chair Bridget Barrett, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>109 Shattuck Hall 413-538-2257 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/gender (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/gender/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><L><LI><Lbl>1.</Lbl><LBody> To understand the very nature of gender; its intersection with other forms of difference -- such as class, race, nation, sexuality -- and power; and its intimate connection with myriad forms of knowledge and social practice, from scientiﬁc investigation to artistic creation and performance. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2.</Lbl><LBody> Recognizing gender studies’ origins as rooted in women's lives, and women's liberation from oppression and secondly, the shift/ mobilization of gender in its capaciousness (e.g. we study masculinities and men too, and all the many things).

The analysis that develops will ultimately allow us to think rigorously about social inequality, resistance and liberation. </P><P>Crosslisted as: LATST-250RP, CST-249RP Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>V.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Housing is closely tied to quality of life and the health of neighborhoods and communities. As a main goal of the &quot;American Dream," homeownership has important signiﬁcance on an individual and societal level. For immigrants, this goal is often out of reach as a result of racism and discriminatory housing policies. This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latinas/os/x relationship to housing and homeownership by examining: 1. the history of housing policy in the United States; 2. national identity, assimilation, and housing; and 3. discriminatory housing policies/programs and housing inequality. We explore topics including immigration, housing policy, public housing, segregation, gentriﬁcation, the suburbs, homelessness, eviction, affordability, and community building. Exploring this range of topics will help us develop a clearer understanding of why housing is one of the most pressing issues for Latinas/os/x today. Students will engage in community- based research on affordable housing in communities in the Pioneer Valley. </P><P>Crosslisted as: LATST-350MC, CST-349MC Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Community-Based Learning, Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

In this course we will explore such questions as: what is pregnancy, and how does the ephemeral, essential organ known as the placenta call pregnancy into being? How is pregnancy sustained? How does it end? We will consider the anatomy of reproductive systems and the hormonal language of reproduction. We will investigate the nature of &quot;sex&quot; hormones, consider racial disparities in pregnancy outcome, and weigh the evidence that the intrauterine environment influences disease susceptibility long after birth. </P><P>Crosslisted as: BIOL-321PR Applies to requirement(s): Math Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive </P><P>S.

These states themselves became sadistic death machines, where bodies became territories of punishment and discipline as well as of struggle, resistance, and difference. We will analyze how recent cultural production (ﬁlm, novel, short stories, and theater) along with theoretical texts imagine and represent those &quot;body struggles&quot; through queer and female bodies, and how they replace the masculine icons of the left-wing militants and the state military terrorists. </P><P>Crosslisted as: SPAN-350QH Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

Slavery studies scholars remind us of how it has proven foundational for modern notions of race and sex by making explicit links between labor and exploitation. Thus, this course moves through themes such as slavery historicity, intersections between Black feminisms and Black sexualities, sexual labor/work, pleasure, and the erotic, in order to consider the stakes of our current critical approaches to Black sexual economies and interrogate its silences and possibilities. </P><P>Crosslisted as: AFCNA-341SE, CST-349SE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>S.

Using critical race theory, feminist, queer/trans* of color critique (e.g., Wynter, Fanon, David Eng, José Muñoz), we will ask how whiteness (white supremacist masculinity) shapes and colors masculinity -- whether as exemplar, visible, illegible, failed, deviant and even toxic -- and what then falls outside of such a frame? </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349ST Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>R.

Their stories are similar: ordinary young women to whom extraordinary things happened, who became symbols of France and inspired a rich verbal and visual iconography. Yet they are profoundly different: Joan was a warrior, Thérèse a memoirist, Bernadette a visionary. We will study the facts of their lives, in their own words and those of others, but also the many ﬁctions, semi-ﬁctions, myths and legends based on those lives. We will analyze a number of ﬁlms and visual images as well as literary and non-literary texts in our attempt to understand these cases of speciﬁcally female, speciﬁcally French sainthood. </P><P>Crosslisted as: FREN-351VR Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language </P><P>C.

Our seminars at all levels facilitate transcultural competence, so that our graduates gain a deeper grasp of their own languages and cultures and a much more substantive level of self-awareness of their own traditions and values. </P><P>Language learning in our program emphasizes at all levels the interrelationship between target language and culture and native language and culture; self and community; curriculum and career. We also consistently explore the global interconnections between German and European cultures. We provide opportunities for students to integrate their interest in other subjects with material in our upper-intermediate and advanced-level courses. Furthermore, we encourage our students to seek experiential learning by participating in our exchange with the University of Leipzig, as well as the Berlin School of Economics and Law, and to combine study with internship experience. </P><P>Following the credo of Mary Lyon, the department has a proud tradition of connecting its rigorous curricular program with career exploration opportunities for students. We have built an alumnae network to provide current students with assistance when searching for internships or employment either in the U.S. or internationally. Many of these alumnae continued their studies in German and other ﬁelds at the most renowned graduate and professional schools in the United States and abroad. Finally, we provide students with support as they apply for internship(s) in German-speaking countries in such ﬁelds as science, business, politics, journalism, ﬁlm, and the arts—to name but a few—as well as study and research and opportunities, including teaching fellowships abroad. </P><P>German studies majors graduating from Mount Holyoke College have used the analytical, cultural, and linguistic competence they acquired to pursue a wide range of careers in banking, business, education, government, international affairs, journalism, law, medicine, publishing, radio and television broadcasting, and the sciences. </P><P>All department members have Ph.D. training in interdisciplinary German studies and participate in a wide range of interdisciplinary programs. Our courses, therefore, contribute to such programs as critical social thought, gender studies, Jewish studies, and the department of ﬁlm, </P><P>media, theater. We strongly recommend that students take courses in other ﬁelds related to German and European cultures. </P><P>Our entire curriculum, then, supports the study of the German language within its European and global cultural and historical contexts and is adapted to the individual student’s learning style. To facilitate such learning, the department has proved a pioneer in creatively employing the use of technology throughout its curriculum, from elementary courses to advanced seminars. In addition, all our courses focus on developing critical reading, speaking, and writing skills and global competencies in line with the overall learning goals of Mount Holyoke College. </P><P>Class time focuses on interpersonal communication among students and with the instructor, and among students and German or near-native peer assistants. From the beginning, students learn strategies for understanding German speakers in a variety of contexts, on many levels, and in diverse situations. When selecting course content materials, we focus on our students’ goals in studying German. In weekly conversation sessions, German or near-native peer assistants provide opportunities for small-group informal conversations. </P><P>Most courses are conducted in German, except ﬁrst-year seminars, GRMST-205, and GRMST-231. However, students in these courses may receive credit toward the German studies major or minor by enrolling in a related independent study (GRMST-295). </P><P>The major in German studies, therefore, integrates learning inside and outside the classroom, the development of language skills with the study of the social, economic, and cultural developments in the German-speaking countries, in the past and present and within a larger transnational context. </P><P>The department also encourages students who are studying German or have an interest in Germany to apply to live in the German Language Living Learning Community in order to practice or improve their German while deepening their knowledge of the history and culture of the German-speaking countries. In addition, students have opportunities to interact with German faculty, take part in discussions with guest lecturers, and may also co-host events with the German Club. </P><P>Study and Internships Abroad in German-Speaking Countries </P><P>A junior year or semester, as well as summer programs and internships in Germany, is open to both majors and non-majors. To be appropriately prepared for study in Germany, students who wish to participate are required to have studied  German continuously, at least one course taught in German each semester, during their ﬁrst and second years. Majors spending their junior year in a German-speaking country with a program approved by the department and the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives normally satisfy some of the minimum requirements of their major while abroad. By completing appropriate course work, including written work, students majoring in German may transfer the equivalent of one course per semester at the 300 level and additional credits at the 200 level. Minors spending the junior year in a German-speaking country with a program approved by the department and the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives may bring back the equivalent of one course at the 300 level and one course at the 200 level. Upon their return, students are required to participate in at least one course per semester in the department so that faculty can evaluate them based on work done in the senior year when writing recommendations for graduate school or employment opportunities. </P><P>The department has an exchange program with the University of Leipzig. In addition, the department participates in the College’s exchange with the Berlin School of Economics and Law. The department encourages students to apply for DAAD scholarships to help ﬁnance study abroad in Germany and DAAD RISE internships (for students in STEM ﬁelds). The chair and other faculty will assist each student with selecting an <Link>individually appropriate opportunities. See the department’s study abroad </Link><Link>webpage (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/german/study-abroad/) for </Link>more details. Our students frequently spend time abroad, either in their junior year or in the summer. They also take advantage of diverse internship opportunities at German investment banks or brokerage ﬁrms, science laboratories, hospitals, newspapers, intercultural agencies, schools, radio and television stations, museums, libraries, archives, and other places of professional interest to them. </P><P>Our graduating seniors have consistently been awarded such highly regarded national and international graduate fellowships as DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service), Fulbright, PAD (Pädagogischer Austauschdienst), Congress/Bundestag Fellowship for Young Professionals, Bundestag Internship Program (Internationale Parlaments-Praktika Internship Programm), CDS Emigré Parliamentary/Cultural Vistas Internships, and internships with the European Union. </P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Karen Remmler, Chair Dominique Rampton, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>103 Ciruti Center 413-538-2294 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/german (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/german/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals Elementary (Completion of Sequence of GRMST-101 and 102, or GRMST-103) </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Communicate in German on a range of everyday situations. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Produce responses to questions (oral &amp; written) using vocabulary and structures as presented in the lesson plans and texts read. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understand and produce a variety of text types (personal letters, emails); write (and rewrite) shorter creative essays (Schreibaufgaben) as well as at least 4 progressively longer essays. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Comprehend German grammar requiring some review and more contextualized analysis and discussion on the next level (GRMST-201). </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Read and summarize the content of German texts, both orally and in writing, written speciﬁcally for German learners, and/or authentic texts written for children or young people in Germany. </LBody></LI></L><P>Intermediate (GRMST-201) </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Have a sound understanding of the diversity of contemporary life in the German-speaking world with some in-depth knowledge on speciﬁc topics. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Possess global comprehension of authentic materials (including texts, ﬁlms, videos on YouTube, etc.) and some ﬁne-point knowledge analysis. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Produce spoken and written discourse from description to narration, to formulation of arguments and/or hypotheses, while incorporating an increasing variety of style and complexity. </LBody></LI></L><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Improve writing and speaking abilities in German through extensive writing and re-writing of assignments as well as recordings and analysis of oral presentations. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Read at least one (possibly two) longer works written in German. </LBody></LI></L><P>Advanced Intermediate (Two 200-level classes above GRMST-201) </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Will know how to work with authentic materials and use acquired knowledge to discuss and understand related issues. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Produce medium-length analytical essays, a ﬁnal paper (Hausarbeit) similar to those written by students at a German university and narratives based on ﬁrst-hand experience, ﬁction, non-ﬁction, visual texts, and media. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Engage in class discussions, debate, and group interactions in German with relative ease using appropriate vocabulary and produce a basic German university-style Referat. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Analyze visual and printed texts. understand historical perspectives within German cultures that existed prior to the 20th and 21st centuries. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Produce a basic German-style Hausarbeit and acquire a basic knowledge of how to research a topic. </LBody></LI></L><P>Advanced level (300-level courses) </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Formulate, develop, present, and document original research questions, their thesis, and arguments made in oral presentations, written abstracts, and group projects in relatively precise German. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Write, with revision(s), an analytical study of at least 12 pages (15-20 pages for the senior seminar) including footnotes and bibliography. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Present analysis of course material, discussion questions, and individual research projects orally (20-minute presentations). </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Understand major debates, trajectories, and directions in the ﬁeld of German studies.

We explore how modes of power, transnational exchange, cultural upheaval, and constructions of identity from the mid-18th century to the present are represented in German-speaking realms, both real and imaginary. What role does colonialism play in shaping early and present-day German national identities? How do particular historical movements, events, and narratives create multifaceted constructions of race, gender, and ethnicities? We will address these questions and others through case studies of pivotal moments in German history. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>K.

As much as German culture is riddled with extreme examples of persecution and nationalism, the presence of those deemed non-German, such as Black Africans, African Americans, Jews, and Muslims, shape cultural expression and cultural exchange.

Historic sites within the built environment of Berlin mark historical upheaval and reconciliation and the transformation of the periphery into productive sites of commerce and cultural exchange. Multiple historic and contemporary sites will serve as a point of departure to explore the emergence of multidimensional identities in today's Europe. We explore the history, design, function, construction, and, in some cases, destruction, of major historical sites in Berlin, such as the Berlin Wall, the Reichstag, the Museum Island, the Holocaust Memorial, and others through case studies, archival research, and visual media.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In 2015, Germany opened its borders to over a million asylum-seekers. The ensuing debates about German national belonging, identity, and rights often overlook the contributions of immigrants, refugees, and displaced persons throughout Europe since the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). Indeed, migrants continue to shape European and German cultures today. Through close-readings and analyses of visual images, narratives, and ﬁlms produced by or about the experiences of migrants and refugees from the 18th century to the present, this seminar traces how immigrant cultures shape contemporary German culture. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>K.

Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Greek tragedies, Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War and, of course, the New Testament are just some of the names on Greek's list of &quot;Greatest Hits." </P><P>These works, of course, can be read in translation, and the department offers a wide array of courses approaching the culture and history of Greek antiquity through readings entirely in English. But juxtapose any two translations of a work in Ancient Greek and you will quickly realize how much the translator stands between you and the original. For this </P><P>reason, our language program is designed to allow students to read Homer's Iliad in Greek as soon as possible—and to help them learn to use the tools needed for learning Greek on their own.  Beyond the ﬁrst year, we offer a range of courses at all levels. </P><P>The Greek major (or minor) complements well the study of philosophy, religion, politics, English, ancient art history, and archaeology, and in some cases Greek is necessary for advanced study in these areas. It is also excellent preparation for law school, while some of our majors have completed their pre-med course work and gone on to medical school. Most important, the study of Greek (Latin, too) provides a strong foundation in the liberal arts, one that challenges students to think deeply about difﬁcult questions and to value the power of language. </P><P>In addition to Greek the department offers majors in Latin, classics, and ancient studies. Classics combines the study of both ancient languages with courses in ancient history, art, philosophy, politics, or religion. Ancient studies approaches Greek and Roman civilizations from an interdisciplinary perspective with less emphasis on the ancient languages. There are also minors related to each of these majors. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>The department encourages study abroad. In recent years, students in the department have spent part of their junior year at Oxford, Saint Andrews, and other institutions in Great Britain. College Year in Athens also offers a one-semester program in Greece. Students who anticipate taking an advanced degree in archaeology, ancient art history, ancient history, or classics can apply to summer sessions of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. </P><P>See Also </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Ancient Studies (p. 56) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Classics (p. 113) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Latin (p. 283) </Link></LBody></LI></L><P>Contact Information </P><P>Geoff Sumi, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/classics (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/classics/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>Learning goals for students of classics and ancient studies are: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To analyze critically ancient Greek and Roman texts, in their original languages and in translation, within their literary, philosophical, and historical contexts. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To understand major monuments and artifacts within their historical and cultural settings; to develop a visual literacy of ancient art and sharpen the ability to see and express what one sees. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To imagine fully and creatively ancient cultural communities when relying on limited written and material remains. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To deepen the understanding of current problems by studying the responses of ancient Greeks and Romans to questions about the human condition, including, how to live well, and how to govern. </LBody></LI></L><P>Full PDF 259 </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To write and speak more conﬁdently and effectively, and to develop well-reasoned arguments using primary evidence and/or secondary material, including print and digital resources. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To expand intellectual breadth through studying the ancient Greek and Roman worlds through different disciplines and modes of inquiry. </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Classics and Italian. Advisors for Greek: </P><P>Paula Debnar, Professor of Classics on the Alumnae Foundation, Teaching Spring Only </P><P>Geoffrey Sumi, Professor of Classics </P><P>Bruce Arnold, Associate Professor of Classics </P><P>Requirements for the Major </P><P>A minimum of 32 credits: </P><P>Code Title Credits </P><P>At least 12 credits at the 300 level in the language of concentration 12 </P><P>20 additional credits in approved courses at the 200 level or above.

It teaches us to look beyond appearance, to evaluate something with clarity and disinterest, to discover and investigate all the causes of an event and evaluate their relative importance. History teaches how to discern the relationship between cause and effect, to analyze motives, to determine agency and assign responsibility, and to understand change over time.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This seminar surveys the history of shopping from the seventeenth to early-twentieth century. From its origin as a term for wastefulness, consumption is now understood as an essential feature of prosperity in modern society. How did shopping change over this period to occupy such an important place in our world? Using primary, secondary and material sources, students will examine the commodities, shopping habits, business strategies, consumer politics, marketplaces, and identities that shaped and sustained the rise of retail. Set primarily in a European context, the course will also emphasize the global and imperial dimensions of consumption and the systems of power that enabled it. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>D.

The literature and artwork of the ancient world are ﬁlled with images of the two faces of war: it conferred great glory on the combatants but at the cost of tremendous horror and suffering. In this course we will examine warfare from archaic Greece and the rise of the city-state (ca. 800 B.C.E.) to the fall of the Roman Empire in the west (ca. 476 C.E.). We will consider such topics as the culture and ethics of war and imperialism, logistics and strategies of warfare, as well as armor, weaponry and battleﬁeld tactics. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-232 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

Credits: 4 Bread and circuses (panem et circenses) was a catchphrase in the Roman empire that described the political strategy of controlling an unruly populace through free bread and public entertainment. Against a backdrop of Roman social and political institutions, this course focuses on the imperial ideology, aristocratic ethos, and cultural practices that underpinned this catchphrase, as well as questions concerning the careers of entertainers--gladiators, charioteers, and actors--who were at once celebrities and social outcasts; the rules of spectatorship at the games; the use of these games as a form of social control; and the logistics of feeding the city population. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-226 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

Among themes to be explored are political structures, trade, slavery, gender relations, and religion, as well as the contributions of ancient Greeks to literary genres (drama, rhetoric, historiography, philosophy) and to the visual arts. Throughout we will consider how the history of the ancient Greeks can speak to modern concerns. Sources will include works of ancient Greek literature and history (e.g., Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Plutarch) as well as archaeological and epigraphic evidence. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-227 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>P.

This course covers the history of Ancient Rome from its mythologized beginnings (753 BCE) to the rise and spread of Christianity under the Emperor Constantine (312 CE). Topics include the creation and development of Rome's republican form of government as well as its eventual transition to monarchy, the causes and consequences of the acquisition of empire, the role of the army in administering the provinces and defending the frontiers, the image of emperor, the economy, and religion. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-228 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

The history of the Roman empire is replete with scandalous stories about eccentric and even insane emperors whose reigns raise questions about the nature of the emperor's power and his role in administering the empire. In this course a close study of Roman imperial biography and historiography--the source of so many of these stories of bad emperors-will be weighed against documentary and archaeological evidence in order to reveal the dynamic between the emperor, his court, and his subjects that was fundamental to the political culture of imperial Rome. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-229 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>G.

In colonial and post-colonial settings, the tribe has served as a category for military surveillance and paciﬁcation, legal regulation, economic development, and political resistance. Drawing mainly on examples from South Asia and engaging theoretical frames from the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Canada, we will consider how colonial and post-colonial governments, missionaries, and tribal populations themselves have invoked tribe.

Drawing from texts and ﬁlms about and by the people living on the borderlands, students in the seminar are to explore the intersecting relation between the two pressing issues and how Chinese states dealt with them. Furthermore, how did all these concerns originate? To that end, the seminar begins by examining how the central state in early modern China formed a multicultural empire in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>L.

Cities were cosmopolitan, centers of commerce, and sites of social movements in late imperial China, Tokugawa Japan, and late Chos#n Korea. How did the roles of cities change in the nineteenth century when East Asia became more integrated into the global system? How was urban life affected in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century when the central states dealt with domestic turmoil and external pressures? How did the state work to redeﬁne cities and urban culture in the postwar era? To answer these questions, this seminar encourages students to position cities historically and comparatively. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>L.

Beginning with the French Atlantic of the eighteenth century, the course traces Franco-African encounters through informal and formal colonial rule, decolonization, and the postcolonial period. It closes by examining current controversies over race, literature and museum rights engendered by this complex history. Students will gain a deep historical understanding of contemporary issues, giving them the capacity to think widely about social divisions, power asymmetries, and debates surrounding identity and belonging that de-center the American experience. </P><P>Crosslisted as: AFCNA-241FR, CST-249FR Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>E.

Credits: 4 </P><P>One of the most signiﬁcant shifts in global history is the incorporation of the New World into the Afro-Eurasian trading system. Slowly, but surely, the Mediterranean declined as a hub of inter-continental trade, and the Atlantic Ocean gained ground. On West Africa's Shores analyzes this world-historical pivot from the perspective of West Africa. Beginning with the rise of the Ghana Empire, we study trans-Saharan cultures of exchange, the societies of West Africa's Middle Ages, and the ways that the trans-Atlantic slave trade transformed the region. A special focus on art and artefacts helps us imagine the worlds of West Africa over the course of a millennium. </P><P>Crosslisted as: AFCNA-241WE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>E.

Around the same time, states on the other side of the Iron Curtain saw the postwar era of rapid economic growth and social consensus close. This course, reaching across the revolutionary break of 1989 up to the present, raises questions of convergence and continuity in European public policy, West and East. Paired case studies from a variety of countries in ﬁelds such as energy, the environment, minority rights, and housing serve to clarify rules and patterns to the politics of policy, from Cold War to European Union and beyond. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

They have been long viewed as transcendental spaces, served as a canvas for epic struggles between humans and nature, shaped cultural attitudes and been at the heart of political struggles. This course traces the history of various political and cultural meanings attached to mountains. Using examples from around the globe, it seeks to argue that rather than a metaphor for remoteness and primitivism, mountains are constitutive to our understanding of modernity. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

The signiﬁcance of this extended intellectual episode has been assessed in radically different ways throughout the intervening centuries. As such, it provides a fertile ground on which to pose and answer important questions about science and its role in society. What does it mean to regard science as 'revolutionary'? How are scientiﬁc developments shaped by, and how do they shape, the social, economic, and political worlds in which they are embedded? How is our contemporary understanding of science and technology influenced by the stories we tell about the past? </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-248 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>D.

Millions living along its vast coastline face the imminent danger of being reduced to climate refugees. In such times, how might we understand the longer history of environmental change in South Asia? This course traces shifts in how people in the region have understood the environment -- as a source of sustenance, a resource ripe for domination, and an entity in need of saving. Drawing from histories of agriculture, public works, and forestry, it interrogates how transnational forces such as colonial capitalism and geopolitics have shaped local interactions between humans, nature, and animals. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

If money could speak, what stories would it tell of the past? This course is about the history of money and money as an object of history. Using primary and secondary sources, students will learn about the social, political and cultural meaning of money at different times in the history of the western world. In addition, students will interpret the history of money using a variety of coins and money-related objects held in the MHC Art Museum. This is a course on the history of money, not the economics of money, but it will be of interest to anyone curious to learn more about the meaning of money in the past and today. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>D.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In contrast to democratic Athens, oligarchic Sparta was renowned for its secrecy and skillful use of propaganda. Thus, it presents difﬁcult challenges for historical study. In this course we will try to peer behind the &quot;Spartan mirage&quot; to determine how much the Spartans really differed from other ancient Greeks. We will then try to understand the use of Spartans as models for later polities and for groups like the Nazis and Alt-right. Topics: government, education, and citizenship; the role of women, eugenics, and slavery; the use and misuse of the image of Sparta. Readings will include Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, and modern scholarship on speciﬁc topics. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CLASS-253 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>HIST-255 Ideas and Society in Europe </P><P>HIST-255DE Ideas and Society in Europe: 'Decentering Europe: An Introduction to Critical European Studies' </P><P>Spring.

Taking a critical view of conventional paradigms of European nation states and &quot;master&quot; narratives, we study shifting European cultures and identities through multiple perspectives across time and space. What remains of the ancient and modern regimes? How have global movements, historical upheavals, and shifting boundaries within and adjacent to European borders, from early empires to contemporary global networks, affected the transformation of lives? Where is Europe heading today?

Many Europeans questioned whether the greatness of cities was such a good thing, but most agreed that the history of nineteenth-century Europe could not be written without them. We will examine that history from the perspective of Europe's largest cities between the mid-eighteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Readings will explore the process of urban transformation, the new forms of experience and identity that emerged in city life, and the efforts of governments, social reformers, planners and engineers to control and discipline the new urban masses. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>D.

Credits: 4 </P><P>With the discovery of a maritime route between Europe and India in 1498, an increasing number of Europeans traveled to South Asia, for commerce, on missionary activity, to collect plants, and as part of colonial enterprises. From about 1600, South Asian elites, and, later, anti-colonial leaders, soldiers, and students, among others, journeyed in the opposite direction. Tracing a long history of cross-cultural contact, this seminar examines the role of travel in fashioning notions of self and &quot;other&quot;. It asks how travel narratives visualize place and people, in what ways gender mediates experiences of travel, and how these encounters help reveal what is common and different between cultures. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

Therefore, they should all be completed within the ﬁrst ﬁve semesters at Mount Holyoke. IR-200 is intended for IR majors in their sophomore year. </P><P>2 Please note that the Department of Economics requires ECON-110 Introductory Economics as a prerequisite for ECON-165 , ECON-213, and ECON-218. </P><P>3 Students with high school preparation in geography should take GEOG-206. </P><P>Other Requirements </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Focus. Each student’s major must have a focus, consisting of at least 12 credits in two different disciplines, only 4 credits of which may be independent study. Students may elect one of the following ﬁve foci: global commons, international institutions, international peace and security, international political economy, or international ethics. They may also design a focus, with the approval of their advisor and the chair. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Independent study. Only 4 credits of independent work can count toward the requirement for courses at the 300 level. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Foreign language. Each student is expected to possess or acquire proﬁciency in a foreign language up to the intermediate level. </LBody></LI></L><P>Additional Speciﬁcations </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Soon after declaring their major, students should plan individual programs of study in consultation with one or more members of the faculty committee, one of whom will be designated the student’s academic advisor. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Exceptions to the requirements above will be made only in rare cases and require the approval of the chair. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>The Department of International Relations does not cross-list courses in other departments that satisfy the major’s requirements. Generally, all courses taught by members of the IR Committee count toward the major. For courses offered by other faculty, the policy of the department is to accept any course in any department that is directly pertinent to the student’s focus in the major. Thus, for example, a student whose focus is global commons could conceivably count courses offered by the geology or biological sciences departments. Or a student focusing on international ethics could use certain courses in the religion or philosophy departments to satisfy the requirements of the major. Any questions concerning the appropriateness of a particular course can be answered by the advisor or the department chair. It is important for the student to verify that the course in question will count toward the major before enrolling. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>The IR major focuses on global issues and institutions, and relationships across regions and nations. This does not preclude students from developing expertise in a particular region or nation; indeed, part of the study of international relations is how global issues ﬁnd local expressions. But students whose primary interest is in a particular area of the world should elect a more appropriate major, such as Latin American or Asian studies. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Students who declare an international relations major automatically fulﬁll the College's &quot;outside the major&quot; requirement. </LBody></LI></L><P>At least 12 credits at the 300 level in two different disciplines (see 12 Focus below) </P><P>Certiﬁcate Overview </P></Div></Sect><P>8 additional credits in international relations 8 The Five College International Relations Certiﬁcate Program offers students an opportunity to pursue an interest in international affairs </P><Sect><P>Total Credits 40 </P><P>as a complement to their majors.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Human rights have emerged in the past sixty years as a powerful set of ideas in international relations. This course explores the intellectual and political evolution of these rights and their integration into the international system today. We will examine the principal human rights institutions, protocols, and conventions and analyze their successes and limitations in theory and practice. We will also examine the central controversies and challenges -- the practice of human rights in a system based on sovereign states; the tensions associated with cultural relativism; and, the challenges of dominant states selectively applying rights to serve their own interests. We will also examine the role of human rights advocacy in the era of globalization. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>J.

multifaceted culture of the Italian people. In addition to acquiring advanced oral and written proﬁciency in the Italian language, majors and minors will have the opportunity to access Italy’s rich literary and cultural heritage through cinema, literature, music, art, the Web. Besides selecting courses offered at Mount Holyoke and in the more extended Five College community, students are encouraged to investigate the many study abroad options available to them in such culturally diverse cities as Bologna, Florence, and Padova. A major in Italian language and culture can lead to a variety of national and international careers, from </P><P>foreign service to fashion marketing, from international banking and trade to ﬁlm, from a career in nonproﬁts to teaching. </P><P>The weekly Italian table provides a welcoming environment for spontaneous expression and cultural exchange, and the ongoing extracurricular activities of the Italian club, lectures, and ﬁlms round out the multifaceted learning experience at MHC. </P><P>See Also </P><P>• <Link>Romance Languages and Cultures (p. 379) </Link></P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Geoff Sumi, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/italian (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/italian/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>In connection with the College’s learning goals, the major in Italian at Mount Holyoke prepares students to develop a comprehensive knowledge of Italian language and culture. It is the department’s mission to inspire and motivate students to learn about Italian culture in all of its multifaceted aspects through: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>in-depth study of the Italian language in all of its components (speaking, writing, reading and listening), in order to achieve near-native proﬁciency. Through a communicative approach, students learn to express feelings, engage in discussion about any topic, develop complex ideas, and read and critically analyze original texts and ﬁlms in Italian. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>in-depth study of Italian culture and literature to develop a rich, diverse and layered knowledge of Italian thought, history, cultural habits, geography, culinary tradition, gender issues and politics. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>in-depth study of the role of Italy and Italian culture in Mediterranean and world history through millennia of people’s shifts, diasporas and migrations. </LBody></LI></L><P>The department aims for students to become global citizens, through study abroad programs in Italy and internships in Venice, Florence and Rome.

Students learn to examine the world with an educated, critical eye; to collect material from a wide range of sources; and to analyze and communicate information clearly and concisely. MHC’s approach reflects the reality of the job market: employers in journalism and media want students who are knowledgeable and articulate across a wide array of subjects in the liberal arts, who are creative, flexible thinkers with superior writing and analytical capabilities. The Nexus in Journalism, Media, and Public Discourse encourages students to explore journalism and media through many venues.

More important, it lives on in the influence it exerted on countless later writers and thinkers and, of course, in Latin works that modern audiences continue to ﬁnd relevant. Among the most familiar names in Latin literature are those from its apex in the ﬁrst century BCE and ﬁrst century CE. Authors such as Cicero, Caesar, Catullus, Vergil, Horace, Livy, Ovid, and Tacitus mastered the genres of epic, lyric, and elegiac poetry, satire, oratory, and historiography. </P><P>The department offers courses in Latin at all levels, with those at the intermediate and advanced levels focusing on many of the authors mentioned above. Students will also ﬁnd a wide array of courses (in English) approaching the culture and history of Roman antiquity from a variety of perspectives. </P><P>While the study of Latin is a foundation stone of the discipline of classics, the Latin major or minor is also excellent preparation for advanced study in English, religion, philosophy, and history. There are also many opportunities for teaching Latin at the middle and high school levels (see below on Teaching Licensure). </P><P>In addition to Latin, the department offers majors in classics, Greek, and ancient studies. Classics combines the study of both ancient languages with courses in ancient history, art, philosophy, politics, or religion. Ancient studies approaches Greek and Roman civilizations from an interdisciplinary perspective with less emphasis on the ancient languages. There are also minors related to each of these majors. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>The department encourages study abroad. In recent years a number of students in the department have spent part of their junior years at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies (ICCS) in Rome. Some have pursued their studies at Oxford, Saint Andrews, and other institutions in Great Britain. Students who anticipate taking an advanced degree in archaeology, ancient art history, ancient history, or classics can also apply to summer sessions of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. </P><P>See Also </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Ancient Studies (p. 56) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Classics (p. 113) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Greek (p. 258) </Link></LBody></LI></L><P>Contact Information </P><P>Geoff Sumi, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/classics (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/classics/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>Learning goals for students of classics and ancient studies are: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To analyze critically ancient Greek and Roman texts, in their original languages and in translation, within their literary, philosophical, and historical contexts. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To understand major monuments and artifacts within their historical and cultural settings; to develop a visual literacy of ancient art and sharpen the ability to see and express what one sees. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To imagine fully and creatively ancient cultural communities when relying on limited written and material remains. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To deepen the understanding of current problems by studying the responses of ancient Greeks and Romans to questions about the human condition, including, how to live well, and how to govern. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To write and speak more conﬁdently and effectively, and to develop well-reasoned arguments using primary evidence and/or secondary material, including print and digital resources. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>To expand intellectual breadth through studying the ancient Greek and Roman worlds through different disciplines and modes of inquiry. </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Classics and Italian.

Credits: 4 Petronius' Satyricon is one of the few surviving novels from the ancient world. Formed from a pastiche of other literary genres, including epic, comedy, and satire, it is a vivid account of the adventures of three men as they travel throughout Italy. Though ﬁction, and only partially extant, its realistic portrayal of Roman life offers a glimpse into the social mores in the early empire. Petronius himself was a member of Nero's court and the Satyricon a product of Nero's promotion of the arts. By giving rise to the picaresque genre the Satyricon’s influence continued to be felt far beyond its own day. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language </P><P>G.

To that end, our courses adopt a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches, including literary studies, ﬁlm and media studies, social history, and politics. </P><P>The Department of Spanish, Latina/o, and Latin American Studies also collaborates closely with a number of other departments and programs on campus, frequently cross-listing courses with ﬁlm studies, gender studies, history, and Romance languages and cultures. Regular co-curricular activities organized by the department (ﬁlm series, lectures, etc.) also engage the larger college community in the interests of our students and faculty. In addition to providing opportunities for learning on campus, the department also strongly recommends that students study off campus in a Spanish-speaking context in order to enhance their language skills and to forge their own connections to place through language. </P><P>The interdisciplinary major and minor in Latin American studies emphasize critical approaches to the culture, history, society, and political economy of the region. As societies long deﬁned by and in opposition to external powers, Latin America and the Caribbean have in modern times developed distinctive national and cultural identities celebrated on a world stage in art, music, and literature. The major and minor study the region in its enormous geographic diversity—from plantation to highland Americas, from Mexico to Argentina; and linguistic variety—four European, several Creole, and numerous indigenous languages. Students pursue course work in several thematic and geographic areas. </P><P>See Also </P><P>• <Link>Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies (p. 289) </Link></P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Nieves Romero-Diaz, Chair Cara Lapenas, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>105 Ciruti Language Center 413-538-2347 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/spanish/latam (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/spanish/latam/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>The three areas of the Spanish, Latina/o/x and Latin American Studies department share the following common learning goals: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Recognize, examine, and interrogate the past, current state, and emerging realities and histories of the societies and cultures of Latin America, Spain, the Caribbean, and the US Latina/o/x population. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Describe and interpret the character of their relations with each other and with the wider world. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Distinguish among and employ multi/interdisciplinary, transnational, and cross-border perspectives. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Analyze critically and articulate with logical arguments the diverse conﬁgurations and varying experiences of (classic, post, and neo) </LBody></LI></L><P>colonialism and diaspora in and among the regions, nations, and populations of our concern. </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop the ability to write, read, speak, and conduct research in the primary languages of our area(s) of coverage, particularly English and Spanish. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Creatively contribute to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge through different modalities individually and collectively. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Engage with and maintain a sustained contact with the local Latina/ o/x communities. </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Spanish, Latina/o, and Latin American Studies: </P><P>Dorothy Mosby, Professor of Spanish;

Courses in Latina/o Studies place a premium on critical thinking, comparative analyses, and historical and contemporary engagement with society. </P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Nieves Romero-Diaz, Chair Cara Lapenas, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>105 Ciruti Language Center 413-538-2347 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/spanish/latina/o-studies-us (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/spanish/latina/o-studies-us/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>The three areas of the Spanish, Latina/o/x and Latin American Studies department share the following common learning goals: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Recognize, examine, and interrogate the past, current state, and emerging realities and histories of the societies and cultures of Latin America, Spain, the Caribbean, and the US Latina/o/x population. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Describe and interpret the character of their relations with each other and with the wider world. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Distinguish among and employ multi/interdisciplinary, transnational, and cross-border perspectives. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Analyze critically and articulate with logical arguments the diverse conﬁgurations and varying experiences of (classic, post, and neo) colonialism and diaspora in and among the regions, nations, and populations of our concern. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop the ability to write, read, speak, and conduct research in the primary languages of our area(s) of coverage, particularly English and Spanish. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Creatively contribute to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge through different modalities individually and collectively. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Engage with and maintain a sustained contact with the local Latina/ o/x communities. </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Spanish, Latina/o, and Latin American Studies: </P><P>Dorothy Mosby, Professor of Spanish; Interim Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty </P><P>Nieves Romero-Díaz, Professor of Spanish on the Alumnae Foundation </P><P>Justin Crumbaugh, Associate Professor of Spanish, Latina/o and Latin </P><P>American Studies David Hernández, Associate Professor of Spanish, Latina/o, Latin American Studies; Faculty Director of Community Engagement </P><P>Adriana Pitetta, Assistant Professor of Spanish </P><P>Vanessa Rosa, Class of 1929 Dr. Virginia Apgar Assistant Professor of Latina/o Studies Esther Castro, Senior Lecturer in Spanish; Spanish Language Program </P><P>Director, Teaching Fall Only Dimaris Barrios-Beltrán, Visiting Language Instructor in Spanish Flávia Cunha, Language Instructor in Spanish Elena García Frazier, Language Instructor in Spanish Antonio Illescas, Language Instructor in Spanish Veronica Davila Ellis, Visiting Lecturer in Spanish, Latina/o, and Latin </P><P>American Studies </P><P>Requirements for the Minor </P><P>A minimum of 20 credits: </P><Table><TR><TH>Code </TH><TH>Title </TH><TH>Credits </TH></TR><TR><TD>LATST-180 </TD><TD>Introduction to Latina/o Studies: Structural </TD><TD>4 </TD></TR><TR><TD/><TD>Inequalities </TD><TD/></TR></Table><P>At least one Latina/o Studies course at the 300 level 4 </P><P>Three other Latina/o Studies courses at the 200 or 300 level 12 </P><P>Total Credits 20 </P><P>Additional Speciﬁcations </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>At least one course must include a Community-Based Learning component. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Students are encouraged to take Latina/o Studies courses offered across the Five Colleges, per department faculty approval. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Four Independent Study credits may be included in the minor (LATST-295, LATST-395). </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Courses in a student’s major ﬁeld may not be used to fulﬁll the minimum requirements of the minor.

The course addresses legal constructions of race and citizenship, nomenclature, border politics, public health, education, and labor. We will consider the critical intersections of class, gender and sexuality as well as inequality in relation to other persons of color. Students will develop a ﬁrm sense of the importance and breadth of the Latina/o political agenda and acquire skills to think across social issues. With the help of a Community Based Learning (CBL) Mentor, students will explore various conceptions of &quot;community&quot; in Latina/o/x Studies through forums and discussions. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Community-Based Learning </P><P>V.

Whereas the Declaration of Independence asserts that &quot;all men are created equal,&quot; we will interrogate that statement by studying identities and personages that are explicitly treated unequally in the law and society. From immigrants to gang members, from tipped workers to queer persons, from presumed terrorists to disenfranchised ex-cons, we will examine the deliberate incorporation and maintenance of people in society into lower classes and statuses. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-249AN Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>D.

Credits: 4 In Borderlands/La Frontera, Gloria Anzaldúa asserts that material change is impossible without changing the cultural imagery in our minds. Latinx Borderlands artists have effected such change through their cultural production. This course will introduce students to Borderlands literature and ﬁlm, and will provide an overview of Mexican American, Chicanx, and other Latinx artistic production from the U.S- Mexico border region. The course will closely examine how these texts reflect borderland folklore, social issues, and &quot;fronterizo&quot; identities. Students will read multiple registers of artistic production, including ﬁction, non-ﬁction, poetry, drama, testimonio, and folk song lyrics. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>R.

Urban scholars have long studied the &quot;evolving&quot; city-this course explores the changing city in relation to Latina/o/x populations and urban social change movements. We examine historical and contemporary conditions and cover a broad range of topics including: urbanization, urban planning, &quot;new urbanism," placemaking, gentriﬁcation, migration/immigration, segregation, and more. The readings in this course aim to provoke a consideration of the dynamic between space and place, as well as how urban life, culture, and form impacts Latina/o/x populations and vice versa. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-249LR Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>V.

We will study the theater work of Latina/os in the U.S. to broaden our understanding of multicultural theater. In addition to studying dramatic texts, we will consider the political implications of the work and its relationship to social activism. We will look at theater companies whose primary missions are to produce Latino/a theater and at the history of the representation of Latinos on stage in this country. We will draw upon theory from ﬁelds such as cultural studies, feminist studies and dramatic criticism as we think and write about the creative work in this course. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>P.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course interrogates the normative construction and meaning of nation-state borders. We do so from the United States/Mexico border, and utilize a comparative approach, relating Latinx Studies to critical Indigenous feminist perspectives. While focused mainly on the United States landmass the course also critically foregrounds Native/Indigenous land and sovereignty to re-conceptualize the United States as a settler colonial, imperial state. Utilizing the knowledges of Latinx and Indigenous thinkers, students will trace the construction of modern borders and will productively re-frame assumptions around immigration/migration, citizenship, nationalism and indigenismo/Indigeneity. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Community-Based Learning, Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>R.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course analyzes the concepts of race and racism from an interdisciplinary perspective, with focus on Latinas/os/x in the United States. It explores the sociocultural, political, economic, and historical forces that interact with each other in the production of racial categories and racial &quot;difference.&quot; In particular, we focus on racial ideologies, racial formation theory, and processes of racialization, as well as the relationship between race and ethnicity. The course examines racial inequality from a historical perspective and investigates how racial categories evolve and form across contexts. The analysis that develops will ultimately allow us to think rigorously about social inequality, resistance and liberation. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-249RP, GNDST-204RP Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>V.

How does it differ from and/or intersect with &quot;other&quot; feminisms? In this seminar, we will explore the relationship between Latina feminist theory, knowledge production, and social change in the United States. This interdisciplinary course explores Latina feminism in relation to methodology and epistemology through a historical lens. This will help us to better understand how Latina feminist approaches can inform our research questions, allow us to analyze women's experiences and women's history, and challenge patriarchy and gender inequality. We will explore topics related to knowledge production, philosophies of the &quot;self,&quot; positionality, inequality, the body, reproductive justice, representation, and community. Our approach in this class will employ an intersectional approach to feminist theory that understands the interconnectedness between multiple forms of oppression, including race, class, sexuality, and ability. Our goal is to develop a robust understanding of how Latina feminist methodologies and epistemologies can be tools for social change. </P><P>Crosslisted as: GNDST-333FM, CST-349FM Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>V.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Housing is closely tied to quality of life and the health of neighborhoods and communities. As a main goal of the &quot;American Dream," homeownership has important signiﬁcance on an individual and societal level. For immigrants, this goal is often out of reach as a result of racism and discriminatory housing policies. This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latinas/os/x relationship to housing and homeownership by examining: 1. the history of housing policy in the United States; 2. national identity, assimilation, and housing; and 3. discriminatory housing policies/programs and housing inequality. We explore topics including immigration, housing policy, public housing, segregation, gentriﬁcation, the suburbs, homelessness, eviction, affordability, and community building. Exploring this range of topics will help us develop a clearer understanding of why housing is one of the most pressing issues for Latinas/os/x today. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-349MC, GNDST-333MC Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Community-Based Learning, Speaking-Intensive </P><P>V.

We will examine the economic, political, and social antecedents to Latin American migration, and the historical impact of the migration process in the U.S. Considering migration from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, we will discuss the social construction of race, the gendered nature of migration, migrant labor struggles, Latin American-U.S. Latino relations, immigration policy, and border life and enforcement. Notions of citizenship, race, class, gender, and sexuality will be central to our understanding of the complexity at work in the migration process. </P><P>Crosslisted as: GNDST-333UU, CST-349UU Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Community-Based Learning </P><P>D.

I will tell you: in every corner of the known universe, you will ﬁnd either the presence of logical arguments or, more signiﬁcantly, the absence.” —V. K. Samadar </P><P>Logic is a part of every discipline. There is reasoning in every ﬁeld of inquiry. There are rules behind every work of art, behind every natural language.

In some instances course work in the major coincides with course work required for licensure; in other cases, it does not. For speciﬁc course requirements for licensure within the major of mathematics, please consult your advisor or the chair of the mathematics department. Further <Link>information about the minor in education (p. 367) and the Teacher </Link><Link>Licensure program (p. 368) is available in other sections of the catalog, </Link>or consult Ms. Lawrence in the psychology and education department. </P><P>Licensure also requires a formal application, as well as passing scores on the Massachusetts Test of Educator Licensure (MTEL) in both the literacy component and the subject matter component. Copies of the test objectives for the MTEL are available in the mathematics department and in the Department of Psychology and Education. </P><P>Additional information about the Licensure Program, including <Link>application materials, can be found on the Teacher Licensure Program </Link><Link>website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/teach/). </Link></P><P>Course Advice </P><P>Beginning the Study of Mathematics </P><P>There are many ways to begin the study of the mathematical sciences at Mount Holyoke College. Students can begin with precalculus, calculus, an introduction to statistics or data analysis, an &quot;explorations&quot; course, or computer science. </P><P>If your interests lie in science, economics, or social sciences, calculus is important because it is the language these disciplines use. Students who are planning to take Precalculus or Calculus I are required to complete a brief online self-assessment. The self-assessment is available to all entering students. It is designed so that a student can use it as a learning tool, taking it as many times as they wish. More information is </P><P><Link>on the department’s website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/math/ </Link><Link>assessments/</Link>). </P><P>Toward the Study of Calculus </P><P>If the online self-assessment or your own mathematics background suggests, you should complete a year-long sequence of MATH-100, followed by MATH-101. Mount Holyoke's MATH-100 course (including all of its variants like MATH-100QR) awards 4 credits and fulﬁlls the Math/ Science distribution requirement. Precalculus courses taken outside the Mount Holyoke College MATH-100/MATH-101 sequence will not be granted credit nor be approved to satisfy any distribution requirement. </P><P>Beginning with Calculus </P><P>If you wish to begin with a calculus course, you can take any of the following: </P><P>Code Title Credits </P><P>MATH-101 Calculus I 4 </P><P>MATH-102 Calculus II 4 </P><P>MATH-203 Calculus III 4 </P><P>Students who have not studied calculus and who have the necessary precalculus background belong in Calculus I. </P><P>Most students who have taken calculus in high school begin with Calculus II. In particular, if you have studied the derivative and its applications and have been introduced to the deﬁnite integral, you should take the Calculus Assessment to determine if you are ready to move to Calculus II. </P><P>If you have a good knowledge of applications of integration and of transcendental functions, and if you enjoy mathematics, we encourage you to begin your college-level study of calculus with Calculus III (MATH-203). (The study of series is neither required for nor included in Calculus III. Physics and mathematics students will encounter this topic in later courses.) </P><P>Beginning the study of calculus beyond Calculus I does not require the advanced placement examination, although the score on this examination is a useful guide. A student with an advanced placement AB score of 3 or less should begin with MATH-101; an advanced placement AB score of 4 or 5 or a BC score of 3 indicates readiness for MATH-102; a grade of 4 or 5 on the BC examination indicates readiness for MATH-203. </P><P>Other Beginnings </P><P>The “explorations” courses in areas like number theory and geometry  (for example, MATH-114, MATH-120) offer another way to begin your study of mathematics. They emphasize mathematics as an art and as a way of seeing and understanding. The exploration courses do not presuppose demonstrated ability for or prior strong interest in mathematics. They intend to awaken interest by demonstrating either the remarkable pervasiveness of mathematics in nature and its power as a tool that transcends disciplines, or its qualities as an art that can fascinate and offer aesthetic pleasure to the participant. Any explorations course can serve as an entry to the further study of mathematics, and even to a minor or a major. Students who wish to go on may follow up with the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation (MATH-251) or Discrete Mathematics (MATH-232), among various other possibilities, all of which can be discussed with any member of the department. </P><P>A few students begin their study of mathematics with Linear Algebra (MATH-211), Discrete Mathematics (MATH-232), or the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation (MATH-251). Linear Algebra is a </P><P>good choice for students who have a very solid background in high school mathematics and who enjoy abstraction. If you have taken some calculus, and if you enjoy new topics in mathematics, then you might consider either Discrete Mathematics (MATH-232) or the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation (MATH-251). </P><P>Finally, some students begin their study of mathematical sciences with statistics or computer science. For more information see the sections on <Link>statistics (p. 401) and computer science (p. 120) in this catalog. </Link></P><P>Advice to Students with Special Interests Actuarial science </P><P>Students interested in this area should plan to cover the material that is included in the ﬁrst two actuarial exams as part of their undergraduate program.

These activities are often initiated by and beneﬁt greatly from the diverse student population of Mount Holyoke. </P><P>Most of our students spend a semester or a summer in study abroad programs. Students may participate in one of the many Mount Holyoke College-approved Middle Eastern study abroad programs. </P><P>Middle Eastern studies majors graduate to pursue graduate studies and careers in ﬁelds as varied as education, business, NGOs, journalism, the arts, and government service. </P><P>See Also </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Arabic Minor (p. 65) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Asian Studies (p. 83) </Link></LBody></LI></L><P>Contact Information </P><P>Calvin Chen, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/asian (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/asian/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>By majoring in Middle Eastern Studies, students should: </P><L><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop proﬁciency in Arabic, Hebrew, or another language widely spoken in the Middle East.

However, even casual reflection reveals that these assumptions are just that — things we take for granted without much thought. In order to illuminate our lives and appreciate our existence, we ought to investigate these assumptions. </P><P>Philosophy is a discipline that encourages the examination of life in its myriad dimensions. Our fundamental assumptions about right and wrong, beauty, truth, the mind, language, and meaning are exposed to careful scrutiny in philosophy classes. We encourage students of philosophy not only to strive to understand what philosophers have written, but also to be a philosopher — to think with depth and clarity about issues that are fundamental to our condition as human beings. Whether taking a course on epistemology, ethics, feminist philosophy, logic, or philosophy of time, students of philosophy will leave the course seeing the world anew. </P><P>A major in philosophy will provide a broad understanding of the background of both historical and contemporary philosophical thought, with the tools for critical reasoning necessary for philosophical inquiry, with a good understanding of some important philosophical themes, and with the enthusiasm for inquiry necessary for the productive pursuit of one's own philosophical speculations. The critical approach learned will be valuable for whatever students choose to do after graduation. </P><P>See Also </P><P>• <Link>Logic (p. 294) </Link></P><P>Contact Information </P><P>James Harold, Chair Natalina Tulik, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>205 Skinner Hall 413-538-2249 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/philosophy (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/philosophy/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P><Link>Mount Holyoke College’s undergraduate learning goals (p. 8) emphasize </Link>skills that promote good citizenship and lifelong learning. At its heart, philosophy is the practice of critical thinking about foundational questions, including moral and political questions about what is a good life and how to be a good citizen. Philosophy is, thus, crucial to realizing Mount Holyoke’s educational mission. This is especially clear with respect to Mount Holyoke’s ﬁrst learning goal, which says that students should learn to “think analytically and critically by questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and articulating well-reasoned arguments.” This is precisely what we learn to do when we learn to do philosophy. The ability to carefully and fairly evaluate arguments is a skill that has value in any situation. As global citizens, over a lifetime of different careers and paths, philosophy equips students with the ability to </P><P>Full PDF 323 </P><P>see the difference between arguments that work and ones that mislead, between sense and nonsense. </P><P>All of the courses in our department, whatever the ostensible topic – Kant’s transcendental deduction, modal logics, the ethics of euthanasia, or the hard problem of consciousness – use a distinctly philosophical way of analyzing arguments. This is most explicit in logic, where the structure of arguments is itself the object of study, but it is equally important in other areas of philosophy. In the history of philosophy, for example, the study of texts focuses closely on understanding and evaluating the reasons offered by the author. The department puts a high priority in teaching the analysis of arguments in clear prose writing. By engaging in this sort of close study of arguments, students become better thinkers, better writers, and better able to handle whatever personal and professional challenges may come their way. </P><P>The department faculty provide the students with a focus on argument, both as it ought to be done, and as it is in fact done, using formal and informal methods. The learning goals, therefore, are fourfold. Students are expected to: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Analyze arguments using the tools of formal logic. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Write clear prose that explicitly sets out and evaluates arguments in English. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Set out and analyze the arguments they discover in texts. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop their own arguments in clear, concise, and convincing prose. </LBody></LI></L><P>One way to sum up the department's learning goals is this: everything we do in philosophy is centered around the analysis of arguments. In some cases this is done formally (in our logic courses); in others, argument analysis is done in clear prose and careful discussion. </P><P>These learning goals are embodied in the major's requirements, the graded work in philosophy courses, and in the department's seminars, theses, and independent work. </P><P>To sum up: clearheaded critical thinking is an invaluable skill in any context. The philosophy department has a precise understanding of what such critical thinking amounts to, and the value it has for students, as scholars as well as citizens. </P><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Department of Philosophy: </P><P>James Harold, Professor of Philosophy </P><P>Nina Emery, Associate Professor of Philosophy </P><P>Samuel Mitchell, Associate Professor of Philosophy </P><P>Katia Vavova, Associate Professor of Philosophy, On Leave 2021-2022 </P><P>Laura Sizer, Visiting Professor of Philosophy </P><P>Theresa Helke, Visiting Lecturer in Philosophy </P><P>Requirements for the Major </P><P>A minimum of 32 credits: </P><P>Code Title Credits </P><P>One course in the History of Philosophy, such as: 1 4 </P><P>PHIL-201 Philosophical Foundations of Western Thought: The Greek Period </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_296.jpg"/></Figure><P>PHIL-202 Philosophical Foundations of Western Thought: The Modern Period </P><P>PHIL-212 Philosophical Foundations of Chinese Thought: The Ancient Period </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_297.jpg"/></Figure><P>PHIL-255 Existentialism </P><P>One course in Ethics and Value Theory, such as: 4 </P><P>PHIL-205 Ethics </P><Table><TR><TH>PHIL-242 </TH><TH>Social and Political Philosophy </TH></TR><TR><TD>PHIL-273 </TD><TD>Philosophy of the Arts </TD></TR><TR><TD>One course in Theoretical Philosophy, such as: </TD><TD>4 </TD></TR><TR><TD>PHIL-222 </TD><TD>Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics </TD><TD/></TR><TR><TD>PHIL-270 </TD><TD>Epistemology </TD><TD/></TR><TR><TD>PHIL-272 </TD><TD>Metaphysics </TD><TD/></TR><TR><TD>One course in Logic, such as: </TD><TD>4 </TD></TR><TR><TD>PHIL-170 </TD><TD>Logical Thought </TD><TD/></TR><TR><TD>PHIL-225 </TD><TD>Symbolic Logic </TD><TD/></TR><TR><TD>At least 12 credits in philosophy at the 300 level </TD><TD>12 </TD></TR><TR><TD>4 additional credits in philosophy </TD><TD/></TR></Table><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_298.jpg"/>4</Figure><P>Total Credits 32 </P><P>Prior to fall 2021, two courses in the History of Philosophy had been </P><P>required. </P><P>Additional Speciﬁcations </P><P>• Students who plan to do graduate work in philosophy will need to complete far more than the above minimum requirements for the major.

What moral duties do we have to those at the beginning and the end of life? How should limited health care resources be distributed? What are the responsibilities of medical researchers towards their subjects? Do we have reason to be worried about the growth of technology in medicine? Are the basic institutions of medicine just? The goals of this course are to improve our understanding of the arguments on different sides of these questions, and to acquire some tools to evaluate those arguments. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>M.

What are the responsibilities of individuals, particularly individuals living in relatively affluent societies, to prevent climate change, or to alleviate the harms caused by it? How should we act to prevent war, and should we ever initiate wars in order to prevent greater evils (such as terrorism)? What responsibilities do citizens of relatively affluent nations have to prevent and ameliorate poverty and global inequality? In order to reason clearly about these questions, we will need to think deeply about the notion of global citizenship (or &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;) and the nature of individual moral responsibility. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Do non-human animals have rights? Do trees and rivers? What about entire ecosystems? What might be the basis for such rights and obligations? We will discuss how traditional ethical theories have approached questions about moral obligations towards non-humans, and see whether these views can be extended to include some or all of the non-human natural entities mentioned above. Students will read and critically analyze philosophical positions and will learn to articulate arguments on several different sides of the issues. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities The department Notes: Short and longer argument papers are required. </P><P>PHIL-201 Philosophical Foundations of Western Thought: The Greek Period </P><P>Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4 </P><P>An introduction to ancient Greek philosophy, focusing mainly but not exclusively on the works and ideas of three Athenian philosophers who worked and taught in the period between the Persian Wars and the rule of Alexander the Great, more than 2,300 years ago: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Topics to be discussed include: What is the nature of the self? What is truth, and how can it be known? What kind of life should we live? We will work to understand each philosopher's responses to these questions, but we will also learn to develop our own answers. We will take care to place these ﬁgures and their works in their historical and cultural context. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Philosophy was transformed during the 17th and 18th centuries, in a period known as the Modern period, or the Enlightenment. This period is important for the background of our current views both in Philosophy and in intellectual endeavor generally. In this course, we'll look at the major ﬁgures involved in this transformation, and the positions about knowledge and reality that they defended. We'll have selections from the work of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. We might not cover all of these, but will get to most. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S. Mitchell Prereq: 4 credits in Philosophy.

The purpose of this course is to critically examine some of the key theoretical approaches to answering these questions. We will focus on three main ethical theories: (1) virtue ethics, which focuses on the importance of good character; (2) utilitarianism, which focuses on promoting the happiness of all; and (3) Kantianism, which focuses on an agent's reasons for acting. We will also discuss contemporary alternatives to and criticisms of these traditions. Finally, we will evaluate some arguments for and against the objectivity and universality of ethics. Is there such a thing as moral truth? </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities The department </P><P>PHIL-212 Philosophical Foundations of Chinese Thought: The Ancient Period </P><P>Fall. Credits: 4 </P><P>An introduction to Chinese thought during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (roughly 770-256 BCE), a time of remarkable philosophical growth and controversy. We read the works of this era's most influential philosophers, including: Kongzi (Confucius), Mozi, Laozi, Mengzi (Mencius), Zhuangzi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi. Topics discussed include: What makes for a just ruler? What kind of life should we live? What is our relationship to nature? We work to understand each philosopher's responses to these questions, but we also learn to develop our own answers. We take care to place these ﬁgures and their works in their historical and cultural context. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ASIAN-214 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Although quantum mechanics is a remarkably successful scientiﬁc theory, it also leads scientists to make extraordinary claims like that cats can be both dead and alive and that the state of a fundamental particle depends on whether someone one is observing it. In this class we will consider the various interpretations of quantum mechanics and the way in which those interpretations influence and are influenced by philosophical issues in science more generally. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>N.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course develops a symbolic system that can be used as the basis for inference in all ﬁelds. It will provide syntax and semantics for the language of this system and investigate its adequacy. It provides the basis for all further work in logic or in the philosophical foundations of mathematics. Much of the course has a mathematical flavor, but no knowledge of mathematics is necessary. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S.

Is religion in conflict with science? Can we have morality without religion? What happens when we die? In this class, we will consider arguments for and against different positions that people have on these questions. This course will give students a sense of the issues that philosophers of religion are currently thinking and writing about. As we think through topics such as these, we will be working to develop and hone philosophical skills such as analyzing concepts, constructing and critiquing arguments, and evaluating philosophical theories. </P><P>Crosslisted as: RELIG-226 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>We will examine the place of liberty and equality in a just society by looking at classic and contemporary topics in social and political philosophy. We will consider big questions such as the following: what is liberty and why is it important? What about equality? Do these values conflict? Or can a society ensure both? We will also consider more narrow, practical questions on topics such as immigration, voting, commodiﬁcation, reparations, freedom of expression, and a universal basic income. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities The department </P><P>PHIL-248 Philosophical Issues in Race and Racism </P><P>Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4 </P><P>The category of race has profound political, economic, and moral signiﬁcance for people. In the ﬁrst part of this class, we explore the problem of whether race is real. What would it mean for race to be real? If race is not real, what follows? Can we continue to use the concept of race if it is not real? The second part of the course deals with racism. What is racism? Is it a matter of conscious belief, implicit bias, institutional forces, or something else? What policies are morally appropriate to address racism? For example, are reparations for slavery justiﬁed? We dig deep, critically examine the key arguments on these topics, and practice disagreeing with another respectfully. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Philosophers through the ages have asked about the nature of happiness and its contribution to the 'good life.' Happiness is something we all want, but what is it? And why do we all want it so much? What makes us happy and why? Is a 'good life' also a happy one? This course will examine happiness from several different perspectives. We will look at what ancient and contemporary philosophers have said about the nature and importance of happiness in our lives and read recent work from the ﬁeld of positive psychology. This is a writing intensive course that focuses on developing skills in philosophical reading, analysis, and writing. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>L.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In this course, we will undertake a close reading of several of Plato's dialogues, exploring the themes of beauty, love, justice, society, and human happiness. More formally, we will cover metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, moral psychology, and social and political philosophy. Dialogues include Lysis, Symposium, Gorgias, Republic, Me no, and Phaedo. Plato's ideas were as surprising and controversial to his Athenian contemporaries as they are to so many in this American democracy. For that very reason, Plato's ideas remain alive and deeply relevant today. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>V. de Harven </P><P>PHIL-255 Existentialism </P><P>Spring. Credits: 4 </P><P>Modernity has brought with it scientiﬁc and technological wonders, but it has also uprooted millennia-old convictions about God, morality, and humanity's place in the universe. In a secular society, how should we choose which values to adopt, or what path in life we should follow? How can we be authentic or true to ourselves in a culture that rewards conformity? What, moreover, is the meaning of life? Existentialism, a philosophical movement that flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, is unique in trying to provide answers to these questions. Readings are drawn both from philosophical works and from existentialist authors like Kafka, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J. Koon, M.

This course will survey of some major topics in metaphysics, with a particular focus on radical metaphysical arguments -- arguments that call into question our most basic beliefs about the world. Examples of questions that we will consider include: Do ordinary objects exist? Is there anything that makes persons distinct from other sorts of objects? Could things have been different than the way they in fact are? In answering these questions we will investigate the nature of composite objects, the criteria for personal identity, and the metaphysics of causation, laws of nature, and modality. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>N.

Which actions are right, which are wrong, and how can we tell the difference? Can we give principled answers to questions like these, or is it just a matter of opinion? We will think critically about such questions and some key theoretical approaches to answering them. We will focus on central traditions of Western moral philosophy, typiﬁed by Mill, Kant, and Aristotle. We will also consider vexing contemporary moral issues with an eye to whether these theories can guide our actions. Along the way, we will ask whether the moral theorizing we engage in can really uncover objective moral truths. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>K.

This class is about moral knowledge: what it is, if we have it, and how we get it (when we do have it). We'll consider question in moral epistemology such as: Can we gain moral knowledge from testimony? What are the implications of the prevalence of moral disagreement? Do our evolutionary origins pose a challenge to our moral beliefs? And, more generally, should we be moral skeptics? </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>K.

Credits: 4 </P><P>From Plato's attacks on Homer's poems to the protests against D.W. Grifﬁth's racist ﬁlm The Birth of a Nation to the recent spotlight cast by the #metoo movement, it is clear that the relationship between art and morality is a difﬁcult one. Are some works of art inherently immoral? If so, why? What should we say about works of art that are created by immoral artists? Or works that have morally troubling social effects? What is the relationship between an artwork's moral status and its value as a work of art? Are moral and aesthetic judgments objective? How are they related? We will survey the current state of the philosophical debate over the conflict between moral and aesthetic value. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>J.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Is free will possible if all our actions are causally determined? Might we be justiﬁed in blaming, praising, rewarding, or punishing people even if their actions are not free? Abstract metaphysical questions about freedom intersect in important ways with everyday problems in our relationships with others and our attitudes about moral ignorance, addiction, and madness. This course will examine these issues side by side in the hope of improving our understanding of freedom and responsibility. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>K.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This course is a study of 20th Century analytic philosophy using one philosopher to focus the course, Michael Dummett. Dummett was one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century. He gave a theory of meaning using work by Frege and Wittgenstein. He then used this to argue that if our knowledge of the Universe is to be objective, then we cannot conceive of that Universe as real. That is, it is not in existence independently of our ability to ﬁnd out about it. He was the ﬁrst to introduce non-classical logic as a means to address the nature of truth. This introduction to his work will ﬁll in the background to this argument, and thereby give an overview of 20th century philosophy. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>S.

Students will develop their own philosophical project in an academically rigorous way and then ﬁnd a way to present that project outside the classroom. Along the way we investigate the question of what counts as philosophy and why.

While we will draw from a variety of disciplines, the nature and motivations of the inquiry are philosophical. We will consider: what are emotions? Are they bodily responses? Thoughts? Feelings? What roles do cultures play in shaping our emotions? What functions do emotions serve? We will examine evidence and arguments offered by philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, anthropology and evolutionary theory, and consider how these perspectives do or don't inform each other, as well as how they can help us understand the nature of emotions. </P><P>Crosslisted as: NEURO-309SE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>L.

This course focuses on works of popular, serialized art in which the possibilities for artist/audience interaction are great, and so is the potential for conflict. We look at serial novels, ﬁlm series, television shows, and new media (such as TikTok), among others. What are the rights of artists to control their works? What rights do audiences have to alter or create new works based on an existing work? What should we do when these rights conflict? What makes a &quot;bad fan&quot; bad?

No tank tops. </P><P>All riders must be prepared to allow approximately one half-hour before and after each class to properly groom, tack, and cool out their horse. </P><P>Riding is a sport in which the rider’s balance and the horse’s balance are integrally connected. When a rider’s body weight is signiﬁcantly high in relation to height, the rider may struggle enough with one's own balance to endanger both the rider’s and horse’s safety, especially when learning to ride and when jumping. There are also times when the Equestrian Center does not have horses suitable to carry these riders. With these two facts in mind, the Equestrian Center reserves the right to prohibit students’ participation in a riding class or to limit the horses that they ride. The Equestrian Center may also limit the activities in which they may participate within their physical education class if the instructor feels that either the student’s or horse’s safety and well-being is at risk. The Equestrian Center staff is committed to encouraging ﬁtness through </P><P>riding and will collaborate with the physical education department to improve any interested student’s ﬁtness level for a safe riding experience. </P><P><Link>Students with any questions about their riding level should see the Riding </Link><Link>Program (http://athletics.mtholyoke.edu/facilities/equestrian_center/ </Link><Link>riding_program/</Link><Link>) website or email equestrian@mtholyoke.edu. </Link></P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Miriam Esber, Chair Aldo Santiago, Non-Riding Physical Education Coordinator Joy Collins, Riding Physical Education Coordinator </P><P>106 Kendall Sports &amp; Dance Complex; Equestrian Center 413-538-2310 (PE &amp; Athletics); 413-538-2472 (Equestrian) <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/physicaleducation (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/physicaleducation/</Link>) </P><P>Faculty </P><P>David Allen, Head Swimming and Diving Coach; Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Miriam Esber, Head Lacrosse Coach; Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Erica Lemm, Interim Director of Athletics and Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics; Associate Director of Athletics and Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Ellen Perrella, Head Athletic Trainer; Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Aldo Santiago, Head Tennis Coach; Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Andrea Whitcomb, Head Field Hockey Coach; Senior Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Iris Carpio, Head Volleyball Coach; Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Seth Hussey, Head Rowing Coach; Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics, On Leave 2021-2022 </P><P>Christopher Kibler, Head Cross Country and Track Field Coach; Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Erin Robson, Head Squash Coach; Lecturer in Physical Education </P><P>Jackie Ward, Head Basketball Coach; Lecturer in Physical Education and Athletics </P><P>Joy Collins, Riding Program and Community Lesson Manager, Riding Instructor </P><P>Carol Law, Director of Collegiate Riding, Riding Instructor </P><P>Paula Pierce, Director of Equestrian Center, Riding Instructor </P><P>Course Offerings </P><P>Aquatics </P><P>PE-101 Beginning Swimming </P><P>Spring. </P><P>For the student who has little to no experience in the water.

Copies of the test objectives for the MTEL are available in the physics department and in the Department of Psychology and Education. </P><P>Additional information about the Licensure Program, including <Link>application materials, can be found on the Teacher Licensure Program </Link><Link>website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/teach/). </Link></P><P>Course Advice </P><P>Getting Started in Physics </P><P>Entering students considering a major in physics are strongly urged to take PHYS-110 in the ﬁrst year. While it is possible to complete the major by taking PHYS-110 and PHYS-201 as late as the second year, such a program is not recommended because this delay limits the student’s opportunities for advanced electives or honors work. </P><P>Introductory Courses and Distribution Requirements </P><P>PHYS-100–PHYS-150 is a non-calculus introductory course sequence in physics, appropriate for students in the life sciences and for students with a general, nonprofessional interest in physics. This sequence satisﬁes the physics requirements of medical school. </P><P>PHYS-110–PHYS-201 is a calculus-based introductory course sequence in physics, appropriate for students intending to major in a physical science. To major in physics, a student must complete PHYS-201 by the end of the sophomore year. A student with excellent preparation in physics may take a departmental placement exam to place out of one or both of these introductory courses. Any 200 or 300-level 4-credit physics course will then count for distribution in physics. PHYS-110 and PHYS-201 do not cover the full range of topics on the MCAT syllabus; the PHYS-100 and PHYS-150 sequence has a better coverage of these topics. </P><P>Course Offerings </P><P>PHYS-100 Foundations of Physics </P><P>Fall.

The phrase “international politics” encompasses the waging of war and conducting of peace, the pursuit of national interests in competition with other states, norms of interaction among sovereign states, projects of humanitarian intervention, and collective efforts to enhance state security, global order, and human rights. </P><P>The study of such a complex subject has traditionally been divided into four overlapping ﬁelds: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Political theory tackles the contested meanings of freedom, equality, power, justice, community, and individuality, as well as the clashing ideological perspectives by which different people make sense of political life. It also explores the ideas of influential political theorists from Plato to Thomas Hobbes to Hannah Arendt. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>American politics studies the history and current organization of political institutions at the national, state, and local level in the United States. It also examines conflicts in America over private rights and material interests; racial, class, and gender inequality; and public goods, including the good of American citizenship itself. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Comparative politics covers the spectrum of political histories, systems of government, public policies, political parties, and social movements across the world. It examines, for example, parliamentary systems, ethnic conflict, authoritarian regimes, immigration policy, and nationalist movements from Asia to Europe to the Americas to Africa and the Middle East. </LBody></LI></L><P>• International politics investigates U.S. foreign policy, international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court; the politics of population migrations; war, terrorism, and international security; and the political dilemmas sparked by economic globalization and such border-crossing problems as resource depletion and environmental decay. </P><P>The Department of Politics at Mount Holyoke College offers students courses within all four ﬁelds as well as courses that cross the lines between them. </P><P>See Also </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Law, Public Policy &amp;

This course asks whether and to what extent cyberspace has revolutionized the nature of international politics. Are traditional understandings of sovereignty, deterrence, and diplomacy bunk? Rather than engaging in speculation, this course will cover the history of the development of both cyberspace and the beliefs that it will revolutionize politics. By examining the distance between speculation and reality this course will provide a grounded understanding of the effects of the &quot;cyberrevolution&quot; on international politics. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>B.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The planetary systems on which human civilizations depend are increasingly under threat, forcing contemporary societies to reckon with their societies' impacts on the Earth's biosphere. &quot;Politics as usual&quot; has become a recipe for ecological suicide. Building sustainable societies will be this generation's deﬁning challenge. Students in this course will examine how political thinkers throughout history have characterized humanity's place in the natural world, and how those ideas shape political beliefs, institutions and practices today. They will apply theoretical techniques to design innovative solutions to pressing environmental problems and controversies, learning how to translate ideas into actions. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>R.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Environmental concerns are no longer a niche &quot;special interest&quot; in American politics. Today multiplying and intensifying ecological crises are getting harder to ignore, and the need for action is urgent. Deciding how to respond to and govern a climate-changed world is now one of the deﬁning political challenges of our time. This course examines the history of environmental debates in the United States, the diverse range of actors and organizations participating in these debates, current laws and institutions regulating Americans' relationships with their environments at both the federal and state levels, and the processes for making and implementing public policy for the environment. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>R.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Authoritarianism, the most common form of government for much of history, is on the rise again today. Yet authoritarian states differ widely in their policies, institutions, and durability. How do we recognize whether a country is a dictatorship? When do dictators use repression, and why do they sometimes hold elections? When do dictatorships break down? How should all this influence our thinking about democracy? Drawing from examples around the world, we will analyze ways in which authoritarian governments exercise and maintain power, including issues relating to legislatures, clientelism, and patronage. We will also examine how authoritarianism impacts economic and foreign policy. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>S.

Spanning anarchism, Afro-pessimism and Afro-futurism, and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, we will examine political actions and thought that do not identify themselves as democratic and even deﬁne themselves as anti-democratic in order to name politics they aspire towards. Special attention will be given the picture of collective belonging and action that emerges in these works along with the techniques of ﬁguring these visions and of gathering community around them. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In recent years, scholarship on American politics has challenged the idea that our government has upheld and expanded basic democratic principles since the fall of Jim Crow. This scholarship notes a growing wealth gap since the 1970s and 1980s that has given rise to a &quot;New Gilded Age.&quot; Along with this rising wealth gap, the United States has also endured rising incarceration rates, a shrinking middle class, an eroding public sphere, and charges that plutocracy -- or governance by the rich -- has overtaken American democracy. In this course we will explore, investigate, and challenge several arguments and assumptions at the heart of these critiques of contemporary US politics. Students will read and discuss cutting edge scholarship and journalism exploring the inequality debates, including inquiries into the complex interrelations of race, gender, and class. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>A.

Credits: 4 </P><P>We center &quot;health&quot; as a critical concept in political theory and practice. &quot;Health&quot; has emerged as a social value of many Western democracies, especially with advancements in medical science, and often refers to a healthy society or debate. Health can be a moral good or a resource to pursue and receive state support for. But health can also be elusive for many people and its meaning can shift based on experience. Nevertheless, health can inform who we think of as a citizen, leader, parent, adult, or even person. We will examine the concept of &quot;health&quot; in all of these and other variants and its impact on democratic societies. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

We will contextualize arguments for reparations within a larger conversation about repairing democratic norms, institutions, and social conditions within recent democratic theory. Together we will investigate what historical and ongoing injustices and inequalities reparations are meant to repair, how reparations would address those harms, and how arguments for reparations have mobilized social activists on both sides of the question. Our readings will span history, legal studies, politics, literature and the arts and arguments for reparations to be paid by the American state down to institutions such as corporations, universities, and other jurisdictions. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

Among the major topics covered are the ways attitudes develop and change; the conditions </P><P>under which individuals adhere to or deviate from social norms; the behavior of groups; communication; social interaction and interpersonal relationships; and the differences in behavior across gender identities. </P><P>Personality and Abnormal Psychology </P><P>The courses in this area cover the ﬁelds of personality, abnormal psychology, and psychotherapy. The ﬁeld of personality, the systematic study of individual differences and similarities, poses questions such as the following: How is each person unique? In what ways are people alike? Abnormal psychology concerns aspects of human behavior that are maladaptive in a person’s current context. Students concentrating their study in this area are urged to take additional courses in developmental psychology, social psychology, and biological bases of behavior. </P><P>Developmental and Educational Psychology </P><P>Developmental psychology is characterized by a distinct point of view rather than a speciﬁc content area. It is concerned with the origins and progressive development over time of perception, thought, language, personality, and social behavior. Educational psychology involves the application of psychology to our understanding of learning, motivation, and teaching, and focuses on both the complex experiences of individual learners and the diverse sociocultural contexts of learning. </P><P>The courses in developmental and educational psychology reflect this range of topics and also cover the application of developmental theory and ﬁndings in education. Students concentrating their study in this area are urged to take courses in as many of the other areas of psychology as possible. </P><P>Perception and Cognition </P><P>The courses in this area are concerned with how we acquire, use, and recollect information. Major topics include visual and auditory perception, learning and memory, and how individuals understand language. Students concentrating their study in this area, especially those with an interest in cognitive neuroscience, are urged to take additional courses in neuroscience and behavior and developmental psychology. Courses in philosophy (PHIL-201) and computer science (COMSC-151AR) are recommended for those students with interests in cognitive science and artiﬁcial intelligence. </P><P>Biological Bases of Behavior </P><P>The courses in this area adopt the perspective that behavior is the product of biological processes.

Is there something about the human brain that drives us to paint and sing? We will examine how the brain simultaneously processes different aspects of visual and auditory stimuli, ask how this processing may affect the way we do art and music, and explore where these phenomena may occur in the brain. As we engage in discussion and hands-on activities, we will discover the commonalities between the arts and the sciences including practice, experimentation, exploration, innovation, and creativity. </P><P>Crosslisted as: MUSIC-321AM Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>M.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Languages differ in the way they describe the world. For example, the noun for bridge is feminine in German, but masculine in French. Russian has two words for blue, while English has only one. The Piraha (an Amazonian hunter-gatherer tribe) arguably have no number words. In this course, we will be asking to what extent these cross-linguistic differences are reflected in thought. That is, do German speakers think bridges are more feminine than French speakers do? Can Russian speakers discriminate different shades of blue better than English speakers? Can the Piraha count? In exploring these questions, we hope to discover how tightly linked language and thought are. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>M. Breen Prereq: PSYCH-204.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Every culture in the world has some form of music, but why do humans develop music, and what function does it serve? In this course, we'll explore the cognitive and neural processes that underlie music perception and production, and ask the following questions: Does music have universal features that cross cultures? How does music convey emotion? What do infants know about music? Is music speciﬁcally human? And ﬁnally, what are the parallels between music and language? Through these questions, we'll learn about basic processes of cognition, as well as functions of a variety of human brain regions, and we will gain insight into what makes music such an integral part of our daily lives. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>M.

However, this course considers their historical and contemporary interconnections in Latin America. It begins with an investigation of the proto-racial and religious categories through which Europeans in the early modern era conceived of human difference. We then trace how the encounter between Europeans, Africans, and Indigenous Peoples transformed these notions, with particular attention to how the overlapping racial and religious hierarchies that emerged were both constructed and resisted. We conclude with a series of ethnographies that highlight the contemporary entanglements of race and religion in the region. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ANTHR-216LT Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>W.

Credits: 4 </P><P>In this course we will examine how medieval European thinkers and artists theorized and visualized the body in ways that are vastly different from how the body is conceptualized today. Indeed, the &quot;medieval body" was not a monolithic entity, but rather a shifting constellation of ideas and practices that waxed, waned, and coexisted throughout the Middle Ages. A body could be understood as an earthly body -- sexed, fleshly, corruptible -- as well as a heavenly and divine body, including Christ's own. Our considerations will further contextualize representations of gendered, racialized, clerical, monstrous, animal, virginal, non-Christian, heretical, and resurrected bodies. Artworks and monuments include icons, reliquaries, altarpieces and other church decorations and liturgical objects, sculptural programs, illuminated manuscripts, prints, and incunabula. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ARTH-290MB Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>C.

In this class, we will consider arguments for and against different positions that people have on these questions. This course will give students a sense of the issues that philosophers of religion are currently thinking and writing about. As we think through topics such as these, we will be working to develop and hone philosophical skills such as analyzing concepts, constructing and critiquing arguments, and evaluating philosophical theories. </P><P>Crosslisted as: PHIL-226 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

Muslims in the United States have often been treated with suspicion and their religion viewed as foreign and incompatible with American values. Yet, Islam was present in North America since at least the 1700s in the lives of enslaved Africans. And it was theoretically included in the religions whose free exercise is protected by the First Amendment. This course traces the fraught and complex history of Islam and Muslims in North America, from the loss and preservation of Islamic practices under the regime of slavery through the reclamation of Islamic symbols and identities in African-American movements of the 20th century (e.g., The Moorish Science Temple, The Nation of Islam, and The Five-Percenters) to the rapid growth of a diverse immigrant Muslim community post-1965. Particular attention will be paid to: the intertwining of race, gender, and religion in the self-construction of Muslim identities and the policing of Muslim persons; the depictions of Islam and Muslims in U.S. society and politics; and the use of Islamic themes and symbols in contemporary popular culture, such as hip-hop. </P><P>Crosslisted as: CST-249SM Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>A.

Concurrently, we will study key historical moments of iconoclasm ranging from the Byzantine era to the Protestant Reformation and the French Revolution. Studying iconoclasms in different historical periods raises the issue of the power of art in society. Through class discussion, group work, original research, and writing, we will explore how past iconoclasms may inform our understanding of the present. The work also involves an inquiry into art historical methodology as well as approaches from ﬁelds such as critical race theory, and a consideration of the role of the art historian in the present debates and social justice movements. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ARTH-301DE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>C.

After all, we tend to imagine religion as the domain of faith, emotion, and the otherworldly and the climate as the realm of science, objective knowledge, and the here and now. Nevertheless, this course investigates the sometimes surprising connections between them. For example, how do religious communities work to promote or oppose political action on climate change?

However, in recent years, religion has been rethought in light of its own speciﬁc Western history, its normative tendencies, and its place in colonialism and other projects of domination.

In recent years, scholars in number ﬁelds have begun to question these common sense notions about secularism. In this course, we will investigate this rapidly expanding literature and the critical lines of inquiry it has opened up: Under what speciﬁc cultural and historic conditions did secularism ﬁrst emerge?

Mount Holyoke’s Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies invites you to join with us in our exploration of the vast area of the world that we engage in on a daily basis. Through course work in language, literature, history and politics, our students gain a multidimensional understanding of the diverse peoples and cultures that inhabit this region—its past, its present, as well as its prospects for the future. </P><P>As the world reconﬁgures itself at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, a reenergized Russia will play a major role in shaping the political and economic futures of Europe and Asia, and resolving issues of global importance like resource use, climate change, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Indeed, Mount Holyoke graduates who have focused on Russian studies can be found working in nongovernmental organizations in Washington D.C., embassies in Russia and Europe, the oil ﬁelds of Siberia, as well as in journalism and business. </P><P>Beyond the purely pragmatic, Russia’s fundamental cultural achievements—in literature, art, music, theatre, and ﬁlm—are of permanent value and interest to students of the humanities. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Akhmatova and Pasternak, Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich, Vertov and Eisenstein, Pavlova and Baryshnikov, Gergiev and Rostropovich—the Russian legacy of achievement is profound, and continues to be a living presence in the intellectual, spiritual, and creative life of humanity. Our commitment to this legacy is at once intensely intellectual and deeply personal: until his death in 1996, Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Brodsky was counted among our colleagues. </P><P>The Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies is unique among MHC’s language departments in that its faculty includes both specialists in language, literature, and culture and specialists in history and politics. Variously trained in Russia, Europe, and the United States, we strive to bring a balance and a perspective to our subject area that is challenging, engaging, thoughtful—and never dull. </P><P>For students with a strong interest in the non-Russian nations of Eurasia, a working knowledge of Russian and a grasp of Russia’s historical role on the Eurasian continent are essential to understanding the peoples and places that have lived or continue to live under Russian influence (the Caucasus, Central Asia, Siberia). The Mount Holyoke Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies stands out among Russian departments in the Five Colleges in that it includes a specialist who is uniquely qualiﬁed to interpret events in Eurasia beyond the borders of Russia itself (Jones). Our students study not only in European Russia, but in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Siberia, and experience the multicultural expanse of Eurasia. </P><P>Beyond regular course work, the department sponsors spring and fall festivals of Russian food, a ﬁlm series, lectures, and other events (like building a Mongolian yurt). </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>Study abroad is highly recommended and may be used toward fulﬁllment of major requirements. </P><P>There are numerous summer, semester, and yearlong programs offered for undergraduates. Since admission to many Russian study abroad programs is competitive, students are advised to consult early in their academic careers with members of the department. We have had great success in getting our students into these competitive programs. </P><P>Opportunities to study the non-Russian languages of Eurasia are rapidly expanding. Summer immersion programs and summer and academic-year programs abroad offer instruction in Armenian, Georgian, Azeri, Uzbek, Tajik, Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Estonian, and others. In some cases, applicants may be expected to have an intermediate-level command of Russian. </P><P>See Also </P><P>• <Link>Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies (p. 386) </Link></P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Peter Scotto, Chair Dominique Rampton, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>103 Ciruti Center 413-538-2648 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/russian (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/russian/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>On completion of the following levels, students will be able to: </P><P>Elementary Russian (Completion of the RES-101 and 102 sequence) </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Make introductions and get acquainted with others. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Talk about self, family, friends, university studies, and jobs by providing basic information and description. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Read simple authentic texts, such as announcements, schedules, greeting cards, phone texts, e-mails, personal letters, and short prose and poetry pieces for basic facts and information. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Acquire basic linguistic and cultural knowledge to engage in the following activities: shopping, ordering food, buying tickets, giving directions, giving advice, issuing invitations, ﬁlling out forms with basic biographical information. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Describe hobbies, interests, personal preferences, and routine activities in some detail. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Talk about past personal events and plans for the future. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Compare, contrast, and express opinions and feelings about things and people. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Ask and answer questions about familiar topics. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Write multi-paragraph compositions on familiar topics. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Acquire basic Russian grammar: nominal, pronominal and adjectival declension system (6 cases);

Credits: 4 </P><P>Perhaps no other novelist has delved as deeply into the psychological and metaphysical dimensions of evil as the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. This course will be devoted to a close reading of Dostoevsky's landmark novel of murderous passion and parricide, The Brothers Karamazov. Why should crime and transgression be a privileged avenue of access into the human interior? How is psychology tied to the metaphysical aspect of human existence? What are the sources of evil-and redemption? </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities The department Notes: Taught in English </P><P>RES-216 Pushkin: Found in Translation </P><P>Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4 </P><P>Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) is universally regarded as Russia's greatest poet. However, the magnitude of his achievement has remained inaccessible to readers who do not know Russian. That has now changed. With the renaissance in the art and practice of translation over the past several decades, much of what was previously unavailable to readers of English is now available, and it has become possible to offer this course. Participants will encounter Pushkin in three different, but intersecting ways: through a careful reading of his masterpieces, through a comparison of the renditions of various translators, and ﬁnally through responses to his work by his literary heirs. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities The department Notes: Taught in English. </P><P>RES-226 Philosophical Tales: The Short Fiction of Anton Chekhov </P><P>Spring.

What can ﬁctions do that discursive philosophical essays can't? How do they engage the complexity of the world and of life? We'll also read Chekhov's work in larger tradition of Wisdom Literature, with readings drawn from Biblical, Hassidic, Classical, Folk, and Chinese traditions, as well as from other notable practitioners of the genre (Chesterton, Borges, Poe). </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive </P><P>P.

Revered by Dostoevsky, he created a literary universe that has lost none of its original power despite the passage of time. This course will trace the development of Gogol's genius from his early Ukrainian stories, through his tales of St. Petersburg, to his comic masterpiece Dead Souls. Special attention will be paid to Gogol's deployment of the comic, fantastic and grotesque to render the reality of tsarist Russia. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>P.

From now on, they said, all states will move toward the model of market capitalism. But the last decade of the 20th century and the ﬁrst ﬁfteen years of the 21st century have shown that history, and with it, revolution, is far from over. We will look at the American and Russian revolutions, at Nazism, the Iranian revolution of 1979, Eastern Europe in 1989, the 'colored revolutions,' and the Arab Spring.

Assumptions about physical co-presence, standardized testing, the rights of students, and the responsibilities of schools have all been transformed at warp speed. The pandemic also exposed durable fault lines in American education and society. This course provides an opportunity to evaluate our present moment using classical and contemporary sociological perspectives on mass schooling. It highlights issues facing the future of education, the role of schooling in struggles for economic and racial justice, and how the aspirations of individuals and families interact with state institutions to shape the American social and economic order. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences </P><P>B.

From the Occupy Wall Street movement to ongoing debates about the power of big banks, ﬁnance has been seen as the culprit for the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, U.S. income and wealth inequality, and global instability. But what explains the rise of ﬁnance and how has ﬁnance gone global? How does global ﬁnance contribute to inequality within and across nations? We will tackle these questions by covering some of the recent sociological research on ﬁnance and ﬁnancial globalization.

Our students are expected to incorporate the humanities and the social sciences fully into their studies with classes at Mount Holyoke and the other colleges in the Five College Consortium. Complementing course work at Mount Holyoke are extracurricular activities and study abroad programs that broaden and deepen students’ understanding of Asia. </P><P>On campus, our students experience regional culture at many levels, including language tables and clubs, guest lectures, performing and visual arts, ﬁlm, festivals, and regional cuisine. These activities are often initiated by and beneﬁt greatly from the diverse student population of Mount Holyoke and particularly the large numbers of students from Asian countries or with an Asian background. </P><P>Most of our students spend a semester or a summer in one of the many Mount Holyoke College-approved South Asian study abroad programs. </P><P>South Asian studies majors graduate to pursue graduate study and careers in ﬁelds as varied as education, business, NGOs, journalism, the arts, and government service. </P><P>See Also </P><P>• <Link>Asian Studies (p. 83) </Link></P><P>Contact Information </P><P>Calvin Chen, Chair Denise Falk, Academic Department Coordinator </P><P>112 Ciruti Center 413-538-2885 <Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/asian (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>acad/asian/</Link>) </P><P>Learning Goals </P><P>By majoring in South Asian Studies, students should: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop knowledge of the history of premodern and modern South Asia. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop knowledge of the arts, literature, religions, and philosophies of South Asia. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Develop knowledge of the geography, politics, economics, and societies of South Asia. </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty </P><P>This area of study is administered by the Asian Studies Committee: </P><P>Satyananda Gabriel, Professor of Economics </P><P>Rie Hachiyanagi, Professor of Art, On Leave 2021-2022 </P><P>Sohail Hashmi, Professor of International Relations on the Alumnae Foundation and Professor of Politics </P><P>Kavita Khory, Ruth Lawson Professor of Politics; Carol Hoffmann Collins Director of the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives </P><P>Susanne Mrozik, Professor of Religion, Teaching Spring Only </P><P>Naoko Nemoto, Professor of Asian Studies </P><P>Joshua Roth, Professor of Anthropology </P><P>Ajay Sinha, Julie '73 and Helene '49 Herzig Professor of Art History, Teaching Spring Only </P><P>Ying Wang, Felicia Gressitt Bock Professor of Asian Studies </P><P>Elif Babul, Associate Professor of Anthropology, Teaching Fall Only </P><P>Calvin Chen, Associate Professor of Politics </P><P>Amina Steinfels, Associate Professor of Religion Lan Wu, Assistant Professor of History Lisha Xu, Senior Lecturer in Asian Studies Heba Arafah, Five College Lecturer in Arabic Jinhwa Chang, Lecturer in Japanese Kyae-Sung Park, Five College Lecturer in Korean Richard Chu, Five College Associate Professor of History Mohamed Hassan, Five College Senior Lecturer in Arabic May George, Five College Lecturer in Middle East Studies Nahla Khalil, Five College Lecturer in Arabic Suk Massey, Five College Lecturer in Korean Shaimaa Moustafa, Five Colleage Lecturer in Arabic Chan Young Park, Five College Lecturer in Korean John Weinert, Five College Lecturer in Arabic </P><P>Requirements for the Major </P><P>A minimum of 40 credits: </P><P>Code Title Credits </P><P>One course (4 credits) in modern South Asian history, for example: 4 </P><P>HIST-124 History of Modern South Asia, 1700 to the Present </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_346.jpg"/></Figure><P>One course (4 credits) on pre-modern and/or early modern South Asia (c. 3000 BCE to 1700 CE), for example: </P><P>ARTH-263 Arts of India </P><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-22_Bulletin-CatalogXML_img_347.jpg"/></Figure><P>8 elective courses (32 credits): Two (8 credits) must be from Group One: Humanities (history, </P><P>religion, philosophy, literature, language, the arts, and interdisciplinary courses in these areas) 1 One (4 credits) must be from Group Two: Social Science </P><P>(anthropology, economics, geography, international relations, linguistics, politics, sociology, and interdisciplinary courses in these areas) </P><P>At least three courses (12 credits) must be at the 300 level.

This material is included in Calculus I (MATH-101), Calculus II (MATH-102), Calculus III (MATH-203), Probability (MATH-342), and Mathematical Statistics (STAT-343), along with Macroeconomic Theory (ECON-211), Microeconomic Theory (ECON-212), and Economics of Corporate Finance (ECON-215). Students are also encouraged to obtain experience through an internship. </P><P>Biostatistics, public health, or natural resources </P><P>Students interested in these areas should include substantial work in biology, chemistry, geology, and/or environmental studies in their programs. </P><P>Economics or business </P><P>Many students with these interests choose the special major in mathematics and economics or the special major in statistics and economics. </P><P>Engineering </P><P>Students interested in engineering often double-major in mathematics and physics and/or participate in one of the College’s ﬁve-year, dual-degree programs with Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, or California Institute of Technology, or the University of Massachusetts (see the Other Degree and Certiﬁcate Programs chapter). </P><P>Graduate school </P><P>Students preparing for graduate school in statistics or mathematics often participate in an undergraduate research program in the summer after the junior year and continue with an honors thesis in the senior year. Students considering graduate work in statistics at the level of a Ph.D. are encouraged to include abstract algebra and especially MATH-301. </P><P>Teaching certiﬁcation </P><P>Students interested in pursuing certiﬁcation for middle school or secondary school should major in mathematics rather than statistics. However, there is increasing emphasis on statistics in secondary school, and any of the applied courses would provide good preparation. </P><P>Course Offerings </P><P>STAT-140 Introduction to the Ideas and Applications of Statistics </P><P>Fall and Spring.

Credits: 4 </P><P>John Tukey once said &quot;the best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard&quot; -- but when do statisticians learn how to play nice with others? In Statistical Consulting and Communication, students will implement techniques and methods they have learned elsewhere while simultaneously developing skills for communicating results to peers, collaborators, and clients, including best practices for reproducible research, technical writing, and public speaking. Furthermore, students will learn how to respond to questions commonly asked of statistical consultants, such as study design, sample size computations, and dealing with missing data. Finally, students will consider several aspects of ethics in statistics, including questions on informed consent and data manipulation. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Math Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

For speciﬁc course requirements for licensure within the major of theatre arts, please consult your advisor or the chair of the theatre arts department. Further <Link>information about the minor in education (p. 367) and the Teacher </Link><Link>Licensure program (p. 368) is available in other sections of the catalog, </Link>or consult the Department of Psychology and Education. </P><P>Licensure also requires a formal application as well as passing scores on the Massachusetts Test of Educator Licensure (MTEL) in both the literacy component and the subject matter component. Copies of the test objectives for the MTEL are available in the Department of Psychology and Education. </P><P>Additional information about the Licensure Program, including <Link>application materials, can be found on the Teacher Licensure Program </Link><Link>website (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/teach/). </Link></P><P>Course Advice Lab/Crew Requirements </P><P>Lab: Some courses may require a student’s participation in a preparation or a running crew on a major production on one of the ﬁve campuses. One such crew will satisfy a student’s lab requirement for courses taken in a single semester. </P><P>Prep Crews in costume, lighting, and scenic preparation require up to 24 hours of outside classroom work for the semester. Every crew is different and every production is different from every other show, so time commitments may vary from semester to semester. Arrangements must be made at the beginning of the semester with the crew head.  Lighting prep may have some day, evening and/or weekend work. </P><P>Running Crews vary from production to production, but generally will begin the day before Tech Rehearsal (usually the Thursday before the show opens) and continue w/technical, dress rehearsals, and all performances through closing performance. </P><P>Students taking Intro to Theater are required to sign up to assist with “Front of House” duties working with the House Manager(s) for one or two evenings per production, or assisting with poster/flyer distribution. </P><P>Volunteering allows a student doing a running crew to receive one (1) credit — completed as a 200-level independent study with the appropriate staff person (costumes, lighting, sets). Prep crews do not qualify for credit — the hours to complete the crew are too few compared to a running crew. Students fulﬁlling a running crew as part of a class requirement are not eligible for an extra credit. </P><P>Failure to fulﬁll a crew will result in a signiﬁcant reduction in your grade. </P><P>Department Productions and Practicum Credit </P><P>Practicum credit may be awarded for participation in department productions: 1, 2, or 4 credits at the 200 or 300 level at the discretion of the instructor. Department productions are the practical application of a student's classroom experience, and encompass intensive teaching and learning. They require a substantial investment of time by both students and their instructors, which is usually the equivalent of a 4credit course at the 200 or 300 level. Practicums are not limited to theatre majors and minors. If a student acts in, directs, serves as an assistant director, designs, serves as assistant designer, stage manages, serves as assistant stage manager, or serves on a run crew on a department production, they will receive a grade and credit through a practicum at the appropriate level agreed to by the practicum instructor. </P><P>Practicum for Actors </P><P>Auditions for department productions are open to all Mount Holyoke and Five College students. All selected students may be enrolled in the practicum. The practicum for actors is FMT-282 (THEAT-282), which may also be taken at the 300 level with the department's consent. </P><P>Practicum for Directors and Assistant Directors </P><P>Majors and minors concentrating in directing may be invited to be a director on a department production. They must have taken at least one approved directing course and served as assistant director for a previous approved production. Assistant directors can apply to -- or be invited by --the director of a production to act as an assistant. The practicum for </P><P>directors and assistant directors is FMT-282 (THEAT-282), which may also be taken at the 300 level with the department's consent. </P><P>Practicums for Set, Costume, Lighting and Sound Designers </P><P>Majors and minors concentrating in design may be invited to be a designer on a department production. They must have taken the design course in their ﬁeld (see prerequisites below) and have served as assistant designer for a department production. Assistant designers can apply to, or be invited by, the designer of a production to act as an assistant and must be approved by the department. The practica for designers are FMT-284 (THEAT-262CS), FMT-286 (THEAT-262LS), or FMT-288 (THEAT-262SC) as appropriate.

FMT-282 (THEAT-282) is the practicum for stage managers. </P><P>Independent Work Independent Study </P><P>Independent studies may be taken with the consent of an instructor and the approval of the department. Please note that only 8 credits of practicums and/or independent study can be counted toward the major and must be approved by the department. Proposals for independent study must be presented in written form and must not duplicate a course in the department's curriculum. </P><P>Senior Thesis Requirements and Procedures </P><P>Students wishing to write a senior thesis in the department must demonstrate excellence in critical writing and the desire to explore a topic in depth through extensive research. In certain cases, traditional research methods may be supplemented by creative work, as long as that work is understood to be an organic part of the written thesis, and vice versa. </P><P>The student should discuss their interest with the department chair who will assist in choosing an advisor who, in turn, will work closely with them throughout the process. Two additional readers should be included on the student’s committee. </P><P>By March of the junior year, the student should submit a proposal to the chair of the department that includes the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>A brief explanation of why they want to pursue a thesis. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>A three- to ﬁve-page description of the thesis.

Credits: 4 </P><P>This class explores African approaches to performance, premised on the interdisciplinarity of theater in many African societies. We take our inspiration from centuries of apprentice-style artist training in some indigenous West African societies. The evolution of oral and popular performance traditions into literary theater has also necessitated a similar trend in the training of the modern actor. The primary object of this class is to be able to embody a plethora of idiomatic expressions. Thus, we will move to the energy of the drums, we will train the ears to transmit the complex musicality of several sonic elements and raise our voices in song and apply them in scene explorations. Ultimately, we intend to unlock new ways of using our minds, bodies, and voices as conduits of exciting storytelling. </P><P>Crosslisted as: AFCNA-241PE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives </P><P>M.

Credits: 4 The Oxford English Dictionary deﬁnes &quot;adaptation&quot; as &quot;the bringing of two things together so as to effect a change in the nature of the objects." Rather than studying adaptation as a project that attempts to reproduce an original work in another medium, our course considers the complex relationship between narratives and their retellings and revisions. In particular, we will focus on how such retellings permanently alter their so-called &quot;source&quot; material and how each incarnation of a given narrative offers us insight into and commentary upon a particular historical moment and its unique political and ideological challenges. We will also consider the ways in which literary and visual representations differ in their communicative and affective mechanisms, and challenge where we draw the line between &quot;art,&quot; &quot;history,&quot; and &quot;entertainment. </P><P>Crosslisted as: ENGL-367AD Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive </P><P>A.

Credits: 4 </P><P>Usually, an artist produces a work, and then an audience experiences that work. However, sometimes audiences influence what a work means and even how an ongoing story unfolds. This course focuses on works of popular, serialized art in which the possibilities for artist/audience interaction are great, and so is the potential for conflict. We look at serial novels, ﬁlm series, television shows, and new media (such as TikTok), among others. What are the rights of artists to control their works? What rights do audiences have to alter or create new works based on an existing work? What should we do when these rights conflict? What makes a &quot;bad fan&quot; bad? When do audiences become artists? </P><P>Crosslisted as: PHIL-375AV Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>J.

This course both explores various constructs of postmodern American masculinity as they are portrayed and disseminated through contemporary ﬁlm, and seeks to understand some of what is at stake (culturally, ideologically, economically) in perpetuating certain cinematic archetypes. Of particular relevance to our investigation are the ways in which ﬁlm yokes masculinity to race, gender, and class. Films include Full Metal Jacket, No Country for Old Men, The Big Lebowski, Boyz in the Hood, Paris is Burning, Fight Club, and Moonlight.

In this course we will study representations of apocalyptic futures from illuminated manuscripts, from illustrated poetry, and from science ﬁction ﬁlms that waver between hope for escape and doomsday scenarios. Along the way we will also take seriously nonﬁction representations of global crisis, analyzing how phenomena like climate change and galactic collision are represented across media forms, including infographics, visual models, digital memes, and documentary ﬁlms. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities </P><P>H.

Students will study the ways communication and performance media, from Shakespearian theater, to ﬁlms and photographs of deceased loved ones, to legacy accounts on Facebook, have served as conduits of the dead and even spawned occult practices. The course will address: how do theater, ﬁlm, and other media bridge us to what has been lost and animate our connections to those who have died?

Yet each ﬁlm has its own existence, to be understood not just as an &quot;adaptation,&quot; but also as the product of linked artistic, technical, and economic choices.

Credits: 4 </P><P>The Creative Incubator is a transdisciplinary laboratory of creative explorations. The fundamental objective of this class is to democratize the creative process. As such we shall collectively engage with a wide variety of art forms and artistic processes that will hopefully serve as inspiration for our own creative agency. The class also adopts a highly collaborative approach which deemphasizes the idea of the &quot;disciplinary expert.&quot; As a theme-driven and project-based lab, each semester we shall nurture ideas from their inception until they culminate into events. Each project will be approached with a desire for inquiry and risk taking, and a desire to attain the ultimate collective goal. </P><P>Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Community-Based Learning </P><P>M.

Students must authorize other sponsors to view the bill and to receive notiﬁcation to their Mount Holyoke College email address when the monthly bill is prepared. </P><P>Past due balances will incur a late fee of 1% each month on balances over $100. </P><P>No student may register for classes, or receive a degree, diploma, or transcript until the student’s bill is paid. In addition, on-campus charging privileges may be suspended for any student with signiﬁcant past due charges. If you would like to arrange for payment other than on the regularly scheduled due dates, the College offers a semester payment </P><P>plan and provides information on several types of educational loans. The College cannot make arrangements for payment other than those herein described. </P><P>Financial Aid for Graduate Students </P><P>Funding education is a concern for many students. Mount Holyoke's Ofﬁce of Student Financial Services works closely with students to talk about what federal aid resources might be available. </P><P>Graduate students are eligible to apply for graduate scholarships and fellowships and to participate in special partnership-based programs such as the Teach Western Mass M.A.T. Fellowship, the Peace Corps Coverdell Fellows Program, the City Year scholarship, the Holyoke Public Schools Urban Pathways Program, and the Amherst Public Schools Futures Program.

Additionally, there may be career-speciﬁc scholarships, or scholarships based on particular aspects of the students' lives (for women, for veterans, for people living in certain counties, etc.). For instance, many students in the <Link>Mathematics Teaching graduate program apply to National </Link><Link>Council of Teachers of Mathematics Education Trust (http:// </Link><Link>www.nctm.org/met/</Link>) for scholarships and support. Mount Holyoke <Link>College undergraduate alumnae may apply for Alumnae Fellowships </Link>(<Link>http://alumnae.mtholyoke.edu/career/alumnae-fellowships/? </Link><Link>utm_source=blast&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=fellowships</Link>). </P><P>Employer Tuition Assistance </P><P>Students should explore tuition beneﬁts that may be offered by their employers. Beneﬁts may include tuition reimbursement, scholarships, </P><P>Full PDF 461 </P><P>or waivers. Employers may provide up to $5,250 in employer education assistance beneﬁts for undergraduate or graduate courses tax-free each year, per section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. Students do not necessarily need to be seeking a degree to be eligible. Many employers will require that graduates stay at the organization for some time once they've completed the degree. </P><P>Veterans Beneﬁts/GI Bill ® </P><P>For veterans who qualify,<Link>GI Bill (https://www.beneﬁts.va.gov/ </Link><Link>gibill/higher_learning.asp</Link>)<Link>®</Link> (<Link>https://www.beneﬁts.va.gov/gibill/ </Link><Link>higher_learning.asp</Link>)<Link>beneﬁts</Link> (<Link>https://www.beneﬁts.va.gov/gibill/ </Link><Link>higher_learning.asp</Link>) may offer the cost of tuition, fees, books and housing. GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). </P><P>Loans and Grants </P><P>There are a variety of federal and private types of ﬁnancial aid available for graduate students, including (more information follows the list): </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Federal TEACH Grant (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants</Link><Link>scholarships/teach/</Link>) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Federal Direct Student Loan (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/ </Link><Link>loans/subsidized-unsubsidized/</Link>) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Grad PLUS Loan (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus/) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Massachusetts Educational Financial Authority (MEFA) Graduate </Link><Link>Student Loan (https://www.mefa.org/pay/loanproducts/) </Link></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Private Student Loans (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/ </Link><Link>federal-vs-private/</Link>) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Teacher Loan Forgiveness (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay</Link><Link>loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher/</Link>) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody><Link>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay</Link><Link>loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service/</Link>) </LBody></LI></L><P>Student Financial Services works closely with students to ensure that they are aware of the different ﬁnancing options available to best suit their individual needs. </P><P>TEACH Grant </P><P><Link>The Federal TEACH Grant Program (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/ </Link><Link>grants-scholarships/%20teach/</Link>) provides grants to full time graduate students who are completing or plan to complete the coursework needed to become teachers. (A graduate student may receive a total of two scheduled awards provided they are in attendance full-time for two <Link>years.) There are a number of conditions and requirements (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/federal-teach-grant/</Link>) that must be met in order to receive the TEACH grant. </P><P>Federal Direct Student Loan </P><P>Graduate students are eligible for the Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) provided they are enrolled in at least 4 credits per semester. Repayment begins six months after the student is no longer enrolled in at least 4 credits. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and complete entrance counseling and a promissory note. </P><P>Grad PLUS Loan </P><P>Grad PLUS loans are available for up to the cost of attendance minus any other awarded ﬁnancial aid (including loans). Repayment begins two months after the last disbursement for the academic year. Graduate students must be enrolled in at least four credits to be eligible for federal loans. Students must ﬁle the Free Application for Federal Student Aid </P><P>(FAFSA) and a Grad PLUS application to be considered for a Grad PLUS loan. </P><P>MEFA Graduate Student Loan </P><P>The Massachusetts Educational Financial Authority (MEFA) is a nonproﬁt state agency that offers ﬁnancing to U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are studying at least half time at accredited degree-granting non-proﬁt colleges and universities. </P><P>Private Student Loans </P><P>Student Financial Services strongly suggests that all federal ﬁnancing options be maximized prior to turning to non-federal ﬁnancing alternatives. Federal loans offer repayment options based on income and have forbearance and deferral options during times of extreme economic hardship that other loan programs do not offer. Also, some federal loan programs offer loan reductions or forgiveness for public service and teaching in high need areas. </P><P>Students interested in private (alternative) student loans may ﬁnd <Link>more information by contacting Student Financial Services (https:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/sfs/</Link>). </P><P>Teacher Loan Forgiveness </P><P>The Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program is intended to encourage individuals to enter and continue in the teaching profession. Under this program, those who teach full-time for ﬁve complete and consecutive academic years in certain elementary and secondary schools and educational service agencies that serve low-income families, and meet other qualiﬁcations may be eligible for forgiveness. Those who have <Link>PLUS loans only are not eligible for this type of forgiveness. The Federal </Link><Link>Student Aid website (http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/) is a good resource </Link>for more information. </P><P>Private Loans for International Graduate Students </P><P>Many of the private lenders who lend to Mount Holyoke undergraduates will also lend to graduate students who have qualiﬁed co-signers who are </P><P>U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </P><P>Tax Beneﬁts for Education </P><P>There are a variety of Qualiﬁed Tuition programs that allow for tax-free college savings plans, including 529 plans, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, and others. </P><P>Graduate students may also be eligible for education related tax credits, including the Lifelong Learning Tax Credit (up to $2,000 annually), qualiﬁed educational expense deductions, student loan interest <Link>deductions, and business deductions. Please see IRS Publication 970 </Link><Link>“Tax Beneﬁts for Education”</Link><Link> (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf) </Link>for more information. </P><P>Refund Policies Tuition Refund </P><P>The Professional and Graduate Education ofﬁce must receive written notice of the student’s intent to withdraw from a course. The ofﬁcial withdrawal date for a student is determined based on when the request to withdraw was received. </P><P>Students will be refunded 100 percent of their previously paid tuition, less the enrollment deposit for new students, if the Professional and Graduate Education ofﬁce receives written notice of an ofﬁcial withdrawal or leave of absence before the ﬁrst day of classes. If a student ofﬁcially </P><P>withdraws or takes a leave of absence on or after the ﬁrst day of classes of a particular term, refunds occur on the following schedule: </P><P>Fall and Spring Refund Schedule </P><P>Weeks Percentage </P><P>Week 1 90% refunded </P><P>Weeks 2-3 75% refunded </P><P>Weeks 4-5 50% refunded </P><P>Weeks 6-7 25% refunded </P><P>Summer Session Tuition Refund Schedule </P><P>Weeks Percentage </P><P>Weeks 1 75% refunded </P><P>Weeks 2 50% refunded </P><P>Weeks 3 25% refunded </P><P>Summer courses are typically shorter than fall and spring courses. Students requesting refunds before the ﬁrst day of the Summer session are entitled to a full refund, less the enrollment deposit paid. </P><P>January Session Refund </P><P>January session is typically only two weeks long. For this reason, refunds are not given to students who withdraw or take a leave of absence during the January session. Students requesting refunds before the ﬁrst day of the January session are entitled to a full refund, less the enrollment deposit paid. </P><P>Refund of Scholarships and Fellowships </P><P>If a student receiving a scholarship or fellowship drops or withdraws from a class, the amount of the credit applied towards the student bill will be proportional to the amount billed per the tuition refund schedule above. </P><P>Refund of Federal Student Loan </P><P>Federal aid refund policies are different than institutional refund policies. For students receiving federal loans for the fall or spring, “earned” loan funds are prorated based on the time enrolled (percent earned vs. unearned). Grad PLUS loans are returned before the Federal Direct Student Loan when loan funds must be returned. </P><P>Refund of Fees </P><P>There is no refund of the Graduate Student fee if a student withdraws on or after the ﬁrst day of classes. </P><P>Professional and Graduate Education Academic Policies </P><P id="LinkTarget_84855">Mount Holyoke students are expected to be fully acquainted with the policies affecting their academic and nonacademic lives on campus. Policies are published in this Bulletin, the Student Handbook, and in Faculty Legislation. New policies are published on the College’s website. </P><P>Academic Integrity Academic Responsibility </P><P>The decision to join this academic community requires acceptance of special rights and responsibilities that are essential for its effective functioning and the realization of its mission. </P><P>All members of the community share the responsibility to uphold the highest standards of academic and personal integrity, community engagement, and commitment to principles of equity and inclusion that </P><P>are central to the mission of the College. Failure to accept and act on this responsibility threatens the rights of the rest of the community by undermining the trust upon which the community is built. </P><P>Students, faculty, staff, and administrators assume a commitment to the academic community that supports teaching and learning in an open environment based on mutual trust, respect, and concern. All members of the community have the right to careful and constructive analysis of their work, and they have the responsibility to provide a serious response to the work of others. </P><P>Each member of the academic community has the right to beneﬁt from its collective knowledge and resources as well as the responsibility to contribute to them. </P><P>Honor Code </P><P>Each member of the Mount Holyoke community is expected to adhere <Link>to the following honor code and all regulations in the Student Handbook </Link>(<Link>https://www.mtholyoke.edu/deanofstudents/student-handbook/</Link>): </P><P>“I will honor myself, my fellow students, and Mount Holyoke College by acting responsibly, honestly, and respectfully in both my words and deeds.” </P><P>The framework of our honor code assumes adherence to the rules and regulations of the College which are designed to promote intellectual and social pursuits and to ensure personal safety. In addition, the College protects and upholds human rights policies, and is committed to an inclusive and diverse community. </P><P>The honor code is the hallmark of life together at Mount Holyoke College. Simply stated, it means that each student is responsible for maintaining their own integrity and, to the best of their ability, the integrity of the Mount Holyoke community. While broad in its applications, it provides a guideline for decision making which holds each student to principles of good conduct toward themselves and others. To ensure the care and preservation of the honor code, standards and procedures have been developed and implemented to provide the structure by which the honor code is administered. Students are expected to comply with the rules and regulations of the College. Beyond minimal compliance, students under an honor code grow to understand, through course work and collaborative learning, that honor is achieved with diligence, commitment, and courage. </P><P>The Mount Holyoke College honor system relies on the integrity of each student. The strength of the system derives from the honesty and self-discipline of every student and from the faith of the faculty and the administration in the student body. With integrity as the foundation, the honor system promotes individual freedom tempered by responsibility to the community. Each student demonstrates their respect for individual freedom by conducting themselves with maturity and honor, and by showing due concern for the welfare of other members of the community. </P><P>College regulations delineate the expected standard of behavior in academic and social circumstances. Dishonorable academic conduct, such as plagiarism and cheating, discredits the individual student. Behavior which is in conflict with the  community standards and regulations of the College is detrimental to the well-being of the Mount Holyoke community. </P><P><Link>Please see more information on the honor code on the dean of students </Link><Link>website (http://www.mtholyoke.edu/deanofstudents/honorcode.html). </Link></P><P>Additional information on the honor code, examples of violations, the process for reporting suspected violations, the procedures through which the Academic Honor Board adjudicates suspected violations, and <Link>potential penalties for its violation are available on the Academic Honor </Link><Link>Board page (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/academicdeans/academic</Link><Link>honor-board/</Link>). </P><P>Plagiarism </P><P>Academic integrity is highly valued at Mount Holyoke College. Respect for intellectual labor and creativity is vital to academic discourse and enterprise. This principle applies to works of all authors and publishers in all media. It encompasses respect for the right to acknowledgment, right to privacy, and right to determine the form, manner and terms of publication and distribution. Plagiarism or other forms of scholarly misconduct can have no purpose or place in the academic life of the College. Each student is responsible for observing established procedures in the preparation of assignments, the writing of papers and examinations, and for submitting only original work. Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism may be grounds for sanctions against members of the academic community. </P><P><Link>Please refer to this Library Research Guide (http://guides.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>c.php?g=879988</Link>) on how to cite sources properly and plagiarism. Please see the Graduate Student Policies Handbook for more information on academic integrity policies and procedures. </P><P>Academic Standards </P><P>The academic requirements for graduate students include timely completion of all College, graduate program, and individual academic program requirements. </P><P>Students are expected to enroll in the courses per their approved program of study and submit any proposed changes to their program plan to their advisors, in advance, for approval. </P><P>Students are expected to be enrolled in all terms required by their degree program. The only exception to this requirement occurs when the student is granted an ofﬁcial leave of absence by the Professional and Graduate Education Executive Director, with the concurrence of the director of their program. </P><P>Satisfactory Academic Progress </P><P>Students in the graduate programs are required to obtain a B or better in all coursework. Any grades lower than a B- are not acceptable and can not be used towards the completion of a degree. In instances where a student has not met this requirement, the student must meet with the program director/advisor who, in consultation with the Executive Director of Professional and Graduate Education, will determine if the student can proceed in the program. </P><P>Incomplete grades are awarded at the discretion of the instructor in concurrence with the Executive Director of PaGE. Incompletes that remain unchanged after the end of the authorized extension are converted to F grades. </P><P>To maintain full eligibility for federal student aid funds, satisfactory academic progress must be maintained. Graduate students who fail to complete the total number of credits attempted, whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.00 or whose years of enrollment in the program exceed the statute of limitations for the academic program will lose eligibility to receive any future federal student aid funds at Mount Holyoke. Student </P><P>Financial Services will notify the student of the loss of federal eligibility and the appeal process available to request aid eligibility be reinstated. </P><P>Statute of Limitations </P><P>For students who start a one-year graduate degree program, requirements must be completed within a three-year period from the semester of admission. For students who start a two-year graduate degree program, requirements must be completed within a four-year period from the semester of admission. </P><P>Access and Inclusion </P><P>Mount Holyoke is committed to creating and maintaining a community in which all its members including students, faculty, staff and visitors can live and work together in an environment free from discrimination. Under federal and state laws, all students are protected from discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, (including sexual harassment), age, sexual orientation, marital or veteran status. </P><P>The College complies with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other applicable statutes and amendments. </P><P>Compliance with the law is the responsibility of all members of the Mount Holyoke community. </P><P>Any student who feels that they have been discriminated against based upon any one of these factors must contact the College’s Title IX Coordinator. These protections also include retaliation for ﬁling complaints of discrimination. Concerns regarding course offerings, instructor and student attitudes should also be directed to the Title IX Coordinator. </P><P>The College's Title IX Coordinator shares oversight of the College’s compliance with Title IX with Human Resources and the Dean of Faculty Ofﬁce. The Title IX Coordinator oversees the use of grievance procedures as it pertains to the resolution of complaints of violation of Title IX. </P><P>The Title IX Coordinator can be contacted at: <Link>titleixofﬁcer@mtholyoke.edu or 413-538-3569. </Link></P><P>For more information, please consult the Mount Holyoke webpages <Link>on Title IX compliance (http://www.mtholyoke.edu/risk/title-ix</Link><Link>compliance-mount-holyoke-college/</Link><Link>) and access and inclusion (http:// </Link><Link>www.mtholyoke.edu/deanofstudents/access-and-inclusion/</Link>). </P><P>Accommodating Learning Differences </P><P>Students requiring accommodations should let their advisor know as soon as possible and will be required to register with the<Link>Ofﬁce of </Link><Link>AccessAbility Services (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/accessability/). </Link></P><P>Students who are registered with the Ofﬁce of AccessAbility Services, and are seeking an incomplete as an accommodation based on a disability, should simultaneously make requests through AccessAbility Services and the Executive Director of Professional and Graduate Education. </P><P>Registration and Class Attendance </P><P>Students register for the next semester following academic advising periods. Courses may be added only during the designated add period, as </P><P><Link>outlined in the academic calendar (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/registrar/ </Link><Link>calendar/</Link>). </P><P>Students may drop courses only during the designated drop period, <Link>as outlined in the academic calendar (https://www.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>registrar/calendar/</Link>). Courses from which the student has dropped will not appear on the student’s academic record. After the designated drop period, withdrawals from courses require the approval of the instructor and will appear on the student’s record, with the notation “W.” After this withdrawal period, students may withdraw from courses only with the approval of the instructor and authorization from the director of health services, the director of the counseling service, or AccessAbility Services when granted as an accommodation. Courses recorded with the notation “W” will not affect a student’s grade average. </P><P>Regular class attendance is expected of all students unless an individual instructor suspends this expectation. </P><P>Religious Observance </P><P>In support of our religiously diverse student population and in compliance with Title XXI Chapter 151C Section 2B of the General Laws of Massachusetts, students seeking a religious accommodation because their religious observance will determine they will miss a class or work and who need an extension, rescheduled exam, or make-up materials to complete work due on these dates are advised to contact their professors (or staff employer in relation to campus jobs) well in advance of the holiday or fasting period -- preferably at the start of each semester. </P><P>Section 2B of Chapter 151C of the General Laws of Massachusetts reads: &quot;Any student in an educational or vocational training institution, other than a religious or denominational educational or vocational training institution, who is unable, because of his religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination or study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study, or work requirement which he may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such school. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the said student such opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his availing himself of the provisions of this section." </P><P>Course Evaluation </P><P>As the semester draws to a close, students are required to submit an online course evaluation for each of their courses. This requirement is a reflection of the importance the College places on students and faculty supplying each other with timely, thoughtful feedback. Students who do not submit their evaluations on time may be blocked from access to their degree audit, unofﬁcial transcript, and grades until they have submitted the overdue evaluations or, at minimum, until they record a “decline to evaluate” response. Professional and Graduate Education course evaluations are administered by the Ofﬁce of the Dean of the Faculty. </P><P>Grading Policies </P><P>The grades of A and B (with “+” and “-”) are acceptable for graduate credit.  Anything lower than a B- is not acceptable toward the degree. </P><Table><TR><TH>Grade </TH><TH>= </TH><TH>Points </TH></TR><TR><TD>A </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>4.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>A</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>3.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B+ </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>3.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>3.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>2.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C+ </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>2.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>2.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>1.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D+ </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>1.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>1.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D</TD><TD>= </TD><TD>0.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>F </TD><TD>= </TD><TD>0 </TD></TR></Table><P>Extensions </P><P>Extensions are to be used to address unanticipated emergencies only and are intended to apply to cases where the student has completed at least three-quarters of the work of the semester. During the semester, course instructors have full discretion with regard to the granting of extensions when students need extra time to complete assignments or examinations. Prior to the last class in a given semester, however, students who need any further extension must consult with their instructor and receive approval of the Executive Director of Professional and Graduate Education. In order to be eligible for an extension to complete course work beyond the end of the semester, a student must experience a medical or personal emergency that could not have been anticipated that prevents them from completing the ﬁnal work in a course. </P><P>Per College policy, faculty are not allowed to accept work after the noon deadline on the last day of the examination period unless a student has an authorized extension. Students are strongly advised to plan ahead as much as possible and request an authorized extension. </P><P>Students who would like to request a course extension can access the <Link>form and additional instructions (https://gradadmission.mtholyoke.edu/ </Link><Link>register/CourseExtension/</Link>). </P><P>Leaves and Withdrawals </P><P>A variety of factors may emerge that require students to disrupt their program of study. If something comes up, students should discuss their options with their advisor or program director. </P><P>Ofﬁcial notiﬁcation must be given by the student in order to drop or withdraw from a course, request a leave of absence, or withdraw from the College. If the effective date of the request is before the ﬁrst day of classes, that semester's courses will be dropped from the student’s transcript. However if the effective date of the request is on or after the ﬁrst day of classes, the student will be withdrawn from those courses and they will remain on the student's transcript with a grade of “W”. Failure to complete the withdrawal procedures may result in failing grades. </P><P>Dropping or withdrawing from classes, taking a leave or withdrawing from the college may impact ﬁnancial aid eligibility or the loan repayment schedule. Please contact Student Financial Services with any questions. <Link>A partial tuition refund (p. 462) may be available depending on when a </Link>request is received. </P><P>Course Drops/Withdrawal </P><P>Students who would like to request course drop or withdrawal <Link>can access the request form and additional instructions (https:// </Link><Link>gradadmission.mtholyoke.edu/register/CourseWithdrawal/</Link>). Withdrawing from a course may have both academic and ﬁnancial implications. A grade of &quot;W&quot; is recorded for each withdrawn course. That grade will be reflected on the transcript, but not calculated in the grade point average. Once a withdrawal request has been processed for a course, it becomes part of the academic record and it is non-reversible. If the withdrawn course is required for the student's program, the student will need to retake the course and pay any associated tuition, fees, etc. Based on the time of withdrawal, students may qualify for a partial credit of tuition. The ofﬁcial date of withdrawal is based on the date the form is received by the Professional and Graduate Education. </P><P>Leaves of Absence </P><P>A student in good academic and ﬁnancial standing may request a leave for one or two semesters. A leave begins at the end of a regular semester. The student is expected to return at the conclusion of the leave or to request an extension of the leave. Students who would <Link>like to request a leave of absence can access the request form and </Link><Link>additional instructions (https://gradadmission.mtholyoke.edu/register/ </Link><Link>LeaveOfAbsence/</Link>). Students who take a leave without a formal request or notifying the College will be withdrawn and must request reinstatement if they wish to return. </P><P>Voluntary Withdrawal from College </P><P>Students who would like to request a withdrawal from the college <Link>can access the request form and additional instructions (https:// </Link><Link>gradadmission.mtholyoke.edu/register/CollegeWithdrawal/</Link>). Once a withdrawal request has been processed, it becomes part of the student's academic record and is non-reversible. Students who withdraw from the <Link>College must reapply (https://gradadmission.mtholyoke.edu/register/ </Link><Link>withdrawal-readmission/</Link>) if they wish to return. </P><P>Privacy of Student Records </P><P>Mount Holyoke College policy with respect to conﬁdentiality of student records complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as amended (PL 93-380, Section 438, the General Education Provisions Act), which gives students certain rights, consistent with the privacy of others, to review their own ofﬁcial records, ﬁles, and data, and to challenge the accuracy of the contents of such records. The act also generally prohibits the release of personally identiﬁable information (other than “directory information” deﬁned below) about students without their written consent other than to teachers and other College ofﬁcials who have legitimate educational interests; to ofﬁcials of other institutions in which the student intends to enroll; to certain authorized state and federal ofﬁcials; to appropriate parties in connection with ﬁnancial aid to the student; to organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the College; to accrediting organizations; to comply with a judicial order or lawfully ordered subpoena; and to appropriate ofﬁcials in the case of health and safety emergency. </P><P>A school ofﬁcial is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research or support staff position (including law enforcement personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using College employees or ofﬁcials (such as an attorney, auditor, IT specialist, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student or appointed volunteer serving on an ofﬁcial committee or assisting another school ofﬁcial in performing his or </P><P>her tasks. A school ofﬁcial has a legitimate educational interest if the ofﬁcial needs to review an education record in order to fulﬁll his or her professional responsibilities for the College. </P><P>The regulations of the act make clear that, in the case of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes, information from the education records of the student may be disclosed to parents without the student’s prior consent. The College may notify the student’s parents in writing of academic probation, required withdrawal, and suspension. In communications with parents concerning other matters, it is normally College policy to respect the privacy of the student and not to disclose information from educational records without the student’s prior consent. </P><P>Requests for review of speciﬁc records must be made in writing. A student who seeks to review only health or career records should ﬁle a written request to do so with the director of health services, the director of the counseling service, or the Career Development Center. All other requests should be made at the Ofﬁce of the Dean of the College. </P><P>The Privacy Act gives Mount Holyoke College the right to make public at its discretion, without prior authorization from the individual  student, the following personally identiﬁable directory information: name; class year; home/permanent, off-campus/local, and College addresses; home, local, and residence hall telephone numbers; College electronic mail address; identiﬁcation photograph; dates of attendance at Mount Holyoke College; enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate; full- or part-time; on leave); date and place of birth; major(s); degrees, honors, and awards received; participation in ofﬁcially recognized sports and activities; status as student employee; and previous educational institution most recently attended. An individual student may limit release of the above information for any given year by ﬁling such a request with the registrar by July 1 of that year; requests received after this date will be put into effect as quickly as possible, but directory information already released cannot be recalled. </P><P>Transfer of Graduate Course Work </P><P>The College will accept transfer of up to two graduate courses, after a review has determined that the courses meet the content requirements of the particular program. However, all students completing the degree must still complete the full number of degree credits for their speciﬁc program by selecting among the alternative electives available through Mount Holyoke’s Professional and Graduate Education programs. </P><P>Course Eligibility Requirements </P><P>Grades received for courses requested for transfer must be &quot;B&quot; (3.00) or better. Graduate level courses to be transferred must have been taken no more than three years prior to the student's acceptance into the Master's program and may not have been used previously to fulﬁll the requirements for any other degree, certiﬁcate or diploma program. An ofﬁcial transcript and syllabus of the course(s) to be transferred are required. </P><P>No more than two courses, a maximum of eight (8) graduate credits, may be transferred. Eligible courses may be from any one of the following sources: </P><L><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Course(s) taken at another regionally accredited college/university within the United States, </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>• </Lbl><LBody>Course(s) taken while enrolled as a non-degree graduate student, </LBody></LI></L><P>• Course(s) offered through Mount Holyoke’s Professional and Graduate Education programs. </P><P>The MAT program may recognize courses taken as an undergraduate student, over and above the requirements necessary for the baccalaureate degree towards speciﬁc content areas, as appropriate towards licensure. </P><P>FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION </P><P><Link>Faculty and Emeriti (p. 467) </Link></P><P><Link>Administration (p. 479) </Link></P><P>Faculty and Emeriti A </P><P>Samuel Ace </P><P>Visiting Lecturer in English </P><P>MA City College of New York;
