To this day Colgate people consider the number 13 a good omen. </P><P>The Baptist Education Society was chartered by the state in 1819 and chose Hamilton as the site for its school, which opened in 1820. The Colgate family connection was established in 1823 when Baptists in New York City — soap maker William Colgate among them — consolidated their seminary with the school in Hamilton to form the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution. </P><P>The oldest building on the current campus, West Hall, was built three years later in 1827. By 1834 the institution included preparatory, collegiate, and theological departments. The first students &quot;not having the ministry in view&quot; were admitted in 1839. </P><P>A state charter issued in 1846 changed the name to Madison University and established the right to grant degrees. Madison was changed to Colgate in 1890, recognizing nearly 70 years of continuous involvement and service by the Colgate family. </P><P>Colgate Academy, the preparatory department, was discontinued in 1912. The theological division merged with Rochester Theological Seminary in 1928 to become Colgate Rochester Divinity School, and Colgate has been non-sectarian since that time. The University became coeducational in 1970. </P><P>Colgate today is a highly selective, independent, coeducational liberal arts college enrolling approximately 2,900 undergraduates in programs that lead to a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree. A small graduate program offers the Master of Arts (MA) and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degrees. </P><Sect><H2>The Thirteen Founders of Colgate University </H2><P>John Bostwick </P><P>Jonathan Olmstead Joel W.

The Middle States Commission on Higher Education is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Colgate University is also accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS). All Colgate degree programs are registered by the New York State Education Department, Office of Higher Education and the Professions, Cultural Education Center, Room 5B28, Albany, New York 12230, 518-474-5851. </P><P>Colgate University is a member in good standing of the Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP). The Teacher Preparation Program at Colgate University is fully accredited by AAQEP. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Curriculum </H2><P>Fully reaccredited effective June 2018 by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Colgate offers a curriculum established around four academic divisions — Arts and Humanities, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Social Sciences, and University Studies. Colgate offers 64 undergraduate majors including several interdisciplinary programs. See Majors and Minors </P><P>The academic program consists of courses in the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, courses in the field of major, electives, and physical education classes. Competency must be demonstrated in a foreign or classical language and in English composition. First-year students enroll in a first-year seminar during the fall term. (See Undergraduate Program.) </P><P>Selection of the major is made before the end of the sophomore year from among the departmental majors or the interdisciplinary majors. Optional minors in all department fields are normally declared during the junior year. </P><P>Colgate offers a variety of academic experiences with an international emphasis including nine modern and two classical languages as well as more than 20 off-campus study groups, most of them overseas. As part of the liberal arts and sciences program, there are opportunities for honors, independent study, and research. The diversity within the academic program prepares students for many careers and life choices, including professions that require graduate school training. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Graduate Study </H2><P>Colgate offers a small graduate program leading to the Master of Arts (MA) in several academic fields and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. (See Graduate Program.) </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Academic Centers and Institutes </H2><P>Under the auspices of the Office of the Provost and Dean of the Faculty, academic centers and institutes support scholarship and intellectual inquiry, often of an interdisciplinary nature. Each entity is directed by an appointed member or members of the faculty. </P><P>The Center for Freedom and Western Civilization seeks to enliven the intellectual discourse among students and faculty on campus by promoting a set of ideals that have their origins in Western civilization but are universal in scope and appeal. </P><P>The Center for International Programs supports globally focused programming and educational initiatives at the University, preparing students for success in an increasingly global world and economy. </P><P>The Center for Language and Brain scientifically explores questions regarding neural mechanisms and functions of native and foreign language use and learning. </P><P>The Center for Learning, Teaching and Research is dedicated to enhancing learning and teaching in support of the liberal arts. The center provides support for students in the areas of summer research, tutoring and learning support, accessibility services, and athletic academic support.  The center also offers programming, services and resources to faculty. </P><P>The Center for Women's Studies is a multipurpose space where students, faculty, and staff can gather to discuss a multitude of topics spanning the feminist spectrum and considering the intersectionality of identities and various forms of oppression. </P><P>Lampert Institute for Civic and Global Affairs provides a forum for study and debate in the areas of civic affairs and public leadership, applying insights from the liberal arts to the important challenges facing human beings around the world. </P><P>The Picker Interdisciplinary Science Institute fosters the creation of new knowledge that is obtainable only through the development of sustained interdisciplinary research. </P><P>The Upstate Institute promotes a better understanding of the cultural, social, economic, and environmental resources of Upstate New York. </P><P>W.M. Keck Center for Language Study is a high-tech space for the exploration of language and culture, promoting global perspectives in education. </P><P>Writing and Speaking Center provides one-on-one peer assistance with writing projects and oral presentations from across the disciplines. Writers and speakers of all levels and abilities are welcome, with no referral necessary, and students may visit at any stage of the composing process, from initial brainstorming of ideas to review of a full draft or presentation. Appointments and walk-in hours are available at several campus locations each semester. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>The University Community </H2><P>As a residential university in the village of Hamilton, Colgate is a community where students share the challenges, joys, and responsibilities of learning with members of the faculty and staff, and respect for individuals is expected and fostered. Students are represented on both the Academic Affairs Board and the Student Affairs Board, the two major policy-making bodies in the governance system. The liaison committees reporting to the faculty and to the Student Senate are also composed of students, professors, and administrators. These committees deal with matters ranging from multicultural affairs to the University budget. </P><P>Active and constructive participation is the key to Colgate community life. A look at the schedule of events for any given week will reveal many opportunities beyond the classroom, laboratory, and library — music, theater, art, lectures, films, athletics, community service and more — to suit almost every interest. </P><Sect><H2>Students </H2><P>Colgate is a community of approximately 2,900 students — a size that supports a richer variety of opportunities than would be possible at a smaller college. The University seeks to admit individuals who are able and motivated to complete the academic program and who represent a diversity of talents and backgrounds that contribute to and enrich the campus community. Special promise in particular areas, such as art, music, theater, and athletics, is sought along with demonstrated academic achievement. Since 1967, academically and economically disadvantaged students with strong potential have been recruited and admitted to Colgate under the auspices of the Office of Undergraduate Studies. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Faculty </H2><P>The principal purpose of the University is undergraduate education, and all faculty members have teaching as their primary responsibility. Courses are taught by faculty members, not graduate students. Students and professors share in the vigorous pursuit of learning, both inside and outside the classroom. </P><P>Colgate faculty members are productive artists, authors, and scholars whose professional work is important not only for the advancement of knowledge but also as a means by which teaching is continually refreshed and revitalized. </P><P>Interdisciplinary cooperation, exploration, and programming among members of the faculty, as well as the University's commitment to undergraduate teaching and to the goals of academic freedom and excellence, make Colgate's teaching and learning experience outstanding. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Alumni </H2><P>Colgate's nearly 34,000 living alumni are particularly notable for their loyalty and have a tradition of strong engagement and philanthropic support. Their achievements as distinguished graduates in almost every field continually enhance Colgate's reputation. </P><P>Many alumni maintain an active interest in university affairs through admission recruitment, career advising, mentoring, fundraising, reunions, speaking engagements on campus, Colgate publications, and more than 60 active district clubs around the world. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>The Campus </H2><P>Colgate University is located in the historic village of Hamilton, at the northern end of the Chenango Valley in upstate New York. Picturesque Hamilton, with a population of approximately 4,000, is centered on a village green. Students frequently shop in the village, although many resources are available to them right on the campus. The nearly 600-acre campus rises from the valley floor and village edge to a forested hill </P><Sect><H2>Academic Buildings </H2><P>Alumni Hall, erected in 1860, is home to the departments of history and sociology and anthropology, the Africana and Latin American studies, Peace and Conflict studies, and Native American studies programs, and the The Longyear Museum of Anthropology. </P><P>The Dana Arts Center houses the departments of music and theater, Brehmer Theater, and the Picker Art Gallery.

It is structured to provide a well-rounded liberal arts education and to prepare students for graduate and professional schools. A student's academic program consists of courses in the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, courses in the field of major, electives, and physical education classes. There are 56 majors offered, several of which are interdisciplinary in nature and offer honors programs. Qualified students are encouraged to participate in one of Colgate's more than 20 off-campus study groups. Other academic options include independent study courses, guided research, and approved off-campus (non-Colgate) study programs. </P></Part><Part><H2>The Academic Curriculum </H2><P>The following sections describe important features of the curriculum. For more specific course requirements see Majors and Minors. </P><Sect><H2>Academic Credit </H2><P>Academic credit toward the Colgate degree is expressed in terms of course credits. Most courses taken at Colgate carry one course credit (1.00) or the equivalent of four credits on the semester-hour basis. Fractional credit (0.25 or 0.50) is awarded for academic opportunities that do not fit easily into the standard one course/one credit structure. Fractional credit of 0.25 or 0.50 may be awarded for two types of courses: </P><P>(1) stand-alone fractional credit courses that have a clear intellectual rationale independent from other courses (e.g., approved half-semester courses, independent study/research); and (2) add-on fractional credit courses comprising components that intellectually engage students in ways that extend beyond the content of the full-credit course to which they are attached (e.g., laboratories, service learning, extended study, and performance). Add-on fractional credit may be either required or optional. A maximum of 2.00 course credits from add-on fractional credit courses may count toward the 32-course credit graduation requirement. There is no limitation on the number of stand-alone fractional credit courses that may count toward graduation. </P><P>All fractional credit courses receive separate grades. One-half credit courses are equivalent to two credits on the semester-hour basis and are indicated as 0.50 on the academic record. One-quarter credit courses are equivalent to one credit on the semester-hour basis and are indicated as 0.25 on the academic record. </P><P>As used in the catalog, the term &quot;course&quot; means a full (1.00) course credit, as distinguished from fractional credit courses. All laboratories included in course descriptions as bearing academic credit carry 0.25 course credits, unless noted otherwise. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Curricular Requirements for Graduation </H2><P>Students must complete a minimum of 32.00 course credits (with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00) and requirements for the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, a major, and foreign language and writing (if stipulated upon admission). Additional requirements, including residency and physical education, are described in Academic Regulations. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Liberal Arts Core Curriculum: Living and learning in a Diverse Community </H2><Sect><H2>Summary </H2><P>The required Liberal Arts Core Curriculum has the following structure for students who arrive after the Spring of 2023: </P><P>The Components </P><P>Core Communities Core Conversations Core Sciences </P><P>The Liberal Arts Practices </P><P>Confronting Collective Challenges   The Process of Writing   Quantitative and Algorithmic Reasoning   Language Study Artistic Practice and Interpretation  </P><P>Areas of Inquiry </P><P>Human Thought and Expression  Natural Science and Mathematics   Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents   </P><P>Physical Education and Wellness  Distinction   (optional) </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Fulfilling the Core Components: </H2><P>These three Component courses are not sequential. Students may complete the three required component courses in any order but are expected to complete the three courses by the end of their sophomore year. Exceptions may be made for students completing certain programs (for example, pre-medical study) and for students with special individual circumstances. Students who have not completed the three component courses by the end of the second year are required to obtain permission of the course instructor to enroll as juniors or seniors in component courses. </P><P>Students entering Colgate in the Fall of </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>2021 must successfully complete Core 151 and 152 in addition to Core Communities and Identities and Core Scientific Perspectives; or Core Conversations in place of either Core 151 or 152. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>2022 must complete three component courses. In addition to Core Communities and Identities and Core Scientific Perspectives, they must successfully complete one of the following, or two if they wish: Core 111 (Conversations) or CORE 151 (Legacies of the Ancient World) or CORE 152 (Challenges of Modernity). The second course would count toward graduation but would not fulfill a requirement. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>2023 or later must successfully complete Core Communities, Core Conversations, and Core </LBody></LI></L><P>Sciences. A Global Engagements course (see the previous core curriculum) is no longer required. Students entering Colgate in the Fall of 2021 or 2022 may substitute Core Communities for Core Communities and Identities, and Core Sciences for Core Scientific Perspectives when the new courses become available. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Fulfilling the Liberal Arts Practices and Areas of Inquiry: </H2><P>To ensure a well-rounded liberal arts education, students must engage with disciplines throughout the curriculum and across the full reach of the academic program at Colgate. Thus, to fulfill the Liberal Arts Practices and Areas of Inquiries requirements, students must successfully complete at least seven courses, from at least six different departments or programs. Students will fulfill the LACC in no fewer than 10 and no more than 12 courses. </P><P>Although a course may carry multiple tags, a student may not fulfill multiple designations through a single course. The following exceptions apply: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Students may double-count their Process of Writing Practice course to also fulfill one Liberal Arts Practices or Areas of Inquiry requirement. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Students may double-count the FSEM to fulfill one Core Component or any Liberal Arts Practice / </LBody></LI></L><P>Area of Inquiry requirement except their Process of Writing course. Students may complete these requirements in any order, at any point during their progress toward a degree. </P><P>Students entering Colgate in the Fall of </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>2021 or 2022 must successfully complete two courses, in different subject codes, in each of the three Areas of Inquiry. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>2023 must successfully complete one course in each of the three Areas of Inquiry plus one course </LBody></LI></L><P>in each of the five the Liberal Arts Practices. (See above for double-counting options.) Apart from transfer students, all Colgate undergraduates entering in the Fall of 2023 or later are required to meet these requirements; students may not place out of any of them. None may be fulfilled by Advanced Placement credits or other pre-matriculation credit. Liberal Arts Practices and Areas of Inquiry requirements may be fulfilled on Approved Programs and at other institutions approved by the University for transfer credit. Component courses must be successfully completed at Colgate. </P><P>For additional information see the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>First-Year Seminars </H2><P>Director Karn </P><P>First-year seminars (FSEMs) are designed to introduce students to a variety of liberal arts topics, skills, and ways of learning, including the importance of academic integrity. The FSEM emphasizes all aspects of the learning process including the exploration of individual needs and strengths, interactions with classmates, and the multiplicity of resources beyond the classroom. Special emphasis is placed on improving writing skills and using the library's many resources. The merging of these elements into a single course provides a prime opportunity for the student to obtain a breadth of college-level experience and academic perspective. </P><P>Many first-year seminars will earn credit within the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, including Areas of Inquiry. FSEMs are listed each year in the first-year student registration materials. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Cultures and Languages Across the Curriculum (CLAC) </H2><P>Colgate University seeks to create an international ethos for the liberal arts by expanding the range of curricular settings in which students and professors pursue knowledge through the study of materials produced in multiple languages. Beyond the language and literature departments, faculty across all academic disciplines regularly include sources originally published in a wide variety of languages in their curricula. Through the CLAC program, faculty may choose to offer a supplemental component to a particular course in which students learn new language skills related to the primary course or read course materials in their original language. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Major Programs </H2><P>Students investigate a body of knowledge in depth in a major. An official major must be selected and filed in the Office of the Registrar in the second term of the sophomore year. Students who fail to declare a major by the announced deadline will not be permitted to register for the upcoming term. A student may subsequently change majors with the approval of the new department chair or program director and the filing of a new declaration of major form with the registrar. Most major programs are centered on a single discipline and supervised by one academic department; however, a number of interdisciplinary majors permit students to major in a subject that involves several related departments. Some even cross divisional boundaries. A minimum grade of C- in introductory courses is normally needed for admission to a major. For graduation, the minimum grade point average (GPA) required for courses counted toward the major is 2.00 (C). </P><P>The major program includes at least eight courses. Most departments or programs also require a senior-level seminar or research course or independent study. </P><P>Students may pursue a double major, a major and a minor, or a major and two minors. No more than two majors, one major and one minor, or a major and two minors, may be recorded on a student's transcript. Students should see Majors and Minors for an alphabetical list. </P><Sect><H2>Bachelor of Arts Degree (AB) Programs </H2><P>The major programs are approved by the Dean's Advisory Council and registered officially with the New York State Education Department. Specific major and honors requirements are found in Majors and Minors. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Double Major </H2><P>Some students elect to fulfill the requirements for two separate majors. This choice helps focus the plan of study but greatly reduces one's freedom in electing courses each semester. </P><P>Students wishing to declare a second major must formally file their plan with the registrar by the end of full-term course withdrawal period in the first term of the senior year. </P><P>The form filed first will be considered the primary major, unless the registrar is informed that the second form filed is to be the primary major. Students who elect to complete a double major must let each supervising department or program know that a second major is being pursued. </P><P>A course may be used to satisfy requirements in both majors. A student will only be considered to have completed a double major when at least seven of the courses completed in fulfillment of each major are unique. If the primary major requires cognate courses (which must be taken but which are not actually considered part of the major), these cognate courses may be counted toward the second major. The minimum GPA of 2.00, required for completion of the primary major, also applies to a second major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Topical Majors </H2><P>Topical majors allow students, with the advice of a faculty adviser, to design an independent, interdisciplinary course of study outside the existing department and program structure. Topical majors are used for student major programs that encompass courses from more than one department or program. The three topical major programs are in Arts and Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Sciences. Although administered at the divisional level, some topical majors may cross divisional lines. Topical major programs are approved by the respective division directors. In all cases, Colgate's general requirements for graduation will apply. Topical majors are described under their respective divisions within the alphabetical order of Majors and Minors. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Minor </H2><P>Every department and nearly every program at Colgate offers an optional minor consisting of at least five designated courses or types of courses. A major and a minor, or two minors, may have overlap of course requirements, but at least seven courses must be unique to the major and at least four courses must be unique to each minor. Minors should include coursework at the intermediate or advanced level. A minimum GPA of 2.00 (C) is required in all courses counted toward a minor. Minors must be filed with the registrar by the end of full-term withdrawal period in the first term of the senior year. No student may declare a minor in the same field as the student's major. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Academic Advising </H2><P>Faculty advising can be essential to a student's success and sense of satisfaction with the academic program. Colgate recognizes that academic advising needs can be diverse, and individual expectations and requirements often change with time. Effective advising develops in a timely fashion when students take the responsibility of reading this catalog and the Colgate Student Handbook, and seek assistance early and often. </P><P>Academic advising typically follows this pattern during the four years at Colgate: </P><Sect><H2>Prior to the first semester </H2><P>Students select courses for the first semester during the summer, prior to their arrival on campus for the fall orientation program. At this point, the first-year web pages and summer pre-matriculation faculty advisers serve as the primary resources for academic planning and course selection. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The First Semester - Course-Based Advising </H2><P>One of the four courses that each student selects for the first semester is a first-year seminar. The instructor for this course serves as the faculty adviser for each student enrolled in the seminar. During the first-year orientation program, students meet with their faculty advisers in individual advising sessions and review their fall course schedules. </P><P>Throughout the semester, the faculty adviser serves as an important source of counsel and guidance, gives information on course withdrawal and registration for spring term, and monitors midterm reports. Each semester, students are required to consult with their academic advisers prior to registration. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Second and Third Semesters - Transition Advising </H2><P>The advising relationship with the first-year seminar instructor usually continues until a major is selected. Students may change their official advisers by completing a form available from the Office of the Registrar. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Fourth Semester - Declaration of the Major </H2><P>In the spring semester of the sophomore year, each student must declare a major by completing a form to be turned in at the Office of the Registrar. The student chooses or is assigned a major adviser at this time. The major adviser is a mentor who advises students about requirements in the context of a sound, comprehensive academic program. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Administration's Role in Academic Advising </H2><P>The academic advising program is administered by the Office of the Dean of the Faculty and Provost. Questions, concerns, and suggestions about academic advising at Colgate should be directed to the director of academic support and disability services in the Center for Learning, Teaching, and Research. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Honors and Awards </H2><P>Colgate University encourages students to strive for excellence in their chosen fields of academic endeavor and honors those who achieve distinction in their academic performance. </P><Sect><H2>Honors in Major </H2><P>Students who earn honors in their majors have so mastered their disciplines that they are able to complete with distinction original work appropriate to their chosen fields of study. While specific requirements differ, all majors (except topical majors) offer the opportunity to pursue honors or high honors. Most major honors require completion of department or program courses with a designated grade point average (GPA) as well as a project designed and pursued independently under the guidance of a faculty sponsor. Departments and programs will determine whether the oral presentation and/or written reports are of a quality appropriate for honors. For details consult the departmental or program major listed alphabetically in Departments and Programs. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>University Honors </H2><P>Students who maintain a consistently high grade point average (GPA) throughout their academic careers are recognized for their achievements by the awarding of university honors at graduation. University honors are summa cum laude (3.80 for all courses attempted), magna cum laude (3.50), and cum laude (3.30). GPAs for university honors are established and reviewed by the Dean's Advisory Council. A minimum of 22 Colgate courses taken for a grade will be considered for university honors. Transfer students who have taken between 16 and 22 Colgate courses for a grade will be considered for university honors. </P><P>The valedictorian and salutatorian are the students who have the highest and second highest rank in the graduating class based upon the cumulative GPA in all courses taken for a grade. Transfer students must be enrolled at Colgate for at least six terms in order to be considered eligible for the university honor of valedictorian or salutatorian. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Dean's Award </H2><P>The following awards are presented each term to students who achieve the following </P><P>Dean's Award with Distinction - Students who receive a term grade point average of 3.6 or higher while completing at least 3 course credits for a conventional letter grade and a minimum of 3.75 total course credits. </P><P>Dean's Award - Students who receive a term grade point average of 3.3 or higher while completing at least 3 course credits for a conventional letter grade and a minimum of 3.75 total course credits. </P><P>See Grading Policies  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Other Awards </H2><P>The Bernard and Sydell Citron Pre-Medical Scholastic Prize — established in 1964. The income from this fund, but not less than $250 annually, is to be paid to the graduating pre-medical senior who has been accepted in a medical school and who has attained the highest scholastic standing among all the premedical students graduating that year. </P><P>The Class of 1884 Public Speaking Prize — established in 1884 to offer a prize for debate. </P><P>The Class of 1997 Award — established to provide financial assistance for one or more graduating seniors.

Stevenson Prize — established in 1920 for a prize in extemporaneous speaking. </P><P>See department/program pages for specific departmental awards. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Off-Campus Study </H2><P>Acquiring an intercultural perspective is an important goal of Colgate's liberal arts education. The university offers an academically, geographically, and culturally diverse array of off-campus programs that combine rigorous academic study with meaningful cultural engagement. The global campus provides access to lectures by distinguished scholars and readings by well-known writers; it opens the doors of museums, libraries, theaters and temples; and it allows students to experience the day-to-day fascination of a new and stimulating environment. </P><P>Effective September 2019, all students studying abroad on approved programs that are hosted in a non-English speaking country, or in a country in which English is one of many official languages, are required to take at least one language class in that program's native language or one course taught in a local language other than English during the program.  </P><P>Please consult the Off-Campus Study web page for a list of language requirements for each program. Exceptions will not be granted except in extreme circumstances. </P><P>The off-campus study program is administered by the Office of Off-Campus Study in McGregory Hall. Options include semester-long Colgate study groups directed by Colgate faculty; semester-long approved programs offered by other universities or education providers; and extended study courses taught by Colgate faculty that include a three-week off-campus component. </P><P>Students are advised to meet with an off-campus study adviser to learn more about their options and plan in order to take best advantage of this opportunity. Students should consult their academic adviser and department early in the process to discuss degree requirements and any courses to be applied towards the major or minor. </P><P>For more information see Off-Campus Study. </P><Sect><H2>Application and Enrollment </H2><P>Application to off-campus study programs is made through the Office of Off-Campus Study. Applicants must meet the GPA requirements and prerequisites of their desired program, and be in good academic standing with Colgate in the following areas: academic, financial, and disciplinary. Students must demonstrate personal and academic maturity equal to the demands of the off-campus program, which often exceeds the demands of the campus. This maturity should be attested to by the student's academic record, administrative dean, and academic adviser. Admission to an off-campus study program is competitive and not guaranteed. </P><P>The application deadline is normally in November for Colgate Study Groups (Faculty led) and may be found online at colgate.edu/OCS. The annual deadline for Approved, non-Colgate programs is in early February for all of the following year, fall and spring semesters. Approved programs are reviews bu Colgate's academic departments on the Off-Campus Study Programs website at colgate.edu/OCS. </P><P>The number of students permitted to study off campus is managed by the university and student numbers must be balanced across semesters. Study Groups are scheduled to balance between fall and spring semesters. In order to continue to maintain all on-campus activities and support systems (including housing), approved program applicants must also be balanced across semesters. Colgate makes every effort to accommodate requests for off-campus study that will enable students to deepen their liberal arts education with coursework sponsored by other institutions. Nonetheless, the university needs to balance enrollments across both semesters and so reserves the right to regulate the number of students who are granted permission to study off campus each semester. Careful and early planning is vital to successful off-campus study. Students should discuss projected off-campus study plans with OCS and their academic advisers, considering options for both fall and spring terms that will achieve their educational objectives. Students attending a Colgate study group, approved program, or extended study remain enrolled at Colgate during their time off-campus. </P><P>Please refer to the Off-Campus Study section in Academic Regulations, for additional policies concerning the transfer of credit and grades from off-campus study programs. </P><P>Tuition and Financial Aid </P><P>Colgate's off-campus study tuition and financial structure make programs accessible for all students, regardless of financial means, just as it does for on-campus programs. The tuition structure helps to ensure that Colgate programs meet the university's high standards for academic rigor and quality. </P><P>All Colgate students who study on a Colgate-directed study group or on an external approved program continue to pay Colgate tuition and are eligible for Colgate need-based financial aid when studying off campus. Students are billed for tuition by Colgate for the semester they will be off campus plus the cost of any room, board, or other expenses charged by the individual study group or approved program. Students are responsible for paying other non-billable expenses, such as airfare, government visas, books, refundable deposits, optional fees, and personal incidentals directly. Off-campus study cost estimates are available on the OCS web pages at colgate.edu/OCS. </P><P>Students receiving need-based financial aid will have their financial aid package reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid for the semester they will be abroad. Financial aid is applied to students' accounts at the time of billing. Students are responsible for paying any balance due to Colgate. If there is a credit due, it will be released to the student shortly before the start of the semester. </P><P>Financial aid may be increased to meet the additional cost of off-campus study for only one semester and one extended study. Students participating in an additional semester-long or extended study program will have their awards capped at the amount they would have received if they were to remain on campus. </P><P>For information regarding withdrawal from off-campus study, see Withdrawal and Refund Policy section in Expenses. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Colgate Study Groups </H2><P>Colgate study groups provide students the opportunity to study off campus for a semester under the guidance and mentorship of a Colgate faculty member. Each study group has a unique academic focus and immerses students in new cultures, perspectives and experiences. Depending on the program, students will live together with their peers in apartments, with local students in university dorms, or with local host families. Study groups primarily accommodate registered Colgate students, though occasionally a few students from the New York Six group of colleges or Syracuse University may participate on certain study groups with visiting-student status on a space-available basis. Study groups normally enroll 15-18 students and are subject to minimum enrollment numbers to operate. </P><P>Colgate regularly offers the following semester-long study groups on an annual or biennial basis and currently all but the Washington DC Study Group satisfy the GE credit. For specific details, consult the OCS web pages at colgate.edu/OCS. It should be noted that changes may occur in the scheduling of study groups and that new groups may be added. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Australia: University of Wollongong (fall and spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>China: Taiwan, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>England: London Economics (fall and/or spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>England: London English (fall and/or spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>England: London History (spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>England: University of Manchester (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Germany: University of Freiburg (spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Italy: Ca'Foscari University, Venice (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Jamaica: University of the West Indies, Kingston (spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Japan: Kyoto (fall or spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>New Zealand: University of Otago (spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Singapore: National University of Singapore (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Scotland: St. Andrews University (fall or spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>South Africa: University of Cape Town, Cape Town (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>South Korea: Yonsei University, Seoul (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Spain: Madrid: CEU (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Switzerland: The Graduate Institute, Geneva (fall or spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Trinidad: University of the West Indies, St. Augustine (spring) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>United States: Bethesda Biomedical Research, Bethesda, MD (fall) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>United States: Washington, D.C.

Approved programs have been carefully vetted by the Off-Campus Study Committee and by individual academic departments for compatibility with Colgate's curriculum. In addition to meeting Colgate's expectations for academic rigor, they offer strong on-site support services and emergency support, and provide opportunities for meaningful engagement in the host culture. </P><P>Colgate's approved programs list is available on the Off-Campus study web pages at colgate.edu/OCS, and includes over 100 programs in 50 countries. Approved programs expand the possibilities for students with diverse academic interests and goals by providing options in a wide range of locations as well as a variety of program models. </P><P>As a way of ensuring an immersive study abroad experience, students participating on approved programs that are hosted in a non-English speaking country or in a country in which English is one of many official languages, are required to take at least one language class in that program's native language or one course taught in a local language other than English during the program. Often these courses are conversation-based and designed to enhance student ability to converse with local people. Please consult the Off-Campus Study web page for a list of language requirements for each country. Ordinarily, exceptions will not be granted. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Extended Study </H2><P>A number of Colgate courses offer short-term study components that extend the course for three weeks beyond the campus and beyond the regular term. These programs offer opportunities for students to gain access to institutions and individuals relevant to their coursework that are not available on campus. Extended study is particularly attractive to students whose schedules do not permit them to participate in semester-long programs. The university has developed many extended study courses, of which up to eight are offered each year. Extended Study groups operate in either January or May immediately following the semester. </P><P>Prerequisites may exist for extended study courses. Any seniors electing to participate in a spring extended study will graduate at the next degree conferral date, but will be eligible to apply for participation in the May commencement ceremony. Please refer to the student handbook for details on commencement participation. </P><P>New extended study courses are added on a regular basis. Please see the OCS web page for a complete listing of courses offering extended study components. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Other Programs </H2><P>Students with a compelling academic rationale whose academic interests cannot be met by a Colgate study group or approved program may petition the Office of Off-Campus Study to attend an alternate program. Students should begin by speaking with the associate director of off-campus study for advice about options and drafting a petition. Students should consult their academic advisers about the possibility of attending a program not already approved by Colgate. Petitions are vetted and determined by the Off-Campus Study Committee and require the support of a student's academic department and faculty adviser. </P><P>Students who do not submit a petition or whose petitions are denied, will not be eligible for Colgate financial aid or grant assistance, nor will academic credit transfer toward the degree. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Petitions for Travel to Countries under a U.S. State Department Travel Advisory Level 4 </H2><P>Colgate students are subject to the Colgate Travel Advisory policy that follows federal guidelines and restricts Colgate students from studying abroad or receiving funding in a country with a US Department of State level 4 rating. </P><P>Students may only receive sponsorship for activities abroad, including credit for study abroad; funding for internships, research, or volunteer activities; or sponsorship for extracurricular activities, such as music or sport, for countries for which the U.S. State Department has issued a country rating of levels 1 and 2, unless granted special approval through a petition process. </P><P>Countries designated a level 4 are those that do not have a US diplomatic presence and include North Korea, Iran, and Afghanistan. This often results in federal aid not being available for use in these countries. Colgate University will not approve undergraduate students to study in locations with a US State Department travel advisory of level 4. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Additional Academic Programs </H2><Sect><H2>Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) </H2><P>The Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) is led by a committed team, composed of a faculty director, an associate director, an administrative dean, and an OUS Fellow. This supportive four-year program aims to tap the potential of each OUS scholar, particularly in terms of academic excellence and leadership in the tradition of the liberal arts. The mission of the OUS program is reflected in Colgate University's own mission, which includes providing a &quot;demanding, expansive educational experience to a select group of diverse, talented, intellectually sophisticated students who are capable of challenging themselves, their peers, and their teachers.&quot; As OUS students are a highly select, talented, and diverse group of students at Colgate, they especially fulfill and enrich Colgate's mission and purpose. For information about the program, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Studies at 315-228-7375. For information about admission to Colgate through OUS, please contact the Office of Admission. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Pre-Engineering Studies </H2><P>Adviser Metzler </P><P>To combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University, Washington University (St. Louis), and Rensselaer Polytechnic University, under which a competent student may pursue this option. A student may earn a bachelor's degree from both institutions by spending three years at Colgate as a physics major and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan). Alternatively, a student may pursue the 4-2 plan. The pre-engineering student may be eligible to continue study for a master's degree. Colgate students are required to complete at least 24 credits, 6 semesters in residence, and CORE requirements before attending another institution. Students completing this program have a total transfer credit limit of up to 8 credits. For further information, students should consult the Pre-Engineering adviser or the chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Sophomore Residential Seminars </H2><P>Director Baptiste </P><P>This program is a faculty-led, yearlong program that integrates residential, classroom, and academic-travel experiences. Students in the program live together with other members of their chosen seminar. Faculty who teach these seminars act as mentors to this group of students, encouraging reflection and fostering discussion. In doing so, they help the members of the seminar to build a community, one centered on an intellectual pursuit but which extends beyond the classroom. </P><P>Members of the seminar travel with their professor for one week in January, deepening and broadening their understanding of the class material. (There is no charge to students for the travel component.) In the spring, all sophomore residential seminar students complete a 0.25-credit course, in order to develop the conversation of the class in light of the travel experience. </P><P>Applications for the SRS program are made available to rising sophomores at the beginning of the spring semester of their first year. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Summer Research </H2><P>Each year approximately 200 Colgate undergraduates receive research assistantships and fellowships funded directly by Colgate, corporate or foundation grants, individual donors, or individual faculty research grants. This funding provides a weekly stipend to enable students to work full time during the summer on research or scholarly projects in close collaboration with one or more faculty members. Often these activities result in presentation of papers at professional meetings or publication in the scientific and scholarly literature, with undergraduate students as co-authors, performers, and exhibitors. </P><P>Student/faculty-initiated research proposals are used as the basis for awarding summer research assistantships or fellowships of eight to ten weeks in duration. Partially subsidized on-campus housing options and special academic and recreational events enhance this scholarly summer community at Colgate. </P><P>Colgate understands the educational value of research by undergraduate students and is committed to its support. The college is recognized as a national leader in this activity with students and professors from all academic divisions participating. Details about on-campus summer research opportunities may be obtained from department chairs, division directors, or the Center for Learning, Teaching, and Research. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Teacher Preparation Programs </H2><P>Director Gardner </P><P>Programs are available to prospective elementary and secondary school teachers in the fields of childhood education, English, mathematics, social studies (economics, geography, history, political science, sociology) and natural science (biology, chemistry, earth science, or physics). Students in these programs major in academic areas for which childhood and adolescence teaching certification is sought and take appropriate coursework in the Department of Educational Studies. Students who wish to gain New York State teacher certification have the option of completing their professional semester in the fall term of their undergraduate senior year, directly following graduation as part of the ninth semester program, or as part of graduate-level coursework. To be eligible for the ninth semester program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification requirements prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their junior year. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the MAT adolescence programs are accredited through the Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP). </P><P>Successful completion of all requirements in all teacher preparation programs leads to recommendation for New York State initial teacher certification. </P><P>For more information see educational studies department page. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium </H2><P>Established with the support of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium facilitates collaboration among its member institutions in fulfilling their educational missions and serving the public good. Through the sharing of expertise and resources, the Consortium enhances options for students, faculty, and staff. In addition to Colgate, members of the consortium include Hamilton College, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Skidmore College, St. Lawrence University, and Union College. </P><P>Students who have completed at least one semester at Colgate have the opportunity to participate in a collaborative cross-registration program made possible through the New York Six Consortium. To be eligible to cross-register, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 3.00 course credits at Colgate. Courses taken as part of this cross-registration program will count as institutional (Colgate) credit, and grades earned will be recorded on the Colgate transcript and calculated into the Colgate grade point average. Because cross-registered courses count as part of the student's full-time Colgate course load, no additional tuition is assessed by the host institution. Normally students may only cross-register for one New York Six course per term. A maximum of three New York Six credits will count toward the Colgate degree. For additional information, please refer to the registrar's office web pages at colgate.edu/registrar. </P></Part><Part><H2>Less-Commonly Taught Language Program </H2><P>The Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTL) Program provides opportunities for students to study languages not available through the regular Colgate curriculum. LCTL courses are offered through two methods: shared course initiatives with instructors located on other campuses and self-instructional language courses overseen by the Director of the Keck Center for Language Study and the Language Council. LCTL courses are never offered for languages being taught on campus at Colgate nor do they count toward the completion of Colgate's language requirement. The Language Council regularly reviews the effectiveness of LCTL courses to determine whether they are suitable for the Colgate curriculum. </P><P>Upon approval from the Language Council, the Curriculum Committee, the Registrar, and any other relevant program of study, shared courses will be listed among the course offerings. Students will receive credit for </P><P>courses taught by the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium members according to the guidelines of that agreement. Courses taught at any other institution will be treated as transfer credit. </P><P>Students with a compelling academic rationale to study a language not offered through any other means may apply for a self-instructional language course. The application procedure includes writing a detailed explanation of how the language study fits within the student's broader academic studies and an interview by members of the Language Council. Students may earn a maximum of 0.5 credits per semester for self-instructional language study. All self-instructional language courses must be taken with the S/U grade option. The final grade in the course will be determined by the director of the Keck Center, and will be based upon completion of self-instructional materials, regular meetings with a native-speaking language partner, and an assessment by an outside reviewer. All courses will have the 'LCTL' course designation. Students interested in LCTL should contact the director of the Keck Center for Language Study. </P></Part><Part><H2>Cooperative Arrangement with Hamilton College </H2><P>With approval of the faculty adviser and the associate dean of the faculty, a Colgate student may take courses at Hamilton College, to be counted toward the bachelor's degree at Colgate. These arrangements must be made prior to the end of the Colgate drop/add period each term. Credit and final course grades for courses taken at Hamilton College are recorded on the Colgate transcript. Grades earned at Hamilton College are calculated into the cumulative grade point average at Colgate. </P></Part><Part><H2>Office of National Fellowships and Scholarships </H2><P>The Office of National Fellowships and Scholarships (ONFS) advises and prepares students and alumni in their pursuit of nationally and internationally competitive external fellowships, scholarships, and grants. </P><P>Through the process of applying for any award, students and alumni engage in deep reflection about their intellectual, personal, and professional goals, along with developing their critical thinking, writing, and presentation skills. The Assistant Dean for Fellowship Advising closely advises and supports students and alumni who are seeking Colgate's nomination for fellowships that require it. For these nomination-based awards, the Dean and faculty committees are involved in the review and evaluation of applicants for nomination and the further mentoring of nominees. </P><P>Students and alumni pursuing fellowships which do not require nomination also stand to benefit from the Dean's advice and support and are welcome and encouraged to work with ONFS on these applications. All interested students and alumni should contact ONFS well in advance of the deadline to begin the advisement and application process. </P><P>The most prominent fellowships, scholarships, and grants for which Colgate prepares students and alumni can be found on the Office of National Fellowships and Scholarships web page. </P></Part><Part><H2>Honorary Societies </H2><Sect><H2>Phi Beta Kappa </H2><P>The Society of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1776; Colgate's chapter was organized in 1878. The Colgate chapter holds three elections each year, in September, February, and May. Seniors whose records of outstanding academic achievement are combined with the society's traditional regard for moral character and a broad liberal education may be invited to join Phi Beta Kappa in a formal initiation ceremony. </P><P>Minimum academic requirements include: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>A course in mathematics, statistics, or logic (or AP equivalent) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Fluency in a second language, as demonstrated by a year of coursework at the intermediate level </LBody></LI></L><P>(or AP equivalent) or graduation from a non-English language secondary school. Transfer students should take note that election requires a minimum of 16 courses taken at Colgate for a grade, not under the S/U option. </P><P>For questions, contact Professor Jason Meyers, Associate Professor of Biology, President, Eta Chapter, Phi Beta Kappa. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Other national honorary societies </H2><P>Colgate also has a chapter of the national honor society of Phi Eta Sigma for first-year students. </P><P>Honor societies in specific disciplines include </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Lambda Alpha (Anthropology) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Eta Sigma Phi (The Classics) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Omicron Delta Epsilon (Economics) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Gamma Theta Upsilon (Geography) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Delta Phi Alpha (German) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Pi Delta Phi (French) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Pi Sigma Alpha (Political Science) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Psi Chi (Psychology) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Alpha Kappa Delta (Sociology) </LBody></LI></L></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Career Services and Career Development Planning </H2><P>Colgate Career Services, located in Benton Hall, is a comprehensive center of support that empowers students to engage in strategic exploration, discovery, preparation, and action, translating the liberal arts into a lifetime of meaningful work. The four-year plan -- starting in students' first semester -- provides students with a helpful structure to navigate this process while ensuring an individualized approach to meeting students' unique needs.  </P><P>Students engage with Career Services staff in a working partnership to help outline their first and next steps and encourage students to drive their own progress.

Since 2013, through the generosity of alumni and parents, Career Services has supported over 1,100 students with over $4.3M in grant funding for summer experiences.  </P><P>Graduate School Access Fund: This fund provides financial support for students of color and/or low-income students with demonstrated need who seek admission to graduate schools and professional  schools. Students in active application cycles for master's or doctoral programs, and those preparing for standardized testing for future enrollment, are eligible to utilize this grant to support their needs. </P><P>Colgate Professional Networks (CPNs): Eleven interdisciplinary networks designed to connect alumni-toalumni and alumni-to-students for professional development. The CPNs host regional and online topical programs and networking events. Current CPNs include: Arts, Creativity, and Innovation; Common Good; Consulting; Digital Business and Technology; Entrepreneur; Finance and Banking; Health and Wellness; Colgate Lawyers Association; Marketing, Media, and Communication; Real Estate; and STEM. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Internship Programs </H2><P>Career advisers work closely with students to identify and apply for summer experiences, including internships, research, and long-term service projects. In many cases, students leverage career services' resources, such as Handshake and the Colgate Premier program, the Colgate Link, or connections with program panelists to pursue experiences. </P><Sect><H2>Colgate Internship Programs </H2><P>The John A. Golden '66 Endowed Fellowship provides summer internship funding, in addition to advising, programmatic, and financial support for sophomores, juniors, and seniors interested in pursuing law school or medical school.

A minimum of 32 academic course credits is required for graduation. A maximum of 2 credits from add-on fractional credit courses may count toward this requirement. </P><P>All students must meet the following requirements: a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of </P><P>2.00 for all Colgate courses and a GPA of 2.00 in the major. Both full and fractional credit courses are included in the GPA. Colgate grades range from a high of A+ (4.33) to F (0.00). </P><P>It is the student's responsibility to know where he or she stands in terms of completing graduation requirements. Students may track academic progress and plan for future semesters using Colgate's degree audit program, which is available in the Colgate portal. Unofficial transcripts are also available in the portal, or students may request a copy from the Office of the Registrar. Students should consult with their department chair or program director and with the registrar's office if there are questions regarding major, minor, or graduation requirements. </P><P>Students must meet all requirements of the academic program in order to be eligible for graduation, including the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, major, foreign language, and writing (if stipulated at admission). Additionally, physical education, residency, and all financial obligations to the university must be satisfied. </P><P>Degree requirements must be completed within 12 years of initial matriculation. Petitions for exemptions to this rule will be considered only in exceptional circumstances, and approved petitions for degree completion may require additional coursework to reflect changes in the university's academic program. </P></Part><Part><H2>Residency Requirement </H2><P>Matriculated students entering as first-year students are required to complete seven terms in academic residence at Colgate. Transfer students are required to complete a minimum of four terms in academic residence at Colgate. A student participating in a Colgate study group is considered to be &quot;in academic residence&quot; for the purposes of this requirement. One semester of participation in an approved program will also count toward this requirement. </P></Part><Part><H2>Physical Education Requirement </H2><P>Students must complete two units of physical education at Colgate. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of sophomore year. A complete listing of physical education and outdoor education activities may be found on the physical education department web page. Athletes may earn one physical education credit for each full year of participation on varsity teams. Students may earn a maximum of one physical education credit per club sport. Questions about physical education credits should be directed to the Department of Physical Education. </P></Part><Part><H2>Registration </H2><P>Students are expected to participate in official course registration on the announced dates for each term of attendance. Later registration will jeopardize admission to courses. </P><P>A student's registration will be canceled if the student is not confirmed in residence on campus by the sixth day of classes in a semester. Similarly, a student will be unable to initiate on-campus course registration after that deadline. </P><P>Students failing to meet announced deadlines for financial obligations in any term will be placed on a &quot;financial hold&quot; status and normally will not be permitted to register or make schedule adjustments until the hold has been resolved. </P><P>Registration changes made during the drop/add period must be processed via the Colgate portal by the announced deadline of the drop/add period for a term. The drop/add period for a course that meets less than or outside of the regular academic term is through the eighth day of the session. Please see Withdrawal from a Course, below. </P><P>Students are not permitted to add or drop courses after the end of the drop/add period, except with special permission granted by the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS). </P></Part><Part><H2>Normal Course Loads </H2><P>A normal full-time course load is 4.00–4.50 course credits per semester. During early registration, students may register for no more than 4.50 course credits. Students not on academic warning who wish to take 5.00 course credits in any term may add additional courses to their schedules during the drop/add period. Because of the demanding academic load, students who wish to register for 5.00 course credits are urged to discuss this matter with their faculty advisers. Students may register for 5.50 course credits only with the written permission of their faculty adviser. Students may not take or receive credit for more than 5.50 course credits in any term except with the approval of their faculty adviser and the associate dean of the faculty, which must be secured by the end of the drop/add period. </P><P>First-year students are expected to take 4.00–4.50 course credits per term and may deviate from this plan only with permission from their academic adviser. Juniors, Seniors, or special students who plan to take fewer than 3.00 course credits in any term should refer to the section on Per Course Billing. </P></Part><Part><H2>Independent Study </H2><P>Although academic work consists primarily of courses taught in the classroom, laboratory, and field, there are a number of opportunities for independent study. Students may register for independent study during </P><P>each term of the regular academic year. The essential features of the independent study program are as follows: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Students may apply for independent study through a specific department/program, for which they receive course credit (0.50 or 1.00) and a grade. The credit weight must be decided at the time of application and may not be changed without administrative approval. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Not more than one half of a student's course load in any one term may be courses of independent study, except with the permission of the associate dean of the faculty. Permission must be secured before the beginning of the term. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>Independent study courses must be approved by the faculty supervisor and the appropriate department chair or program director no later than the last day of the drop/add period in any term. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>4. </Lbl><LBody>Independent study courses are not offered to students free of charge. Tuition is charged for independent studies according to the established rates whether taken as part of a full-time or part-time course load. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>5. </Lbl><LBody>A student who wishes to take an independent study course during a fall or spring semester when not in residence at Colgate must secure the approval of the faculty supervisor, the appropriate department chair, and the Associate Dean of the Faculty before the beginning of the term. Students must also make appropriate arrangements with the registrar's office for independent study courses well in advance of the beginning of the term. Work equivalent to the course credits earned must be completed during the semester in which the credit is received and must include an in-person component. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>6. </Lbl><LBody>Independent study courses are registered according to the level of the course, which usually corresponds to the student's class level. Sophomores who enroll for independent study courses will normally be registered at the 291 level, juniors at the 391 level, and seniors at the 491 level. First-year students normally do not enroll in independent study courses. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>7. </Lbl><LBody>In rare cases, students may take a conventional course independently. This should be done only for compelling reasons, and explicit permission must be received in advance from the faculty supervisor and the appropriate department chair. Students enrolling in such a course will be registered according to the normal course number, to which the suffix Z is appended to indicate that the course is taken independently. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>8. </Lbl><LBody>All work for independent study courses must be submitted by the last day of classes in the term to give the faculty supervisor sufficient time to evaluate the student's performance and submit the final course grade to the university registrar. </LBody></LI></L><P>For additional information regarding independent study policies and procedures, please refer to the registrar's office web page at colgate.edu/registrar. </P></Part><Part><H2>Registration Restrictions </H2><P>A student may not register for a course that is a prerequisite for a course for which he or she has already received credit, unless permission is granted by the department chair/program director and the associate dean of the faculty. A student may not take crosslisted courses and receive credit for both courses. Students may not register for any courses that overlap in any of their scheduled times. </P></Part><Part><H2>Repeating a Course </H2><P>With permission from the instructor, a student may repeat a course in which a grade of C–, C, or C+ is earned. Any course in which a grade of D+, D, D–, F, or U was received may be repeated in subsequent terms by contacting the registrar's office prior to registering; permission of instructor is not required. A student may not repeat a course in which a grade of B– or higher was earned. </P><P>A prerequisite course may not be repeated after the successful completion of a subsequent higher level course. Courses, including discontinued courses, may not be repeated by substituting a similar or comparable course currently in the curriculum. A repeated course must be taken in the same grading mode (i.e., conventional letter grade or S/U) as the original course. Additionally, the course must be taken in the same method (e.g., a conventional course cannot be repeated on an independent basis). Courses taken on a Colgate study group may not be repeated on campus, and courses taken on campus may not be repeated on a Colgate study group, without the permission of the department chair/program director and associate dean of the faculty. A Colgate course may not be repeated by means of transfer credit from another institution, although credit for a course, with no GPA adjustment, may be earned if a student earned a grade of F or U in the equivalent Colgate course. </P><P>Only the highest grade of a repeated course will be calculated into the term and cumulative GPAs. Should a student earn the same grade on a second or subsequent attempt, only the first grade earned will be reflected in the student's term and cumulative GPAs. Credit from the repeated course will not be counted toward overall graduation credits. Students who complete a Colgate course that is a repeat of (or equivalent to) a transfer course or Advanced Placement will not receive duplicate credit. All grades earned in courses, including transfer or Advanced Placement, remain on the student's transcript, but will be noted as repeated. When a course is repeated after a grade of F has been assigned as a result of University Student Conduct Board action, both the original grade of F and the subsequent grade will be calculated into the cumulative GPA. </P></Part><Part><H2>Grading Policies </H2><P>The grades used to indicate the quality of the student's performance in a completed course are as follows: A means excellent, B means good, C means satisfactory, D means poor but passing, F means failing. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by dividing the number of quality points by the number of course credits attempted for grades. Colgate grades are assigned the following quality points to full (1.00) credit courses: The following grades are not calculated into the GPA and carry no quality points. </P><Table><TR><TD>A+ </TD><TD>4.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>A </TD><TD>4.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>A</TD><TD>3.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B+ </TD><TD>3.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B </TD><TD>3.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>B</TD><TD>2.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C+ </TD><TD>2.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C </TD><TD>2.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>C</TD><TD>1.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D+ </TD><TD>1.33 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D </TD><TD>1.00 </TD></TR><TR><TD>D</TD><TD>0.67 </TD></TR><TR><TD>F </TD><TD>0.00 </TD></TR></Table><P>EX Credit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or other international examinations </P><P>TR Credit for course work transferred from another institution </P><P>S Satisfactory for one-course-per-term grade option (Juniors or Seniors only, effective September 1985) or January project </P><P>U Unsatisfactory for one-course-per-term grade option (Juniors or Seniors only, effective September 1985) or January project </P><P>O Credit for Physical Education unit </P><P>N No credit/No course value for Physical Education unit </P><P>T Satisfactory progress in two-term course (converted to standard letter grade at end of second semester) </P><P>CR Credit Grade Recording Option (effective Spring 1981-1986) </P><P>H Honors for January term project </P><P>P Pass in Pass/Fail Option </P><P>Failure in Pass/Fail Option </P><P>* Grades in courses taken on approved or affiliated off-campus program </P><P>W's (withdrawal), I's (incomplete) and NG's (no grade submitted by instructor) are not included in the calculation of the GPA, as these are administrative notations rather than grades. </P><P>Grades appearing on a student's academic record may normally not be changed after one semester from the end of the term in which the grade was awarded. Grade changes initiated by the course instructor(s) must follow the &quot;Changes of Grade" policy laid out in the Colgate University Faculty Handbook. Under extraordinary circumstances, grade changes beyond one semester but before graduation may be approved by the associate dean of the faculty. </P></Part><Part><H2>Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Option </H2><P>The Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grade option is designed to encourage students to explore new areas outside their majors in the spirit of a liberal education. The following conditions apply to this option: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Students with junior and senior standing may elect to take one 1.00-credit course (plus any required fractional credit add-on components) or two .5-credit courses per semester, for a maximum of 4 semesters, which are evaluated &quot;satisfactory&quot; (S) or &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; (U) instead of by the conventional letter grades. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>It is expected that students will take a course and any required fractional add-on component with the same grade option (conventional grade or S/U). In these cases, the total credit value of S/U courses may exceed the usual 1.00 credit limit per semester. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>In certain instances, faculty members may require that a stand-alone course or add-on fractional credit course be offered only on a graded or S/U basis. These courses will not count against the 1.00-credit-per-semester limit. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>4. </Lbl><LBody>Except in item #3 above, the decision to choose the S/U option rests solely with the student. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>5. </Lbl><LBody>A student on academic warning may not take a course S/U. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>6. </Lbl><LBody>Courses taken to fulfill the Common Core, Global Engagements, areas of inquiry, language, writing, and major or minor requirements may not be taken S/U. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>7. </Lbl><LBody>The choice to take a particular course with the S/U option must be made prior to the end of the withdrawal period as published on the academic calendar. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>8. </Lbl><LBody>No course will be officially recorded as using the S/U grading option unless the student has submitted the completed Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Option form to the registrar's office by the deadline. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>9. </Lbl><LBody>After the end of the withdrawal period, no changes in the grading mode (conventional grade to S/U, or S/U to conventional grade) may be made. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>10. </Lbl><LBody>In the event of a course's limited enrollment, a student's desire to take the course on the S/U basis shall not be a criterion in determining his or her eligibility for the course or course section. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>11. </Lbl><LBody>To achieve the grade of S, the student must perform at a level that would warrant a grade of C– or better. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>12. </Lbl><LBody>Satisfactory completion of a course is entered on the student's permanent transcript as S, but does not enter into the computation of the GPA. The unsatisfactory completion of a course is entered on the student's transcript as U, but does not enter into the computation of the GPA. No course credit is awarded for a grade of U. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>13. </Lbl><LBody>Seniors, during their final semester, are discouraged from taking a course using the S/U option </LBody></LI></L><P>unless they will have a total of 32 course credits without the S/U course. For additional information regarding the S/U grade option, please refer to the registrar's office web page at colgate.edu/registrar. </P></Part><Part><H2>Withdrawal from a Course </H2><P>Students are permitted to withdraw from a course without academic penalty until the mid-term date listed in the academic calendar. For fractional credit courses that meet for the first- or second-half of term students are permitted to withdraw without academic penalty prior to the appropriate date listed in the academic calendar. The required course withdrawal form is available in the registrar's office. Withdrawing from a course after the end of the drop/add period places a W on the transcript for the course. Students are cautioned to avoid a pattern of regularly accumulating W grades on their academic record. Withdrawals after the deadline are not permitted unless there are extraordinary circumstances (such as severe illness) that merit an exception. In those cases, a petition must be submitted to the administrative dean and approved by the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS). </P><P>First-year students normally may withdraw from courses only for reasons beyond their ability to predict or control and only with approval of the course instructor and faculty adviser. First-year students in the fall semester must also receive approval from their administrative dean to ensure appropriate mentorship and support. </P><P>Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors may withdraw from courses only with the approval of the course instructor and faculty adviser. Sophomores, Juniors or Seniors are also encouraged to discuss the withdrawal with their administrative dean to ensure appropriate mentorship and support but are not required to obtain their signature.  </P><P>International students must receive approval from their administrative dean, in addition to their faculty advisor and course instructor, to withdraw from a course regardless of their class year because such decisions may affect visa eligibility. </P><P>Student athletes must consult with the Director of Student-Athlete Academic Enhancement, in addition to their faculty advisor and course instructor, when considering whether to withdraw from a class, as this decision may impact their NCAA athletic eligibility. Students receiving financial aid are limited to a total of 8 semesters of aid and should carefully consider how a withdrawal will impact their ability to complete their coursework within 8 semesters. </P><P>Students on academic warning may withdraw from a course only for well-documented reasons and only with approval from their administrative dean, in addition to their academic adviser and course instructor. (See Academic Warning and Suspension below.) </P></Part><Part><H2>Incompletes </H2><P>The temporary status of &quot;incomplete&quot; in a course is given only when, for compelling reasons, a student is not able to complete the work in the course by the end of the term. It is used rarely and only as a consequence of extenuating circumstances beyond the ability of the student to predict or control. A student's request for an incomplete must be made before the end of the term and must be directed to their administrative dean, who will consult with the instructor in the course (or study group director) before making a decision. Faculty do not grant incompletes. If an incomplete is granted by the administrative dean, the dean then informs the university registrar, the student, and the faculty member. It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements with the instructor to complete the work in the course by the established deadline. </P><P>An administrative dean will grant an incomplete for a specific period of time, but in most cases the incomplete work must be completed and submitted to the faculty member not later than 20 days from the last day of the term's final examination period. Extensions beyond the 20-day period will be granted by the administrative dean only as a result of highly unusual circumstances. The instructor will submit the appropriate grade to the Registrar within 10 days after the conclusion of the deadline for completion of work, whether or not the make-up work has been completed. If no grade is submitted, the registrar, after consultation with the instructor and administrative dean, will assign a grade of F. </P></Part><Part><H2>Class Attendance </H2><P>Attendance at all classes is expected and is an important part of one's academic development. Because most faculty at Colgate put a premium on student participation in class, absence is likely to be detrimental to the student's learning in any course. </P><P>Attendance practices for each course will be announced by the faculty member at the beginning of each term. Conflicts between curricular and co-curricular activities should be avoided by careful planning and scheduling of activities. The rare but unavoidable conflict should be worked out well in advance by the student with the faculty member's permission. </P><P>Students may request that an administrative dean notify faculty members about prolonged absences due to serious health problems. Students should consult an administrative dean immediately if non-health-related obligations will force them to miss several classes. Single or brief absences should be discussed by the student and faculty member without necessarily contacting the student's administrative dean. </P></Part><Part><H2>Class Standing </H2><P>Progress toward degree typically requires the successful completion of a minimum of 4.00 course credits per semester. Class standing is determined by the number of credits earned. A student's initial class year and expected graduation date may be changed if progression toward degree is interrupted by leaves of absence, course failures, course withdrawals or reduced course loads. </P><P>In order to achieve junior class standing, a student must successfully complete 4 semesters and a minimum of 14 course credits. To qualify for senior standing, a student must successfully complete 6 semesters and a minimum of 22 course credits. </P><P>Students who receive financial aid should refer to Financial Aid for eligibility for federal programs. </P></Part><Part><H2>Minimum Academic Progress </H2><P>Students must earn a minimum GPA of 2.00 each term as well as cumulatively in order to be considered in good academic standing. Students who fail to meet minimum GPA requirements are subject to academic warning or dismissal (see below) and may lose eligibility for federal and/or state aid. See Financial Aid. </P></Part><Part><H2>Academic Warning and Suspension </H2><P>The Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS), chaired by a designated member of the dean of the college staff, reviews the academic performance of all students at the end of each term. Students are expected to meet minimum GPA requirements, not only for each single term but also on a cumulative basis. </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>A student who fails to meet minimum GPA requirements (see &quot;Minimum Academic Progress,&quot; above), either cumulatively or for any term, will be placed on academic warning during the next term of enrollment at Colgate, or will be suspended. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Any student on academic warning who fails to earn at least a 2.00 GPA for a term will be subject to academic suspension. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>Any student who fails three or more courses during a term and/or who has a term or cumulative GPA of less than 1.33 will be subject to suspension even if the student is not on academic warning. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>4. </Lbl><LBody>A student readmitted after academic suspension will be placed on warning for the term in which he or she returns. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>5. </Lbl><LBody>A student who does not return from an academic suspension within four semesters will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for readmission through the Office of Admissions </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>6. </Lbl><LBody>A second academic suspension results in permanent academic dismissal. </LBody></LI></L></Part><Part><H2>Off-Campus Study </H2><Sect><H2>Colgate Study Groups and Extended Study </H2><P>Academic regulations, registration changes, and drop/add deadlines for a term apply to students participating on Colgate-sponsored off-campus programs (study groups and extended study). Colgate study group students who enroll in a host university will also need to comply with the host university's academic regulations and registration requirements. Students making changes to their curriculum must seek Colgate approval (as outlined below) before making final course selections. </P><P>A normal course load on a Colgate study group is four courses, unless a fifth course is a required part of the program. Any deviation from this norm requires pre–approval first from the director of the study group and the director of Off-Campus Study, and subsequently from the associate dean of the faculty. </P><P>Use of the satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading option for study group courses is highly discouraged. Requests for the S/U grading option for study group courses must be approved by the director of the study group, the director of the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs, and the associate dean of the faculty. </P><P>Students may satisfy the Global Engagements requirement by participating in all overseas study groups and for the USA-based Santa Fe and NIH study groups. However, GE credit does not apply for the Washington DC study group. </P><P>Any seniors electing to participate in a spring extended study will graduate at the next degree conferral date, but will be eligible to apply for participation in the May commencement ceremony. Please refer to the student handbook for details on commencement participation. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Approved Programs </H2><P>Approved programs have been selected by individual departments to allow students to transfer credit toward the Colgate degree and a complete list of available programs may be found on the Colgate off-campus study application site (colgate.edu/OCS). Students are bound by the academic regulations and registration requirements of their approved program sponsor and host institution in addition to those of Colgate University. Students are expected to enroll in pre-approved courses equivalent to 4 Colgate credits. Any deviation from this norm requires pre-approval from the approved program sponsor, director of off-campus study, and subsequently from the associate dean of the faculty. Students who plan to participate in an approved program must submit a Transfer Credit Application Form, available in the Registrar's Office or online, prior to departure. </P><P>Students may participate in one semester-long approved program. Students with a compelling academic reason who wish to study on a single approved program for two consecutive semesters must successfully petition the Office of Off-Campus Study. Petitions for two different approved programs will not be allowed. Students who successfully petition to participate in an approved program for two consecutive terms may transfer eight (8.00) credits toward the Colgate degree. This is the maximum transfer credit: students who earn eight credits may not receive other transfer credit, such as Advanced Placement or summer credit. This policy does not alter existing policies set by departments and programs for transferring major or minor credit. </P><P>Credit from approved programs counts toward the six-course limit for transfer credit. Credit and grades for approved programs appear on the Colgate transcript but are not counted toward the GPA. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) or other ungraded options are not permitted. Courses taken on an approved program do not count toward the Global Engagement requirement. </P><P>A student is considered enrolled at Colgate while on an approved program, with the proviso that only one such semester may count toward the seven-semester residency requirement for graduation. Note that Colgate students participating in an approved program where study is conducted at a foreign host university may not elect to study at the host university independently of the approved program provider. Similarly, Colgate students may not opt to withdraw from an approved provider program when a program is canceled due to a global or host country emergency in order to continue to study at the host university. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Leaves of Absence </H2><P>Many Colgate students complete the bachelor's degree by attending Colgate, including participation in a study group or approved program, for eight consecutive semesters, but there are often compelling reasons for students to break this normal attendance pattern. For detailed information regarding leave options, including policies and deadlines, please consult the Colgate Student Handbook. </P><P>If unapproved leaves are taken, students are withdrawn from Colgate and must apply for re-admission through the Office of Admission. In addition, students taking an unauthorized leave of absence must be aware that their eligibility for student aid is jeopardized, and that academic work taken elsewhere is not considered for transfer credit. Any student who is uncertain about attending a future term at Colgate is urged to discuss the matter with the administrative dean prior to the deadline to submit a formal request to the Office of the Registrar for transfer credit; April 15 for the fall term and November 15 for the spring term. (See Residency Requirement and Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures in this section.) </P></Part><Part><H2>Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures </H2><P>Matriculated students may receive transfer credit for a maximum of six Colgate course credits. (Maximum credits for transfer students are outlined in &quot;Transfer Student Program,&quot; in this section.) This limit includes all courses taken on an approved program, at other institutions during the summer or intersession, during a leave of absence from Colgate, Advanced Placement,  International Baccalaureate or other international exam credits, and college credits earned prior to entering Colgate as a first-year student. (See &quot;Advanced Placement and Pre-matriculation Transfer Credit&quot; in the following section.) </P><P>Students who plan to take courses at another institution and receive transfer credit from Colgate must submit a Transfer Credit Application, which is available on the registrar's office web page. All courses taken off campus must be approved in advance by the Office of the Registrar to be eligible to transfer, and in some cases by the appropriate department or program. Courses consistent with the Liberal Arts curriculum at Colgate may be eligible for transfer; internships, fieldwork, and clinical courses are not eligible for transfer. Please refer to the registrar's office web page (colgate.edu/registrar) for detailed information regarding the types of courses that may be considered for transfer and the process for transferring credits toward the Colgate degree. </P><P>Colgate University operates on a course credit system for graduation. Faculty, students, and administrators should be aware that semester- and quarter-hour values are assigned to courses at the majority of institutions in this country and abroad. The semester hour/quarter hour transfer conversion chart is below and also available on the Transfer Credit Application on the registrar's web page (colgate.edu/registrar). Colgate will award one-quarter course credit per semester hour, and one-sixth of a course credit per quarter hour (rounded to the nearest quarter credit), up to the course credit offered by Colgate for the equivalent course. A course transferred as 0.75 or more Colgate credits is eligible to fulfill required courses in a major or minor or other University requirements. The awarding of more than 1 course credit for a course without an exact equivalence in the Colgate curriculum requires approval by the Associate Dean of Faculty for Curricular and Academic Affairs, and is approved only in exceptional situations. The registrar's office will determine the amount of Colgate credit to be granted and refer students to department chairs and program directors for specific course approvals as appropriate. </P><Table><TR><TH>Semester </TH><TH>Quarter </TH><TH>Colgate </TH></TR><TR><TH>Hours </TH><TH>Hours </TH><TH>course credits </TH></TR><TR><TH>4 </TH><TD>5-6 </TD><TD>1.00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>3 </TH><TD>4 </TD><TD>0.75 </TD></TR><TR><TH>2 </TH><TD>3 </TD><TD>0.50 </TD></TR><TR><TH>1 </TH><TD>1-2 </TD><TD>0.25 </TD></TR></Table><P>Colgate students may not be simultaneously enrolled in courses which will lead to more than 2 course credits during summer terms, or more than 5.25 course credits, while enrolled at another institution during a Fall or Spring term following matriculation at Colgate, except with the prior approval of the Associate Dean of Faculty for Curricular and Academic Affairs. Colgate students may not be enrolled in courses at another institution while also enrolled in courses at Colgate, except when doing so under an official Colgate program (such as a Colgate Study Group). </P><P>An official transcript, as well as any supporting documentation (such as department approval), should be submitted to the registrar's office within one academic year following the term in which the coursework was completed. After a transfer course has been recorded on a student's Colgate transcript, it may not be removed. If a student repeats the course at Colgate, the credit weight will be removed from the transfer course, but the transfer course will remain on the transcript. </P></Part><Part><H2>Advanced Placement and Pre-matriculation Transfer Credit </H2><P>Upon receipt of an official college transcript, students may be eligible to earn credit for courses taken at a regionally accredited college/university while a student is in secondary school. The courses may be considered for Colgate credit if satisfactorily completed (letter grade of C or better) and bear a minimum of three semester or five quarter hours. Courses taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory, pass/fail, or other ungraded basis are not eligible for transfer. Courses taught in the high school are not eligible for transfer. The course must be taken at the college/university (e.g., with degree seeking candidates and taught by a regular member of faculty). Students may be requested to submit course syllabi or laboratory materials for evaluation purposes. College courses completed prior to matriculation may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement. For required forms and additional information, refer to the registrar's office web page (colgate.edu/registrar). Colgate credit is normally granted to first-year students who achieve a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) tests or a 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations (higher level only), and when a department certifies that the exam score indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific Colgate course. Individual students may petition for credit from A-Levels or other international examinations. The amount of credit, the conditions under which credit is granted, and/or placement appropriate to the academic development of the student are all determined by the appropriate Colgate academic department. Detailed descriptions of the petition process and credit policies applicable to an entering class may be found on the registrar's office web page. Credit from standardized examinations may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement. </P><P>All requests for credit for academic work completed prior to entering Colgate must be filed with the registrar's office prior to registration during the fourth semester. Supporting documentation, such as the official transcript(s), official test scores, and/or course syllabi, must be submitted with the pre-matriculation credit application. Students who fail to meet this deadline must submit a written request accompanied by a written statement of support from the academic adviser to the university registrar. </P><P>Advanced course placement without academic credit may by granted by departments to first-year students whose performance on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP subject examinations only), CEEB Achievement Tests, or the New York State Education Department's College Proficiency Examinations gives clear evidence of competence in the courses tested. </P></Part><Part><H2>Transfer Student Program </H2><P>The maximum number of non-Colgate course credits for which a transfer student receives credit depends upon the number of acceptable liberal arts courses, grades, and credits from all other college(s) attended, as well as the number of acceptable Advanced Placement (AP) course credits. </P><P>After enrolling at Colgate, transfer students may subsequently transfer additional coursework from other institutions, with prior approval, up to the maximum indicated: </P><Table><TR><TH>Total course credits accepted </TH><TH>Maximum (not additional) transfer </TH></TR><TR><TH>upon enrollment at Colgate </TH><TH>course credits allowed </TH></TR><TR><TH>1.00 – 4.75 </TH><TD>6.00 </TD></TR><TR><TH>5.00 – 8.75 </TH><TD>8.00* </TD></TR><TR><TH>9.00 – 12.75 </TH><TD>12.00* </TD></TR></Table><P>13.00 – 16.00 16.00 </P><P>*Students who are eligible for a fractional credit value above the limit at the time of Admission may retain the additional fractional credit above the stated maximum. </P><P>No student may transfer more than 16.00 course credits toward a Colgate Bachelor's degree. </P><P>Any questions relating to the issue of transfer credit should be referred to the registrar's office. </P><P>Students who transfer to Colgate from other institutions will be subject to the requirements of the educational programs that are appropriate to their level of entrance (first-year, sophomore, or junior). These requirements include the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, major, foreign language, writing (if stipulated on admission), and physical education requirements. The specific requirements as they apply to transfer students can be found in the transfer, visiting, and special student fact sheet, available from the Office of Admission. </P><P>In order to satisfy Colgate's residency requirement, transfer students are required to complete a minimum of four terms in academic residence at Colgate or on a Colgate study group. One term of an approved program may count toward the four semester requirement if the student does not exceed the maximum transfer credit limit indicated at the time of admission. </P><P>To count for major credit, a course taken elsewhere must be accepted by the appropriate Colgate department chair or program director. After enrolling at Colgate, transfer students are subject to the rules for transfer of credit under the section &quot;Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures,&quot; above. Transfer students must be enrolled at Colgate for at least six terms in order to be considered eligible for the university honor of valedictorian or salutatorian. </P><P>Requests for exceptions to these policies, for academic reasons only, must be supported in writing by the student's faculty adviser and administrative dean and submitted in writing to the Petitions Committee. </P></Part><Part><H2>Petitions for Exemptions </H2><P>Exemptions from graduation requirements are granted only by the Petitions Committee. Exemptions are approved for compelling academic reasons, or when a true hardship exists for the student through no fault of his or her own and when no other solution can be found. A petition for exemption should be developed with written support from the student's faculty adviser and administrative dean. </P><P>The Petitions Committee exists to hear petitions concerning all graduation requirements, including residency, the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, and the transfer credit limit. The committee does not review routine administrative requests from students, nor does it hear appeals concerning routine administrative decisions. </P></Part><Part><H2>Changes to Academic Records </H2><P>Academic records are sealed upon graduation, withdrawal, or permanent dismissal from Colgate University. No changes or additions to a student's undergraduate transcript will be permitted after this date. This includes, but is not limited to, grade changes, majors and minors, crosslisted courses, additional transfer credits, or additional courses taken at Colgate following graduation. </P></Part><Part><H2>Degree Conferral </H2><P>Colgate University confers degrees three times each year: at the May Commencement ceremony, on August 31 and on December 31. Degrees are conferred only upon students who have been certified by the university registrar to have met all requirements as described in this catalog and have met all financial obligations to the university. Students should refer to the &quot;Policy for Participating in the Commencement Ceremony&quot; in the Colgate Student Handbook. </P><P>Admission </P></Part><Part><H2>Applying to Colgate </H2><Sect><H2>The Applicant </H2><P>Colgate students are selected from applicants throughout the United States and around the world for the talent and intellect they can contribute to this university community. Academic achievement, reflecting a student's passion for, and engagement with, the learning process is important to the admission decision. Well-developed special interests, talents, and skills of all kinds can be a significant part of an admission application. In addition, Colgate is committed to attracting people who represent a wide range of intellectual perspectives as well as diverse economic, racial, religious, and geographic backgrounds. In the interest of bringing the best possible applicants to the university, Colgate sets no limits on the number of students admitted from a given secondary school. Colgate does not accept transfer, visiting, or special student applications for the undergraduate degree program from individuals who already possess a bachelor's degree. </P><P>All admission credentials, from the traditional secondary school record to letters of reference that cite intellectual and creative promise, are important. Personal character and qualities that both reflect and determine the productive use of a student's talent are also important to the admission decision. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Academic Record </H2><P>While other considerations are important, the academic record stands at the heart of any admission decision. An academic record is evaluated strictly in terms of course selection and achievement — that is, what a student did with what was available in the school attended. </P><P>Academic preparation is usually measured in Carnegie units, with one unit representing a full year's work in a major academic subject. Applicants with fewer than sixteen units are seldom admitted. The number and difficulty of courses chosen each year is an important measure of academic motivation and achievement. While each student's record is evaluated individually, the strongest applicants will have completed five major academic courses per year whenever possible. The senior year program is most important as it is the final preparation for college-level work. It should include at least four to five courses, including honors or advanced-level courses such as AP and IB courses. Colgate encourages students to pursue cumulative subjects, such as foreign languages and mathematics, through senior year. </P><P>The typical distribution of courses across disciplines for most accepted students is four years of English (especially composition and literature); four years of mathematics; four years of natural and physical sciences, with a lab; four years of social sciences; and at least three years of a foreign language. Colgate encourages elective coursework in the arts and strongly advises students to pursue honors and advanced-level courses in major areas of interest. </P><P>All applicants should follow these recommendations to the best of their ability. Scheduling problems or other circumstances that limit course selection should be conveyed in the additional information section of the application. Colgate evaluates applications based on the material available, but further information may be requested. Students are required to submit official documentation of high school degree completion or an acceptable equivalency certificate prior to enrolling at Colgate. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Recommendations </H2><P>Faculty and counselor recommendations are vital to the admission evaluation. Faculty recommendations must be written by teachers from core academic subjects in an applicant's 10th, 11th, or 12th grade year. Additional recommendations may also be useful if they are written by those who know an applicant well and have been in a position to evaluate the student's performance. Good judgment should be used in asking for additional recommendations; too many testimonials can make an application more difficult to interpret and process. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Standardized Testing </H2><P>Due to the disruption of teaching and standardized testing worldwide caused by COVID-19, Colgate has adopted a test-optional policy for all applicants through 2026. Transfer admission also remains test-optional. </P><P>When students choose to submit standardized test scores, this information provides additional data to demonstrate their overall achievement. When students choose not to submit standardized test scores, the Office of Admission evaluates achievement through all other elements of the application. Students will be at no disadvantage if they choose not to submit test scores. </P><P>Colgate will accept self-reported SAT or ACT scores for the purposes of application assessment. These scores must be verified by an official report prior to enrollment. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Financial Aid </H2><P>A domestic candidate requesting institutional need-based financial aid should complete the CSS PROFILE and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). International students and those who do not qualify for federal financial aid must submit only the CSS PROFILE. These forms are due by November 15 for Early Decision I candidates and by January 15 for Early Decision II and regular decision candidates. Transfer applicants should submit the CSS PROFILE and the FAFSA by the admission deadline of the term for which they are applying. Additional information may be obtained by contacting the Office of Financial Aid and at colgate.edu/financialaid. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>First-Year Admission </H2><Sect><H2>Application Procedures </H2><P>A candidate must complete and submit an application electronically. Applicants must submit the following required documents: the first-year application, the Mid-Year School report, and an Early Decision Agreement form for students applying under the Early Decision program. An optional Colgate writing supplement is available for students to expand upon their application materials electronically, in their applicant portal. The first-year application includes a School Report and Teacher Evaluation forms for the guidance counselor and two high school teachers to complete and submit. Applications for first-year admission must be submitted by January 15. Applications should be submitted online and require an electronic signature. More information about the application process can be found at colgate.edu/apply. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Application Fee </H2><P>Colgate requires a non-refundable fee of $60 from all candidates for admission. This fee may be waived upon certification of extreme financial hardship by the guidance counselor or by a school-certified College Board Fee Waiver, or for students who qualify for a fee waiver through the Common Application or Coalition Application. The application fee is also waived for non-US citizens. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Admission Notification </H2><P>Admission is granted only through notification by the Office of Admission. Early decision notifications are released in mid-December. Regular admission decisions are announced in late March. Financial aid candidates normally receive notice of any aid award with their acceptance letters. All accepted candidates wishing to enroll, other than Early Decision candidates (see below), must pay a non-refundable tuition deposit of $500 by May 1. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Postponed Enrollment </H2><P>While most students apply for admission with the intention of entering college the following fall, some accepted applicants may wish to postpone entrance to Colgate for a period of time. </P><P>To request deferred enrollment, students must first confirm their intent to enroll at Colgate by the applicable enrollment deadline and submit a $500 enrollment deposit to be eligible. </P><P>Students interested in requesting deferred admission must contact the Office of Admission. A request to defer admission form will then be added to the student's applicant portal, and this form must be submitted by June 1. The form includes space for a 500 word explanation for the purpose of the deferred enrollment request. Requests submitted after June 1 will not be accepted. Upon approval, the student will be required to pay an additional, non-refundable $500 deposit (total $1000 non-refundable deposit) to confirm and finalize their plans to defer their enrollment for one year. </P><P>Students admitted from Colgate's waiting list are not eligible to defer their enrollment. </P><P>Students applying for financial assistance must file the CSS PROFILE and FAFSA by January 15 of the year of intended enrollment. Candidates may expect notification of financial aid awards by early April of the spring before entrance. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement and Pre-matriculation Credit </H2><P>Information regarding advanced placement and pre-matriculation credit can be found in Academic Regulations. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Visiting Colgate </H2><P>Colgate encourages each prospective applicant to arrange a visit to campus, if possible. Morning and afternoon visit experiences include a brief session by an admission staff member and a student-led tour. </P><P>While interviews at Colgate are non-evaluative, they give applicants insights about Colgate and the admission selection process. </P><P>A prospective applicant who is not able to arrange a campus visit may schedule a virtual informational interview with a Colgate graduate. Additionally, opportunities to explore Colgate virtually, through virtual tours, information sessions, or remote interviews are available to prospective students. Admission staff members recognize that it may not always be possible to visit the campus before applying; still, it is important for the student to see the campus and meet the people who live, study, and work at Colgate before making a final college choice. </P><P>The admission staff is happy to assist applicants with arrangements for visits to campus. To ensure that records of campus visitors are as accurate as possible, pre-registration is required and visitors are encouraged to check in at the Hurwitz Admission Center in the James B. Colgate Administration Building upon arrival. If the office is closed, campus maps (digital version at colgate.edu/campusmap) and forms to request admission materials may be found in the visitor box outside the administration building. Prospective students can also connect with current Colgate students listed on the contact a current student web page at colgate.edu/admission-aid/contact-us/contact-current-student. </P></Part><Part><H2>Special Admission Programs </H2><Sect><H2>Early Decision </H2><P>An Early Decision application indicates that Colgate is a student's first choice and that the student will withdraw all other applications and attend Colgate if admitted. Not to be confused with early action, Early Decision at Colgate is binding; a signed Early Decision Agreement is required to complete an Early Decision application. The form must be signed by the student, a guidance counselor, and a parent or legal guardian. Students may not apply to more than one college as an Early Decision applicant. As Early Decision programs may vary slightly from college to college, please note the following options and requirements specific to Colgate's Early Decision program. </P><Sect><H2>Colgate offers two options for Early Decision: </H2><P>Early Decision Option I Candidates who apply by November 15, including completion of the Early Decision Agreement form, will receive decisions in mid-December. All required application documents should be postmarked no later than November 15. </P><P>Early Decision Option II Students who file regular decision applications by January 15 may change their status to Early Decision by filing an Early Decision Agreement form any time by February 1. Notification will occur in mid-February. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>For both Early Decision options </H2><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Applicants may be accepted, deferred for reconsideration under regular decision (with notification by late March), waitlisted, or denied admission. Students who are deferred under Option I will not be reconsidered under the Option II timetable. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Multiple or concurrent Early Decision applications to Colgate and any other colleges are not permitted. Early Decision candidates may file regular decision applications to other colleges, but once admitted to Colgate through Early Decision, all other applications must be withdrawn. Failure to do so may result in withdrawal of Colgate's offer of admission. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>Accepted Early Decision candidates must pay a non-refundable enrollment deposit of $500 within </LBody></LI></L><P>two weeks of acceptance. Standardized testing (SAT Reasoning Test or ACT Assessment) should be completed by early November for Option I candidates wishing to include these scores with their application. Option II candidates should complete testing by early December. Results of early November testing normally will be available from the testing services in time for Option I review if the scores are sent directly to Colgate, or a student may self report their testing upon receiving the results. </P><P>An Early Decision candidate applying for financial aid should file the CSS PROFILE and FAFSA, if applicable, by the Early Decision application deadline. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Early Admission </H2><P>Candidates with strong academic records, who receive the support of their secondary schools, may apply for admission and entrance prior to the final year of secondary school. Members of the admission staff are available to discuss this option with those who are interested. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Alumni Memorial Scholars </H2><P>The Alumni Memorial Scholars (AMS) program promotes academic and personal achievement through service, leadership, and wide-ranging intellectual inquiry. The program was established in 1945 in tribute to Colgate students and alumni who gave their lives during the First and Second World Wars. Today, it attracts students from across the country and around the world, young men and women whose academic credentials, character, creative talent, and community involvement indicate the potential for high-level engagement both inside and outside the classroom. All Colgate applicants are automatically considered for admission to AMS, so there is no program-specific application. Eligible students will be notified of their acceptance into the AMS program alongside an offer of admission to the university. </P><P>Each AMS student in good standing will have access to grant funds. These funds are intended to support independent research projects, internships, academic conference attendance, and other eligible academic programs. In recent years, they have enabled AMS students to visit dozens of countries across six continents. Grant funds may be used all at once or through several smaller requests, as long as the cumulative total does not exceed the maximum. Faculty and staff reviewers must approve all requests. </P><P>AMS students benefit from extraordinary access to Colgate's faculty, staff, and campus resources. Curricular requirements include a special AMS orientation prior to first-year orientation and research design preparation. First-years will ordinarily be housed in the same Residential Commons, and students in all class years are encouraged to attend group excursions, dinners, lectures, and presentations. Questions about AMS admissions should be sent directly to the admission office. For more information about the AMS program, please visit colgate.edu/ams. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) </H2><P>The Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) Scholars Program is the second oldest scholars program at Colgate, established in 1967 as the &quot;University Scholars Program.&quot; Candidates chosen to be part of the program are a highly select group of students who have demonstrated creativity and determination in the face of personal, economic, and social challenges; they have systematically sought the most demanding academic paths open to them and dedicated themselves to achieving success. The OUS Scholars Program is a vibrant community of scholars who have a history of making significant and meaningful impacts on campus. </P><P>The OUS curricular program begins with the Summer Institute, a rigorous five-week, pre-first-year summer session designed to begin the transition to college. With courses taught by a select group of Colgate's excellent faculty, the Summer Institute fosters close and lasting student-faculty relationships and enhances the academic preparedness of OUS scholars. Each OUS cohort lives and learns together in a supportive family-like environment throughout their first year. This tight-knit community is further developed over four years at Colgate through a series of planned events and experiences, setting the stage for students to take on a wide array of scholarly pursuits, leadership roles, and community engagements. </P><P>Eligibility for admission to Colgate through OUS is determined at the time of admission, and no separate application is necessary. Questions about OUS admissions should be sent directly to the admission office. For more information about the OUS program, visit colgate.edu/ous. See Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS) for additional information. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>QuestBridge </H2><P>Colgate is proud to partner with QuestBridge, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to connecting the most exceptional, low-income youth with leading institutions of higher education. </P><P>Colgate accepts the QuestBridge application from all QuestBridge finalists and non-finalists during all phases of the first-year application process. Students applying using the QuestBridge application will need to submit a QuestBridge Application Supplement through the Colgate applicant portal. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>International Student Admission </H2><P>International students whose first language is not English should sit for  a standardized English proficiency examination. Acceptable exams include: the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Duolingo English Test. Students studying at an English-medium secondary school can request a TOEFL waiver. </P><P>All admission documents should be written in English or accompanied by certified translations from a local consulate, embassy, or school official. </P><P>While Colgate welcomes international applicants, there is limited financial assistance for students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Canadian nationals are eligible for certain loan and work-study programs. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Admission by Transfer Application Procedures </H2><P>Colgate considers well-qualified candidates from other colleges who seek to enter with advanced standing for transfer admission. Admission may be granted in the fall or spring. The application deadline for fall admission is March 15; for spring, November 1. (Candidates are notified of the admission decision by early May and early December, respectively.) A non-refundable application fee of $60 must accompany each application. This fee may be waived upon certification of extreme financial hardship or if the student has received a waiver from the Common or Coalition Application. The application fee is also waived for students whose permanent mailing address is outside the United States. Colgate does not accept transfer, visiting, or special exemption student applications for the undergraduate program from individuals who already possess a bachelor's degree. </P><P>Competition for admission with advanced standing is rigorous. Most successful transfer applicants will have achieved at or above the 3.00 (B) grade level during their previous college experience. Participants in the </P><P>Visiting Student Program (see below) are eligible to apply for transfer to Colgate but should not expect to receive preferential treatment. </P><P>Application requirements: In addition to an application for transfer admission, Colgate reviews a full report of the candidate's secondary school record. Official transcripts of all completed college studies should be forwarded immediately. The College Official's Report should be completed and submitted by the dean of each college attended, and the Faculty Recommendation should be completed by a faculty member who has taught the student and who can comment on the student's academic potential. Additional information about applications can be found at colgate.edu/apply. </P><P>Transfer credit is generally allowed for courses taken through a strong liberal arts curriculum in which a grade of C or better has been earned. Credit toward graduation may be granted for no more than the equivalent of 16 Colgate course credits. After enrolling at Colgate, transfer students are subject to the rules for transferring of credit which apply to matriculated Colgate students. See Transfer Student Program. </P><P>Financial aid: Colgate is able to offer need-based institutional financial aid to transfer students. Institutional aid for transfer students is limited to the number of semesters needed to complete the degree requirements, as determined by the registrar, at the time of admission. </P><P>Transfer applicants anticipating a need for help with financing their education must submit the CSS PROFILE and the FAFSA by March 15 for the fall term and November 1 for the spring term. Additional information may be obtained in Financial Aid and at colgate.edu/financialaid. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>First-Year versus Transfer Admission for Students with Advanced Standing </H2><P>Colgate University defines a transfer applicant as someone who has enrolled in a degree-seeking program at a college or university. A student who possesses an associate's degree must normally apply to Colgate as a transfer student. </P><P>Students who have supplemented their high school curriculum with college-level classes in a non-degreeseeking program and students who have enrolled in a high school enrichment program associated with a college may have the option of applying to Colgate as either a first-year student or a transfer student. The benefits and limitations for these options are available at colgate.edu/admission-aid/apply/transfer-otherapplicants. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Visiting Student Program </H2><P>A student who wishes to attend Colgate for a term as a visiting student should complete an application form. Members of the Visiting Student Program are eligible to apply at a later date as transfer applicants, but it must be understood that no preference is given over other transfer applications; visiting students must meet the same standards as candidates not in attendance. Visiting students are not eligible to receive Colgate financial aid. </P><P>For students wishing to enroll, a non-refundable tuition deposit of $500 is required within two weeks of receipt of the official acceptance letter. </P><P>Students applying for admission as visiting students should visit the admission web pages: colgate.edu/admission-financial-aid. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Special Exemption Students </H2><P>The special exemption student option is almost invariably limited to a few area residents who, for personal reasons, wish to enroll for one term and for less than a full course load. Special exemption student status is an exception; the Colgate campus does not readily lend itself to part-time, non-residential students. Special exemption students must plan to commute, as there is no provision in the residential facilities for those taking less than a full academic program. Students must complete the application and pay a non-refundable application fee of $60. Special exemption students receive no extraordinary consideration or priority at registration. </P><P>For students wishing to enroll, a non-refundable tuition deposit of $500 is required within two weeks of receipt of the official acceptance letter. </P><P>Students applying for admission as special exemption students should visit the admission web pages: colgate.edu/admission-financial-aid. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Readmission </H2><P>Students who withdrew from or were withdrawn from Colgate may need to apply for readmission; however, readmission to Colgate is not guaranteed. Please be aware that to earn a Colgate degree, readmitted students will be subject to certain academic requirements in place at the time of readmission. Admission and financial aid application materials must be submitted by the application deadline. For spring admission the deadline is November 1, for fall it is March 15. Application requirements can be found at colgate.edu/admission-aid/apply/transfer-other-applicants. </P><P>Expenses </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Application Fee </H2><P>Colgate requires a nonrefundable fee of $60 from all candidates for admission. For information regarding fee waivers, see Application Fee. </P></Part><Part><H2>Charges </H2><P>A matriculated student is defined as a student who is working toward a Colgate degree. Matriculated students are assessed tuition and fees each semester at one-half of the annual rate. There is no additional tuition charged for course overloads (see Normal Course Loads), nor is there a reduction for an underload. </P><Table><TR><TH>A basic annual cost for 2022–2023 is </TH></TR><TR><TH>Tuition </TH><TD>$63,904 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Student Activity Fee </TH><TD>386 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Room (residence hall rate*) </TH><TD>7,778 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Meals (premier unlimited) </TH><TD>8,328 </TD></TR></Table><P>$ 80,396 </P><P>At least $3,204 should be allowed for books, supplies, normal travel, clothing, and incidentals. In addition, a one-time transcript fee of $50 is assessed for students attending Colgate for the first time. *Please note Colgate's Residency Requirement. Per Course Billing Matriculated students may request per course billing if: </P><Table><TR><TD>a. </TD><TD>they have completed eight semesters of coursework but must return for a ninth semester to </TD></TR><TR><TD/><TD>complete degree requirements or, </TD></TR><TR><TD>b. </TD><TD>they have completed all degree requirements (see Academic Regulations) but wish to enroll for an </TD></TR><TR><TD/><TD>additional semester to complete additional coursework. </TD></TR></Table><P>A student must seek approval for per course billing through the Office of the Registrar prior to registration for their final semester. The Office of the Registrar will notify pertinent campus offices of approved per course billing status. </P><P>Students granted per course billing will be billed at a rate of one-eighth of the annual tuition per course. Such students will also be charged on a pro rata basis for optional add-on fractional credit components as well as stand-alone fractional credit components. No tuition will be charged for required add-on fractional credit components, such as labs. (See Academic Credit) </P></Part><Part><H2>Visiting Students </H2><P>Visiting students are students who are not working toward a Colgate degree (non-matriculated). Charges vary depending on the type of Visiting Student but may include tuition, student activity fee, housing, meal plan, health insurance, transcript fee and/or shipping and visa fees. Please contact the Office of Student Accounts with questions. </P></Part><Part><H2>Insurance </H2><P>Health and Accident Insurance Colgate requires that all students have health and accident insurance coverage. Domestic* students are asked to enroll in or waive out (by providing timely proof of sufficient private coverage) of the Colgate health insurance plan each academic year. If a waiver is not submitted (at all, or on a timely basis) or not approved, students are enrolled automatically in the Colgate plan. All students enrolled in the Colgate plan are billed the annual premium for the Colgate Student Group Health Insurance on the fall semester invoice. </P><P>*Students who do not reside in the United States will automatically be enrolled in and billed for the Colgate University insurance plan. There is no option to waive out utilizing international health insurance plans. </P><P>Tuition and Fee Insurance A commercial insurance plan is available to safeguard tuition, student activity fee, and on-campus traditional residence hall room charges at 80 percent. Information regarding this plan is provided by the Office of Student Accounts. </P><P>Off-Campus Study - International Medical Insurance Coverage Students participating on a Colgate, faculty-led Study Group or an Extended Study Group will be enrolled in an international travel health policy for their time outside the United States. This coverage is expressly for routine and emergency healthcare (including hospitalization and mental health) outside the United States and includes other emergency-related benefits as well, with no deductible or co-pay and to cover most pre-existing conditions. The cost of this insurance is billed to students and that cost can be reviewed on the Colgate cost estimate sheets available on the Off-Campus Study web page (colgate.edu/OCS). Students will be instructed on the use of the insurance abroad prior to departure. Full details on the international travel medical insurance are available on the off-campus study website in the health and safety section. </P><P>Students studying internationally on a non-Colgate, approved program should receive insurance coverage through that approved program. In the event that the approved program does not offer insurance, or it does not meet Colgate University standards, students will be enrolled in the Colgate international health insurance and billed for that amount. </P><P>Colgate recommends that you continue your U.S.-based health insurance coverage (such as the Colgate Student Health Insurance Plan) while abroad so that when you return from your program, whether as scheduled or early, you can access U.S.-based treatment without interruption. If you waive your Colgate Student Health Insurance Plan, which we do not recommend, it is your responsibility to petition for re-enrollment in the plan by posted deadlines to ensure you do not have a gap in coverage. </P></Part><Part><H2>Students Studying Off Campus </H2><P>The university adopted a home school tuition policy effective for the Class of 2016 and beyond. Beginning with the 2014–2015 academic year students who study in any semester-length, Colgate-sponsored study group or an approved program sponsored by an outside organization will pay Colgate tuition when studying off campus. Additional fees for housing or other student cost estimates for individual off-campus study programs, along with complete information, are available on the Office of Off-Campus Study web page: http://colgate.edu/off-campusstudy. </P><P>Graduate Students </P><P>Information regarding tuition and fees for the graduate program can be found in Graduate Program. </P><P>Billing Schedule </P><Table><TR><TH>Semester </TH><TH>Billing Date </TH><TH>Payment Date </TH></TR><TR><TD>Fall </TD><TD>Early July </TD><TD>August 1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Spring </TD><TD>Early December </TD><TD>Mid-January </TD></TR></Table></Part><Part><H2>Payment of e-Bills </H2><P>Semester e-bills are issued to the student in early July for the fall term and early December for the spring term and are presented electronically via TouchNet, the student account system. This e-bill for tuition, fees, fines, and applicable charges for room and meals (including fraternity/sorority charges) must be paid by the payment date each semester. A student will not be permitted to continue in classes until the semester bill has been satisfied. For more information about billing/payment, please contact the Office of Student Accounts 315-228-4817, or see colgate.edu/studentaccounts. </P><P>The university offers two options for payment of tuition, fees, room, and meals: regular semester payments or payment plan installments. Payments may be made by cash, check, or bank wire transfer. Payments can also be made through TouchNet by e-check (no fee to payer) or credit card (fees apply). For information on loan programs, please contact the Office of Financial Aid, 315-228-7431, or see colgate.edu/financialaid. </P><P>Semester Payments Payment for tuition, fees, room and board is due in advance of each semester (see Billing Schedule above). Balances not paid by the deadline may be assessed a late fee of 1% of the outstanding balance or a minimum of $1.00 per month, and result in a financial hold (see nonpayment penalties below). </P><P>Payment Plan After bills are posted each semester, a TouchNet payment plan is available to divide semester fees into multiple payment installments for a small set-up fee. Monthly payments not received by installment deadlines may be subject to late charges and a financial hold. For more information, please contact the Office of Student Accounts, 315-228-4817, or see colgate.edu/studentaccounts. </P><P>Multiyear Prepayment The Tuition Prepayment Plan protects students from probable future tuition increases by offering the opportunity to prepay tuition for two or three years at the current rate of annual tuition set for the first year of participation in the plan. For more information, please contact the Office of Student Accounts, 315-228-4817, or see colgate.edu/studentaccounts. </P><P>Financial Aid Credits Colgate University must receive notification of expected grants and loans that students or parents wish to use as a payment resource. Anticipated earnings from campus employment may not be claimed as credit on the bill. Students or parents who anticipate difficulty in making payment should consult with the Office of Financial Aid well in advance of the scheduled date of payment. For more information, please contact the Office of Financial Aid, 315-228-7431 or finaid@colgate.edu. </P><P>Veterans Benefits In accordance with Title 38 US Code 3679 subsection (e), Colgate University adopts the following additional provisions for any students using U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Post 9/11 G.I. Bill (Chp. 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Chp. 31) benefits, while payment to the institution is pending from the VA, Colgate University will not: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Prevent nor delay the student's enrollment; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Assess a late penalty fee to the student; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Require the student to secure alternative or additional funding; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Deny the student access to any resources available to other students who have satisfied their tuition and fee bills to the institution, including but not limited to access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities. </LBody></LI></L><P>However, to qualify for this provision, such students may be required to: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Produce the Certificate of Eligibility by the first day of class; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Provide written request to be certified; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Provide additional information needed to properly certify the enrollment as described in other </LBody></LI></L><P>institutional policies.  To determine what is required, students must contact the Financial Aid Office at finaid@colgate.edu. </P><P>Nonpayment Penalties In any semester, students who fail to make satisfactory financial arrangements and enter courses without paying their semester bill will be required to leave the university and forfeit all deposits and any academic credit for that semester. </P><P>Through a student account financial hold, the university reserves the right to deny a student with an unpaid balance the opportunity to change current term course registrations or register for subsequent terms. Unpaid </P><P>balances will result in late fee assessment and, in due course, be turned over to an external collection agency. </P><P>Collections costs may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33 percent of the debt. All costs and expenses, including attorney's fees Colgate University incurs in such collection efforts, are added to the debt, and Colgate must be reimbursed for these costs by the debtor. </P></Part><Part><H2>Withdrawal and Refund Policy </H2><Sect><H2>On Campus </H2><P>Students must notify and receive permission from an administrative dean to withdraw officially or to take a leave of absence from Colgate. The official date of withdrawal is determined by the student's administrative dean. A student who officially withdraws or is granted a leave of absence from Colgate before 60 percent of the enrollment period has expired will receive adjusted charges for tuition, fees, room, and meals based on the percentage of time enrolled. Federal aid is refunded according to the Federal Title IV refund formula. State grants are refunded based on individual state regulations. After 60 percent of the enrollment period has passed, no adjustments will be made. This policy applies only to tuition, fees, room, and meal charges set by Colgate University. External scholarships will be adjusted based on the host program's regulations. A sample of this refund policy is available by contacting the Office of Financial Aid, 315-228-7431 or finaid@colgate.edu. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Off-Campus Study </H2><P>Effective for all 2020-2021 off-campus study programs (Colgate study groups; Extended Study Groups; or non-Colgate, Approved Programs), participants must pay a non-refundable $450 deposit at the time of commitment to their program. This deposit is applied to the overall program costs for the semester of participation or forfeited upon withdrawal from a program. Failure to pay the enrollment deposit will result in withdrawal from the program. If this payment presents a significant and demonstrable financial burden, a student accepted to a program may contact the Office of Off-Campus Study to submit a request to reduce the deposit, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis with input from the Office of Financial Aid. </P><P>Refunds of Colgate tuition for off-campus study are governed by the university's refund policy. Written notification of withdrawal must be dated and sent to the off-campus study email (offcampusstudy@colgate.edu).  E-mail notification from a Colgate e-mail address is acceptable. The postmark or date of e-mail serves as the effective date of withdrawal and the first day of class or the official program start date, whichever comes first, serves as the official start date for the purposes of the tuition refund calculation. </P><P>Additionally, students who withdraw following their commitment to the program will be charged for any nonrecoverable expenses including, but not limited to, non-refundable deposits, tuition from a partner university or organization, approved program charges, housing, transportation, visas, and/or shared group expenses. The extent of non-recoverable expenses vary by program and the date of withdrawal. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Leave of Absence Fees and Deposits </H2><P>Normally students attend Colgate for four consecutive years, fall and spring semesters. If it is necessary to interrupt this pattern, a student may request an academic or personal leave of absence. </P><P>Students must request an academic leave of absence from their administrative dean. Students approved for academic leaves will be charged a $500 administrative fee. This fee defrays costs incurred by Colgate for maintaining records and providing advising and other services to students while studying away from the university. </P><P>Students approved for personal leaves will be required to pay a $300 nonrefundable leave deposit. Provided that a student either returns for the scheduled semester or arranges an extension of the leave through his or her administrative dean, the deposit will be applied to the student's account in the semester of return to Colgate. </P><P>For a student who plans to be away on academic or personal leave, the fee or deposit is due within one month of the effective date of separation.

Prospective students will be considered for Colgate's need-based aid only when they apply for financial aid before an admission decision is made. Colgate is committed to meeting the demonstrated financial need of all admitted students, but the admission process is not need-blind. A limited number of Colgate grant awards are reserved each year for international students. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Eligibility </H2><P>The composition of a student's financial aid offer depends on several factors, including the extent of a student's financial need, eligibility for other aid resources, the availability of funds, and the date of application. Students who have applied for aid are automatically considered for all sources of financial aid, including federal, state, and institutional grants, loans, and employment. </P><P>The amount of aid varies with need, as demonstrated by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS ProfileTM. If a student's biological or adoptive parents are not married/partnered or living together, their information (and that of their spouse/partner/significant other) must be provided in separate CSS ProfileTM applications. The custodial parent (and their spouse, if remarried) must complete the FAFSA and the CSS ProfileTM. Additional documentation may be required after initial review.  </P></Part><Part><H2>Limitations </H2><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Colgate grant assistance is limited to a maximum of eight terms of enrollment for students who matriculate as first-year dependent students. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Students who first matriculate as dependent students will remain dependent for financial aid purposes through completion of their degree requirements.

Institutional grant aid will be awarded for 80 percent of tuition charges for all MAT students. Federal loans for US citizens or permanent residents are available to pay for the remaining tuition, student activity fee, living costs, and miscellaneous expenses. To determine eligibility for these federal loans, the applicant must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). In order to receive these federal loans a student must be enrolled at least half time. Financial aid is awarded one semester at a time and is dependent on the number of courses for which a student is registered each semester. Additional information about financial aid can be obtained by contacting the Office of Financial Aid, 315-228-7431 or colgate.edu/financialaid. </P></Part><Part><H2>Standard, Current Descriptions of Financial Aid Programs </H2><Sect><H2>New York State Programs </H2><P>Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) </P><P>Application Procedures: Applicants must apply annually to the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC), Albany, New York 12255. The application deadline for the current academic year is June 30. Students can begin the TAP application process by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available at fafsa.gov, or by completing the TAP application directly at hesc.ny.gov. </P><P>The Higher Education Services Corporation determines the applicant's eligibility and notifies the applicant indicating the amount of the grant. The postsecondary institution may defer payment on the basis of receipt of the award certificate. Actual payment is received after the school certifies student eligibility. </P><P>Selection of Recipients and Allocation of Awards: Tuition Assistance Program is an entitlement program for legal residents of New York State who are U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens. Other eligibility requirements are listed on the hesc.ny.gov website. The amount of the award is dependent on state legislation and can vary from year to year. </P><P>Students must be in good academic standing and enrolled full-time in courses that apply to their degree program to be eligible for their NYS award. Enrollment in three course credits constitutes full-time enrollment. Students may not be enrolled in repeat courses unless one of the following conditions apply: the student is repeating a failed course; the student is repeating a course in which the grade earned would ordinarily be passing but is a failure in a particular curriculum; the student is repeating a course where credit will be earned each time. </P><P>Recipients must not be in default of a loan guaranteed by the Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Under certain circumstances, defaulted borrowers can be reinstated for TAP eligibility by HESC.  </P><P>Undergraduate students may generally receive TAP awards for eight semesters of study. For semester limits on other awards, please visit the HESC website. </P><P>Continuation of Awards: Eligibility for renewal of New York State awards is dependent upon remaining in good academic standing. To maintain good academic standing, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree and pursuing the program of study. Note that satisfactory academic progress for New York State awards differ from federal satisfactory academic progress. Good academic standing is evaluated each semester in which a New York State award is received. </P><P>For pursuit of the program of study, students must enroll in a certain number of credit hours each semester and earn a specific number of credit hours for that semester. For the first year an award is received, a student must earn 50% of the minimum full-time course load for each term. For the second year an award is received, this is increased to 75%, and it increases to 100% in each term of the third year and subsequent semesters an award is received thereafter. Courses assigned grades of W, I, and NG are not considered to have been completed and do not count towards the pursuit of program requirement. </P><P>For satisfactory academic progress, students must maintain a specified grade point average and a pace leading to completion of his or her degree within a specified time period. The table below illustrates the specific requirements needed to receive TAP for satisfactory academic progress. The number of course credits that must be accrued depends on the number of TAP payments the student has received, not on the year of enrollment. Visit the NYS HESC website for full information. </P><P>The minimum standards of eligibility for undergraduate students are listed in the chart below: </P><Table><TR><TH>Standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress for Purpose of Determining Eligibility for State Student Aid Before being certified for this payment First Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh A student must have accrued at least this 0 2 4 7 10 13 17 many course credits With at least this grade 0 1.5 1.8 1.8 2.0 2.0 2.0point average </TH><TH>Eighth 21 2.0 </TH></TR></Table><P>Students who have received the equivalent of two or more full years of state-funded student financial aid must have and maintain a cumulative GPA of C (2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale) or better to be eligible for continued state-funded assistance. If a student is not in good academic standing, they may be able to appeal and request a waiver. Students not in good academic standing will be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid with further guidance and instructions. </P><P>Memorial Scholarships for Children and Spouses of Deceased Police Officers, Firefighters, Volunteer Firefighters, Peace Officers, and Emergency Medical Service Workers Regents Awards for Child of Deceased or Disabled Veteran (CV) Nursing Faculty Scholarship Veterans Tuition Awards New York State Scholarships for Academic Excellence World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship Military Service Recognition Scholarship State Aid to Native Americans New York State Math and Science Teaching Incentive Scholarship </P><P>Source and contact for programs described above: New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York 12255, 888-697-4372, hesc.com </P><P>Vocational Rehabilitation </P><P>Application Procedures: Persons with disabilities may obtain a list of local Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR) offices from: Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, New York State Education Department, 1 Commerce Plaza, 19th Floor, Albany, New York 12234. </P><P>Selection of Recipients and Allocation of Awards: Any person with a substantial employment disability, who can become employable within a reasonable period of time, may be eligible.

The client is required to maintain an average of C or better. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Federal Programs </H2><P>Standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress for continued Federal Student Aid Eligibility: Students must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements in order to remain eligible for federal (Title </P><P>IV) aid. Federal aid at Colgate includes the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Federal Work-Study Program, and the Federal Direct Loan Program. </P><P>In order to meet the minimum SAP standards, students must successfully complete 67% of the cumulative course credits that they attempt and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Total completed credits are calculated by dividing a student's total number of earned credits by a student's total number of attempted credits. Withdrawals, repetitions, and transfer credits (not including AP credits) are considered part of a student's attempted credit total.  For attempted credit(s) a student was unable to complete as a result of the COVID-19 qualifying emergency, these credits may be excluded from the SAP calculation, after it has been reasonably determined that the student's failure to complete those credits was the result of a COVID-19 related circumstance. Attempted credits not completed as a result of the COVID-19 qualifying emergency are taken into consideration at the point a student is not meeting SAP standards for a 2nd consecutive semester. </P><P>Students must also complete their programs within 150% of the normal program length. The maximum time frame is reached when the student has attempted more than one-and-one-half the number of course credit hours required to earn the degree. The maximum time-frame standard for transfer-students will consider only those course credit hours attempted at Colgate University, as well as those accepted for transfer credit by the university. </P><P>The Office of Financial Aid reviews the academic records of all students at the end of each semester. In addition, the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS) reviews the academic performance of all students each semester. SAP standards and CSAS standards are separate with each having their own requirements. </P><P>The first time a student does not meet SAP standards, the student will be placed in a Financial Aid Warning Status. This means the student is one term away from losing federal financial aid eligibility. The student is still eligible for financial aid and no appeal is necessary at this stage. The student is considered to have used their Warning Status for the term even if they did not receive federal (Title IV) aid for that term. </P><P>The second consecutive semester in which the student does not meet the SAP standards, the student will be required to take action in order to be eligible for federal aid. Federal financial aid eligibility may be regained by submitting a financial aid appeal with supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid and, if approved, federal financial aid will be reinstated and the student will be placed on a Financial Aid Probation Status for one semester. Students must achieve the minimum SAP standards by the end of their probationary period to remain eligible for federal aid. </P><P>Eligibility Requirements for Federal Student Aid: To apply for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) at FAFSA.gov. Students meeting the federal definition of a &quot;dependent student&quot; must report parent information on the FAFSA. Basic eligibility for federal student aid requires a student to be: a US citizen or an eligible non-citizen, enrolled at least half-time as a matriculated student in an eligible degree program (students can be enrolled less than half time for Pell Grants), students must not be in default or owe a refund for any Federal Title IV aid at any institution. The Office of Financial Aid confirms federal student aid eligibility. The amount offered and awarded is based on federal regulations in effect for each federal program. </P><P>Federal Pell Grants </P><P>The Federal Pell Grant is an entitlement program. A student's eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant is determined after the Financial Aid Office receives the results from a valid, processed FAFSA. The award amount is determined using the student's Federal Expected Family Contribution (EFC), the institution's cost of attendance, and the student's enrollment status (i.e. full time, part time). Federal Pell Grant awards are calculated based on a payment schedule approved annually by Congress. </P><P>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) </P><P>Eligible students are selected by the Office of Financial Aid. Awards are made to eligible students with the lowest federal EFC (Expected Family Contribution). </P><P>Federal Direct Loans </P><P>Federal Direct Loans are available to eligible undergraduate students who submit a valid processed FAFSA, regardless of family income. Borrowing limits are established by the U.S. Department of Education: $5,500 for first year students, $6,500 for second year students, and $7,500 for third and fourth year students. Graduate students may borrow up to $20,500 in a federal direct unsubsidized loan in an academic year. Undergraduate students may be eligible to borrow through the subsidized portion of the Federal Direct Loan program, in which no interest accrues while the student is enrolled at least half time. However, at least $2,000 of each of these amounts can be offered only through the unsubsidized portion of the program. </P><P>For federal student aid purposes, year in school is defined in the table below: </P><Table><TR><TH>First Year Second Year Third Year Fourth Year </TH><TH>0-5.99 course credits 6 - 13.99 course credits 14 - 21.99 course credits 22+ course credits </TH></TR></Table><P>The interest rate is established annually on July 1 and is a fixed rate for the life of the loan. Interest rates can be found at studentaid.ed.gov. In the unsubsidized portion of the program, interest accrues while the student is in school and may be paid or capitalized. In both portions of the program borrowers pay an origination fee of roughly 1%. Colgate will award as much subsidized loan as possible before awarding unsubsidized loan; however, in some cases the student is eligible for an unsubsidized loan only. </P><P>Repayment is deferred as long as the student remains enrolled at least half-time and for a six month grace period after he/she ceases to be enrolled at least a half-time. Payment of principal may also be deferred for certain categories of borrowers: (1) rehabilitation training; (2) unemployment; (3) economic hardship including the Peace Corps, and (4) during a period of active military service. After ceasing to be at least a half-time student, the borrower must make formal arrangements with the Department of Education's servicer to begin repayment. Depending on the amount of the loan, the minimum monthly payment will be $50 plus interest. Under unusual and extenuating circumstances the servicer, on request, may permit reduced payments. Repayment in whole or part may be made at any time without penalty. </P><P>Federal Direct PLUS Loan </P><P>To apply for this loan the borrower (who must be the parent of a dependent undergraduate student) initiates the application at studentaid.gov. To qualify for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, parent borrowers must not have an adverse credit history. Federal Student Aid will conduct a credit check on all Direct PLUS Loan applicants. The maximum loan that can be borrowed is the cost of attendance, minus other aid. Interest rates can be found at studentaid.gov. An origination fee is deducted upon disbursement by the Department of Education. Repayment begins 60 days after the full amount of the loan is disbursed. </P><P>Federal Work-Study Program </P><P>Work-study offered in a financial aid package may be earned by working in a part-time job on campus. Students typically work up to 8-10 hours per week, and cannot exceed 20 hours per week. Like any part-time job, students apply for available jobs and, once hired, submit timesheets to be paid for hours worked. To find a position, students must search the Student Employment section of the Colgate Portal. Available job openings are typically advertised on the Portal shortly before the start of each semester, along with instructions on how to apply. Assistance in finding a job is available from the Office of Student Employment, in the Division of Human Resources. </P><P>The amount of work-study offered in the financial aid package is only an approximation of what a student might earn during the academic year. Students are not obligated to earn the full amount, and Colgate will not penalize students or make adjustments if they learn less or more than the amount indicated in the financial aid package. </P><P>United States Bureau of Indian Affairs Aid to Native Americans </P><P>Higher Education Grants: The grant application is available from the education office of the tribe in which you are affiliated or possess membership. As the majority of federally recognized tribes are administering the grant program for their tribal members, call your tribe first. A tribal directory is located on the Department of the Interior's website. If your tribe is not administering the grant program, they can direct you to the nearest Office of Indian Education Programs Education Line Officer for the application (OMB No. 10760101), with instructions for completing and returning the application.

Closely aligned with Career Services, Thought Into Action, or TIA, is Colgate's entrepreneurship incubator. Students apply to engage in this year-long experience to develop skills in creativity and innovation while taking an idea into an action under close alumni mentorship. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Administrative Deans </H2><P>Colgate has a wide range of educational opportunities and the University assigns an administrative dean and a faculty academic adviser to provide guidance. </P><P>Working collaboratively with faculty to address needs holistically, administrative deans assist students with interpretation of the University's policies and procedures, as well as with questions pertaining to graduation requirements, leaves of absence, disciplinary matters, or emergencies or problems that may affect the quality of their academic work. Administrative deans are also available to assist with personal issues and may, at the request of the student, contact others in the Colgate community or elsewhere who may be better positioned to assist depending on the situation. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>First@Colgate </H2><P>Each year Colgate has the privilege of engaging with over 300 first-generation students that have chosen to pursue the opportunity for higher education at Colgate University. First@Colgate recognizes there may be unique challenges of being the first in one's family to graduate from a four-year institution, the first to earn an undergraduate degree from an American institution of higher education or perhaps the first to navigate a more traditional path toward a bachelor's degree. Committed to ensuring that students have the necessary resources, experiences and support to help them thrive at Colgate and beyond, First@Colgate provides a range of support for first-generation students. First@Colgate works in collaboration with campus partners to provide a variety of workshops and activities to ease the transition to college, to promote holistic wellbeing and to help first-generation students navigate college life.

Fraternities and sororities emphasize shared values and responsibilities, provide leadership opportunities, create life-long friendships, and allow members to live together in chapter houses owned by the University. Fraternities and sororities at Colgate are advised by professional staff members and receive guidance and support from their national headquarters as well as from their organizations' alumni advisers. Affiliation with these organizations may occur during the sophomore year. </P><P>Nearly all students who join a fraternity or sorority blend their involvement with other extracurricular and athletic activities, undergraduate research, and/or employment. </P><P>University policies regarding the recognition of fraternities and sororities conduct and membership can be found in the Colgate University Student Handbook. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Office of the Chaplains </H2><P>The college years are often a time when people shape and refine their fundamental life commitments. The Office of the Chaplains serves the Colgate community by cultivating strong, active faith communities and providing a dynamic, friendly, and supportive place in which students can seek answers to life's biggest questions. Students are encouraged to become the best versions of themselves, growing as people of integrity and commitment. It is the hope that, through participation in Colgate's religious communities, students will be brought to a greater understanding of and fidelity toward their own traditions. </P><P>Interfaith partnership is a strongly held value at Colgate. The interfaith dynamic recognizes substantive differences while also promoting respect and friendship across religious lines. Since college provides </P><P>significant opportunities to explore the ways in which others make sense of the world, the chaplaincy program promotes interfaith understanding and cooperation. </P><P>In embracing Colgate's motto, &quot;For God and Truth,&quot; the Office of the Chaplains works collaboratively with members of Colgate's faculty and staff to provide students with intellectually robust ways to integrate their religious and ethical commitments with their academic pursuits. </P><P>The Colgate Buddhist Community meets regularly for meditation. The organization collaborates with faculty and staff members and the group facilitates discussions on Buddhist thought and how to integrate the teachings into the lives of busy college students. </P><P>Colgate Christian Fellowship, the student-led chapter of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, maintains close relationships with churches in the area as well as the Colgate chaplains. The CCF sponsors weekly large-group meetings, regular small-group bible study, speakers, social events, and service projects. </P><P>The Colgate Newman Community is centered in the celebration of the Eucharist and seeks to create a faithful Catholic community on campus. It has four primary concerns: the worship of Jesus Christ, service and hospitality to the needy, education and spiritual formation, and building community through social activities. </P><P>The Hindu Student Association gives Hindu students an opportunity to observe their religion and provides the community a chance to learn more about Hinduism. In addition to regular prayer meetings, the HSA celebrates Hindu holidays, including organizing an annual Diwali festival with prayers and festivities. </P><P>The Colgate Jewish Union is a student-led organization that promotes Jewish religious, intellectual, and cultural life.

Worship is followed by dinner together. Music is rich and varied, preaching is biblically centered, and the Lord's Supper is celebrated regularly. Led by the Protestant Campus Minister, University Church life includes Bible study lunches, speakers, social events, and service projects. </P><P>The Secular Association of Skeptical Students seeks to alleviate the stigma against non-theists by promoting education, cooperation, community service, and active involvement in the interfaith movement at Colgate. Through philosophical discussion and guest speaker events, students have an opportunity to add their non-religious views to the interfaith discussion. </P><P>Colgate Christian Athletes supports students as they strive to live a Christian life at Colgate and for those who simply wish to inquire about the Christian faith. The group meets weekly, led by the Protestant Campus Minister. </P><P>Heretics Club is a lunchtime discussion series meant to elevate the conversation on campus about life's &quot;big questions.&quot; Through lectures and discussions among a diverse group of faculty, staff, and students, the series demonstrates that people of different religious convictions and worldviews can have meaningful and productive conversations about ultimate ideas.  </P><P>Weekly Reflections is a morning program featuring faculty, staff, and student speakers providing their thoughts on matters of personal significance. </P><P>Area congregations Students are also welcome to worship with area congregations. Please consult the Chaplains' Office for a complete list. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Student Services </H2><Sect><H2>Integrated Health and Wellness </H2><P>Student Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, Haven, and the Shaw Wellness Institute work closely together to deliver high quality health and wellness services to students. The collaboration between these departments offers holistic treatment and proactive measures in support of students' success at Colgate. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Student Health Services </H2><P>Student Health Services promotes healthy lifestyles through education and preventative medical care and provides diagnostic services and treatment of illness, injury, and acute and chronic medical conditions. Services include general medical treatment, including for minor injuries or surgery, sexual and reproductive health exams, testing, treatment, counseling, immunizations, and travel counseling.

Medical information is strictly confidential and may be released only with the written or verbal permission of the student. The medical record is not accessible to anyone other than the professional staff of Student Health Services and other Colgate medical professionals. In case of a serious medical emergency, a student's emergency contacts and the students administrative dean will be notified. </P><P>Medical Coverage After matriculation, any treatment undertaken while the student is off campus should be reported to the director of health services for continuity of care. Students with pre-existing health problems, injuries, or disabilities are invited to contact the director of health services to discuss their health needs and the availability of local or out-of-town services. Students are responsible for providing transportation to healthcare facilities outside of Colgate. </P><P>The university requires students to carry acceptable health and accident insurance. Colgate offers a health care plan that is available for all students (see Insurance). Many services provided at the Student Health Services are free of charge, with some services requiring additional costs.  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Counseling and Psychological Services </H2><P>Counseling and Psychological Services, located in Conant House, is staffed by psychologists, social workers, and mental health counselors representing a wide range of backgrounds, training, and professional interests. Students are offered counsel on a variety of psychological, interpersonal, and academic problems that may interfere with educational and/or personal development. </P><P>Information shared by students during counseling is held in the strictest confidence and will not be communicated by staff members to anyone unless requested by the student, required by law, or in order to avoid what appears to be a clear and imminent danger to the student or others.

The First and Second Year Experience and Community Development Office coordinates a robust and comprehensive complement of programs to support students transitioning into and becoming established members of the university community.  Throughout the first and second years at Colgate students will have the opportunity to heighten their sense of belonging, navigate campus resources, foster their intellectual curiosity, engage with staff and faculty, prioritize well-being, and create lifelong friendships. </P></Part><Part><H2>Residential Life </H2><P>A four year residential liberal arts education furthers civic engagement, respect for all aspects of diversity and inclusion, belonging in community, intellectual engagement, and living with integrity. </P><P>Colgate's residential environment supports students' formal education through experiential and co-curricular experiences, centering the student as an author and co-constructor of learning. The space provided for residential students to grow and learn are rooted in the ideas of critical thought and civic discourse steeped in academic tradition. The Office of Residential Life strives to create experiences that will foster student personal development and cognitive growth as a result of living in our residential community. </P><P>The communities within student living areas offer a variety of experiences. These experiences include: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Residential Commons - Each of the four Commons is a community within which students live for their first two years, and with which they continue to affiliate throughout their four years on campus. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Sophomore residential seminars — academic courses with a housing and international travel component </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Theme Housing - communities with a specified scholarly or personal interests. Engagement and experiential learning in the community is centered on the theme of the community. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Interest Groups - students can form groups around a topic in order to further learn skills, center academic thought, or engage in civic discourse around a common topic. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Opportunities to live in community as part of a fraternity or sorority </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Residences offering junior and senior students more independence </LBody></LI></L><P>Community leaders live in residence and assist the Office of Residential Life with the fulfillment of the departmental mission. Community Leaders foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for all of our residential students. They develop one-on-one relationships with their residents and help them make connections with fellow peers, faculty, and staff on Colgate's campus. Community Leaders create a supportive, engaging environment for all residents with attentiveness to safety and security. They serve as role models, are effective listeners and excellent resources, demonstrate pride in their communities, and care for their residents. </P><P>Colgate provides vibrant and diverse options for campus living, including traditional residence halls, thematic communities, townhouses, and apartment complexes. The university housing agreement is for a period of one academic year. Students are expected to live on-campus for all four years of their undergraduate experience. A very limited number of seniors are granted approval to live in private off-campus housing. </P><P>The Office of Residential Life is committed to student learning and growth and to promoting a purposeful and inclusive environment through shared expectations. This is accomplished by promoting healthy, safe communities where individual members are valued and respected; fostering personal growth and success; and challenging and supporting students in making meaningful and responsible contributions to society. The department is managed by the Director of Residential Life and is staffed by residential life professionals who provide guidance and support to all students. </P><P>Each living community on campus is overseen by an Area Director for Residential Life who is responsible for its overall operation, including staff and resource management, community development, and administrative functions. The Community Leaders (student staff members) serve as mentors and sources of information to assist students in making their Colgate experience as fulfilling as possible. </P><Sect><H2>Residential Commons </H2><P>The Residential Commons program at Colgate seeks to infuse intellectual engagement and community development into the residential experience. All first and second-year students live in one of four Residential Commons, each with its own unique personality and characteristics, under the leadership of faculty and staff directors and affiliated faculty members. Upper-level students maintain an affiliation with their respective Commons for life, whether formally, by continuing to live within the Residential Commons or its social house, or informally through mentoring opportunities and participation in events and programs. Through the Residential Commons program, Residential Life and the Dean of the College Division in partnership with faculty and the Dean of the Faculty Division, strive to provide students with a home away from home that is rich with opportunities for intellectual and social engagement and reflects the academic rigor of the classroom and the sense of belonging students feel across the University. </P><P>The residential facilities that comprise each Residential Commons are as follows:  Brown Commons: Andrews, Burke, East, Gate House, 100 Hamilton Street, and 110 Broad Street; Ciccone Commons: Curtis, Drake, and 102 Broad Street; Hancock Commons: Bryan Complex, 113 Broad Street, and 94 Broad Street; Dart Colegrove Commons: Pinchin, Stillman, West, 76 Broad Street, and 104 Broad Street. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Sophomore Residential Seminars </H2><P>Sophomore Residential Seminars (SRS) are a unique and immersive living-learning experience during the sophomore year. SRS students have opportunities to build deep academic communities based on common interests and sustained interactions with SRS faculty members and guest speakers in their living communities. Students selected for the SRS program live among members of their class and reside together in a larger Residential Commons, enriching the intellectual engagement within that community. The capstone experience is a 7-10 day trip in January or May that extends the academic experience out of the classroom and into the real world. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Theme Housing </H2><P>One of the attractive features of Residential Life at Colgate is the opportunity to live in small, self-governed communities in which students have specified scholarly or personal interests. Engagement and experiential learning in the community is centered on the theme of the community. Some of these communities have strong links to academic departments and faculty mentors. Colgate also offers opportunities for small groups of students interested in living together. All provide students with opportunities for growth, leadership, and community. </P><P>Theme housing offers diverse housing options such as La Casa, Afrikan Diaspora, The Loj, Creative Arts Society, Interfaith, Pink House, and Asia Interest House. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Fraternities and Sororities </H2><P>The buildings that house the eight recognized fraternity and sorority chapters are owned by the University, and their residents are held to the same high standards as students residing in other living units. Each residential facility is managed by the Office of Residential Life and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Advising. Seven of the facilities employ chefs that provide meals to all chapter members. Each chapter has a chapter meal plan that is a requirement of organizational membership. Juniors and seniors of each organization are eligible to live in the chapter facility. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>University Apartments and Townhouses </H2><P>Colgate manages and maintains three apartment complexes (Newell, Parker, and University Court) and a townhouse complex that accommodate juniors and seniors. The units are furnished and have complete kitchens. While first-year and sophomore students are required to be on a Colgate meal plan, junior and senior residents, who reside in these apartments, typically do their own cooking, although they are also welcome to purchase dining hall meal plans. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Meal Plans </H2><P>First-year and sophomore students, as well as any upper-level student living in a traditional residence hall, are required to be on the most comprehensive meal plan offered. Juniors and seniors not living in traditional residence halls may choose from a variety of meal plan options, or can opt out of a meal plan altogether. All meal plans provide flexibility for use in any of the dining facilities, at a wide variety of times. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Off-Campus Housing </H2><P>Consistent with its four-year approach to residential education, Colgate students are required to live on-campus for all four years. Colgate does allow a small number, approximately 30% of the senior class, to live in private off-campus apartments and other housing units. The option to live independently off campus provides students with the opportunity to develop the skills needed to manage a household, live as part of a broader community, and to accept the responsibilities attendant to this privilege. The experiences that students gather through negotiating a lease, paying rent, managing routine expenses, cooking for themselves, and living among neighbors of varied ages and backgrounds can be invaluable in preparing them for life after college. </P><P>Because the residential campus experience is a core component of Colgate's educational model, the University limits the number of students allowed to live off campus. Seniors who wish to live off campus must apply to the Office of Residential Life, which after a conduct eligibility review, will facilitate a lottery process to determine the recipients of the small number of off-campus spaces available. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>University Governance </H2><Sect><H2>The University Governance System </H2><P>An Academic Affairs Board and a Student Affairs Board, both of which are composed of faculty members, students, and administrators, participate in the development of policies concerning academic and extracurricular life. In addition, several liaison committees that report to the faculty and Student Senate act in an advisory capacity to members of the president's cabinet. </P><P>The faculty and the Student Senate may review decisions of the Academic and Student Affairs Boards, hear regular reports from the liaison committees that affect their principal areas of interest, and also recommend that the boards and committees act in any area under their jurisdiction. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>University Code of Student Conduct </H2><P>Students at Colgate University accept membership in an academic community dedicated to the pursuit of intellectual and personal growth. As a liberal arts institution, Colgate seeks to provide opportunities for students, both inside and outside the classroom, to develop critical thinking, integrity, judgment, a common experience of learning, and appreciation of cultural and ethnic diversity, as well as the social and ethical values necessary for community life. </P><P>Colgate expects that its students will not lie, steal, cheat, or engage in dishonest or unlawful behavior, including behavior that damages University property, the personal property of another individual, public property, or any other behavior that inflicts physical or emotional harm on oneself, another person, or the community. In addition, students will not engage in behaviors that impede other students' opportunity to learn, or a faculty member's ability to teach, or that interferes with the academic objectives of the University. Colgate students must abide by all University policies and procedures and comply with directions of University officials acting in performance of their duties. </P><P>The System of University Standards and Student Conduct resolves possible violations of the University Code of Student Conduct by matriculated or enrolled Colgate students on or off campus. It is not a substitute for any civil or criminal court proceedings. Students on campus, as well as off campus, are subject to federal, state, and local laws. </P><P>As part of its disciplinary structure, Colgate maintains a University Student Conduct Board composed of students, faculty members, and administrators. It hears cases involving violations of the University Code of Student Conduct. </P><P>The procedures and rules for student discipline are published in the Colgate Student Handbook. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Academic Honor Code </H2><P>The Colgate Student Handbook outlines Colgate's standards of academic integrity and the Academic Honor Code. The handbook defines academic dishonesty and outlines how cases of suspected academic dishonesty are reported, investigated, and resolved. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Campus Safety </H2><P>The Colgate University Campus Safety Department is committed to maintaining the safety and security of the campus community in a caring, respectful, and professional manner. The department actively builds community with students on campus while taking seriously its charge to keep the entire university community, including visitors, safe by providing a supportive, and secure environment. </P><P>Campus Safety serves the Colgate community in numerous ways that include processing Gate cards, access control, building security, event security and traffic control, ride assist program, safety escorts, vehicle registration for parking permits and disabled vehicle assistance. All members of the Colgate community are responsible for promptly reporting crimes and fires to the Campus Safety Department by dialing 315-228-7911. Campus Safety is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Campus Crime Reporting and Statistics </H2><P>The Campus Safety Department will provide upon request a copy of Colgate's Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. This report includes statistics as reported to the United States Department of Education for the previous three years concerning reported: </P><P>1. crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by Colgate University; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from, the campus and </P><P>2. fires that occurred in student housing facilities. The report also includes institutional policies concerning campus security and fire safety, such as policies concerning sexual assault, life safety systems, and other related matters. To obtain a copy contact Brittany Fuller, Campus Safety Compliance Manager, 315-228-7333, or via e-mail at bfuller1@colgate.edu. You may also access the report at: colgate.edu/campussafety. </P><P>Crime and fire statistics for all colleges and universities are available for review at the United States Department of Education's website: ope.ed.gov/security/. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Emergency Management </H2><P>Colgate's Emergency Management program is designed to maximize emergency preparedness, fortify community safety, preserve university property, restore normal operations in the event of an emergency, and provide responsive communications to all appropriate parties. This program is also intended to ensure full compliance with applicable local, state, and federal life safety regulations and cooperation with relevant public agencies charged with disaster control. </P><P>The program includes general campus safety advisories; emergency communication systems; locations of all emergency telephones, automated external defibrillators and aid stations; fire alarm inspection and testing, Keltron fire alarm supervising station, and the Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP provides the basic framework for the university's emergency response and incident command. It applies to all units of the university and may be activated in the event of campus, local, regional, or national emergencies. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is composed of cross divisional staff and supports the Incident Commander (IC) under the direction of the Executive Group (EG) to respond to emergencies. </P><P>Environmental Health and Safety </P><P>Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) provides safety and advisory services to the entire campus community. EHS supports a safe learning, living, and working environment at Colgate University by promoting health, safety, and environmental protection through the development of comprehensive programs for training and consultation, risk evaluation and mitigation, emergency response, hazardous materials management, and regulatory compliance. </P><P>EHS is committed to supporting a community where safety is valued and is seamlessly integrated into the work in our offices, shops, laboratories, and classrooms. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Athletics and Recreation </H2><P>The Division of Physical Education, Recreation, and Athletics offers a stimulating and carefully planned variety of individual and team activities for the experienced, as well as inexperienced, participant. While Colgate's varsity teams compete against some of the strongest teams in the nation, the intramural and club sports programs offer both competitive and noncompetitive recreational and instructional opportunities in extremely broad-based programs. </P><P>The campus governance system, through the Committee on Athletics, provides for faculty and student input into the varied programs of the Division of Physical Education, Recreation, and Athletics. The committee acts as an advisory body to the director of the division. Committee reports may go on to the Academic Affairs Board, faculty, or Student Senate. </P><Sect><H2>Intercollegiate Athletics </H2><P>Scope Colgate is a member of NCAA Division I and proud of its intercollegiate athletic traditions. The University has played an active and distinguished role in intercollegiate athletics since 1886 and currently fields teams in the following sports for men and women: basketball, cross country, ice hockey, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track and field; football and golf for men; and field hockey, softball, and volleyball for women. All teams compete in the Patriot League, with the exception of men's and women's ice hockey, which are members of the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and men's rowing, which is a member of the International Rowing Association. </P><P>Athletics Awards A varsity or a participation award is granted based on the number of years an athlete is a member of a varsity team. </P><P>The division recognizes outstanding scholar athletes through the Patriot League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference. See also Honors and Awards: Athletics for information about Colgate awards for scholar athletes. </P><P>Athletics Managers Students who enjoy affiliation with sports but are not members of varsity teams can pursue their interests in athletics by serving as managers. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Other Athletics Activities </H2><P>Club Sports provide additional opportunities for involvement in sports, many of which are not normally offered through the intercollegiate varsity program. Competition is generally on a higher level than intramural sports, yet not as formal or intense as that at the varsity level. </P><P>The clubs are headed by student officers, and most are student coached. Although the University subsidizes these clubs, most require membership dues to help defray costs. </P><P>The following clubs are active at this time: badminton, baseball, women's basketball, curling, cycling, equestrian (English and Western), fencing, field hockey, figure skating, golf, ice hockey, indoor rock climbing, juggling, lacrosse, martial arts (aikido, American karate, and tae kwon do), rugby, running, sailing, ski racing, soccer, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, triathlon, ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, and water polo. </P><P>Intramural Sports at Colgate have a rich tradition. Many activities are offered throughout the academic year, ranging from team sports such as, basketball, billiards, broomball, dodgeball, flag football, ice hockey, indoor soccer, soccer, and softball, to individual or dual activities such as trap shooting and bowling. </P><P>In the team sports, round-robin competition is established within leagues, culminating in all-university championship playoffs for the top teams. In the individual and dual sports, either elimination tournaments or championship meets determine all-university champions. Fees are charged for bowling and trap shooting. </P><P>Informal Recreation Informal &quot;drop-in&quot; recreational time is made available so that students can participate at their leisure. Except for physical education classes, intercollegiate athletic practice times, and formal intramural time, most facilities are scheduled for open recreation. Popular activities include basketball, ice skating, racquetball, squash, swimming, tennis, and fitness training. </P><P>Fitness Fitness and wellness programming are in high demand at the state-of-the-art Trudy Fitness Center.

In addition, Colgate Recreation offers fitness center orientations, workshops on various health and fitness topics and personal training services. Personal training is a fee-based service and all Colgate Personal Trainers are certified professionals by an accredited organization. </P><P>Outdoor Education The mission of Colgate's Outdoor Education Program is to provide the community with experiential opportunities that emphasize safety, environmental awareness, and technical skills, while promoting personal growth and group development through rediscovery of the natural world.

These credits will be applied toward the satisfaction of the degree requirements only if relevant to the approved plan of study and the grade is B or better. Requests for transfer credit should be made to the  program director at the time of application to a program. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Additional Opportunities for Graduate Students </H2><P>Graduate students are sometimes able to assist in science laboratories or assist with Colgate's athletic teams. </P><P>Any graduate student who is able to live on campus during the fall and spring terms is eligible to be considered as a community leader. Interviews for community leaders are held in February for the following fall term. </P><P>Some of these opportunities require an extension of the program length and others require special scheduling. Applicants who wish to pursue any of these options should indicate interest at the time of application. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Employment Service for Graduates </H2><P>Colgate University maintains a career planning and placement service for all of its graduates. (See Career Services and Postgraduate Planning for a full description.) In addition, the educational studies department maintains close contact with local and regional schools for job opportunities. Employment prospects for students who complete the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Program continue to be strong. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>MAT Curriculum and Degree Requirements </H2><P>The MAT program provides advanced coursework in a selected discipline and in education, leading to secondary school teaching certification. In keeping with the character of our educational studies department, this program emphasizes that what and how we teach in public schools is connected with the struggle for global peace and social and environmental sustainability and justice. Subject areas in which certification is offered include childhood education, English, mathematics, history, and natural science (biology, chemistry, earth science, or physics). The program is based on the premise that a prospective teacher should have a liberal education, thorough knowledge of his or her chosen discipline, a mastery of educational theory and practice, and a complex understanding of social institutions. A prospective teacher also needs habits of mind that include a willingness to move beyond personal comfort, and a desire to be challenged in all aspects of learning. MAT students work closely with departments to integrate increased knowledge in their disciplines with field experience in education which includes significant observation time and a full term of student teaching. </P><P>To receive the MAT degree, students complete between four and eight courses in educational studies, and at least three courses in their major depending on previous experience and coursework, a special project or thesis, and workshops on child abuse and violence prevention. Fingerprinting is also required by the State of New York. Students who are already certified at the secondary level may substitute two other education courses. </P><P>MAT students should enroll in educational studies courses at the 500 level. (See Educational Studies.) Courses taken by MAT students for degree credit in their disciplines of specialization will be assigned 500level numbers consecutively beginning with 591. </P><P>For each undergraduate course taken toward the MAT degree, a student must submit a Graduate Credit Agreement form prior to registration. This form is available online or from the registrar's office. </P><P>To be admitted to the program, a student must have a strong academic background relevant to their area of certification, usually the equivalent of an undergraduate major. A background in the social, cultural, and developmental foundations of education is also desirable, but this background can be acquired in the program. In addition, two semesters of a foreign language or the equivalent is recommended. These courses may be transferred from another institution and must be approved by the educational studies department. Alternatively, the prerequisite courses may be part of the degree program. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Academic Standards </H2><P>Students must maintain a grade point average of B to continue in good standing as master's degree candidates. To qualify for a degree, a student must earn a minimum B– average in all content- and pedagogy-related courses. In the various teaching degree programs, one-half of the work is typically done in an area of specialization, and a student must receive a grade of B– or higher in the courses in the area of specialization and in education courses. </P><P>Degrees &quot;with distinction&quot; are awarded to students who maintain an A– average in both the areas of specialization and education courses, and whose special projects or theses are considered by the thesis and special project supervisor to be of high quality. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>MAT Requirements in Academic Fields </H2><P>Each MAT candidate is normally required to take a minimum of three classes in his or her chosen academic field, consulting with his or her advisers both in the educational studies department and in the field of specialization to select appropriate courses that meet State of New York certification requirements. </P></Sect></Part><Part><H2>Masters of Arts in an Academic Subject </H2><P>Programs leading to the Master of Arts (MA) degree can occasionally be arranged in English, geology, philosophy, psychology, and religion. Candidates for the MA degree typically register for advanced undergraduate courses and seminars, with extra assignments for graduate credit. Graduate-level independent study courses are arranged with faculty in appropriate departments. </P><P>Except as noted below, all requirements and policies for MA candidates are identical to those for MAT candidates. Please refer to the MAT policies described above. </P><Sect><H2>Admission </H2><P>Candidates for admission to MA programs should write directly to the department of interest and should submit applications to the chair of the appropriate department. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Degree Requirements </H2><P>To earn the MA degree, a candidate must successfully complete a minimum of seven courses approved for graduate credit, write a thesis, and pass an oral examination on the thesis. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Program Completion </H2><P>Requirements for the MA degree must be completed within five years of matriculating in the program of study. Students who do not complete the program within the five-year limit must submit a petition for readmission to the associate dean of the faculty. </P><P>Financial Assistance </P><P>Is available for US citizens or permanent residents through the Federal Direct loan program. Financial aid applicants must submit the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). No institutional grant aid is available. </P><P>Liberal Arts Core Curriculum </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Liberal Arts Core Curriculum </H2><P>Director Kaimal </P><P>As the heart of Colgate's academic program, the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum (LACC) is a common intellectual project for the University, exposing students to diverse fields of study and modes of intellectual and creative inquiry across the curriculum and furthering Colgate's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. </P><P>A great institution is a diverse institution. To foster deep understanding in a complex, rapidly changing world with a diversity of peoples and perspectives, this curriculum asks students and faculty to grapple with questions that shape knowledge, experience, and practice across time and space as well as across divisional and disciplinary boundaries. As a liberal arts college, Colgate strives to convey to students the value of a variety of skills and a willingness to examine one's own experience and conditions from a variety of perspectives as well as to learn of contexts different from one's own. Through these practices, this Core encourages lifelong learning, thoughtful citizenship, and inclusivity. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>First-Year Seminars and the Living and Learning Workshop </H2><P>Director Karn </P><P>First-year students must enroll in an FSEM and the Living and Learning Workshop. The FSEM course may be drawn from many parts of the academic curriculum, including Core Component courses and entry-level courses in departments or programs. FSEMs that are departmental or program courses may carry any of the Area of Inquiry tags or Liberal Arts Practices tags except for the Process of Writing. </P><P>First-year seminars (FSEMs) and the Living and Learning Workshop are designed to introduce students to a variety of liberal arts topics, skills, and ways of learning. These include academic integrity, effective writing practices, information literacy, and institutional resources available to support intellectual engagement, personal growth, and well-being. The FSEM program emphasizes all aspects of the learning process, both in and out of the traditional classroom setting. Each FSEM cohort connects directly with one of the living and learning communities that constitute the Residential Commons program. The merging of the FSEM course, the Living and Learning Workshop, and the Residential Commons community provides a unique and focused opportunity for students to obtain a breadth of college-level experience and academic perspectives in a supportive environment. FSEM courses will normally earn credit within the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum as one of the Core Components, Liberal Arts Practices, or Areas of Inquiry. </P><P>The Living and Learning Workshop curriculum is developed as a partnership between staff and faculty. Individual workshops will address pressing social and student-life issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusivity, sexual violence, drug and alcohol abuse, mental and physical well-being, and civic engagement. Workshop meetings will also encourage academic and career preparation with a focus on fundamental research skills, effective writing, and career exploration. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Components: </H2><P>Foundational to Colgate's Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, the three components together embody the goals of a liberal arts education. They encourage students to call assumptions into question, to push beyond the limits of their experience, and to examine structures and systems in which we operate. These courses are expected to be challenging. They stand outside departments and programs, asking students and faculty to move across disciplinary boundaries. </P><P>1. Core Communities </P><P>Director Ballve </P><P>Core Communities courses foreground multidisciplinary engagement with the historical and contemporary factors influencing peoples' experiences of living in community.  Courses in this component ask students to examine community dynamics across time and space. Each course in this component addresses the ways in which peoples' lives unfold in social and material worlds that have been shaped and reshaped by global, transregional, and historical phenomena, such as slavery, colonialism, capitalism, industrialization, and new technologies.  These courses also recognize that the gains and losses catalyzed by such forces are not equally shared; rather, communities are marked by legacies of difference. Core Communities courses emphasize three pedagogical goals: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Gain academic and empathetic understanding of the experience of people in communities that may be different from one's own </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Understand the cultural, ethical, economic, and political significance of living in community </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Explain dynamics of power that shape patterns of inclusion and exclusion within a  community, with attention to the histories and contemporary implications of those patterns </LBody></LI></L><P>The communities explored in this component take a variety of shapes. They may be: 1) nations and societies, 2) geographic regions, 3) historical communities, 4) transregional or transnational communities, 5) communities of practice, or 6) communities emerging through things, technologies, or markets. </P><P>2. Core Conversations </P><P>Director Worley </P><P>Conversation is central to Colgate's educational mission. Conversation requires active listening – paying attention to what others say and how they say it. Conversation equally requires actively responding to others – opening one's mind to theirs through the expression of one's own thoughts and feelings. Conversation thus presupposes mutual respect, whether with someone in the room or someone hundreds of years in the past, and it knits its participants into a community. Engaging with a book, film, song, or other form of creative expression is also a conversation, in which people open themselves to what the work has to say and in exchange have a say in the work's legacy. </P><P>This course employs a set of five common texts – selected by the faculty teaching the course –  to promote wide-ranging conversations, anchored in the past and directed toward the present.  Core Conversations defines the term &quot;text&quot; expansively, not limiting it to written work but encompassing diverse modes of intellectual and creative expression. As such, the common texts for this course are drawn. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>from multiple disciplines, </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>from pre-modern and modern worlds, </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>and from Western and non-Western cultures. Instructors are encouraged to add other materials in order to enhance the themes of the course. </LBody></LI></L><P>3. Core Sciences </P><P>Director Van Wynsberghe </P><P>The present world has been fundamentally shaped by the products of the scientific endeavor, from the nearly instant connectivity of the globe to our ability to fight pandemics at the genetic level.  A scientifically literate populace is needed in order to address many of our most important issues. For such literacy, it is necessary to understand the processes and practices behind the development of scientific knowledge. The courses in Core Sciences are designed to explore the complexities of creating scientific knowledge and applying it to broader contexts in wide-ranging ways. As these courses explore the cultural and social impacts of science, they also consider forces that influence the production, application or reception of scientific knowledge. Thus, Core Sciences courses are unified around two common goals: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>understanding the scientific process and the nature of scientific knowledge </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>connecting science to society – in discussions of the broader impacts of science, instructors should address histories, inequities, or social differences within the frame of the course topic Core Sciences courses engage students in the scientific process, with a focus on helping them develop an understanding of the ways that observations and experiments lead to empirically based theories about physical, human, technological, and natural worlds. Component courses offer many pathways for students to explore the nature of scientific knowledge. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>The Liberal Arts Practices </H2><P>Director Chianese </P><P>A liberal arts education is designed to free the mind to think critically and independently, abilities which are developed through exposure to a wide range of subjects and ideas. Courses fulfilling Liberal Arts Practices requirements develop important skills and competencies: comprehending action that matters in the face of urgent world questions, attention to the process of writing, familiarity with quantitative and algorithmic reasoning, insight into the ways languages work, and the capacity to practice and interpret visual, literary, and performing arts. </P><P>Courses tagged with a Liberal Arts Practice belong to specific departments or programs, may be taught at any level, and may count toward a student's major or minor. </P><P>Liberal Arts Practices can be completed via transfer credit, pursuant to Colgate's other transfer credit policies. However, these courses play an integral part of the guided development that takes place during a college education. As such, they cannot be exempted based on placement procedures or demonstrated proficiency. The Liberal Arts Practices cannot be fulfilled by Advanced Placement credits or other prematriculation credit. Neither can these requirements be fulfilled by courses taken during a winter/January intersession term, unless under exceptional circumstances and with permission of the department chair, division director, and associate dean of the faculty. </P><P>Courses can carry up to two tags from the five Liberal Arts Practices. Tags apply to courses, regardless of the individual instructors teaching sections. Syllabi for tagged courses will include one or two sentences explaining how the course fulfills the goals of the designated Liberal Arts Practice. The approval of Liberal Arts Practice tags will be overseen by the relevant Department Chair or Program Director, Division Director, and the Curriculum Committee. </P><L><LI><Lbl>a. </Lbl><LBody>Confronting Collective Challenges Courses in this Practice are devoted to studying and addressing urgent, highly complex problems that call for purposeful, collective action. Confronting Collective Challenges courses provide durable ways of looking at large-scale challenges while teaching students to become open-minded problem-solvers capable of taking action in the world around them. Topics include social inequity and inequality; climate change; systemic and structural racism; disinformation; the challenge to democratic norms, institutions, and practices; the rise of authoritarianism; immigration and statelessness; and environmental degradation. Issues studied may span multiple geographies, nations, species, and nonhuman phenomena. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>b. </Lbl><LBody>The Process of Writing The ability to communicate clearly and effectively is a critical part of every liberal arts education, transcending individual disciplines. Writing is a skill developed over the course of a lifetime, and it takes many forms, depending on purpose and audience. For that reason, this curriculum entails a focus on writing in both the First-Year Seminar and also in another class later in a student's Colgate career. Process of Writing courses are offered in many departments in addition to the Department of Writing and Rhetoric. All courses that count toward the Process of Writing Practice emphasize the iterative nature of composition, the importance of revision, and the value of clear communication beyond the standard rules of grammar and mechanics. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>c. </Lbl><LBody>Quantitative and Algorithmic Reasoning It is essential that each student be able to understand, interpret, and apply algorithmic or quantitative methods. Quantitative and algorithmic reasoning form the basis of knowledge in a variety of departments and programs across Colgate's academic divisions. Quantitative and Algorithmic Reasoning courses emphasize themes such as how numerical evidence can facilitate the analysis of a problem; how to locate, collect, or interpret quantitative data; how to recognize the limitations of particular algorithmic or quantitative methods; or how to communicate algorithmic or quantitative arguments. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>d. </Lbl><LBody>Language Study The experience of being introduced to a different way of ordering ideas through language and the ability to communicate in another language are key ways of bridging difference. College language courses help students learn new languages and encounter new cultures. Even students who enter Colgate conversant in more than one language can benefit from such courses, either by studying that language at an advanced level, a new language at the introductory level, or a language course that develops literacies in a heritage language. </LBody></LI></L><P>The requirement cannot be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency or fluency in a second language. </P><P>e. Artistic Practice and Interpretation The study of the arts, whether through practice or interpretation, exposes students to unique pedagogies and learning experiences, and enhances their understanding of the diverse modes of creative expression. This engagement not only deepens students' appreciation for the arts, but also has the potential to nurture their creativity and increase their openness to experimentation, risk taking, and innovation. </P><P>To fulfill this requirement, students must complete one course that emphasizes either applied or interpretative artistic methodologies, practices, and theories. Courses in studio art, creative writing, music, theater, dance, or the interpretation of literature, poetry, art, film or other creative or artistic media may fulfill this requirement. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Areas of Inquiry </H2><P>Students achieve greater breadth of knowledge by taking courses in each of the University's three predominant areas of intellectual inquiry. These courses expose students to disciplinary modes of thinking and the opportunity to discover their majors, minors, and unexpected passions in new fields of study. Courses offered by interdisciplinary programs in the University Studies Division are included in these Areas of Inquiry. </P><P>Areas of Inquiry can be completed via transfer credit, pursuant to Colgate's other transfer credit policies. However, these courses play an integral part of the guided development that takes place during a college education. As such, they cannot be exempted based on placement procedures or demonstrated proficiency. The Areas of Inquiry cannot be fulfilled by Advanced Placement credits or other pre-matriculation credit. Neither can these requirements be fulfilled by courses taken during a winter/January intersession term, unless under exceptional circumstances and with permission of the department chair, division director, and associate dean of the faculty.</P><P> Most courses will carry a tag for one of the Areas of Inquiry. </P><L><LI><Lbl>a. </Lbl><LBody>Human Thought and Expression Courses in this area develop an understanding of what it means to be human: they focus on cultural and intellectual expressions throughout time. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>b. </Lbl><LBody>Natural Science and Mathematics Courses in this area apply theoretical and empirical methods to the study of living organisms, the physical world, and abstract and practical mathematics. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>c. </Lbl><LBody> Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents Courses in this area expose students to the study of social order and human behavior in societies of the past and present. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Physical Education and Wellness </H2><P>The Division of Physical Education, Recreation, and Athletics (PERA) offers a variety of programs and courses addressing students' physical, mental, social, and environmental well-being. These include programs and courses such as dance, outdoor education, volunteerism, and varsity and club-level athletics, and five-week courses in health, fitness, positive sexuality, and stress management. </P><P>Participation in approved extracurricular activities may earn up to one unit per activity. Students are required to complete two units. These do not carry academic credit. The Physical Education and Wellness requirement may be completed during any year, but students are encouraged to complete at least one credit by the end of the second year. Varsity athletes may earn one unit for every full year of team participation. Further information regarding the Physical Education and Wellness requirement is available on Colgate's Physical Education web pages. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Distinction Seminar in the Liberal Arts Core </H2><P>Director Chianese </P><P>Taught by two instructors, normally from different divisions, to students from a range of majors and minors, Distinction courses are transdisciplinary. They provide students and faculty with opportunities to consider topics and ideas from multiple vantage points and to engage in dialogue across disciplines. Throughout the course, the instructors model transdisciplinary exchange and thoughtful consideration of different perspectives. Choice of course content is open to the team of instructors. Each instructor participates fully throughout the term. </P><P>Admission to the seminar is by application. The team of instructors will review the applications and select up to 15 seniors from any major. Students with an overall grade point average of 3.33 (B+) or higher GPA are eligible to apply. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, students must earn an A- or better in the Core Distinction Seminar and achieve an overall grade point average of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Liberal Arts Core Curriculum Prizes — awarded by the program to the authors of the best papers/projects done by a student in each of the components of the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, as determined by a faculty committee. The winning papers/projects are evaluated on their scholarship, originality, and excellence. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Division of Arts and Humanities </H2><P>Director L. Schwarzer </P><P>The Arts and Humanities division supervises students considering a topical major if they wish to focus their studies in interdisciplinary areas not encompassed by approved majors. A student must first discuss a possible program of study with an appropriate Arts and Humanities faculty adviser. Then, with guidance from the adviser, the student provides the division director with the proposed program and a rationale for this program at least one month prior to registering for the student’s fifth term at Colgate.  </P><P>Major Requirements: The major must include a minimum of nine courses that closely relate to a common theme and are complementary; a maximum of two of these courses may be counted toward another major. Please note that five of the nine courses must be departmental courses, taught by members of the Arts and Humanities faculty. Four of the courses counted toward the topical major must be at the 300- or 400- level. Students must produce a capstone 400-level research project; this is normally fulfilled by enrolling in a course offered by an Arts and Humanities department, or as an independent study taken with an Arts and Humanities faculty member and approved by the faculty adviser and division director. </P><P>All courses in the Division of Arts and Humanities count towards the Human Thought and Expression area of inquiry requirement. </P><P>The Division of Arts and Humanities offers one topical major and houses the departments/programs listed below: </P><P>Division of Arts and Humanities </P><P>Click for the Division of Arts and Humanities  </P><Sect><H2>Arts and Humanities Topical Major </H2><P>Director L. Shwarzer </P><P>Students who wish to focus their studies in disciplinary or interdisciplinary areas not encompassed by a single department in the arts and humanities may pursue a topical major in the division. Normally a minimum of 9 courses are required for the topical major, at least 7 of which must be from departments within the Division of Arts and Humanities. In order to qualify for this major, a student must provide the division director with a proposed program of study and a rationale for this program during the spring term of the sophomore year. No proposal for a topical major will receive approval after the second month of the student's fifth term. Customarily, the major is available for students who wish to devote special attention to studies such as comparative literature or some combination of creative arts, such as music and fine arts, or drama, literature, and stage design. Students majoring in this topical area will, in the last term, write a substantial integrating paper as an independent study; one course credit is earned for this senior project. Students interested in such a major program are strongly urged to discuss their proposed plans of study with appropriate academic advisers and with the division director well in advance of the deadline specified above. </P><P>All courses in the Division of Arts and Humanities count towards the Human Thought and Expression area of inquiry requirement. </P><P>For more information about the division, honors/high honors, transfer credit, etc., visit the Division of Arts and Humanities page. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Art and Art History </H2><Table><TR><TH>Faculty </TH></TR><TR><TH>Professors Godfrey, Kaimal, McVaugh, Schwarzer, Stephenson Associate Professors Guile, Luthra, Marlowe (Chair) Assistant Professors Cui, Hatton, Haughwout Visiting Assistant Professors Gulkis, Hakimi Lecturers Domashenko, Guy </TH></TR></Table><P>The Department of Art and Art History offers courses of study in the history, theory, and practice of the visual arts for the general liberal arts student as well as the art history or studio art major. </P><P>Art History The department offers more than 20 courses that trace the visual arts from antiquity to the present day. Classroom lectures are supplemented by visits to museums in the area and in New York City, as well as Colgate's Clifford Gallery, Picker Art Gallery, and Longyear Museum. In this way, students increase their understanding of the visual arts as expressions of fundamental cultural values. </P><P>Studio Art Courses explore creative modes of expression and problem solving while gaining familiarity with contemporary issues in visual art. The curriculum supports a variety of mediums including digital art, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video art at the introductory and advanced levels. Studio arts courses are enriched by an ongoing series of visiting artists' lectures, exhibitions, and screenings as well as regular visits to New York City galleries, museums, and artists' studios. </P><P>Departmental Exhibitions, Lectures and Screenings </P><P>The Clifford Gallery is a teaching gallery featuring four to six exhibitions a year. Exhibitions are selected by the art and art history faculty to explore issues central to the academic curriculum, with the primary focus on professional work by contemporary artists. These artists are often featured in the weekly public lecture series described below. The Clifford Gallery is open to the entire community and contributes to the cultural life of the central New York area. </P><P>The Department of Art and Art History Lecture Series Lectures take place throughout the semester in Little Hall's Golden Auditorium. The series features presentations by studio artists, art historians, and critics, and serves as an arena for discussion of a wide range of subjects relevant to the study of the visual arts. Recent participants have included art historians and practicing sculptors, painters, film and video makers, printmakers, photographers, architects, and artists working in digital art and performance. The series is required as part of the curriculum and is open to the community. It also serves as a venue for welcoming Colgate graduates back to discuss their work in the visual arts and architecture. </P><P>The Alternative Cinema Series takes place weekly on Tuesday evenings. Tied to the film and video art curriculum, this series is programmed to include films and videos ranging from &quot;classic&quot; cinema to the current avant-garde. Each semester several film/video makers, historians, or curators visit campus and present work in person. </P><P>University Museums </P><P>The Picker Art Gallery This professional gallery maintains the Colgate University collections, including some 11,000 works from a wide range of cultures and historical periods. Although it is not part of the Department of Art and Art History, the Picker Art Gallery provides an important resource to students, faculty, alumni, and friends of Colgate through exhibitions and sponsorship of the Friends of the Visual Arts. </P><P>The Longyear Museum of Anthropology For a full description, please see Sociology and Anthropology. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Information </H2><P>Course classifications: </P><P>Studio Arts (SA) Art History (AH) </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>After completing ARTS 475 Senior Project: Art History (AH) or ARTS 406 - Senior Project: Studio Art (SA) in the fall semester, students have the opportunity to apply to continue their work with an honors-eligible project in the spring semester. The award of honors in art and art history is dependent on departmental evaluation. </P><P>The honors-eligible project can be a substantial reworking of the senior project completed in the fall semester of senior year, or a discrete project that meaningfully engages and builds on ideas raised in ARTS 406 or 475. The senior project coordinator will decide on the student's application to continue on to honors-eligible work. Students pursuing honors-eligible work in the spring enroll in an independent study (ARTS </P><P>499) with their senior project adviser. Honors presentations take place at the end of the term and faculty decide whether the project is worthy of honors. Honors will be conferred only on work of outstanding quality. </P><P>GPA Requirements: Honors — 3.20 in courses within the department; High Honors — 3.70 in courses within the department. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Fitchen Award for Excellence in Art and Art History — awarded by the department to an outstanding art and at history major. </P><P>The Harriette Wagner Memorial Award — established in 2004 by Professor Joseph Wagner, created in memory of Harriette Zeppinick Wagner. The award will be given annually to the senior art and art history major whose work exemplifies the way visual arts enrich the spirit and express the dignity of human beings. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>The department allows two courses to be transferred for credit toward the major, with prior approval of the courses by the department. No more than one period requirement may be fulfilled by means of courses transferred and no seminar taken outside Colgate will fulfill the seminar requirement within the art history major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Groups </H2><P>Students are encouraged to participate in study groups; they may not schedule off-campus study during the senior year. Study abroad must be scheduled around the seminar requirement in art history or the ARTS 240 or ARTS 243 requirement in studio art.

To prepare for graduate work in architecture, students should take PHYS 105 or PHYS 111 and one semester of calculus. Experience in studio courses, especially drawing (ARTS 211), sculpture (ARTS 263 or ARTS 264), is extremely valuable in the preparation of a graduate portfolio. The study of historical architecture and the ways in which architecture connects to society is promoted in many art courses such as ARTS 207, ARTS 216, ARTS 220, ARTS 226, ARTS 275, ARTS 277, ARTS 344, ARTS 360, and ARTS 372 .

Ammerman Associate Professors Benson, Rood (Chair), Stull Assistant Professors Tober </P></Caption></Figure><P>The Department of the Classics offers a multifaceted approach to the ancient Greek and Roman world, with courses not only in language and literature but also history, art, archaeology, religion, politics, philosophy, and anthropology. Students may pursue a major in Latin, Greek, the classics, or classical studies. Majors in Latin, Greek, or the classics make language and literature their main focus; majors in classical studies give less emphasis to the languages but acquire a broad understanding of different aspects of ancient civilization. Recent graduates from the Department of the Classics are pursuing diverse careers in fields such as law, medicine, advertising, computer science, and education. Many, too, have gone on to do graduate work in classics or related disciplines. </P><P>CLAS 221, CLAS 222, CLAS 230, CLAS 234, CLAS 235, CLAS 236, and CLAS 237 require no knowledge of Greek or Latin language. These courses are open to all students, but are subject to limitations in enrollment set by the instructor. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Major Programs in the Classics </H2><P>There are four possible majors in the classics: Greek, Latin, the classics, and classical studies. All majors require a minimum of eight courses within the department but vary in the amount and level of language study required. In addition, all majors require the senior seminar (CLAS 401), taken in the fall of senior year. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Newton Lloyd Andrews Prize — established in memory of Newton Lloyd Andrews, a member of the class of 1862, to support the study of the art and monuments of ancient Greece and Italy, Gothic architecture, or Renaissance painting. </P><P>The J. Curtiss Austin Latin Prize — established as a memorial to Dr. J. Curtiss Austin in honor of his 40 years on the Colgate faculty, and awarded by the Department of the Classics to the student whose performance in Latin has been the most outstanding. </P><P>The Award for Excellence — awarded annually to that first-year or sophomore student who shows the best promise in a course in Latin or Greek and who achieves the best record among his/her peers in Latin or Greek. </P><P>The Baldwin Greek Prize — established for the sophomore class for the examination in writing upon some author, or work of an author, read by the class. No student may compete unless his/her standing in all departments averages at least B (3.00). The award is made by a committee not associated with the university. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </H2><P>To evaluate a student's qualifications for advanced placement, the department requires the submission of an Advanced Placement Examination in Latin. Students who submit a grade of 4 or 5 and complete LATN 201 or a higher-level course in Latin will receive one credit for LATN 122 for the AP examination that may count toward a major in the department. </P><P>Transfer credit for a major is granted for courses comparable to those required for the classics major at Colgate on an individual basis. Evidence of course content may be required. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>The minimum departmental GPA required for honors in the classics, classical studies, Greek, or Latin is 3.50; for high honors 3.80. In addition, successful completion of an honors thesis and an oral examination is required. Honors candidates usually take CLAS 490, GREK 490 or LATN 490 in the fall of their senior year while writing their theses. Proposals for theses should be prepared in the spring of the junior year in consultation with the thesis adviser. Theses are then revised during the first half of the spring semester of the senior year and defended in April. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Extended Studies </H2><Sect><H2>Greece </H2><P>The department offers students who are enrolled in GREK 121 or who have completed GREK 122 (or higher), an opportunity to explore the material culture of Greece through a course that culminates in a three-week trip to Greece in May. For further information, see the course descriptions of CLAS 251 and CLAS 251E and consult with a faculty member in the department. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Rome and Pompeii </H2><P>The department offers students who are enrolled in LATN 122, or have completed LATN 122 (or higher), an opportunity to explore the material culture of Rome and Pompeii through a course that culminates in a three-week trip to Italy in May. For further information, see the course descriptions of CLAS 250 and CLAS 250E and consult with a faculty member in the department. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Sicily and Southern Italy </H2><P>The department offers students who are enrolled in, or have completed, GREK 121 or LATN 122 (or higher), an opportunity to explore the material culture of Sicily and Southern Italy through a course that culminates in a three-week trip to Italy in which students participate in excavations at the Graeco-Roman site of Paestum in May. For further information, see the course descriptions of CLAS 253 and CLAS 253E and consult with a faculty member in the department.  </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>The Venice Study Group </H2><P>The Venice Study Group offers majors who have had one or more years of Latin or Greek at Colgate the opportunity to explore sites and monuments of the classical world. The archaeology of Italy forms a major component of this interdisciplinary study group. For further information, see Off-Campus Study. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Classical Studies in Rome </H2><P>The department is a member institution of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, which offers a full schedule of classics- and archaeology-related courses each fall and spring.

Johnson, Maurer, Staley (Chair) Associate Professors Ames, Brice, Child, Hauser, Page, Rajasingham Assistant Professors Clayton, Cypress, Martino, Padilla Rios </P><P>The Department of English offers courses in two programs of study, one in literature written in the English language and the second in English with an emphasis in creative writing. Students may pursue majors and minors in both these areas. </P><P>An English major develops students' ability to use language effectively and enhances their critical and analytical skills by making them aware of the social and historical context in which writing, in any of its forms, is produced. English study provides an excellent basis for professional programs in law, journalism, publishing, and business as well as for graduate study in literature, the theater, or creative writing. </P><P>Students pursuing one of the majors in the department take courses in specified categories described in detail below. There is considerable choice from among the courses that fulfill these requirements, and students should discuss their programs with an adviser in planning a major. English courses also serve as electives for students in other programs. Normally 200-level courses are for first-year and sophomore students; 300-level courses, for sophomores, juniors, and seniors; and 400-level courses for juniors and seniors. There are a few specified prerequisites for individual courses. Non-majoring students considering 400-level English courses as electives, however, should consult catalog descriptions and may wish to speak with instructors to determine their readiness for particular courses. </P><P>Continued study of a foreign language or work in the literature of other languages in translation is particularly recommended as complementary to an English major and is especially important for students interested in further literary studies. Writing is an important component of coursework. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Allen Prizes in English Composition — established in memory of Hattie Boyd Allen — two prizes in English composition. </P><P>The Jonathan H. Kistler Memorial Curricular Innovation Fund in English — established to support and nurture new curricular and pedagogical ideas within the English department. </P><P>The Lasher Prize — established as an award to a member of the junior class in recognition of outstanding talent. </P><P>The Lasher Prize for Distinction in English Composition —awarded for distinction in the various types of writing. </P><P>The Scott Saunders Prize for Excellence in Literature — established in memory of Scott Saunders '89, and awarded annually to a senior major in English who participated in the Colgate London English Study Group, in recognition of work done in London that is distinguished in its own right or which contributed to the completion of a distinguished project. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement </H2><P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>Because transferred courses must conform in rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in English literature at another institution must meet with the department's transfer-credit adviser before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for an English course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The transfer-credit adviser grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors in English </H2><P>The privilege to work toward honors is granted at the discretion of the faculty. Seniors with an average of 3.5 in ENGL courses are eligible to apply to pursue an honors project. Interested students should begin discussing their projects with potential directors in their junior year. </P><P>Candidates in literary criticism must enroll in ENGL 489, a 0.25-credit course offered in the fall semester. In consultation with a member of the faculty, the student selects a topic and submits a formal prospectus, which must be approved by two faculty supervisors, the director of the honors program, and the department as a whole. The deadline for submission of the prospectus normally falls in October, while the deadline for an annotated bibliography normally falls in December. </P><P>Candidates in creative writing must enroll in ENGL 477 - Advanced Workshop in the fall of their senior year and must submit a formal prospectus. They should also speak with a creative writing professor(s) in the spring of their junior year. Permission to pursue a creative writing honors the next spring will be granted on the basis of the quality of work in ENGL 477. </P><P>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in ENGL 490 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates during the spring term of their senior year. ENGL 490 must be taken in addition to the required 400-level seminar and in addition to the minimum number of courses required for the major. Students must successfully complete the honors seminar and submit a final version of the thesis on a date specified by the department. If the thesis is provisionally approved by the faculty supervisors and the director of the honors program, the student then discusses the project at an oral presentation scheduled during finals week. </P><P>A student who completes a project judged worthy of honors by the department and maintains at least a 3.5 average in all ENGL courses, including ENGL 490, is awarded a degree in English with honors. Students with an outstanding overall record in the major who complete a superior thesis and oral presentation may be awarded high honors. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the thesis is not approved for honors, ENGL 490 is converted to ENGL 491 - Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the faculty member who supervises the completion of the work. </P><P>Students with further questions should contact the director of honors in the Department of English. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Preparation for Graduate Study </H2><P>Students interested in graduate study should consult with their advisers and the department chair early in their programs to be advised about preparation for advanced work. The department also designates special advisers to meet with students interested in graduate work, and informational meetings are held to help juniors and seniors plan their applications for fellowships and graduate admission. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Teacher Certification </H2><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in English who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching.

Preference normally is given to majors or prospective majors who have completed at least three courses toward the requirements for the major. ENGL 290 - London English Study Group Preparation is a 0.25-credit course limited to participants in the London English Study Group in a subsequent term. The course prepares students for the English coursework to be undertaken in London.

Serving as a gateway to rich literary and artistic traditions as well as the discourses of philosophy and critical theory, German also enables students to access Germanophone Europe's many contributions to the social and natural sciences. The department's academic program is structured to enable students to pursue their interests in German as well as related fields: the beginning and intermediate language courses emphasize cultural knowledge about contemporary German-speaking societies and provide a strong foundation in the skills of speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing German. German 351 fosters students' capacities for advanced study of German language, literature, and cultural history, while enabling them to conduct related academic work in German. Additional courses at the 300 level feature diverse topics in German literary and cultural studies, while seminars at the 400 level undertake focused investigations of seminal periods, genres, and sites of the German literary and cultural imagination. </P><P>The study of German can be integral to students' academic pursuits as a whole. The department encourages students to enroll in related courses in other disciplines such as philosophy, history, music, international relations, linguistics, and art history. A major in German is an excellent preparation for graduate studies in these fields as well as in literature and German Studies, and can also give students a competitive edge in economics, politics, law, business, journalism, consulting, and publishing. German not only provides students with the necessary basis for a rigorous and sophisticated understanding of central European culture, but also fosters a more profound understanding of their native language and of the relationship between language and knowledge: to speak with Goethe, &quot;Wer fremde Sprachen nicht kennt, weiß nichts von seiner eignen&quot; (those who don't know foreign languages know nothing of their own). </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Valentine Piotrow German Prizes — two awards for excellence in German. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </H2><P>Both university and major credits are normally granted to students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examinations in German language and literature or a score of 6 or 7 on the higher level International Baccalaureate German exam. Transfer credit for courses taken at other institutions may be granted with the approval of the department chair. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>An honors project allows students to build on their knowledge to pursue independent research on a topic of their interest in close consultation with one or several faculty members. Students with a GPA of 3.30 in courses included in the major and with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 are eligible for honors in German. Students who have attained that average may apply to pursue honors by the early fall of the senior year. Each candidate must complete a thesis or its equivalent under the guidance of a faculty adviser and must discuss the thesis at an oral presentation normally scheduled in April. Research on this project begins in the fall semester of the senior year. In the spring semester candidates register for GERM 490. This course must be taken in addition to the minimum of eight courses required for the major. The quality of the project resulting from this course, as judged by the adviser and one other faculty member, determines whether the student receives honors or a grade in GERM 491 - Independent Study. </P><P>Successful honors students whose departmental average is 3.50 or higher are eligible for high honors. For this distinction the student must fulfill all regular honors requirements and must also pass an additional oral examination based on his or her cumulative work in German courses. </P><P>Acceptance in Delta Phi Alpha (the national German honor society) is possible for all students who have at least two years of college German, a minimum GPA of 3.30 in all German courses, and an overall GPA of 3.00, and who show a continued interest in the study of German language and literature. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Group </H2><P>Every spring the department conducts a study group at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität in Freiburg, Germany. Majors in German are normally expected to avail themselves of this opportunity. The study group is also open to non-majors who have sufficient German language skills. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Facilities </H2><P>The Max Kade German Center in Lawrence Hall serves the department both as a seminar room and as a common room. It offers audiovisual facilities, German television broadcasts, a German reference library, and current German periodicals. The center is also the site of lectures, film screenings, and a weekly coffee hour. </P><P>In addition, the German department shares the Keck Humanities Resource Center with other arts and humanities departments. Here German audio, video, and computer resources are available for laboratory work in connection with language classes as well as for independent studies. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>University of Freiburg Visiting Instructors </H2><P>Each year, two German visitors from the University of Freiburg join the department to support our curriculum and our students. The department Intern serves as tutor, and advises the student-run German Club and the student-taught Foreign Language Program for second graders at Hamilton Central School. The Max Kade Teaching Fellow offers first- and second-year German language courses in the department. </P><Sect><H2>German Major </H2><P>Major Requirements </P><P>A major in German literature and culture consists of a minimum of eight courses. Normally these include at least three 400-level seminars and two 300-level courses. The remaining major credits may be fulfilled through additional courses in the department at the 200-level and above, or up to two cognate courses on German Studies topics taught in English outside the department, with departmental approval. Exceptions require the permission of the department chair. </P><Sect><H3>GPA Requirement </H3><P>University regulations require that a student maintain a minimum GPA of 2.00 in the courses comprising the major program. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Honors and High Honors </H3><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the German department page. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>German Department </H3><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, the Freiburg study group, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the German department catalog page. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>German Minor </H2><Sect><H3>Minor Requirements </H3><P>The minor in German literature and culture consists of a minimum of five courses.

The fundamental aim of the curriculum in music is to develop that experience to its utmost potential. Performance ensembles and private instruction build directly on that experience, while classroom instruction introduces student musicians to important ideas, histories, and various cultures that inform and broaden that experience. Qualified students can choose to develop in ways that most interest them. Those who choose to major in music will find their development guided by a balanced program of performance and classroom studies. Graduating majors have gone on to graduate study in every area of music or have immediately entered careers in arts management, mathematics, medicine, law, business, sound engineering, and many other fields. </P><P>Another fundamental aim of the curriculum is to introduce students with little or no musical background into the world of music as part of Colgate's liberal arts program. These students should begin with MUSI 101, MUSI 103, MUSI 111, MUSI 151, MUSI 161, or MUSI 221. </P><P>Upper-level courses divided into three groups: history, theory, and performance. The history courses are designed to provide students with an understanding of music through a study of composers and historical periods. The theory sequence teaches how music is created and how to compose it. The performance courses offer opportunities for students to engage in the art of performance and to gain credit in department-sponsored ensembles and private instruction. </P><P>Students with some musical background are encouraged to take MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 or MUSI 203 first. MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 can be taken in any order. </P><P>The music department offers extensive performing opportunities open to all qualified students regardless of major. Performance opportunities are offered in the Colgate University Orchestra, Colgate University Choral Ensembles, the Colgate Chamber Players (chamber music) and the Colgate University Concert Jazz Ensemble. (Auditions required for all ensembles) Private instruction in most instruments and in voice is available to students at an additional fee. All of these programs (except private instruction) may be elected on a credit or non-credit basis, and they are open to all Colgate students regardless of major. </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Information </H2><P>Course classifications: </P><P>History and Appreciation (H&amp;A) Performance (PF) Theory (TH) </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Class of 1909 Music Prize — awarded by the department to &quot;the person who has, during the year, contributed the most to the advancement of the standards of musical performance on the campus." </P><P>The Donald Lloyd Cotton '36 Endowed Prize — established to recognize one or more outstanding student musician(s). Recipient(s) are eligible to submit a proposal for an additional grant that provides financial </P><P>support for the furtherance of the student's music education. The grant may be used to cover expenses such as the purchase of musical instruments or relevant equipment, private music lessons, music research projects, summer music school, or music festival participation. Grants are awarded based on the merit of the written proposal, demonstrated musical talent, and participation in music department programs. </P><P>The Felix Eyle Memorial Prize in Music — awarded annually to an outstanding violin student at Colgate. The recipient is chosen by the faculty of the music department solely on the basis of talent, not financial need. The student will be featured during a normally scheduled concert. </P><P>The Robert G. Ingraham Memorial Music Prize — established as an annual award to the graduating senior who, in the judgment of the president, dean, chair of the Department of Music, and director of CSLI, did the most to promote and stimulate good music as an undergraduate by voluntary activity, leadership, performance, or participation in the band, orchestra, choir, glee club, or any other musical endeavor, individual or group. </P><P>The Lorey Family Senior Music Prize — established in 2012 by Evan Lorey and Paul Schupf, in memory of Wilhemine and Fred Lorey, and awarded annually to one or more senior majors in music.

Meyer, Tumulty Associate Professors J. Klein, Witherspoon Assistant Professors Lennertz, Stenberg, L. Tomlinson Senior Lecturer Pendleton </TH></TR></Table><P>Philosophy is a central component of a liberal arts education. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the place of human beings within it. What is the nature of morality? What is free will and are human beings free? What is the relation between mind and body? What, if anything, can we know about the material world? Does God exist? What makes a state just? What makes for a good life? </P><P>In attempting to answer such questions, students of philosophy reflect on both their own responses to these questions and the ways in which past thinkers have defended their answers to them. The process of formulating and testing these answers requires education in logical analysis, reasoned argument, and analytic thinking. In acquiring such education within the philosophy curriculum, students develop their ability to solve problems and to think, read, and write critically — skills that are in high demand in a number of different professions. Philosophy majors go on to successful careers in law, consulting, finance, and medicine. Many have also embarked on academic careers. </P><P>But philosophy is about more than reflection and finding answers. As the love of wisdom, it is also a practice and a way of life, one characterized by openness to viewpoints other than one's own, a willingness to question both received opinions and one's own opinions, and a passionate concern to integrate thought and practice into a meaningful life. </P><P>The department offers a number of courses that serve as gateways to the practice of philosophy. These gateway courses are PHIL 101 - Introduction to Philosophical Problems; PHIL 111 - Ethics; and PHIL 121 -Political Philosophy. Prospective philosophy majors are especially encouraged to take PHIL 101 early in their course of study. Other courses at the 200 and 300 level are either courses in the history of philosophy or courses that focus on problems in specific areas of philosophy. Many of these courses do not have specific prerequisites and are open to all interested students. </P><P>There are two distinct major programs: philosophy and the joint major in philosophy and religion. The department does not offer a minor in philosophy and religion. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Information </H2><P>Course classifications: </P><P>Major Figures (MF) Metaphysics and Epistemology (M&amp;E) Value Theory (VT) </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Balmuth Award for Philosophical Engagement — established as an award in honor of Jerome Balmuth for the student who, in the judgment of the department, best exemplifies Jerry's love of philosophy and cultivation of philosophical community at Colgate. </P><P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Awards for Excellence — established as an award for students who, in the judgment of the department, have performed exceptional work in philosophy. </P><P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Award for Postgraduate Study in Philosophy or Religion — established as an award for a graduating senior, for achievement in the study of philosophy and to assist the recipient with postgraduate study in philosophy or religion at a recognized graduate or divinity school. </P><P>The Marion Hoeflich Prize for the best Philosophy Paper in a Foreign Language – established in memory of the grandmother of Richard Klein '78. Awarded to the best philosophy paper in a language other than English, usually written as part of a recognized study abroad program.  </P><P>The Robinson Essay Prize —awarded on the basis of an essay written for a 200- or 300-level course in the department during the previous spring or fall semesters. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement </H2><P>Advanced Placement credit is not offered. Placement into more advanced philosophy courses may be granted to incoming first-year students who have achieved a score of 6 or 7 on the higher-level International Baccalaureate (IB) Philosophy Exam.  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>Transfer credit for graduation requirements may be awarded by the registrar on the basis of course syllabi and requirements and advice from the department. To assess transfer credit for major requirements, however, the same documents plus the student's written work in the course (i.e., exams, papers) must be submitted to the faculty adviser for evaluation. The department chair receives a recommendation and is responsible for deciding whether to award major credit. Normally no more than two transfer credits may count toward major or minor requirements. Students may not receive transfer credit towards 400-level courses. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors </H2><Sect><H2>Philosophy </H2><P>A student who wishes to become a candidate for honors in philosophy or who wishes to become a candidate for honors in philosophy and religion by writing on a philosophical theme must seek the approval of a faculty adviser by presenting him or her with a substantial essay that could serve as the basis for an honors project. Normally this will be an essay written for a 300- or 400-level philosophy course, together with a plan for developing the original essay into an honors thesis. If the faculty member and the department's honors supervisor agree that the submitted essay shows promise of becoming a high-quality thesis, the student may register for PHIL 490 with a view to qualifying for honors. </P><P>The independent study should result in a senior thesis. Students writing a senior thesis will give an informal presentation of their work to students and faculty of the department. Students seeking honors must submit their theses to their advisers by the deadline set by the department. If a student's adviser judges the thesis to be of sufficient quality, the student will be invited to stand for honors. (Independent study students who are not invited to stand for honors will still be able to complete their senior theses.) Honors candidates will undergo an oral exam (the honors defense) conducted by the adviser and two additional faculty members during exam week. Ideally the honors defense becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. In addition, an honors candidate must have a GPA of at least 3.40 in the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Philosophy and Religion </H2><P>Candidates for honors in Philosophy and Religion normally take an independent study (PHIL 490 or RELG </P><P>490) with their honors adviser during the spring term of their senior year. The honors thesis – a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique – is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser and two other faculty readers decide that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets with their adviser and the two other faculty readers – a committee consisting of Philosophy and Religion faculty – and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in the Philosophy and Religion major. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Group </H2><P>During the spring semester, the Department of Philosophy, in conjunction with the Department of Religion, offers a study group at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland's first university, founded in 1410. Other than the director's course, which is offered by a department member, students take courses of their choice from among those offered by the University of St. Andrews, at which they are enrolled for the semester. St. Andrews has a very fine philosophy department and it is a great advantage for majors in both philosophy and philosophy and religion to study there for a semester. The study group is also open to majors from other departments. See Off-Campus Study and Extended Study. </P><Sect><H2>Philosophy Major </H2><Sect><H3>Major Requirements </H3><P>A major in philosophy requires nine courses in philosophy, or ten if the philosophy major is a candidate for honors. </P><P>Though students may take as many 100- and 200-level courses as they wish, no more than three such courses will count towards the completion of the major. The lone exception is PHIL 225 Logic I, which can count towards the major in addition to three other 100- or 200-level courses. Though not strictly required of all majors, PHIL 225, is nevertheless strongly recommended for all majors — especially for students contemplating graduate work in philosophy. Only one of the total number of courses may be an independent study. </P><P>Among the courses for the major, students must complete the following: </P><P>Value Theory (VT) Elective </P><P>At least one upper-level course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 312 - Contemporary Political Philosophy (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 313 - International Ethics (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 329 - Philosophy of Law (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 330 - Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 343 - Topics in Moral Theory (VT) </LBody></LI></L><Sect><H3>Metaphysics and Epistemology (M&amp;E) Elective </H3><P>At least one upper-level course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 320 - 20th-Century Analytic Philosophy (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 335 - Contemporary Epistemology (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 340 - Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 341 - Philosophy of Mind (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 342 - Philosophy of Language (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 380 - Issues in Epistemology and Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 381 - Issues in Epistemology and Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>A similar course approved by the chair </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Major Figures (MF) Elective </H3><P>At least one course from the following, should be completed by the end of the junior year: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 301 - Ancient Philosophy (MF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 302 - Modern Philosophy (MF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 303 - Medieval Philosophy (MF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 304 - Kant and German Idealism (MF) </LBody></LI></L><P>Note: Students planning on pursuing honors should take two courses from Major Figures (MF). </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Philosophy Seminar </H3><P>At least one seminar at the 400-level seminar courses, though students are strongly encouraged to take more than one seminar. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>To qualify for graduation, a minimum grade of C is required in all courses taken toward the major/minor. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Honors </H3><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Philosophy department page. </P><P>Philosophy Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Philosophy department catalog page. </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Philosophy Minor </H2><Sect><H3>Minor Requirements </H3><P>A minor in philosophy consists of five courses in philosophy.

Religion courses offer training in a unique combination of skills, including close textual analysis, direct observation, critical thinking, and cross-cultural understanding. </P><P>The department offers a variety of courses regarding diverse African, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish, and Native American traditions and scriptures. In addition to courses focused on particular traditions, the department also offers courses on the relationship between religion and issues of historic and contemporary importance, such as the environment, terrorism, medicine, gender, and the law. </P><P>The study of religion is necessarily interdisciplinary, making reflective use of the full variety of liberal arts methods. In addition, it engages related issues in philosophy, ethics, society, spirituality, science, gender, sexuality, arts, and politics. Thus, a major or minor in religion may serve as a natural complement to other majors. Students in the arts and humanities, for instance, will find that the study of religious texts and worlds affords them greater insight into literature and visual art. Some students may seek to make stronger interdisciplinary connections. In consultation with an adviser, students may elect to create a track through the religion major or minor that brings their work in religion into dialogue with their work in other departments or programs. Possible tracks include: </P><Sect><H2>Religion, Politics, and Law </H2><P>The department offers courses that examine the intersection of religion and politics, past and present, explore the legal frameworks of a variety of religious traditions, and ask students to think about the role of ethics and morality in public life. Students interested in history, international relations, peace and conflict studies, or political science will find that a minor or second major in religion allows them a better understanding of many of the longstanding ideological conflicts that have shaped the contemporary world. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Religion and Health </H2><P>Students interested in the natural sciences who intend to enter the fields of medicine and health sciences will find that courses in religion equip them to evaluate the moral complexity of current scientific advances. A host of religion courses probe questions that are central to medicine and health: questions of body and soul, psychic states and mindfulness, sex and sexuality, life and death. These are treated in a variety of religious traditions, offering the pre-med student a comparative approach to health and healing. </P><P>The success of our graduates indicates that a major in religion provides excellent preparation for a number of careers, including education, government, journalism, finance, law, social work, and professional service in non-profit organizations and religious institutions. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The M.

At the end of the course, the faculty member may recommend that a student's paper be reworked into an honors thesis. </P><P>In the spring of the senior year, candidates for honors normally take an independent study (RELG 490) with their honors adviser. The honors thesis — a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique — is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser decides that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets during exam week with his or her adviser and two other faculty readers and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in his or her major. </P><Sect><H2>Philosophy and Religion </H2><P>Candidates for honors in Philosophy and Religion normally take an independent study (PHIL 490 or RELG </P><P>490) with their honors adviser during the spring term of their senior year.

Language courses work to improve students' abilities in speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing in French, Italian, or Spanish, while providing an introduction to culture. Structured in levels of increasing complexity, literature, film or theater courses foster the improvement of analytical and critical skills, an enhanced aesthetic appreciation of works of literary, cinematic or theaterical works, and a broader understanding of linguistic and cultural diversity. Many of the courses offered in the department may be taken by students who do not plan to major in French or Spanish but who would like to maintain or develop their knowledge of these languages and cultures. Given the multicultural nature of the United States today, familiarity with a second language and culture will enhance a student's preparation for a career in any profession. Advanced study of Spanish (300 level and higher) makes the student eligible for the intimate contact with a foreign culture available through the department's study group abroad. A major in French or Spanish can be particularly useful in the fields of law, business, international trade, journalism, education, and public administration. </P><P>The department offers majors and minors in both French and Spanish, but not in Italian. Courses counting toward these majors are conducted entirely in the appropriate language. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Award for Excellence in French Studies — awarded in recognition of consistently outstanding performance in French. </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Italian Studies — awarded in recognition of consistently outstanding performance in Italian. </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Spanish Studies — awarded in recognition of exceptional contributions to the life of the Spanish program within the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. </P><P>The Charles A. Choquette Memorial Prize — established in honor of Charles Choquette, professor of French and Spanish from 1927 to 1967 and chair from 1953 to 1962.

In Spanish, language grade of 4 = 202; language grade of 5 = 361; literature grade of 4 = 202; literature grade of 5 = 202, and exemption from a major credit at the 350 level. </P><P>Students with an AP language grade of 3 may take FREN 202 or SPAN 202 or higher. Students with an AP language or literature grade of 4 or higher must register at the 300 level to continue their study of French or Spanish. No more than two AP or transfer credits, or combination of the two, may be counted for a French or Spanish major or minor. </P><P>No more than one major or minor credit may be transferred from an approved program. To be accepted, such courses must be comparable in quality and scope to courses offered at Colgate.

Giurgea, Sweeney Associate Professor DuComb (Chair) Assistant Professors Bass, Swanson </P></Caption></Figure><P>Senior Lecturer S. Giurgea Technical Director Labykina </P><P>Theater predates recorded history and remains a vital mode of artistic expression in the modern world. The Department of Theater educates students in the interdisciplinary practice of theater through required courses in acting, directing, stagecraft, and stage design, as well as elective courses in playwriting, screenwriting, and dance. Students also study theater as a social and cultural institution through courses in theater history and dramatic literature. Each semester, the department mounts a major production in the University Theater, directed either by a member of the theater faculty or a distinguished guest artist. Theater courses and University Theater productions are open not only to theater majors and minors but to all students on campus. </P><P>Theater students at Colgate learn by doing in the intellectually and physically rigorous environment of studio courses, rehearsals, and public performances. The curriculum transcends the artificial split of mind and body, encouraging students to develop skills in both logic and intuition that apply to any field of endeavor. A major or minor in theater fosters students' ability to read closely, think critically, and communicate clearly --not only through speech and writing, but also through embodied presence. Students of theater are trained to integrate analytical, physical, emotional, and interpersonal intelligence in a way that few other courses of study demand. </P><P>By making and studying theater, Colgate students act out a variety of perspectives on the world, learning to problem solve and self-start through immersion in the challenges of the creative process. Students have opportunities both to lead and to collaborate. Graduates regularly pursue successful careers not only in theater but also in communications, media, business, law, and technology. Students interested in majoring or minoring in theater should discuss their plans with an adviser, and consider courses in music, art and art history, film and media studies, English, foreign languages and cultures to complement their theater education. </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Howard W. and Anne T. Pike Memorial Prize—awarded annually to a graduating senior for outstanding achievement and contribution to the University Theater program. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>Because transferred courses must conform in content and rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in theater at another institution must meet with the department chair before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for a theater course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The department chair grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>Seniors with an average GPA of 3.5 or above in courses counted toward the Theater major may apply to pursue an honors project. The application process for honors will be discussed in THEA 495 - Senior Seminar in Theater. Proposals for honors projects should build on the student's previous work in the Theater major. Proposals are normally due in October and must be approved by the Theater faculty. </P><P>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in THEA 496 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates in Theater, during the spring term of their senior year. This course will ordinarily take the form of an independent study with the supervisor of the student's honors project. THEA 496 must be taken in addition to THEA 495 and to the minimum number of courses required for the Theater major. Students must complete their honors projects by a date specified by the Department of Theater. If the Theater faculty approves a completed project for honors, the student receives a grade in THEA 496. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the final project is not approved for honors, THEA 496 is converted to THEA 491 - Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the student's faculty supervisor. Students are awarded high honors on the basis of the quality of their chosen artistic project, thesis, and the oral presentation. </P><P>Students with further questions should contact the chair of the Department of Theater. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Preparation for Graduate Study </H2><P>Students interested in graduate study should consult with their advisers and the department chair early in their programs to be advised about preparation for advanced work. The department also designates special advisers to meet with students interested in graduate work, and informational meetings are held to help juniors and seniors plan their applications for fellowships and graduate admission. </P><P>Theater Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The minimum of nine courses must include the following: </P><Sect><H3>Acting and Directing </H3><P>All of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 254 - Acting I (should be completed by the end of the sophomore year.) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 354 - Directing I </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Theater History and Dramatic Literature </H3><P>Two courses (one of these courses should be completed by the end of sophomore year): </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 266/ENGL 266 - Introduction to Drama </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl></Lbl><LBody> THEA 267/ENGL 267 - Modern Drama </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Stagecraft and Design </H3><P>Two courses (one of these courses should be completed by the end of sophomore year): </P><L><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 250 - Stagecraft </LBody></LI><LI>Choose one of the following: </LI></L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 252 - Scenic Design </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 253 - Costume Design </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Electives </H3><P>Two additional full-credit courses (or the equivalent of two full credits): </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 246/FMST 246 - Introduction to Performance Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 252 - Scenic Design </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 253 - Costume Design </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 257 - Theater for Young Audiences Workshop </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 259 - Performance I </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 270 - Introduction to Dance Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 273/ALST 273 - Contemporary African American Drama  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 276 - Playwriting I </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 321/ENGL 321 - Shakespeare </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 322/ENGL 322 - Shakespeare </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 332 - Theater and Performance: London and the International Stage (Study Group) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 349/ENGL 349 - Global Theater   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 350 - Theater Practicum </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 351 /ENGL 351 - American Theater   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 353 - Theater, Play, and Improvisation </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 355 - Acting II </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 358 - Narrative Screenwriting </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 359 - Performance II: Performance Creation Studio </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 363 - Narrative Improvisation and Storytelling </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 376/ENGL 376 - Playwriting II  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 454 - Directing II </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 458 /ENGL 326 - Shakespeare's Contemporaries </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 491 - Independent Study </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 496 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates in Theater </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>With the permission of the director of the department chair, drama courses in other languages, selected courses in art and art history (such as ARTS 221, ARTS 287, and ARTS 322), and selected courses in music may also count towards the theater major. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Senior Seminar </H3><P> THEA 495 - Senior Seminar in Theater </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Backstage or Technical Work </H3><P>A total of 40 hours of backstage or technical work beyond what is required in any theater courses.

Although the majority of majors ultimately pursue careers in the life sciences, a significant number of individuals with other career interests choose the major within the liberal arts context. The department's majors are found today in positions of responsibility in many fields outside the life sciences, including business, theology, law, and the performing arts. Biology majors who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching should refer to Educational Studies. </P><P>Students expecting to attend graduate or professional schools are reminded that these schools frequently recommend or require calculus, statistics, computer science, chemistry (typically through organic), and a year of physics as cognates to the biology major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Oswald T. Avery Award — awarded by the department in honor of Dr. Oswald T. Avery, who graduated in the class of 1900 and subsequently made major research discoveries in molecular biology at the Rockefeller Institute. The award is given each year to one or more senior majors in molecular biology chosen by the faculty on the basis of academic achievement, academic development, research project, and departmental service. </P><P>The Raymond J. Myers Award — awarded by the department in honor of Professor Raymond J. Myers, who taught biology at Colgate from 1934 to 1972. The award is given each year to one or more senior majors in biology chosen by the faculty on the basis of academic achievement, academic development, research project, and departmental service. </P><P>The Christopher Oberheim Memorial Award — established as an award for a biology student chosen by the faculty on the basis of showing great promise in research, as evidenced by previous work. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement Policy </H2><P>An incoming student who submits an AP grade of 4 or 5 will receive credit for BIOL 101. This course can be counted as a 100-level elective course. Students with AP credit are encouraged to enter the department's curriculum with BIOL 181 or BIOL 182. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>A student may be allowed to stand for honors or high honors in the department following approval of their research adviser. Both honors and high honors in biology require an overall GPA of 3.30 in courses counted toward the major, a demonstrated deep commitment to research in biology, an oral presentation to the department, a review paper, and a research paper submitted to the research adviser and two committee members. The research project evaluated for honors must be based on at least one (honors) or two (high honors) semesters or summers of research. The awarding of honors and high honors will be decided by the faculty in consultation with the adviser and honors committee and will be based on the demonstrated commitment to research and the quality of the research project, the thesis, and the oral presentation. Research projects submitted for honors or high honors must be carried out on campus or on the NIH study group or Singapore Exchange Program.  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>International Exam Transfer Credit </H2><P>Transfer credit may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., A-Levels, International Baccalaureate) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>A maximum of two biology course credits transferred from other institutions may be applied toward major requirements. Students who intend to transfer a course must supply the department chair with a course description and a course syllabus for evaluation prior to taking the course. Students transferring to Colgate with upper-class standing may petition the department for permission to transfer a third course. Courses taken on Colgate Study Groups are approved in the same manner as other non-Colgate courses, but they are not included in the total transfer credit limit. Courses transferred into the major from other institutions cannot be counted toward the lab-course requirement. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Teacher Certification </H2><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in biology who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching.

Students choosing this course are encouraged to take CHEM 212 in the spring of their first year, providing an early start into the chemistry major. Exceptionally well-prepared students from other pre-matriculation programs should consult with the department chair regarding advanced standing. </P><P>Students may also receive course credit for an AP score of 4 or 5 or British A-level grade of A or B. Those who enroll in CHEM 111 receive credit for CHEM 101. Students who choose not to take any introductory chemistry courses may receive one credit toward graduation for an AP score of 4 or A-level grade of B (CHEM 101) or two credits for an AP score of 5 or A-level grade of A (CHEM 101 and CHEM 102).

The decision to award honors, high honors, or neither is based on the quality of the honors project, the quality of its presentation and defense, and other evidence of distinction. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>Transfer students generally receive credit for satisfactorily completed chemistry courses taken at other institutions that correspond to courses at Colgate. The department considers such transfer credits individually, and students should provide information about the courses (syllabi, catalog statements, lab notebooks, textbooks, etc.) to the department chair for consideration. These arrangements should be made well before beginning classes at Colgate. </P><P>Matriculated Colgate students may receive credit for chemistry courses taken at other colleges/universities. Summer courses must meet several criteria established by the department concerning the course content, the length of the course, and the number and length of class and laboratory meetings. Students considering transferring credit to Colgate for a summer chemistry course should obtain a copy of the department's criteria for an acceptable course, discuss the course with the department chair, and receive approval before taking the summer course. Final acceptance of the transfer credit is contingent upon satisfactory performance on a competency exam; the department administers this exam prior to the drop/add period for the fall term immediately following the summer course. </P><P>Other International Exam Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., International Baccalaureate, Abitur) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Summer Research Opportunities </H2><P>Colgate's chemistry department has a rich summer research program and there are numerous summer research opportunities at university, government, and private labs around the country. It is recommended that chemistry and biochemistry majors participate in a full-time research experience before they graduate, in addition to the required year of senior research (CHEM 481/CHEM 482).

Computer science is a mix of theory, application, design, and experiment. Theory addresses questions about the nature and limits of computation, the abstract properties of machine models, the complexity of algorithms, and the formalization of programming languages. Applications include machine and systems design, the design and implementation of programming languages, artificial intelligence, networks, graphics, and simulation. An important aspect of computer science is the development of methods for the systematic design of large systems in hardware and software. Both applications and theoretical issues must be tested experimentally. </P><P>The computer science major prepares students either for graduate study in computer science or for a variety of professional careers. The computer science minor and the major in computer science/mathematics prepare students for professions in which computer science overlaps significantly with another discipline.

The geosciences are a multi-disciplinary effort aimed at understanding the physical and chemical nature of the Earth, the evolution and impact of life on our planet, and how global processes operate now, in the past, and in the future. The Earth and environmental geosciences combine the scientific study of Earth materials, such as minerals, rocks, and fossils, and planet-scale processes uncovered through Earth-observing data derived from satellites, geophysical instruments, and models. The geosciences explain how past and present-day ecosystems and environments have been and continue to be shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, mountain building, climate change, evolution, and human activity through time. </P><P>Introductory courses are designed to contribute significantly to a liberal arts education and an understanding of Earth and the environment. Advanced courses are more specialized and provide the highest possible level of general and pre-professional training for majors. </P><P>Students in the department pursue a Geology or Environmental Geology concentration that prepares students to pursue careers in the geological and environmental sciences, business, and education, as well as government and public service. Upon graduation, many majors attend graduate school in geology, hydrology, oceanography, environmental sciences, and environmental policy and law. Other graduates go directly into a wide spectrum of employment situations, including business, environmental consulting, teaching, administration in schools and museums, and mineral resources and petroleum-related jobs. </P><P>Students interested in pursuing graduate school in the geosciences should note that some graduate schools expect applicants to have supplemented their undergraduate geology courses with introductory calculus, chemistry, and physics or biology. The Earth and Environmental Geosciences department encourages all majors to take these courses; they are required for honors in geology. </P><P>Teacher Certification </P><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for Geology or Environmental Geology majors who are interested in careers in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies . </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Award for Excellence in Geoscience — awarded annually by the department to the student who best demonstrates a combination of excellence in the classroom and creativity and perseverance in research. </P><P>The Robert M.

Requests should be directed to the department chair. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>The department allows two courses to be transferred for credit toward the major and one course towards the minor, with prior approval of the courses by the department. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors </H2><P>All geology and environmental geology majors are encouraged to consider the advantages and challenges of undertaking honors in geology. A GPA of 3.20 or higher in the five core courses (GEOL 190 , GEOL 201 , GEOL 215 , GEOL 225 , and GEOL 235 ), plus the two required 400-level courses are required for a student to become eligible for honors. In addition, at least six full-credit courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics must be taken to become eligible for honors. GEOG 245  can be taken in place of one of these six courses. </P><P>Honors candidates must also complete a year-long senior thesis, which represents the culmination of a research project that typically begins during the summer before the senior year and continues during the fall and spring terms of the senior year. The written thesis must be completed and orally presented by the end of the spring semester. Following the defense, and with the recommendation of the thesis committee, the Earth and Environmental Geosciences faculty will vote to award honors. Awarding the distinction of honors is based primarily on the quality of the written thesis but will also include an overall assessment of the student's academic record. Students who may be eligible for honors will be notified in the spring of the junior year by their academic adviser.  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Related Majors </H2><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Environmental Geology Major </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Astrogeophysics Major </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Natural Sciences, Topical Concentration: Marine Science - Freshwater Science Major  Topical Concentration: Marine — Freshwater Science is offered with the cooperation of the biology department through the Division of Natural Sciences.

Students at Colgate who major in mathematics go on to careers in medicine, law, or business administration as well as areas of industry and education having an orientation in science. Non-majors often require mathematical skills to carry on work in other disciplines, and all students can use the study of mathematics to assist them in forming habits of precise expression, in developing their ability to reason logically, and in learning how to deal with abstract concepts. There are also many people who view mathematics as an art form, to be studied for its own intrinsic beauty. </P><P>All mathematics courses are open to qualified students. Entering first-year students who have successfully completed at least three years of secondary school mathematics, including trigonometry, should be adequately prepared for MATH 161.

In order to be considered for high honors, a 3.7 GPA in the major is required. For both honors and high honors, completion of a course numbered 400 or above besides 481-483 is required. </P><P>Honors / High Honors are attained by a student's production and defense of a thesis of distinction. The student's thesis adviser puts forward the thesis for honors consideration. Subsequently, a committee of three faculty members is formed, one being the student's thesis advisor, the others chosen by the department. The student must give a defense of the thesis. The committee of three, with other faculty members acting in an advisory capacity with a recommendation, then grades the project, consisting of the thesis and defense.

The systems examined may range in scale from molecular through cellular and tissue levels to the scale of organisms and entire ecosystems. The unifying feature of this field is quantitative description of interactions between components of biological systems. </P><P>The interface between mathematics and biology is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of research in the sciences. The technological development of methods for generating large amounts of biological data — including genome sequence information, total protein analysis, metabolic information, etc. — demands the development of mathematical and computational methods for analyzing these data and for developing predictive models that use such large data sets. The multidisciplinary field of systems biology requires an understanding of both mathematical and biological concepts, insights into interesting questions in biology, and comprehension of the mathematical methods that can be used to address many of those questions. The mathematical systems biology minor provides students with the coursework in mathematics and biology required to begin to gain insights and experience in this important new field. </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Course requirements are described below (six courses) </P><P>Required Courses </P><P>Both of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 163 - Calculus III </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 214 - Linear Algebra </LBody></LI></L><Sect><H4>One of the Following </H4><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 181 - Evolution, Ecology, and Diversity and BIOL 181L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 182 - Molecules, Cells, and Genes and BIOL 182L </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H4>One of the Following </H4><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 302/BIOL 302 - Systems Biology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 315 - Mathematical Biology </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Biology </H3><P>One additional biology course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 181 - Evolution, Ecology, and Diversity </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 182 - Molecules, Cells, and Genes </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Any 200-, 300-, or 400-level BIOL elective course </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Mathematics </H3><P>One additional mathematics course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 260 - Computational Mathematics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 302/BIOL 302 - Systems Biology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 308 - Differential Equations </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 310 - Combinatorial Problem Solving </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 312 - Math Modeling: Social Sciences </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 313 - Functions of a Complex Variable </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 315 - Mathematical Biology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 316 - Probability </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 354 - Data Analysis I - Generalized Linear Models </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 360 - Graph Theory </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 376 - Numerical Analysis (formerly MATH 329) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 408 - Partial Differential Equations (formerly MATH 311) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 416 - Mathematical Statistics (formerly MATH 317) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 448/PHYS 448 - Nonlinear Dynamics &amp; Chaos (formerly MATH/PHYS 458) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 454 - Data Analysis II - Nonlinear Model Inference </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 481/BIOL 481 - Modeling of Biological Systems     </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 482 - Research Seminar: Applied Mathematics </LBody></LI></L><P>Note: </P><P>Students declaring a minor in mathematical systems biology select an adviser from either the mathematics department or biology department.

Levine, Metzler Assistant Professors Adhikari, Ilie, Tseng Visiting Assistant Professor Isakovic, Shivashankara Instructor Jones </P><P>A student should select a major in the Department of Physics and Astronomy if he or she is interested in fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the nature of the universe, or in practical questions of engineering, applied physics, or space science. To be successful, a student should also enjoy mathematics and quantitative reasoning. More than half of the graduating seniors in this department go to graduate school in various disciplines, and many earn PhDs in physics, astronomy, and engineering. Approximately 25 percent enter technical careers directly after graduation. The others pursue careers in teaching, business (often technology-based), management, medicine, and other areas. </P><P>The department offers several courses of general interest, not intended for majors. These courses are ASTR 101 - Solar System Astronomy; ASTR 102 - Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe; ASTR 230 - Astronomy in Culture ; PHYS 105 - Mechanical Physics I; and PHYS 111 -Fundamental Physics I, PHYS 112 - Fundamental Physics II. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>To be Eligible to Graduate </H2><P>To be eligible to graduate with a major in any of the programs of this department, a student is expected to achieve a grade of C– or better in each of the courses offered in the department that are required for the major. There are no exceptions to this policy. Additionally, a student's cumulative GPA for all courses counted toward the major must be at least 2.00. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Edwin Foster Kingsbury Prizes — established as an annual award to those students whose performance and promise is judged by the department to be the most outstanding during the year of the award. </P><P>The Joseph C. Amato &amp; Anthony F. Aveni Award for Student Research — Awarded to those students showing excellence in scientific research. </P><P>The Physics and Astronomy Alumni Awards — awarded by the department to those students majoring in physics and astronomy, who, in the opinion of the department, have made the most significant progress in the study of their major subject and the relations of this science to other fields of learning. </P><P>The Physics and Astronomy Department Founders Award — awarded periodically by the department to a senior who has demonstrated four years of outstanding progress and development of his or her understanding of physics or astronomy. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement </H2><P>Credit for PHYS 111 will be granted to students who score 4 or 5 on the AP Physics 1 exam or the AP Physics C-Mechanics exam. Credit for PHYS 112 will be granted to students who score 4 or 5 on the AP Physics 2 exam or the AP Physics C-E&amp;M exam. Placement into PHYS 232 without completion of PHYS 131 can sometimes be allowed following discussion with the department chair and the PHYS 232 instructor. Department majors who do not complete PHYS 131 will be required to complete an additional upper-level course to meet the major requirements. Placement out of PHYS 232 or PHYS 233 based on high school courses (including AP) is not normally possible. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors </H2><P>To qualify for graduation with honors, physics and astronomy-physics students must be invited by the department chair, in consultation with department faculty, to do an honors thesis. Normally, this invitation is extended only after exceptional performance in the capstone course PHYS 410.  </P><P>The following are also required: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>The completion (with a grade of C- or better) of at least two additional 300- or 400-level physics or astronomy courses beyond the minimum needed for the major. PHYS 334, PHYS 336, PHYS 392, PHYS 492, ASTR 312, ASTR 392, and ASTR 492 do not count towards this requirement. With the permission of the chair, a 300- or 400-level course in another NASC department may substitute for one of these courses. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>A cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 in all 300- and 400-level classes taken to satisfy the upper-level course requirements for the major and for honors. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>The completion, defense, and public presentation of an honors thesis. This thesis, to be evaluated by department faculty and an external reviewer, is normally a significant extension of the work completed in PHYS 410. Students normally enroll in PHYS 492 or ASTR 492 during the spring semester of their senior year to complete the work. </LBody></LI></L><P>The department faculty will subsequently determine whether to award honors or high honors. Neither is guaranteed. High honors will be given only for truly extraordinary work. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>Transfer of credit for physics and astronomy courses from other colleges or universities requires approval by the department. In particular, summer courses taken with the expectation of transfer credit must be preapproved by the department well in advance of enrollment. Students should be aware that few institutions offer summer equivalents for major-sequence courses other than PHYS 232 and PHYS 233, and also that a grade of C or higher is required to transfer coursework for Colgate credit. After matriculation, no more than 2 transferred course credits may count towards the physics or astronomy-physics major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Pre-requisites and Minimum Grade Requirements </H2><P>Prerequisite and minimum grade requirements will be strictly enforced for both majors and non-majors. Students who have not taken PHYS 131, and students who have received less than a C- in the lecture portion of PHYS 131, may take PHYS 232 with the PHYS 232 instructor's permission. Otherwise, students will not be permitted to take any department course that has prerequisites before achieving a grade of C- or better in the lecture portion of each prerequisite.  Exceptions will be made to this policy only in extraordinary circumstances. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>International Exam Transfer Credit </H2><P>Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., A-Levels, International Baccalaureate) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Related Majors </H2><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Astrogeophysics Major  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Physical Science Major </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Pre-Engineering Studies </H2><P>The department offers two ways to prepare for engineering: major in physics at Colgate and after graduation go to graduate school in engineering, or use one of the combined plans available in the department. To allow a student to combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University. A student may spend three years at Colgate and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan) to earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions. The student may be eligible to continue study for a Master of Science (MS) degree, which can sometimes be completed in as little as one additional year after earning the bachelor's degree in engineering. Eligibility for the MS program is determined by the engineering school. </P><P>It is imperative for students interested in the 3-2 plan to begin the physics and math curriculum in the fall term of the first year. To be eligible for the 3-2 plan, a student must complete all physics major courses through PHYS 336 and PHYS 431 (or PHYS 451), plus one other upper-level physics course to be chosen in consultation with the pre-engineering adviser. </P><P>Prerequisites for admission to engineering schools vary among schools and fields of study; therefore, it is necessary to indicate an interest in pre-engineering to the physics faculty as soon as possible. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Preparation for Graduate School </H2><P>Students intending to pursue graduate studies in physics, astronomy, or engineering should discuss their plans with their major advisers as early as possible. Students who wish to prepare for graduate studies in physics or astronomy should complete PHYS 431, PHYS 432, PHYS 433 and PHYS 434. To enrich the program, a student should choose additional physics and astronomy electives at the 300 and 400 levels. Advanced courses in other science departments, especially mathematics, are also encouraged. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Teacher Certification </H2><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in physics who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Astrogeophysics Major </H2><P>Director Levine </P><P>The astrogeophysics major is a multidisciplinary program for students interested in the study of the solar system and planetary matter. Drawing on astronomical observations, physical models, chemical constraints, and geological interpretations, students consider the Earth in its planetary context, the processes that have shaped Earth and other planets through time, and our place in the Universe. Students learn to appreciate or participate in the ongoing discovery of planets throughout the galaxy, and to reflect critically on their similarities with and differences from our own world. Astrogeophysics majors develop intellectual tools from across the physical sciences to reason qualitatively and quantitatively about global issues, such as the accelerating pace of global change and planetary habitability. Interested students should consult the program director as early as possible to plan an appropriate sequence of courses, since many of the required courses have prerequisites. </P><Sect><H3>Major Requirements </H3><P>The requirements for the major are as follows: </P><Sect><H3>Physical Science </H3><P>One introductory course with a grade of C– or higher, from the following list: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 101 - Solar System Astronomy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 102 - Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CHEM 101 - General Chemistry I and CHEM 101L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CHEM 102 - General Chemistry II and CHEM 102L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CHEM 111 - Chemical Principles and CHEM 111L  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 101 - Environmental Geology and GEOL 101L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 105 - Megageology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 115 - Evolution: Dinosaurs to Darwin </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 120 - The Geology of America's Parks (Extended Study) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 135 - Oceanography and the Environment </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 190 - Evolution of Planet Earth and GEOL 190L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 131 - Atoms and Waves and PHYS 131L </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Two Courses </H3><P>Two courses from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 201 - Mineralogy and Geochemistry and GEOL 201L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 215 - Paleontology of Marine Life and GEOL 215L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 225 - Sedimentology and Surficial Processes and GEOL 225L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 235 - Tectonics and Earth Structure and GEOL 235L </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>All of the Following </H3><P>All of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 161 - Calculus I </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 163 - Calculus III </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 232 - Introduction to Mechanics and PHYS 232L  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 233 - Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism and PHYS 233L  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 162 - Calculus II </LBody></LI><LI>or </LI></L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 205 - Mathematical Methods of Physics </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Astrophysics </H3><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 210 - Intermediate Astronomy and Astrophysics or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 414 - Astrophysics </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Senior Research </H3><P>One of the following courses: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 410 - Advanced Topics and Experiments </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 441 - Senior Research Seminar </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Advanced Courses </H3><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One additional advanced astronomy course (300 or higher) </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Three additional advanced courses chosen from the following:  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>physics or astronomy (300 or higher) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>at least one course from geology (250 or higher) </LBody></LI></L></L></L><P>o chemistry (300 or higher) Students should select these courses in consultation with the academic adviser and/or the astrogeophysics program director.

The Neuroscience program at Colgate is one of the first two established at undergraduate institutions in the U.S., and has a particularly strong focus on brain-behavior relationships. Its interdisciplinary faculty are drawn from the Department of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences and the Department of Biology. Additionally, majors take courses in the fields of chemistry, computer science, math, philosophy, and physics. In addition to a broad education, the program offers students the opportunity to focus their research interests on a variety of levels of nervous system functioning, ranging from the activity of single neurons to the behavior of complex organisms. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The William E. and Nellie K.

Lindsay O'Connor Chair Shin </TH></TR></Table><P>The basic objective of the Department of Economics is the development of students' understanding of economics as the social science that deals with production, consumption, and market exchange activities. All students begin with ECON 151 - Introduction to Economics. Majors advance through a core of analytical courses and choose among a series of options in theoretical and applied economics. Students with an interest in graduate work leading to careers in such fields as economics, law, business, public administration, or the foreign service are asked to discuss these objectives early in their college careers in order to plan an adequate program in economics. While not an undergraduate business or professional school, the department provides essential background for a variety of career interests. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Information </H2><P>ECON 151 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered above 200. ECON 251 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered between 300 and 349. ECON 251 and ECON 252 are prerequisites for all courses numbered between 350 and 374. ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375 are prerequisites for all courses above 375. </P><P>Courses numbered below ECON 150, including ECON 105, cannot be counted as part of the major program. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Preparation for Graduate School </H2><P>For students considering graduate school in business administration, at least two courses in mathematics (preferably MATH 161 and MATH 162) and one computer science course (such as COSC 101) are strongly recommended. Students considering graduate school in economics are strongly encouraged to take these courses, as well as additional courses in mathematics, including MATH 214 and MATH 377. Students with these interests should also consider the mathematical economics major described here and consult with their academic adviser as early as possible. Students considering graduate work in economics leading to a PhD should consider pursuing a double major in economics and mathematics. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Chi-Ming Hou Award for Excellence in International Economics — established in honor of the late Chi-Ming Hou, who was a member of the Colgate economics department from 1956 to 1991, for outstanding achievement in international economics. </P><P>The Marshall-Keynes Award for Excellence in Economics — awarded by the department to the senior with the strongest, sustained performance in analytical economics. </P><P>The J. Melbourne Shortliffe Prizes — established in honor of the late J. Melbourne Shortliffe, chair of the economics department emeritus, and awarded to outstanding graduating seniors who have majored in economics. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credits </H2><P>A score of 4 or 5 on both the microeconomics and macroeconomics AP exams will exempt incoming students from ECON 151; no credit is given if only one AP exam is taken or if a score of 3 or lower is received on either exam. No transfer credit is given for ECON 105 - Principles of Accounting. Except for students transferring from another college or university, no transfer credit will be given for ECON 251, ECON 252, or ECON 375, and no more than two courses in economics taken elsewhere can be accepted for major credit. An exception may be made in cases when the student has pre-matriculation credit for ECON 151; students should contact the department chair. Courses taken elsewhere must be comparable to what is offered in a liberal arts economics program. </P><P>Students who hope to transfer course credit must consult with the department prior to enrolling elsewhere. Students returning from summer courses, study groups or approved programs are not entitled to retroactively seek major credit in the department. Students are eligible to transfer up to two economics electives towards the major (and one elective for the minor), pending pre-approval from the department. Major or minor credit is normally only granted for courses taken while participating in an approved program that is on the economics department list.  </P><P>All transfer courses must have a minimum prerequisite that is equivalent to Colgate's ECON 151 course and the department recommends taking courses that have ECON 251 and/or ECON 252 as prerequisites. Students who transfer to Colgate from other institutions may be granted more than two course credits toward the major at the discretion of the department chair. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>Economics </P><P>To be invited to participate in the honors program, students need a minimum 3.33 GPA in the three core courses: ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375. To qualify for departmental honors, a student must enroll in the year-long honors seminar (ECON 489 and ECON 490) in which each student writes an honors thesis. Students also present their projects to the seminar and act as discussants of other projects. Certification of honors and high honors will be based mainly on the quality of the honors paper. In addition, honors candidates must have, at graduation, a B+ average (A– for high honors) in the nine economics courses taken for major credit, and must receive a satisfactory grade in ECON 490. </P><P>Mathematical Economics </P><P>Special rules apply to honors in mathematical economics. </P><P>Since the major also includes the requirements for an economics program, special rules apply for honors. A mathematical economics major has two mutually exclusive options: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>qualifying for honors or high honors in economics by satisfying the honors criteria for the economics major.

The department also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program for students preparing to teach at both the elementary and secondary level. </P><P>Given these programs, the department offers a comprehensive study of formal and informal educational institutions and practices, and the ways they are affected by social forces. Interdisciplinary by design, classes draw on diverse methods of inquiry to critically analyze the historical and contemporary ways that people educate and are educated in the United States and societies across the globe. Theory, research, and practice work together to help students become more reflective and engaged as cultural workers, citizens, and critical thinkers. Students learn to ask questions about the relationships between knowledge, power, and identity in educational contexts, and to reimagine education and its contribution to a democratic society. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Groups </H2><P>The South Korea Study Group is a joint program between Educational Studies and Asian Studies. The program offers a dynamic experience for any Colgate University student due in part to its efforts to become a leader in the newly forming globalized world in which we live. South Korea is highly regarded for its rapid modernization, yet the people still hold to its traditional ways in mind and spirit. While the focus is on students' development of educational studies theory and practice from a global perspective, they also gain a fascinating sociocultural experience. </P><P>Students enroll in four courses. The Director provides two courses for the students, one of which provides an opportunity to design a research project with a fieldwork component. Students then take two courses from the host university, Yonsei University. Yonsei offers a variety of courses in English. One course must be on the topic of Korea or East Asia. Prerequisites normally include EDUC 101 and at least one course in Asian Studies. </P><P>The Philadelphia Study Group offers students who are interested in a wide range of questions in and around education, urban studies, public policy, and social justice a full semester of coursework and experience in one of the most historically iconic and dynamic cities in the world. Lauded as &quot;the birthplace of American democracy,&quot; Philadelphia offers students a place to explore some of the most pressing questions around contemporary education policy and its relationship to material questions about the changing spatial and demographic topographies of American cities. In close conversations with students, teachers, families, and community members, this program provides an experimental platform to gain a more critical understanding about the issues surrounding contemporary education and urban policy and the community-based struggles that have emerged in response. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Award for Excellence in Childhood Education — awarded by the department for excellence in elementary student teaching. </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Adolescence Education — awarded by the department for excellence in secondary student teaching. </P><P>The Charles H.

GPA is only one factor in the application, but generally students with an overall GPA of 3.30 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 will be considered for graduation with honors in educational studies. An award of &quot;high honors&quot; is only awarded to work that shows exceptional scholarly insight and innovation. </P><P>All majors will be notified at the beginning of the fall semester of their senior year of the honors application procedures. The application deadline will normally be in late October and includes a current transcript, a letter of recommendation, and a full proposal of the honors project to be conducted in the Honors Seminar. </P><P>Students will need to work closely with a department faculty member, ideally the faculty member leading EDUC 450 Senior Seminar Capstone in the fall semester, prior to submitting the proposal. Seniors will normally develop their honors project proposal during the fall term while enrolled in EDUC 450; however, completion of EDUC 450 is not a prerequisite for the honors seminar.  </P><P>Department faculty will review all proposals and will notify students of their standing prior to the end of the fall semester. Once admitted, students will typically enroll in the Honors Seminar during the spring term of their senior year. </P><P>Students are required to defend their thesis. The defense will normally take place during the last week of classes in the spring semester. This involves a formal presentation of the thesis. The entire Department of Educational Studies faculty will attend the defense and provide input to the Honors Seminar professor and the faculty adviser.   </P><P>The designation of 'honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or neither will be determined by the Honors Seminar professor, the faculty adviser, and any assigned reader. </P><P>An honors project must bring something new into the world—it must teach us something or consider a particular question in a new light. In order to do this well, students will need to clearly articulate what the field of Educational Studies is and how their project is situated within our modes of inquiry/knowledge production. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Teacher Preparation Program </H2><P>Director Gardner </P><P>The preparation of teachers is an all-university responsibility, generally directed by the Department of Educational Studies. The program encompasses liberal studies in education as well as studies and experiences designed to develop teaching effectiveness and professional leadership. The emphasis is on developing the student's ability to relate knowledge and theory to skillful teaching in the interest of promoting greater social justice and environmental sustainability. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) childhood and adolescence programs are currently accredited through the Teacher Education Accreditation Council. Colgate University is a member in good standing of the Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP) with an anticipated Quality Assurance Review in Spring 2022. </P><P>There are five ways to become a certified public school teacher through the Teacher Preparation Program at Colgate. The first is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the four-year undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in childhood education (grades 1–6). The second is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the four-year undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in secondary education (grades 7–12 in Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, English, Mathematics, Physics, or Social Studies). The third is the undergraduate option where teacher candidates return for a ninth semester to complete the professional semester including student teaching for either the elementary or secondary level. The fourth and fifth pathways are through Colgate's MAT program in both childhood education and adolescent education. </P><P>Successful completion of all requirements in all certification programs leads to recommendation for New York State initial teacher certification. </P><P>Students interested in pursuing teacher certification in New York State are strongly encouraged to have taken EDUC 101, one of the Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning classes and one of The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  courses prior to the end of their sophomore year. </P><P>Students who wish to enter the program should submit an application to the Director of Teacher Preparation as soon as possible. Application materials include a personal teaching statement, transcripts, an academic writing piece, and a letter of recommendation. Acceptance into a teacher certification program does not guarantee acceptance into the student-teaching semester. </P><P>Students are tentatively approved for student teaching in the spring of their junior year for undergraduates. Final approval depends on successful completion of all prerequisite courses in their program by the end of the spring term. A decision is made by the department to approve a candidate for student teaching based on previous academic performance at Colgate as well as the apparent suitability of the candidate for the teaching profession. The student must also submit to the program a letter of recommendation written by an individual who, ideally, has observed the student in some teaching/learning capacity in a school setting. For content and pedagogical core courses required by the New York undergraduate students must receive a grade of C or above and graduate students must receive a grade of B- or above in order to meet expectations. Students must achieve at least a 3.0 cumulative grade point average, or its equivalent, in the program leading to the baccalaureate or graduate degree in order to be eligible for program completion and certification. </P><P>Candidates for teacher certification in New York must pass competency examinations prepared by the State Education Department (for comparative data from Colgate and other teacher education programs within New York State see www.highered.nysed.gov). Teacher certification students are required to spend a minimum of 100 hours in a variety of field experiences related to coursework prior to student teaching. Please note that completing certification requirements is not the same as majoring in educational studies. </P><P>Students who wish to gain New York State teacher certification have the option of completing their professional semester in the fall term following graduation as part of the ninth semester program. To be eligible for this special program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification prerequisites prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students admitted into the ninth semester program will be charged a small administrative fee (currently waived), must meet the usual requirements for enrollment at Colgate (such as proof of health insurance), and are responsible for locating their own off-campus housing. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their senior year. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Childhood Education Teacher Certification </H2><P>The elementary certification program is currently offered at both the undergraduate and graduate level. The program leads to New York State teacher certification in grades 1–6. It combines a program of study with both liberal arts and educational coursework. Students are required to obtain 24 liberal arts credits out of a total of 32 in order to be eligible for state certification as an undergraduate. </P><P>Students should begin the certification program as early as possible in their academic career at Colgate. Students are required to apply to the teacher preparation program with a suggested deadline of November 1 of their sophomore year. Students will complete student teaching during the fall term of their senior year or in an extended ninth-semester. This professional semester includes two teaching methodology seminars, and an advanced course on the diagnosis and remediation of reading problems. </P><P>For more information visit the educational studies department page. </P><Sect><H3>Certificate Requirements </H3><P>Education as a Social Institution </P><P> EDUC 101 - The American School </P><P>Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning </P><P>One course from Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning </P><P>The Nature of Childhood Education and Development </P><P>All of the courses from The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  </P><Sect><H3>Professional Student Teaching Semester </H3><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 451 - Seminar on Curriculum and Instruction in English/Social Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 453 - Seminar on Curriculum and Instruction in Science/Mathematics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 454 - Diagnosis and Remediation of Reading Problems </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 455 - Student Teaching </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 456 - Dignity in Schools (0.25 credits), also satisfies DASA training </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Course requirements outside of Educational Studies </H3><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One laboratory science course in biology, chemistry, physics, geology, or astronomy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One American history course </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One mathematics course </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One computer literacy course from the following:  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>COSC 100 Computers in the Arts and Sciences   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>MATH 105 or CORE 143S - Introduction to Statistics   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>PSYC 309 - Quantitative Methods in Behavioral Research </LBody></LI></L></L></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Other Requirements </H3><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Fieldwork — 100 hours </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Child abuse workshop (two hours of training in the identification of suspected child abuse/maltreatment) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Violence intervention and prevention workshop </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Fingerprinting </LBody></LI></L></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Educational Studies Major </H2><P>Courses are designed for liberal arts students interested in studying the problems and prospects of education, the nature and function of educational inquiry, the processes and outcomes of educational practices, the role of educational theory in school practice, and the relation of educational institutions to other social institutions.

Courses taken from non-approved programs may be eligible for one major credit with department approval. Regardless of the source, the number of non-Colgate courses used for major credit in geography cannot exceed two. To be accepted, courses must be comparable in quality and scope to courses offered at Colgate. Students who hope to transfer course credit must consult with the department chair prior to enrolling elsewhere. Transfer credits may not be used to satisfy the department's required courses. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>Students in geography wishing to pursue honors must have a major GPA of 3.50 or better. Students pursuing honors who have a major GPA of 3.70 or better may be eligible for high honors. In such cases, the geography faculty will determine whether the completed honors project is of sufficient quality to warrant such an award. Eligible seniors who wish to pursue honors must follow the guidelines for honors in geography. If approved for preliminary honors work, students will register for GEOG 490, a half-credit course in preparation for honors work, during the fall semester. If given final approval for honors work, students will register for GEOG 499 during the spring term. At the end of the spring term, candidates for honors will make oral presentations of their completed honors projects to the members of the department. The decision to award honors will be made by the department in consultation with the faculty advisers based on the quality of the honors project, oral defense, and other evidence of distinction. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Related Major </H2><P> Environmental Geography Major  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Australia Study Group (fall term) </H2><P>This study group is sponsored by the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies Program (ENST) and focuses on the social and environmental diversity of Australia.

Moore, Riley, Sparber </TH></TR></Table><P>For those interested in world affairs, Colgate offers a major program in International Relations (IR). Students may also take IR as a minor. Study in the program begins with POSC 232, which is normally taken in the sophomore year. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors </H2><P>A candidate for honors in IR must choose an adviser for an honors paper and fulfill the honors requirements for the department of the faculty adviser. In addition, the honors student must (1) achieve a minimum GPA of </P><P>3.50 in the nine IR courses, (2) attain a minimum overall GPA of 3.25, (3) submit a substantial research paper that is judged superior (A– or higher) by two program faculty members. </P><P>A student whose adviser is a member of the Department of Political Science must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium (POSC 498 and POSC 499) in which each student writes an honors thesis. POSC 498 will be taken in the fall semester, followed by POSC 499 in the spring semester. A grade will be given in both POSC 498 and POSC 499. Seniors who anticipate graduating with a GPA eligible for honors should speak with their advisers or the IR director in the semester prior to doing honors. POSC 498 and POSC 499 are to be taken in addition to the nine courses counted toward the IR major. </P><P>A candidate for high honors in IR must fulfill the following additional requirements: (1) achieve a minimum GPA of 3.60 in IR courses, (2) attain an overall GPA of at least 3.40, (3) gain approval of the paper as superior by a third reader, and (4) pass with distinction an oral examination by the three readers of the submitted paper. As above, the professor supervising the research must give prior approval of the paper. </P><P>Students may choose whether the grades received in both POSC 498 and 499, or neither, are to be counted toward their major GPA. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Groups </H2><P>Students are encouraged but not required to participate in off-campus study. The IR program cosponsors a study group in Geneva that typically runs once per year. On the Geneva study group, students receive one core subfield credit for POSC 357, and two elective credits: one for an internship course and the other for a course taken at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. IR majors who are pursuing French to complete their foreign language requirement can receive credit at the 100 or 200 level for an intensive course taken at the beginning of the Geneva study group. See Off-Campus Study for more information. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credits </H2><P>Students participating in off-campus approved programs can seek transfer credits to satisfy certain IR major and minor requirements—most commonly language courses, IR electives, or History electives. Students wishing to receive the upper-level Economics credit must seek additional approval from Colgate's economics department. In very rare circumstances students may receive credit for a core subfield class. POSC 232 - Fundamentals of International Relations (IR) and the IR seminar must be taken on campus. </P><P>Students should seek preapproval for any off-campus courses from the IR director, who will evaluate individual courses with respect to their rigor and substantive appropriateness. Courses whose subject matter is not international cannot receive IR credit; courses with reading and/or writing assignments below Colgate standards can only receive credit on a two-for-one basis—i.e., two off-campus courses count for one IR credit. This two-for-one formula applies to most courses taken on non-Colgate programs. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Paul O. Stillman '55 Award — given annually to an outstanding senior(s) majoring in International Relations. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>International Relations Major </H2><Sect><H3>Major Requirements </H3><P>Students are strongly encouraged to complete most required courses by the end of the junior year. As a general rule, the only requirements students can complete off campus are the elective and History courses as well as appropriate language courses; in all such cases, students must seek prior approval from the IR director. </P><P>For students seeking a major in International Relations and a minor in Political Science, no courses may be counted toward both. </P><P>POSC 152 - Global Peace and War (IR), does not ordinarily count toward the IR major. Students who take POSC 152 before deciding on an IR major must also take POSC 232, but may count POSC 152 as one of the two IR electives with written permission from the IR program director. </P><P>Students who have AP credit for ECON 151 must take one additional elective course. </P><P>The major program consists of the following requirements: </P><Sect><H3>Foundational Course </H3><P> POSC 232 - Fundamentals of International Relations (IR) (a prerequisite for upper-level courses for IR majors) </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Core Political Science Subfield Courses </H3><P>At least two of the following POSC courses: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 349 - The International Political Economy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 353 - National Security </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 357 - International Institutions </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 366 - Contemporary American Foreign Policy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 374 - International Law </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>Economics Courses </H3><P>All of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ECON 151 - Introduction to Economics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ECON 249 - International Economics (Students who have completed the relevant prerequisites may take ECON 349 in place of ECON 249.) </LBody></LI></L><P>Students are strongly encouraged to take ECON 249 before their senior year </P></Sect><Sect><H3>History Courses </H3><P>One of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 105 - Introduction to the Modern Middle East (ME) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 216 - U.S. Foreign Policy, 1917 - Present (US) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 219 - Oceanic Histories (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 232 - The Crusades (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 237 - Empires and Global History:1400-1700 (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 238 - Europe in the Age of the Renaissance and Reformation (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 255 - The Ottoman Empire, 1300 - 1924 (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 263 - Cities of the Silk Road (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 265 - War and Violence in East Asia (AS) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 271 - The First World War (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 272 - War and Holocaust in Europe (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 284 - Decolonization in Africa (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 316 - The United States in Vietnam, 1945 - 1975 (US) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 350 - Contemporary European History, 1945 to the Present (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 358 - Conquest and Colony: Cultural Encounters in the Americas (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 368 - China, the Great Wall, and Beyond (AS) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 370 - The Mongol Empire (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 381 - Pre-Colonial Africa (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 382 - Modern Africa (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 385 - Darfur in Historical Perspective (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 482 - Seminar on Problems in British History since 1800 (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 489 - Seminar on Problems in Military History (TR) </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H3>IR Seminar </H3><P>Unless the director grants specific permission, the seminar must be taken on campus.

The curriculum includes courses in the principal fields of the discipline, including American and comparative government and politics, international relations, and political theory. Through coursework and independent study projects, students confront some of the enduring questions of politics while studying political institutions, processes, behavior, and theory. Internships in Washington on the D.C. study group combine rigorous analysis of politics and government with direct exposure to Congress, the national executive, political parties, interest groups, think tanks, and media. Similarly, study and internships in Geneva, Switzerland, on the department's other study group, provide students with the opportunity to travel widely in Europe and to become immersed in the world of international organizations. The honors colloquium, in addition, offers students the opportunity to conduct significant research under the supervision of a faculty member. Students who major in political science are likely to be well prepared for future careers or graduate study in such fields as law, public service, international affairs, business management, teaching, journalism, and many others. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Course Information </H2><P>Course classifications: </P><P>American politics (AM) Comparative politics (CO) International relations (IR) Political theory (TH) </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>Colgate's chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha is a national honorary society that recognizes the accomplishments of undergraduate political science students. </P><P>The Dr. William L.

Only one transfer credit will be accepted toward the minor. These courses must have been approved for transfer credit by the Colgate registrar and by the member of the Department of Political Science designated to evaluate them. In all instances, courses accepted for major or minor credit must be comparable in quality, quantity of reading and writing, and scope of coverage to courses offered in the department. Transfer credits will not ordinarily be offered for POSC-100 level courses or POSC 232. 400-level courses will not be accepted under any circumstances. Students who anticipate applying for major or minor credit for a course or courses to be taken at another institution should consult with the department's transfer credit representative before enrolling elsewhere. </P><P>Students transferring to Colgate from other universities: The department will accept for major credit up to four political science courses at the 100-, 200- or 300-level taken at a student's prior academic institution. Up to two courses may be accepted toward the minor. In all instances, courses accepted for major or minor credit must be comparable in quality, quantity of reading and writing, and scope of coverage to courses offered in the department. 400-level courses will not be accepted under any circumstances. Transfer students who anticipate applying for major or minor credit for a course or courses they have already taken at another institution should consult with the department's transfer credit representative before declaring political science as their major or minor.  </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>Students with outstanding records in political science may pursue honors. To qualify, a student must have, at graduation, an overall GPA of 3.40 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 in the eleven or more courses taken to satisfy the major requirement for honors. A student must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium (POSC 498 and POSC 499). Major credit and grades used in determining departmental GPA will be awarded for both courses. Each student in the fall while enrolled in POSC 498 will complete an in-depth written literature review of his or her subject of interest; then, in the spring while enrolled in POSC 499, students will write a lengthy thesis. Each course is graded separately, but enrollment in POSC 499 is contingent on the successful completion of POSC 498, and the recommendation of the seminar director and the student's primary adviser. Although these courses are designed for and required of those hoping to stand for honors or high honors at graduation, neither is restricted to them; rising seniors with a strong interest in some area of political science and a proven academic record of accomplishment who would like to explore further a chosen area of research in a collaborative environment should also consider enrolling. It is critically important that juniors interested in doing an honors thesis in their senior year, speak both with their advisers and members of the faculty conducting research in an area of common interest while searching for a primary adviser to guide their independent research during their senior year. </P><P>All students who have successfully completed the honors sequence will be eligible for honors or high honors. Whether a student receives honors or high honors ultimately depends upon the outcome of their thesis research. To be awarded honors, a thesis must be judged superior both by the faculty member guiding the student's research and the seminar director of POSC 499. A thesis judged by these readers to be potentially worthy of high honors will, with the agreement of the student, be submitted to a third reader. An oral defense will then be scheduled at which time the student is examined both on the content of the thesis and his or her knowledge of the general field of inquiry. The three readers then make the final decision as to whether the student will receive high honors at graduation. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Related Majors </H2><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Asian Studies Students may select a topical major in Asian studies with a focus on India, China, or Japan, including related departmental courses in political science. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>International Relations Students with a singular focus on the international political realm take, in conjunction with those in political science, courses in the languages, economics, history, and allied fields. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Peace and Conflict Studies Students interested in this major may enroll in the interdisciplinary Peace and Conflict Studies Program. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Groups </H2><P>Washington </P><P>The Washington Study Group, conducted in the spring term each year, provides a unique opportunity for a select group of Colgate students to study the working processes of the American national government at close range. See &quot;Undergraduate Program&quot;. Study group members take four courses during their term in Washington, one of which is an internship. Students receive three course credits toward completing the political science major (POSC 410, POSC 412, and POSC 414) and one university credit toward graduation (POSC 413). Prerequisites: POSC 150, POSC 210, or POSC 211. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Geneva, Switzerland </H2><P>The Geneva Study Group, conducted in the fall and/or spring terms of each year, provides a rewarding opportunity for a highly select group of Colgate students to study the workings of international organizations, the politics of the European Union and of Western European nations, and other related matters while living and traveling in the heart of Western Europe. Intensive language and cultural immersion in a French homestay, and internship opportunities working in international and non-governmental organizations are important parts of the program. </P><P>At least one college-level French course is a prerequisite. Study group directors may specify other prerequisites, but as a general rule students are required to take POSC 232 prior to the start of the program. Students are also strongly encouraged to take at least one other political science or history course in the politics, culture, history, international relations, or economies of Europe. </P><P>For further information, please see Off-Campus Study. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Political Science Major </H2><Sect><H3>Major Requirements </H3><P>Normally, no more than two independent study courses or political science courses taken on an off-campus study group are accepted for major credit.

In consultation with their faculty advisers, students should plan course sequences that fulfill major requirements while allowing them, if so desired, to develop particular interests in some depth while still gaining a well-rounded grounding in the discipline. All majors are encouraged, as well, to take electives in other closely allied social sciences. </P><P>The 100-level courses are designed for students likely to major in other fields of study as well as those considering a major or minor in political science. The 200-level courses are intended to serve as gateway courses to the major as well as to particular subfields. Both the 100- and 200-level courses, then, serve as general introductions providing a broad foundation in the discipline and are particularly suitable for first - and second -year students. The 300- and 400-level courses are, in most instances, somewhat more demanding and less general than lower-level courses and allow students to explore a specific topic in greater depth. These courses are generally directed, but not limited, to the needs of juniors and seniors. Majors and others interested in one particular area of the discipline, for example in international relations, can take up to seven courses, seminars, or independent studies in that area of interest, especially in classes at the 300 and 400 level. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Political Science Department </H3><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Political Science department catalog page. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Political Science Minor </H2><Sect><H3>Minor Requirements </H3><P>Normally, no more than one independent study course, transfer credit, or political science course taken while participating in a Colgate off-campus study group (except those study groups sponsored by the Department of Political Science) is accepted for credit toward a minor. Requests for exceptions must be approved in advance by the faculty member designated to authorize transfer credits. </P><P>No course with a grade below C will count as credit for the minor. </P><P>A student may not count courses toward a political science minor, which are being counted toward a major in international relations. </P><P>The requirements for a minor in political science are as follows: </P><P>The minor consists of five political science courses. Of these five courses, two must be at the 100 or 200 level and three must be at the 300 or 400 level. The two 100- or 200-level courses cannot be from the same subfield of the curriculum. They must be from two of the following: American politics (AM), comparative politics (CO), international relations (IR), and political theory (TH). </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Political Science Department </H3><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Political Science department catalog page. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Sociology and Anthropology </H2><Figure><ImageData src="images/2021-2022+Colgate+University+CatalogXML_img_7.jpg"/>Faculty </Figure><P>Professors Benson, Bigenho, Henke, Hsu, Hyslop, Loe, Lopes, Moran, Ries Associate Professors De Lucia, Russo, Shever (Chair), Simmons, Spadola, Villarrubia Assistant Professors Abdul-Malak, Avera, Juarez Visiting Professor Newman Visiting Assistant Professor Lau Visiting Instructors Helepololei, Hunt, Kolarevic </P><P>Sociology and anthropology study human cultures and societies, past and present, on a comparative basis. These disciplines are concerned with analyzing and understanding the social structures and values that shape our lives, as well as the institutions and social forces of our own and other societies. The major in sociology or anthropology provides an excellent preparation for graduate study and a variety of careers, including law, education, business, public policy, communication, journalism, health, counseling, and social work. Sociology and anthropology graduates also pursue careers in local, national, and international nonprofit organizations. The department offers two majors, an Anthropology Major and a Sociology Major. </P><P>In keeping with the University's policy, no declarations of major or minor will be accepted after the fall full-term withdrawal period of a student's senior year. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>See the Anthropology Major and the Sociology Major pages for honors and high honors information. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Award for Excellence in Sociology and Anthropology — awarded by the department to a student on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework within the department. </P><P>The Ramshaw Service Award — established by Warren C. and Molly Ramshaw. Warren Ramshaw taught in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology from 1961 to 1992. The award is presented to an undergraduate student in recognition of outstanding community service and academic achievement. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Off-Campus Study </H2><P>Students are strongly encouraged to expand the scope of their academic experiences by studying off campus. SOAN faculty help guide each student toward the off-campus study experiences that complement and build on his or her overall course plan; we encourage students not to think of off-campus study as a semester-long break from Colgate but rather as a way to enhance on-campus course work. Students often use off-campus study as a way to collect data for use in senior seminars and honors projects. Since Anthropology majors are encouraged to complete fieldwork, off-campus study can often be rewarding and useful in this way. More information on off-campus study can be found on the Sociology and Anthropology web page. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>Sociology maintains a list of summer and study abroad programs offering courses that are equivalent to departmental standards. These are the only programs that the department accepts transfer credits from. Sociology majors may use two transfer credits to satisfy their elective requirements; sociology minors may use one. The following courses cannot be transferred for major credit: SOCI 101, SOCI 201, SOCI 250, SOCI 453, SOCI 494, and SOCI 495. Exceptions for students transferring to Colgate from another college or university are made on a case-by-case basis. </P><P>Anthropology will accept for major credit no more than two courses taken at another institution and no more than one independent study course in the department, except in special circumstances as approved by the department. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>The Longyear Museum of Anthropology </H2><P>The Longyear Museum of Anthropology enhances the teaching and research facilities of the department. The museum, founded in 1965 and named after Dr. John M. Longyear III, professor of anthropology, emeritus, contains archaeological, ethnographic, and contemporary art collections from a wide range of cultures around the world. The collections of African art, Canadian First Nations art, Haudenosaunee archaeological materials from central New York, and the central Mexican (Guerrero) stone sculptures are extensive. </P><P>Students may take advantage of the resources of the museum in a variety of ways. ANTH 253 - Field Methods and Interpretation in Archaeology (RI) and ANTH 300 - Museum Studies in Native American Cultures  offer students the opportunity to become acquainted with the museum holdings and to carry out research projects on selected collections of artifacts. Students may also arrange independent studies working with the museum collections and receive credit in either the Department of Sociology and Anthropology or in the Native American Studies Program, which is sponsored by the Division of University Studies. Students are encouraged to inquire at the office of the curator of the Longyear Museum of Anthropology concerning independent studies projects in cultural anthropology or archaeology, as well as for information concerning museum internship programs and opportunities in museum studies and summer programs in archaeological or ethnographic fieldwork. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Related Majors </H2><P>The sociology and anthropology department, along with departments in the social sciences, arts and humanities, and natural sciences, offers an interdisciplinary major in Native American Studies with a study group in Santa Fe. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Anthropology Major </H2><P>Anthropology is the study of human beings in all their complexity. The scope of anthropology is truly global, as it aims to describe and analyze the full diversity of the human experience and cultural creativity across time and space. Anthropology recognizes that human beings are, simultaneously, social actors who create cultures and the products of those cultures. Using a broad array of research methods, including participant-observation and archaeological excavation, anthropologists investigate the historical composition of societies, their transformations, and their contemporary forms. We seek to understand the commonalities and differences in the identities, experiences, and beliefs of people around the world. We connect the details of people's everyday lives to large-scale social systems and cultural forces and reveal that seemingly innate or natural differences among human groups are the result of historical, social, and political-economic processes.  </P><P>The curriculum integrates classroom and out-of-classroom learning, encouraging students to pursue off-campus study and independent fieldwork or research with collections. Students are encouraged to engage </P><P>in hands-on learning activities: anthropological and/or archaeological research, and/or community-engaged learning. </P><P>Students in the Class of 2021 can find the previous major requirements in the 2018-2019 University Catalog. </P><Sect><H3>Major Requirements </H3><P>The anthropology major consists of 9 courses.

For example, cultural anthropologists take seriously the idea of fieldwork and participant observation over an extended period of time, and often in places where one engages significant cultural differences. Therefore, students are encouraged to seek anthropology-approved off-campus study opportunities that feature: home stays, coursework in a second language, independent research projects, and/or different community service learning opportunities. Students are also encouraged to seek off-campus opportunities that involve ethnographic or archaeological fieldwork, or work in museum exhibits. All research intensive activities form part of students' cumulative curricular experience that will prepare them for the senior thesis seminar. </P><P>To meet the Research Intensive component outside of courses, students may seek approval from their anthropology adviser to satisfy this area with one of the following activities: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Interning in Colgate's Longyear Museum of Anthropology during the academic year or summer. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Working with faculty on funded summer research projects (subject to department approval) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Participating in other off-campus anthropology approved programs that involve opportunities for substantial experiential learning and/or independent research (subject to department approval).

Students are expected to design substantive research projects grounded in recent anthropological theory and relevant literature on their topics and collect and analyze appropriate ethnographic or cultural data. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>GPA Requirement </H3><P>To qualify for graduation, a minimum GPA of 2.0 is required in all courses counting toward the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Honors and High Honors </H3><P>Majors may qualify for honors in anthropology by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.50 in all departmental courses and an overall GPA of 3.30, or for high honors by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.70 in all departmental courses and an overall GPA of 3.30, and submitting a thesis judged by department faculty to be worthy of honors or high honors. </P><P>Any student in the junior year who believes he or she will reach the qualifying GPA is strongly encouraged to discuss potential honors or high honors projects with departmental faculty. All seniors will normally enroll in ANTH 452 - Senior Seminar in Anthropology in the fall of their senior year and begin work on a thesis of their own design. To continue to pursue honors or high honors, students must receive at least an A- on the final thesis of the senior seminar. Those students pursuing honors or high honors will significantly revise and expand their seminar theses by enrolling in ANTH 495 - Independent Study for Honors and High Honors, in the spring semester (if a substantial number of students are pursuing honors and high honors in a given year, the group may be organized into a formal honors seminar). They will work with a primary advisor and a secondary reader to complete the project. </P><P>Certification of honors and high honors is primarily based on the quality of the written thesis and participation in a public presentation. To receive honors, a three-person faculty committee must determine that it is strong in each of the following areas: asking and answering a clear anthropological research question, engaging deeply with social theory, collecting and analyzing empirical materials, and writing in a well-organized and professional style. To receive high honors, the committee must determine that the thesis is excellent in each area. Note: ANTH 495 is an additional requirement for students pursuing honors and high honors and cannot be counted as one of the electives required for the major. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H3>Sociology and Anthropology Department </H3><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Sociology and Anthropology department catalog page. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Anthropology Minor </H2><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Required Courses </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ANTH 102 - Culture, Diversity, and Inequality (completed by the end of the sophomore year with a grade of C or better) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ANTH 103 - Introduction to Archaeology (completed by the end of the sophomore year with a grade of C or better) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Three additional ANTH electives, at least 2 must be at the 300 level </LBody></LI></L><P>The department will accept for minor credit no more than one course taken at another institution and no more than one independent studies course in the department, except in special circumstances as approved by the department. </P><Sect><H3>GPA Requirement </H3><P>A minimum GPA of 2.00 is required in all courses counting toward the minor. </P></Sect><Sect><H3>Sociology and Anthropology Department </H3><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Sociology and Anthropology department catalog page. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Sociology Major </H2><P>Sociology is the scientific study of the organization and functioning of societies, their major institutions, groups, and values. Sociologists are particularly interested in understanding and explaining social issues and problems, and the sources of stress and change in contemporary and historical societies. Our courses provide students with critical perspectives on a wide range of major social issues, including social inequality, race/ethnicity, gender/sexuality, the media, immigration, social movements, globalization, crime/deviance, education, war, and environmental issues. In addition, students take courses on classical and contemporary sociological theory, research design, and qualitative and quantitative research methods. The culmination of our curriculum is the required senior seminar. This course provides an opportunity for students to draw on their substantive and methodological training to complete an independent research project on a topic of their choice. Students majoring or minoring in sociology go on to careers in fields such as communications, marketing, business, management, education, law, medicine/public health, and the nonprofit sector. </P><P>Students in the Class of 2021 can find the previous major requirements in the 2018-2019 University Catalog. </P><Sect><H3>Major Requirements </H3><P>The sociology major consists of nine courses, only one of which may be outside of sociology.

The ALST curriculum centers Black diaspora experiences, Indigenous articulations, and transhemispheric migrations–while engaging historical and ongoing structures of racism and colonialism, and anti-colonial projects of resistance within these contexts. Underpinning our curriculum is the belief that Africans, African Americans, Latin Americans &amp; Latinxs, and the peoples of the Caribbean share historical and political experiences, as well as relationships to Blackness and Indigeneity, that provide rich opportunities for interdisciplinary and comparative studies.  </P><P>The major in Africana and Latin American studies consists of nine courses. There are three required courses: the introductory course (ALST 199); a 300-level course on a major concept, figure, or key knowledge producing community in Black &amp; Latinx Studies (ALST 3XX); and a 400-level capstone seminar (ALST 4XX or UNST 410). Students will choose six electives from across different disciplines according to their intellectual and professional interests. These electives may center on a particular region (i.e., Latin America, Africa, the U.S., or the Caribbean), a set of themes, or a disciplinary approach. All students are encouraged to pursue language and off campus study opportunities relevant to their interests. For majors, a maximum of two courses from a student's second major or minors may be counted for the ALST major, with the approval of the ALST director. </P><P>The minor in Africana and Latin American studies consists of six courses: ALST 199 or ALST 3XX, and five electives from across different disciplines according to the student's intellectual and professional interests. No more than one of these courses may also be counted toward a student's major or another minor. </P><P>Substitution of other appropriate or equivalent courses, independent studies, or special study groups for the degree requirements may be possible, but must be approved by the director of Africana and Latin American Studies. Transfer courses, field study, and one-time-only courses by visiting professors can be credited toward the major or minor only with approval of the program director. A minimum average GPA of 2.00 in the courses chosen to count toward the major or minor in Africana and Latin American studies is required for graduation. </P><P>The relationship between students and their advisor is a vital one, and it is imperative that each major and minor meet with their advisor at least once a semester to assess progress toward meeting graduation requirements. </P><P>More than one Core Communities or Core Communities and Identities course may be counted toward the major or minor, but only one Core course used to meet Liberal Arts Core Curriculum requirements may also be counted toward the major or minor. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Wangari Maathai and Nelson Mandela Award for Excellence in African Studies -- awarded to a graduating senior with the highest grade point average in African studies courses. The award celebrates Wangarĩ Maathai and Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela.  </P><P>Wangarĩ Maathai was a Kenyan educator, environmentalist, and political activist who became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. She was also the founder of the Green Belt Movement, a broad-based grassroots organization, whose main focus is poverty reduction and environmental conservation through tree planting. Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela was a South African lawyer, anti-apartheid activist, and political leader who served as South Africa's first democratically-elected president </P><P>(c. 1994-99). He also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. </P><P>The Pauli Murray Award for Excellence in African American Studies -- awarded to a graduating senior in recognition of their outstanding academic achievements in African American studies courses and their distinction as an ambassador of our program's values. This award celebrates the legal trailblazing, intellectual life, and legacy of Pauli Murray and represents the African American Studies program's commitment to studying the histories, cultures, and traditions of African Americans in the United States and around the world. </P><P>Rev. Pauli Murray, lawyer, author, and women's rights activist-intellectual was the first Black person to earn a Doctorate of the Science of Law degree from Yale Law School, a founder of the National Organization for Women, and the first Black woman to be ordained an Episcopal priest. As a lawyer, Murray was committed to tackling oppression in the law and legal statutes that contributed to the advancement of legislative rights and religious life. Murray's scholarship and service addressed Murray's acute awareness of the inequities on account of race and gender. </P><P>Bartolina Sisa Award for Excellence in Latin American Studies -- awarded to a graduating senior in recognition of their outstanding academic achievements in Latin American studies courses and their distinction as an ambassador of our program's values. </P><P>Bartolina Sisa was an Amayra revolutionary leader who led rebellions against Spanish colonial rule in the Andean region. Today she remains a symbol of anticolonial resistance, indigenous persistence, and the defense of the land and peoples of Latin America. This award celebrates her legacy and represents the Latin American Studies program's commitment to studying the histories, cultures and traditions of the region. </P><P>The 1804 Award for Caribbean Studies is given to a graduating senior in Caribbean Studies who has demonstrated academic excellence and a deep engagement with the program's core values of distinction. </P><P>Upon declaring independence on January 1, 1804, Haiti became the first Black republic in the Western Hemisphere. This date not only marks the end of the long struggle against colonial rule for Haiti; it catalyzed a ripple effect across the Caribbean that would eventually result in the emancipation of millions of enslaved Africans. Today, it remains a potent symbol of the spirit of ongoing resistance and the right to self-determination and to freedom from oppression.  </P><P>The Manning Marable Award for Service -- this award, named after the visionary founder of our program in Africana &amp; Latin American Studies, will be given to a graduating senior who has contributed to the visibility of African-American, African, Caribbean and Latin American cultures on campus, through organizing, event planning, and service. Ideally, the student will have worked to forge alliances across the different components, bringing students together from across the four components and areas of study.  </P><P>Dr. Manning Marable, Colgate University's Africana And Latin American Studies Program (ALST) program's founding director was an esteemed public intellectual, and activist whose work was grounded in, and advanced, the Black Radical Tradition. In scholarship and early works, and culminating with his Pulitzer Prize-winning opus, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention, which was published days after his death, Marable's scholarship and intellectual commitments reflected a commitment to transnational, Afro-diasporic, collaborative democratic thought. Beginning in 1976, Marable had a nationally syndicated column &quot;Along the Color Line&quot; which was printed in dozens of newspapers and was fodder for public radio programs. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>Majors may graduate with honors or high honors in Africana and Latin American studies. Qualifications for honors include, at graduation, a minimum overall average of 3.00, a major average of 3.30, and a successful defense before a designated faculty committee of an honors paper or project prepared under the direction of a member of the Africana and Latin American studies faculty. The committee that evaluates the final paper will be identified by the program director in consultation with the student and the student's faculty adviser. Prospective honors students should notify the appropriate coordinators of their intentions by the first week of October of the senior year. A student with a double major in Africana and Latin American studies and a second field may apply for honors in both areas by submitting and defending a paper in each. The paper topics may be related, but the focus and/or content of the two papers must differ substantially. Beyond the requirements for honors, high honors requires a major average of 3.7. High honors projects are usually begun in the fall of the senior year. Students who expect to qualify for honors or high honors should register for ALST 499. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Groups </H2><P>Study Groups Periodically, the Africana and Latin American Studies Program has sponsored study groups in Africa, Latin America, or the Caribbean under the direction of faculty members associated with the program.

Home to an extraordinary range of linguistic and ethnic groups, this broad and dynamic region is rich in cultural and environmental diversity. Engaging the many changes taking place in Asian societies today requires a similarly diverse set of intellectual skills. To this end, the Asian Studies Program at Colgate integrates scholarly approaches spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences: from literature, art, and religion to history, politics, economics, and geography. The Asian studies major encourages students to undertake their own interdisciplinary explorations of this region. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Awards </H2><P>The Award for Excellence in Area Studies (South and Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Comparative) — awarded by the program to students on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework taken within the major. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Study Groups </H2><P>The Asian Studies Program strongly encourages majors to participate in Colgate study groups and in approved programs in India or other locations in Asia. Faculty of the program serve as directors of study-abroad programs in China, Japan, and Korea. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><Sect><H2>China Study Group </H2><P>Spends approximately four months in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, in intensive language training and firsthand observation of recent cultural, political, and economic changes. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Japan Study Group </H2><P>Based in Kyoto, provides lodging with Japanese families; intensive language training; and instruction in Japanese politics, economics, business, religion, art, linguistics, and literature. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Korea Study Group </H2><P>Hosted by Yonsei University in Seoul, serves the academic needs of students interested in educational studies and Asian studies. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors in Asian Studies </H2><P>Asian studies majors who have GPAs of 3.30 or better in the major and an overall GPA of 3.00 are encouraged to pursue honors study. A candidate for high honors must have a GPA of 3.70 in the major and an overall GPA of 3.00. Each eligible student undertakes a project, the form of which — a written research paper, an exhibition, a performance — is decided in consultation with the student's honors adviser. To qualify for honors, the project must be judged by a committee of two faculty members to be of at least A quality. For high honors the project must be judged by three faculty members from at least two different departments, and in addition the candidate must pass with distinction an oral examination conducted by the three-member committee. Often, the project for honors or high honors is begun on a study group, or during the junior year or fall semester of the senior year, in any 300- or 400-level course or any independent study course. The project is continued through the spring term in ASIA 499 - Special Studies for Honors. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Courses </H2><P>The courses listed below are offered by the ASIA program.

Three other courses should be chosen from the list of Governed Electives (below) and may address any region of Asia. Other courses may also serve as electives for this major if they are at the 300 or 400 level and if at least 40 percent of the course and of the student's work concerns Asia. Students must gain approval from the director of Asian Studies prior to taking these courses for them to count toward the major. </P><P>Majors are strongly encouraged to acquire proficiency in one or more Asian languages, although no more than three language courses at any level may count toward the nine courses required for the major. Normally, the nine courses will include courses from at least two of these three divisions: arts and humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics. </P><P>Students completing two majors (i.e. double-majors) may only count two courses toward both of those majors. </P><P>Major credit will be awarded for no more than two courses taken at another institution. </P><Sect><H3>Introductory Course </H3><P>One introductory course drawn from the following Liberal Arts Core Curriculum courses: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CORE 154C -

Students in environmental studies learn to think, speak, and write clearly and articulately about environmental issues from a variety of perspectives. The environmental studies curriculum combines interdisciplinary breadth with depth in a chosen field of study. </P><P>The Environmental Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program located within the Division of University Studies and staffed by faculty from a number of departments who apply their knowledge and expertise to teaching and research endeavors that cross disciplinary boundaries. The program administers five majors: environmental studies plus four departmentally affiliated majors including environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology. All five majors include a common set of courses that ensures a shared interdisciplinary experience. Each student achieves depth in analytical ability by taking a specified set of courses, usually in a particular discipline, chosen in consultation with her or his adviser. To fulfill environmental studies graduation requirements, students must possess a minimum overall GPA of at least 2.00 in all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Honors and High Honors </H2><P>Environmental studies majors wishing to pursue honors should consult with the environmental studies program director and a research sponsor no later than the spring of their junior year. Honors may be awarded to students majoring in environmental studies who accumulate a GPA of 3.30 in courses counted toward the major, and complete a semester-long independent research project under faculty guidance through enrollment in ENST 491 - Independent Study. Students pursuing honors will submit a proposal developed in consultation with an ENST-affiliated faculty member who will serve as research sponsor. The proposal describing the project will be submitted to the environmental studies steering committee in the fall semester of their senior year for approval. The research project should reflect the student's area of focus but must also demonstrate the understanding gained using an interdisciplinary perspective and approach. The Director of the program will normally serve as second reader to the honors project. Alternatively, the director and research sponsor may designate up to three faculty members to evaluate the merit of the work and report to the environmental studies steering committee. Students standing for honors will deliver an oral presentation to faculty and students of the program, and produce a report in a format most appropriate to the project. The environmental studies steering committee and the research sponsor must determine whether the oral presentation and report are of high quality and worthy of honors in the program. Students demonstrating exceptional commitment to research and meeting all the requirements for honors may be awarded high honors if the overall quality of their work is deemed to be outstanding by the environmental studies steering committee and research sponsor. </P><P>To qualify for graduation with honors or high honors in environmental biology, environmental economics, or environmental geography, students must take ENST 490 - Seminar in Environmental Studies and also meet the requirements for honors or high honors in the biology, economics, or geography major (depending on the area of specialization). The major GPA is calculated from all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. </P><P>Honors and High Honors for Environmental Geology </P><P>To be eligible for honors in environmental geology, students must complete the following requirements in addition to the environmental geology major: (1) Complete ENST 490 - Seminar in Environmental Studies, </P><P>(2) take four full-credit courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or biology, (3) complete a year-long senior thesis as described in the honors section of the geology major, and (4) achieve a minimum average GPA of 3.0 in the three 200-level core courses and 400-level capstone course. If additional courses are taken in these categories, the highest grades will be used to compute this GPA. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Transfer Credit </H2><P>A maximum of two course credits transferred from other institutions may be applied toward the environmental studies major. One course credit transferred from another institution may be applied toward the environmental studies minor. If the requirement for Focus in a Particular Field of Study is waived because of a second major or minor, transfer credits contributing to the second major or minor do not count toward this maximum. Approved courses taken as part of Colgate sponsored study groups, such as the Australia study group affiliated with the Environmental Studies Program, are not considered transfer credits and do not count toward the maximum. In many cases, courses that might be applied toward the environmental studies major or minor will be approved for university credit by another department on campus. For example, an environmental economics course would be reviewed for credit by the economics department. Once approved for university credit, the course must be approved by the director of environmental studies for credit toward the major or minor. In some cases, a course might be approved for university credit as an environmental studies (ENST) course. Students must supply the director with a course description and syllabus to apply for transfer credit in these cases. Limits on the transfer of courses toward environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology majors are determined by the biology, economics, geography, and geology departments, respectively, and are available in the affiliated department section in this chapter. </P></Sect><Sect><H2>Australia Study Group </H2><P>This program at the University of Wollongong provides a unique opportunity for junior majors and minors to expand their studies of the environment.

Through the study of history and theory, formal analysis, and production experiences, the program examines how film and media serve as powerful determinants of ideology, identity, and historical consciousness. Courses offered in a range of departments and programs constitute the major and minor, reflecting the fact that cinema and media-based research cuts across disciplines. </P><P>It has been said that the mass media collectively represent the most important and widely shared context for the receipt of information and ideas in our contemporary experience. Courses in Film and Media Studies question the consequences of our passive consumption of mass media as both entertainment and information. Students learn the history and theory of film and media, analytical approaches and strategies; they also come to understand the various ways in which film and media are produced, circulated, and consumed locally, nationally, and globally. </P><P>The film and media studies curriculum encompasses history, theory, and practice, with the goal of developing in students the critical skills necessary to analyze representation and experience as they are constructed by new and emerging visual technologies, and to put theoretical and historical knowledge into practice through media production courses and exercises. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Film and Media Studies Award — awarded for outstanding achievement in film and media studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>The award of honors in film and media studies is dependent on faculty evaluation of work done on an independent research project in FMST 410 and the student's GPA. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Independent Research Project: Every major undertakes a senior project (in FMST 410) in their senior year. Upon completion, the project may be nominated for honors. If nominated, the project is prepared by the senior for a public presentation. Following that presentation, faculty decide whether the project is worthy of honors. Honors will be conferred only on work of outstanding quality, while high honors will be awarded only to exceptional work of highest distinction. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GPA Requirements: Film and media studies majors who have a GPA of 3.30 or better in the major and 3.00 overall will be considered for Honors.

Tomlinson, Woolley </TH></TR></Table><P>The affiliated minor in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies (LGBT) examines the lives and representations of individuals and groups considered sexual minorities, as well as the various forces that have affected them across cultures and throughout time. Sexuality offers a critical lens to analyze communities, cultures, and subcultures; institutions, discourses, and literatures; economic and political movements; the social construction of power, status, and hierarchies; and identity categories configured on the basis of age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. Moreover, sexuality is considered as the subject of biological, medical, and psychological research. LGBT studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary minor that emphasizes the application of new theories and methodologies (e.g., queer, feminist, critical race, and multicultural theories) to established disciplines as it promotes the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields. Through the minor, students gain critical understandings of normative categorization, query unspoken assumptions, examine social stratification and distributions of power, and explore the diversity of forms that sexuality has taken historically and in contemporary contexts. </P><P>Related Major </P><P> Women's Studies Major </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Award for Academic Excellence, in honor of Marilyn Thie — awarded by the program to a senior, on the basis of completion of the minor or three or more courses, a GPA of 3.30 or higher, and significant scholarly achievement in LGBTQ studies. </P><P>The Ken Valente Award for Leadership in LGBTQ Studies and Community, in honor of Ken Valente — awarded by the program to a senior who has demonstrated outstanding leadership in LGBTQ studies and community. </P><P>Courses </P><P>Use the minor link below to find courses that count toward the LGBT minor requirements.  </P><P>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Completing the minor requires students to work closely with their course instructors, their advisers, and the LGBT director.

Students pursuing a minor in linguistics will encounter a wide variety of methodologies: careful data collection and classification, rigorous philosophical analysis, sociological surveys, psychological experiments, ethnographic and ethnolinguistic methodologies, and the writing of computer programs to analyze and interpret language data. The themes addressed by the linguistics minor include the sounds of language; word structure and etymology; styles and dialects; syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of language; language acquisition by children and adults; language in society; language and culture, historical development and language families; language and mind; language and the brain; language processing by computer; psychological perspectives on language. </P><P>Linguistics minors will give a presentation in the last semester of their senior year showing how their study of linguistics has informed their understanding of the world and the academic disciplines they have studied. The presentation can be based on a paper or papers they will have written in their linguistics-related courses. </P><P>Students pursuing the linguistics minor are strongly encouraged to undertake a capstone experience.

Across time and place, it advances the study of cross-cultural and comparative influence in the period both within and beyond Europe's geographical borders. Broadly interdisciplinary, it is intended as a supplement to traditional majors. Spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences, MARS engages history, art, literature, music, philosophy, science, and religion from the 4th to the 17th centuries. </P><P>A thorough, interdisciplinary examination of the medieval, renaissance, and early modern periods enables students to discover local and regional connections across the cultures in the discipline. Through a deep engagement with the program's courses and programming, students develop an appreciation for and understanding of how the distant past shapes and informs who we are today. </P><P>The emphasis in MARS is on creating interdisciplinary bridges across the curriculum, and the program is structured in a way that encourages students to explore a cross section of traditional fields. To this end, MARS courses can center on a topic area proposed by the student and agreed upon in consultation with a faculty adviser. However, courses in the minor should complement each other. </P><P>Students may elect to minor in either the medieval or Renaissance period or in a combination of both. In order to declare a minor, prospective students must meet with the program director to discuss their choice of courses and how those courses will coalesce. This should normally take place by the spring term of the junior year. In order to take full advantage of course offerings and advising, students are urged to enroll in the program as early as possible in their undergraduate career. </P><P>Award </P><P>Award for Excellence in Medieval and Renaissance Studies — awarded by the program for excellence in medieval and Renaissance studies. </P><P>Courses </P><P>Use the minor link below to find courses that count toward the MARS requirements.  </P><P>Medieval and Renaissance Studies Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>The minor consists of at least five courses selected with the approval of an adviser belonging to the MARS faculty. Courses should be selected from the list below and should include a course in history. At least three different disciplines should be represented. French, Italian, and Spanish are considered to be separate areas of study. Additional courses (notably topical seminars) may be accepted upon petition. It is the responsibility of the student to recognize that certain courses might require departmental prerequisites for which he or she would not necessarily receive credit toward the MARS minor. Only one independent study course and only one non-Colgate course will be counted toward the minor. Courses that are appropriate for the MARS minor are sometimes offered as part of the university's Venice study group program. </P><P>At least three courses should be at the intermediate level and at least one should be at the 300- or 400- (seminar) level — either an existing seminar or an independent research paper. Senior seminars and honors thesis courses in any department could provide a place for the student's capstone experience. </P><P>One year's study of Latin at Colgate is recognized as one course toward the minor. While there is no mandated language requirement, it is strongly recommended that students considering graduate school in a medieval or Renaissance field should study Latin at least through the intermediate level. Students are encouraged to explore early literature in Old and Middle English, as well as early period courses in the foreign language departments. </P><P>Courses from the following list are appropriate for the MARS minor: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 207 -

It provides students with an understanding of the origins and development of the Islamic faith in its heartland, as well as an awareness of the global, multi-cultural character of modern Islam. Program courses train students in art, literature, history, culture, politics, and political economy of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. </P><P>The Islamic world spans the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. The world's nearly 2 billion Muslims comprise one-quarter of the world's population and include numerous linguistic and ethnic groups such as Arabs, Iranians, Turkic peoples, Kurds, Baluchis, Malays, and others. The Islamic world is the source of rich religious and intellectual traditions that share deep roots with Western traditions and have evolved over a long history of interaction with the West. It also plays an important role in global peace, security, and prosperity. These demographic, cultural, and strategic considerations ensure increasingly deep and dynamic relations among peoples of the Islamic world and the Euro-Atlantic West. The Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Program (MIST) program equips Colgate students with the knowledge and conceptual tools needed to forge and understand these connections. </P><P>The themes addressed by the program include Islam's textual foundations and interpretive traditions; the developement and historical spread of diverse Muslim societies; political institutions, and artistic and literary traditions; European colonialism and its impact on the cultures, economies, and polities of the region; the rise of modern nationalism and its relationship to tribal, religious, and ethnic identities; the emergence and impact of political Islam and Islamic revivalist movements; the Arab-Israeli conflict; democratization and revolutionary movements; and United States foreign policy toward the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. </P><P>GPA Requirements </P><P>Courses taken at Colgate, on a Colgate Study Group, or an Approved Program must have a grade of C or better to count toward the major or minor. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Major major page. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>The MIST faculty and the off-campus study office have identified a small number of programs that we highly encourage students to attend for a summer or a semester. Up to three course credits toward the major may </P><P>be earned through study in off-campus programs. Approved off-campus language courses may also count toward the major and are not included in the three-credit limit. Consult with MIST faculty for further details. </P><P>Awards </P><P>Award for Excellence in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies — awarded to the graduating senior who has excelled in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. </P><P>The Prize for Excellence in Arabic — awarded by the faculty of Arabic to students who demonstrate excellence in studying Arabic language and culture. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the MIST program.

This may take the form of paid or volunteer work or an internship, and must be at least 140 hours in duration. It is expected that the practicum will deepen the student's understanding of a substantive aspect or aspects of the institution's operations through work in a department such as Curatorial, Development, Education, Collections Management, Communications, or Archives. </P><P>The practicum requirement can be satisfied by an internship at the Picker Art Gallery or Longyear Museum of Anthropology during the academic year or over the summer, or at any other suitable museum over the summer. Students who wish to fulfill this requirement at an off-campus institution must discuss their plans with, and get approval from, the director of the Museum Studies Program in advance. They must also identify the supervisor who will write a brief evaluation upon their completion of the work. This evaluation must be submitted to the director of the Museum Studies Program, who will notify the Registrar when this requirement for the minor has been fulfilled. Financial support for internships is available through Colgate's Summer Funding, but students should be aware of the competitive nature of these grants and of their early deadlines (usually in late February; for more information and specific deadlines visit summer funding). </P><P>Students are encouraged to work with Colgate University's Upstate Institute to identify institutions in central New York where they can fulfill the Museum Studies practicum requirement. The Upstate Institute supports community-based research through the Summer Field School, and can help place students as full-time paid research Fellows with institutions in the region such as the Munson Williams Proctor Institute, Everson Museum of Art, Oneida County Historical Society, Oneida Community Mansion House, Adirondack Museum, Iroquois Indian Museum, Fenimore Art Museum, the Shako:wi Cultural Center, the Corning Museum of Glass, and the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro. For more information about programs and opportunities, visit the Upstate Institute web page. </P><P>Students should also consult with their Museum Studies minor adviser about the various ways this requirement can be fulfilled, and about opportunities that best meet the individual needs and interests of the student. </P><P>Museum Studies Program </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Museum Studies catalog page. </P><P>Native American Studies </P><Table><TR><TH>Faculty </TH></TR><TR><TH>Professor Vecsey Assistant Professor Hall Advisory Committee Bigenho, De Lucia (Director, fall), Hall, Juarez, Reinbold, Roller, Vecsey </TH></TR></Table><P>The Native American Studies Program offers students the opportunity to undertake a comparative study of the pre-Columbian, colonial, and contemporary cultures of North and Latin America. The required and elective courses are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, representing the various topical and regional interests of Colgate faculty whose specializations include archaeology, art, cultural anthropology, education, ethnomusicology, geography, history, law, literature, and religion. Themes and topics of the major include the integrity, richness, and complexity of Native cultures; the reciprocal impact of contact between Native and non-Native populations in the Western Hemisphere; modes and processes of culture change; cultural disruption, resistance, and vitality; social movements; indigenous ways of knowing; and an understanding of the variety of methodological and theoretical approaches to Native American Studies, including comparisons with other indigenous cultures. A major in Native American Studies provides an excellent foundation for graduate education in the disciplines mentioned, as well as professional work in areas such as contract archaeology, environmental and cultural resource management, government services, non-governmental and non-profit organizations, law, museums, public health, and teaching. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Majors may achieve honors by having, at graduation, a minimum GPA of 3.30 in major courses and a minimum overall grade of 3.00. The candidate for honors also completes a research paper, written either in a 400-level independent study course or revised from a paper written in a 400-level course, or the equivalent, that is arranged in advance as an honors paper in Native American Studies. The honors paper must be judged to be of honors quality by a committee of two professors in Native American Studies, designated by the candidate in consultation with the program director. The candidate works with both professors (adviser and second reader) who are consulted during thesis development and provide comments on at least one substantive draft of the research paper prior to their final evaluation. The candidate for high honors must have, at graduation, a minimum GPA of 3.70 in major courses and a minimum overall grade of 3.00. The candidate for high honors produces a research paper, as described above, which is arranged in advance as a high honors paper. The paper must be judged to be of high honors by a committee consisting of two professors in Native American Studies, designated by the candidate in consultation with the program director. The candidate receives high honors by defending the paper with distinction in an oral examination conducted by at least three professors identified by the Native American Studies Program director. </P><P>Santa Fe Study Group </P><P>An off-campus study group to Santa Fe, New Mexico, is offered to enable a select group of Colgate students to further their understanding of Native American history, archaeology, life, and culture. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. Majors and minors are strongly encouraged to participate in this study group. </P><P>Extended Study </P><P>In conjunction with NAST 300 - Continuity in Pueblo Communities: Developing Models for Cultural Understanding, extended study in New Mexico offers students the opportunity to consider how cross-cultural understanding is developed and where and when it is frustrated. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Anthony Aveni Award for Excellence in Native American Studies — awarded by the program for excellence in Native American studies. </P><P>The Carol Ann Lorenz Award for Service in Native American Studies -- awarded by the program to recognize student involvement in Native American Studies programming. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the NAST program.

Founded with a generous gift of the Cooley family, the program presents a challenging course of study that integrates trans-disciplinary academic approaches to war and peace with research into specific regional conflicts and their aftermaths. The curriculum offers students opportunities to explore, from a global perspective, the complex origins and impacts of violence, the challenges of human security, and the possibilities for promoting and advancing human rights. With its regular symposia, lectures, film screenings, and unique electives, the program is actively involved in promoting the study of peace, conflict, and security at Colgate and beyond. After taking advantage of the distinctive combination of faculty and program resources at Colgate, peace and conflict studies majors have pursued successful careers in various international arenas, including law, government, development, journalism, academe, and the private sector. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Dag Hammarskjd Prize in Peace and Conflict Studies — awarded by the program to the student chosen by the peace and conflict studies faculty from among students with a major or minor or who have taken at least two courses, in peace and conflict studies, given on the basis of outstanding work in the program and usually judged on one specific written work. </P><P>The Sterling Prize — established in honor of John F. (Jay) Sterling '68, to recognize excellence in international studies and a personal commitment to peaceful cooperation among nations. The prize is awarded annually to a Colgate student whose academic work in international economics, politics, or culture exemplifies Jay Sterling's spirit of endless curiosity, university interest, and constructive work. </P><P>The Clarence Young Award — awarded in memory of Clarence W. Young, a member of the psychology department from 1929 to 1971. Established as an award for academic excellence in peace and conflict studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Majors may qualify for departmental honors by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.50 in major courses and an overall GPA of 3.30. For high honors, Majors must achieve a GPA of 3.70 in major courses and an overall GPA of 3.30 by graduation. Students who expect to qualify and who seek honors or high honors enroll in PCON 499 upon completing PCON 479. Students enrolled in PCON 479 who fail to receive a grade of A– or higher on the seminar paper may not enroll in PCON 499 without the written permission of the program director. Candidates for high honors must have grades of B- or better in all Cluster 1 courses. Working with a principal adviser and a second reader, the student writes and submits a substantial paper for this course and orally defends it before the program faculty. The designation &quot;honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or neither, is determined at the conclusion of the defense by the PCON faculty and in consultation with second readers external to the program when applicable. This paper must be a substantially different, revised, and expanded version of the student's PCON 479 seminar paper. Honors and high honors projects should demonstrate the ability to work creatively and independently and to synthesize theoretical, methodological, and substantive materials in peace and conflict studies. Such a project should be planned and initiated in the fall term of the fourth year (or earlier), with the research and final writing completed in the spring term when the student is enrolled in PCON 499. Majors seeking to qualify for high honors in peace and conflict studies are required to demonstrate competency in a foreign language equivalent to two semesters at the 200 level. A student pursuing a double major and enrolling in the honors seminar may petition to have two courses count for both majors. </P><P>Off-Campus Study </P><P>The Peace and Conflict Studies Program strongly encourages majors and minors to participate in Colgate study groups, extended studies, or approved programs, especially in regions relevant to their Cluster 3 geographic area. Students should consult with their PCON advisers and the director, as well as the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs, regarding approved off-campus study options, credit approval, and application guidelines. See Off-Campus Study for additional information. </P><P>Related Activities </P><P>The academic program in peace and conflict studies is supplemented by activities coordinated by the director and the program faculty. In addition to lectures, films, and conversations with visiting scholars, the </P><P>program hosts and sponsors seminars, field trips, conferences, workshops, and collaborative research with </P><P>U.S. and international partners. For more information and current details, refer to the program web page. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the PCON program. As an interdisciplinary program, select courses from other departments/programs may also count toward the PCON major and minor requirements. Use the major/minor links below to find other courses that count toward these requirements.  </P><P>Peace and Conflict Studies Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The major consists of 11 courses, taken in four clusters: </P><P>Cluster 1 (Core Approaches) – These three courses serve as a foundation for the program, introducing students to critical perspectives on the study of peace and conflict. </P><P>Cluster 2 (Elective Offerings) – These four elective courses allow students to develop substantive knowledge of key thematic and topical issues and methodologies within the broader interdisciplinary field of peace and conflict studies. Two of these courses must be at the 300 level or higher. </P><P>Cluster 3 (Geographic Area of Specialization) – PCON majors take three courses related to a specific geographic region to broaden their knowledge and to ensure in-depth understanding of particular regional conflicts. </P><P>Cluster 4 (Thesis) – PCON majors, normally in the fall of their fourth year, will take one course (PCON 479) to develop a thesis project that integrates and synthesizes the knowledge gained in Clusters 1–3. </P><P>Major credit will be awarded for no more than two courses taken at another institution, and no more than one independent study course in the program. </P><P>Only one course from a PCON major can be counted towards any other major or minor. This course should be approved by the student's PCON faculty advisor in order to make sure all applicable major and minor requirements are being met for successful completion and graduation. PCON majors are strongly encouraged to consult with their PCON faculty advisor at least once each semester. </P><P>Cluster 1 – Core Approaches (3 Courses) </P><P>Students are strongly encouraged to take all three core approaches courses during their first and second years, and should have completed all Cluster 1 courses before taking the PCON 479 Research Seminar in the fall of their fourth year. These courses may be taken concurrently or in any order. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Required Courses </H4><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PCON 111 - Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PCON 218 - Practices of Peace and Conflict: War in Lived Experience </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PCON 225 - Theories of Peace and Conflict: War, State, and Society </LBody></LI></L><P>Cluster 2 – Elective Offerings (4 Courses) </P><P>To deepen and develop their knowledge of issues, methodologies, and current debates in peace and conflict studies, students take four elective courses (see list below). </P><P>These courses help students develop substantive knowledge of key issues/topics in the field. Courses in Cluster 2 expose students to a range of methodologies for studying peace and conflict, engage new and established frameworks for study and understanding, and incorporate critical approaches to theorizing the field. Courses in Cluster 2 deal with war, armed conflict, and genocide, transnational and human security issues, the lived experience of collective violence, and human rights and structural violence in broadly interdisciplinary ways. A student pursuing a double major with another department or program may use one Cluster 2 elective to count for both majors. At least two of these courses must be taken at or above the 300 level. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ANTH 245/SOCI 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CORE S138/138S -

To develop this knowledge base, students are required to take three approved courses on the politics, culture, history, geography, or economics of a geographic region chosen from the following: </P><P>A. Central America, the Caribbean, and South America </P><P>B. North America </P><P>C. West, East, Central, and Southern and Sub-Saharan Africa </P><P>D. Europe </P><P>E. The Middle East and North Africa </P><P>F. Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia </P><P>G. Asia and the Pacific Rim </P><P>H. Transregional Communities Students may take Cluster 3 electives concurrently with courses in Clusters 1 and 2. Other courses, including Liberal Arts Core Curriculum courses, off-campus studies courses, and 300-or 400-level language courses, may count toward the geographic areas requirement, if approved by the program director. Many courses can count for Cluster 3 for each of the regions listed. Students should consult their PCON adviser about specific courses across the curriculum and off campus which may satisfy this requirement. Approved study abroad programs will normally provide two course credits towards this part of the major. Whenever possible, students should declare their area of geographic specialization and seek approval for Cluster 3 courses prior to the start of their senior year. The &quot;Transregional Communities&quot; designation (see above) applies to a thematic course of study on issues such as displacement, forced migration, or refugee and diaspora communities. </P><P>Cluster 4 – Thesis (1 Course) </P><P>To complete the thesis requirement, students must enroll in PCON 479 in the fall semester of the fourth year. In order to advance to the thesis, students should have completed all of the Cluster 1 requirements and taken as many classes as possible in Clusters 2 and 3. Theses developed during the research seminar may be on any topic, but students are expected to integrate expertise in their Cluster 3 geographic area of specialization in their final submissions. </P><P>Declarations </P><P>Students can declare a PCON major at any time. Prospective majors are strongly encouraged to take and successfully complete (with a grade of C or higher) at least one required Cluster 1 course before making the decision. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Peace and Conflict Studies program page. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>To qualify for graduation, a minimum grade of C is required for all courses taken toward the major. </P><P>Peace and Conflict Studies Program </P><P>For more information about the department, including faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Peace and Conflict Studies program catalog page. </P><P>Peace and Conflict Studies Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>The PCON minor requires six courses. </P><P>Students must take PCON 111 and one other Cluster 1 course (PCON 218 or PCON 225), as well as any four Cluster 2 elective offerings (see list below). </P><P>Minors are strongly encouraged to take two geographic areas courses, unless their major is in a department or program in which they are studying a geographic area. Minors may take PCON 479 as one of their electives, with instructor permission. </P><P>Only one course from a PCON minor can be shared with a major or any other minor. This course should be approved by the student's PCON faculty adviser in order to make sure all applicable major and minor requirements are being met for successful completion and graduation. PCON minors are strongly encouraged to consult with their PCON faculty advisor at least once each semester. </P><P>Geographic Areas of Specialization </P><P>A.

Nakhimovsky Associate Professor Erley </TH></TR></Table><P>Lecturer Domashenko Visiting Assistant Professor Shpylova-Saeed </P><P>Russian and Eurasian Studies (REST) is a multi- and interdisciplinary program that aims to give students an understanding of the history, politics, environment, and culture of Russian, East European and Eurasian places, along with proficiency in the Russian language. Students in this program benefit from the expertise of instructors in diverse fields, including literary and cultural studies, art history, anthropology, history, geography, Jewish studies, environmental studies, and political science. Prospective majors, and those with an interest in Russian language, should begin REST 121 as soon as possible. The major requires a minimum of two years of language. Students who continue into advanced Russian are encouraged to spend a semester in Russia on one of Colgate's approved programs. Courses throughout the curriculum are interdisciplinary and culminate in a senior seminar in which majors pursue advanced research in a collaborative environment. Many of our students choose to combine Russian and Eurasian studies with a second major or minor in history, political science, international relations and other fields. Recent graduates have found work in government, journalism, law, NGOs, education, finance, and many other fields; some have gone to the Peace Corps, and a significant number have pursued graduate study. </P><P>Language Placement and GPA Requirements </P><P>Students with two or more years of high school Russian, and students who have taken an introductory level summer session course at another university, will normally matriculate into REST 122 or REST 201. Students with such previous Russian study, transfer students with coursework in Russian, and students from Russian-speaking families (heritage speakers) should consult with faculty for advice on placement. </P><P>An average of C (2.00) is required for graduation in the major or minor. All REST courses taken at Colgate are counted toward the cumulative grade. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Robert L. Murray Award in Russian and Eurasian Studies — awarded by the program for excellence and originality in Russian and Eurasian studies at Colgate. </P><P>The Albert Parry Prize — awarded by the program for contributions to the Russian and Eurasian studies community. </P><P>The Richard Sylvester Award for First-Year Students — awarded by the department to a first-year student who has demonstrated superior progress and promise in Russian and Eurasian studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>A minimum overall GPA in the major of 3.30 for honors and 3.70 for high honors is required, plus a written thesis of 40 to 60 pages. Students who write an honors thesis are required to complete an honors independent study (REST 490) in the semester following the senior seminar. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>The Russian and Eurasian studies faculty and Off-Campus Study/International Programs have collaborated to identify a small number of approved programs for students with at least two years of college Russian who </P><P>wish to spend a semester in Russia. Two course credits toward the major or minor can be earned through study in Russia. Consult with the Russian and Eurasian studies faculty for further details. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the REST program.

Women's studies understands the complexity of human lives as gender interconnects with sexuality, race, class, ability, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and age in the constitution of experience and identities. Centering underrepresented voices and knowledge, our students analyze how social power and cultural norms shape the ways in which class, gender, race, and sexuality assign value to bodies, and why this matters. </P><P>The program is interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from different disciplines to encourage critical engagement with all forms of experience from feminist perspectives. Interdisciplinarity leads students to question existing frameworks, concepts, and methods, enabling them to understand better both the past and the contemporary world while also envisioning a future beyond traditional roles and inequities. In other words, Women's Studies classes teach students to unlearn what they have been taught about institutions, people and places, a valuable lifelong skill.  </P><P>Women's Studies courses are anchored in five pillars: praxis, self-reflexivity, intersectionality, gender lens, and context. In emphasizing interdisciplinarity, the program helps students acquire the intellectual and praxis-based tools to allow them to critically analyze the societal, cultural, global, and personal issues that shape their lives, and challenge them to look at these issues from multiple perspectives and with a gendered lens, across time and space. </P><P>Program courses are intersectional, meaning we encourage students to reflect on the ways in which knowledge is produced within different, intersecting, and oftentimes unrecognized systems of oppression and to examine categories that are presented as natural and permanent in their cultural and historical context. In this way, the  program prioritizes self-reflexivity. Lastly, the program aims to help students acquire the skills of critical analysis and imagine alternatives that challenge the naturalizing of inequalities, by reading deeply and writing well as the basis of praxis. Our senior capstone experience invites majors and minors to move from theory to practice, and translate their values into a final praxis project that can generate dialogue and action in their communities. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>To be considered for Honors, concentrators must have a cumulative GPA of 3.30 in Women's Studies. Students who choose to pursue honors must announce their intention to do so by submitting proposals preceding their final term of study at Colgate. Additionally, these honors projects must be completed and approved by faculty sponsors and by the Women's Studies director. High honors in women's studies may be awarded to successful honors candidates who have been invited to present the results of their written projects in oral form to the women's studies faculty. A committee of faculty will vote on granting high honors for exceptionally strong intersectional projects that engage feminist theory and communicate across disciplines. </P><P>Related Minor </P><P> Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Minor </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Combahee River Collective Feminist Praxis Award — awarded to graduating seniors who have demonstrated sustained intersectional leadership and coalition-building that highlight and challenge the ways major systems of oppression are interlocking.

With roots in ancient Greece and branches in the most recent media technologies, rhetoric is simultaneously one of the oldest and newest academic disciplines, fundamentally engaging with language, power, and public culture. </P><P>As a discipline, rhetoric demonstrates how discourse generates knowledge, mediates power, and enacts social change; as an art, rhetoric enables the speaker/writer to invent arguments by making logical, ethical, and emotional appeals to an audience. The department offers courses in writing, public address, and the history and theory of rhetoric and language. </P><P>Courses in writing and rhetoric position students to become critical language users, preparing them to be effective communicators both in their future careers and in civic society, in the US and abroad. </P><P>The Writing Requirement </P><P>If notified at the time of admission, students may be required to complete one of the department's eligible 100-level writing courses with a grade of C or better before the end of their fourth semester.

Select courses from other departments/programs may also count toward the WRIT minor requirements. Use the minor link below to find other courses that count toward these requirements.  </P><P>Writing and Rhetoric Minor </P><P>The minor is designed to enhance students' ability to think and write critically as they explore the connections between the theory and practice of rhetoric. Students in the minor demonstrate proficiency at crafting a suitable message as they deepen their understanding of rhetoric as an art and as a disciplinary subject of study. A minor in Writing and Rhetoric provides valuable intellectual resources and practical skills for students across the curriculum who are considering careers that call for excellence in speaking and writing. The minor is also ideally suited for students with interest in public life and civic responsibility in the evolving context of a global culture. </P><P>For more information about the department, transfer credit, etc., visit the Writing and Rhetoric department page. </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>With a variety of course options available, students are encouraged to tailor their minor to fit their individual interests, career goals, and majors. Students should seek advice from a member of the department when planning their course selections. The minor requires a minimum of five courses selected from the list below. No more than one course may be at the 100 level, and at least one course must be at the 300 or 400 level. A course taken in fulfillment of the writing requirement may be counted toward the minor. </P><P>Where appropriate, one semester of independent study in writing at the junior or senior level (WRIT 391 or WRIT 491) may substitute for another 300-level course. </P><P>Normally, no more than one course from another department or program may count toward the minor. This course must focus on either language theory or the specialized expository writing of a particular discipline, and will require the approval of the departmental adviser. Examples of possible courses from outside the Department of Writing and Rhetoric include ENGL 374 - Creative Nonfiction Workshop, HIST 199 - History Workshop, and PSYC 355 - Language and Thought.

The goal is to introduce students to a major world area with which many, even highly educated, Westerners are unfamiliar. Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as &quot;the Dark Continent&quot; in European discourses of the nineteenth century. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: CORE 189C Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 202 - Introduction to African American Studies </P><P>An introductory course to the field of African American studies.

The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue -racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: POSC 212 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 217 - Corridors of Black Girlhood </P><P>An introduction to the emergent field of Black Girlhood Studies. An interdisciplinary journey, it engages theories, methods, and analytical approaches that recognize the power and potential of Black girlhood. Through interpretive and pragmatic inquiry of Black girls' lives, students will develop and enact an intersectional approach to interrogate the ways power, systems of oppression, and culture mediate girlhood. To expose discrepancies in popularized narratives of Black girls and women in the United States, the course is organized around the tenet of celebration and other foundational concepts and scholars within the field. Drawing on theories and concepts derived from Black feminist thought, budding scholars will approach Black girlhood as a political category of identity and symbol of agency. Working within and beyond hip-hop feminist and womanist frameworks, learning will involve critical thinking and embodiment of theories and practices as produced by Black girls, artists, and scholars. With attention to knowledge and creativity engendered amidst legacies of anti-Black racism and racialized femininity, Corridors of Black Girlhood reveals the contributions of Black girls, girlhood, and Black feminist thought to the expansion of theory, praxis, and power analyses. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: WMST 217  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 218 - Seeing, Feeling, Believing: Black Religious Thought through Visual Art and Performance </P><P>What can visual art and performance tell us about Black religion? Students explore this question by considering how historical and contemporary Black artists use mediums such as photography, painting, tactile installation, embodied movement, and sound to consider religious ideas. Students bring these creative works into conversation with scholarship in Black religious thought concerning a range of themes, including conjure/ancestral connection, Black liberation, ecstatic feeling, otherwise worlds, hope/pessimism, and the human. As a result, students gain an understanding of the profound ways that questions of religion and life meaning deeply inform and animate Black artistic and aesthetic cultural expression. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: RELG 218 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 220 - The Black Diaspora: Africans at Home and Abroad </P><P>Focuses on the African presence in the Americas.

The study of pre-Columbian and New World cultures of Spanish and Portuguese America focuses on the interactions of Indian, European, and African cultures and the complexities of what is known as Latin American culture. The course, though not a historical survey, examines the historical origins of contemporary social, cultural, economic, and political issues in Latin America, and in those parts of the world that have been affected by significant numbers of Latin American immigrants. The approach is broadly multidisciplinary, reflecting various perspectives and materials. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None </P><P>Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 237 - Ghana: History, Culture and Politics in West Africa </P><P>Students consider how Ghana has been an active participant in international commerce, politics, and culture, whether as a global source of gold and cocoa, a producer of kente cloth, or pan-Africanism, diasporic culture and politics, or as the &quot;Black Star&quot; state of Africa. Ghana continues to have enormous symbolic and pragmatic value in global relations relative to its size and place, but the course asks how has Ghana grappled with becoming a nation with many histories—indigenous, Islamic, European, migrant African, and Asian—and the different meanings those histories hold in a republic hoping to balance local, continental, and global concerns. The course also asks how indigenous communities, such as the former empire of Asante and its leader the Asantehene, has come to exercise enormous influence on the world stage, at times more than the president of Ghana. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 237E - Ghana: History, Culture and Politics in West Africa (Extended Study) </P><P>The three-week extended study component in Ghana will offers students an immersive, wide-ranging experience in Ghana's vibrant lifeways through visits to museums, pristine forests, transatlantic slave dungeons, historical monuments, markets, as well as lectures, opportunities for research, site visits, and exposure to indigenous language, cuisine and culture. </P><P>Credits: 0.5 Corequisite: ALST 237  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 242 - Religions of Resistance: Gender, Sexuality and Performance in the Caribbean </P><P>Studies African-derived religions and practices in the Caribbean, particularly the ways in which they constitute anticolonial and decolonial perspectives and practices. By exploring texts drawn from cultural studies, religious studies, literature, theatre and anthropology, students will develop an analytical framework through which to examine concepts such as syncretism and hybridity, ritual and bodily performance, and the construction of gender and sexuality. Key concerns in this course are the empowerment of women and people of diverse gender and sexual identities in religious contexts, black identity in the Caribbean and beyond, and the creation of new spaces for marginalized voices to be heard. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 </P><P>Crosslisted: LGBT 242 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 244 - African American Religious Experience </P><P>This historical, theological, and contextual course examines the African American religious experience, including slavery in America, the struggle for freedom and identify, the development of the Black Church, Black Muslims, the Civil Rights movement, the emergence of Black and Womanist theologies, and other expressions of African American spirituality.

The course title, which is inspired by the Black southern vernacular phrase for the region, marks the course's focus on the particularly diverse mixture of cross-cultural, diasporic traditions, beliefs and practices that define the south, from Virginia to Texas and all points in between. Course materials include readings that chronicle histories of slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarnation and gentrification, personal narratives that provide insights into historical and contemporary political realities and social movement organizing, and music, film, and visual art that lend an affective window into the sensory, spatial, and creative dimensions of the Black south. In addition to considering the profound social fabric of Black southern life and its larger impact on the United States, students also explore how this culture and region present a generative challenge to conventional notions that posit identity and geographical boundaries as clear and distinct categories. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: CORE 145C Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 250 - Representations of Africa </P><P>Critique the ways in which &quot;Africa&quot; has been constructed as an object of Western knowledge.

Composed of 55 member states, the African Union was constituted in 2000 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Its objectives are to achieve continental integration, similar to that of the European Union, in balance with recognizing the national sovereignty of its member states. The Model African Union is in session for four days in late February, hosted by Howard University in Washington D.C., and students from more than 30 colleges and universities around the country participate. The on-campus portion of the course meets weekly for the five weeks prior to the trip and one week after, for debriefing. Students are assigned to specific country delegations and committees, research and prepare position papers, draft resolutions, debate and vote on action items, and generally take on the roles of African diplomats. The trip includes a visit to the embassy of the country each delegation is representing. May be taken more than once, with different country and committee assignments each year. </P><P>Credits: 0.50 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 309 - Latin America: Critical Landscapes of Development </P><P>Explores the development experience of Latin America through examination of pressing environmental, economic, political, and social issues that currently face the region as a whole and play out differently across the region. The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries, and Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: GEOG 309  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 312 - Gender, Race and Punishment: Toward an Inclusive History of the American Carceral State </P><P>An interdisciplinary course exploring the complex history of the mass incarceration of African American girls and women within the U.S. penal system. Students investigate the complexities of the U.S. carceral state while unearthing the harsh realities that Black girls and women endured as they faced a system that criminalized their race, gender, and social status. Students further investigate the historical nature of African American girls and women's lived experiences, both within and right outside of a criminal justice system that, in many ways, has worked to criminalized their very being. Coursework is meant to illustrate that African American girls and women have not had one singular experience within the criminal justice system while illustrating that their experiences differed over time and across lines of age, class, regional, organizational, and sexual orientation. Students consider multiple issues that African American girls and women have faced while confined, both physical and mentally, by the United States penal system including their struggle for freedom, the exploitation of their labor, physical and mental abuse within the penal system, their personal practices of self-salvation, family life and love relationships, and their ongoing efforts to not only denounce the prison industrial complex while pushing for the abolition of carceral state. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 </P><P>Crosslisted: WMST 312   Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations, Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 320 - African American Women's History </P><P>An interdisciplinary exploration of the complex history and experiences of African American women's lives beginning with their enslavement in the United States through the present day.

Hip Hop may be one of the largest cultural movements the world has ever experienced – a cultural movement that has influenced everything from the music to which we listen, the clothes with which we adorn ourselves and to, the cars that we drive, the food that we eat and the words we speak. However, Hip Hop culture is more than the music, the fashion and the style that is popular today. It transcends the commercialized products sold to mainstream U.S. America and the around globe. How so?  Why did Hip Hop emerge? What does mainstream Hip Hop today represent? How do women fit into this narrative? Through a close examination of critical feminist and queer theory, this course explores the cultural and political implications of hip hop music and culture – specifically its impact on Black sexual politics and gender performance. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 340 - Art and Culture in Contemporary Jamaica (Study Group) </P><P>Introduces students to ways of reading and interpreting Jamaican culture using a broad interdisciplinary approach. In keeping with a cultural studies framework, students examine literature, theatre, music, dance, and film as expressions of Jamaican subjectivities and identities. The contexts and conversations out of which these artistic representations have emerged are considered through historical, sociological, and political texts that help to map the larger cultural matrix. Textual explorations are accompanied by field trips and guest lectures (from experts in the various disciplines) with the understanding that Jamaican culture is not fixed but evolving and dynamic, multifarious, and heterogeneous. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 351 - Medicine, Health and Healing in Africa </P><P>Designed as a reading seminar, students will be introduced to major themes and the ways in which scholars approach them.

Trinidad and Tobago provide a unique perspective on the Caribbean given its cultural cosmopolitan richness and its label as the most industrialized. Students seek to understand the main ecosystems, environmental threats, and the ways in which the country has responded to these threats. While studying in Trinidad and Tobago students get hands-on experience with these ecosystems and threats in addition to learning from a number of stakeholders – NGOs, community-based organizations, and government – to understand the complexity of responses for small island states. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: ENST 358  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 360 - ALST Interdisciplinary Research Design </P><P>A methods seminar designed to prepare students to complete interdisciplinary research in Africana and Latin American Studies.

Through details about the lives of those who reside in the Andes, anthropological and historical views of this region with cases primarily from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador are brought together. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ANTH 365   Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 367 - Jamaica in the Literary Imagination (Study Group) </P><P>An introduction to Jamaican literature from the plantation to the diaspora, spanning a period from 1930 to the present. While this historical framing is central to the organization of the course, the study is not strictly a historical survey, but rather an attempt to read Jamaican literature produced at different historical moments, in rural and urban, global and local spaces, and across perspectives mediated by differences and convergences of race, gender, sexuality, and location. Writers may include Claude McKay, Roger Mais, Erna Brodber, Curdella Forbes, Margaret Cezair-Thompson, among others. Students examine how the historical forces of colonialism, nation building, migration, and the information age have helped to shape how the selected writers from different spaces and identities imagine Jamaica's culture, cultural products, and geopolitical relations in the global world. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ENGL 367  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ALST 388 - The American South: From Reconstruction to the Present </P><P>Examines the historical and social changes of the American South from the end of the Civil War throughout the twentieth century. The South, a region left almost destitute following the Civil War, underwent a major transformation which saw enslaved labor replaced with prison labor, industrialization driven by southern progressives who envisioned a &quot;new South&quot; and race relation struggles that would and still do plague the region. Material and visual culture, literature, journalism, music, food, religion, and recreation serve as course materials. Discussions cover a variety of topics including race, class, gender, southern agriculture, Jim Crow, the southern penal system, immigration, the South and the New Deal, southern labor, religion, cultural expressions through jazz, blues, country, and hip-hop, the civil rights movement, Southern conservatism, and voting rights. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: HIST 388  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ALST 480 - Issues and Trends in Africana and Latin American Studies </P><P>Serves as the senior capstone when UNST 410 is not offered.

Utilizing a massive body of data, archaeology is in a unique position to study how warfare evolved alongside the emergence of civilizations. Students focus on several civilizations, such as Mesoamerica, the Mediterranean, and the Andes to compare and contrast various models of warfare in the ancient world. In some cases, warfare results in the utter annihilation of millions of people. In other cases, warfare is limited to a ceremonial gathering of armies that result in few to no deaths. By understanding the different models of human warfare, students engage with universal questions such as, how and why warfare happens. Is warfare an innate part of humanity? What is and is not warfare? </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 210 - Otherworldly Selves in Science Fiction and Anthropology </P><P>Anthropology and science fiction often evoke thoughts of strangers in a strange land, but what does each actually consider &quot;strange&quot;? What are the problems and possibilities that differentiation or assimilation present? Fusing ethnography, theory, film, and literature, this course enhances students' ability to think critically about questions of (non)human difference, including race, gender, culture, species, time, and space. Themes include the boundaries of self and other, real and imaginary, past/present/future, (post)apocalypse, human and machine, the body and its parts, and familiar and strange, while also challenging these distinctions. Provides opportunities for creative expression, empowers students to utilize literary works and media as interpretive tools for social scientific research, and encourages thinking across the disciplinary divides of science, social studies, and humanities. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 211 - Investigating Contemporary Cultures (RI) </P><P>Introduces students to the research methods that anthropologists use to study human beings in all their complexity: the range of qualitative, in-depth, and participatory techniques that comprise ethnography. Through a series of hands-on active research projects, students will learn how to investigate the complex social world we live in, and analyze what they find. The course covers the research process from asking compelling questions, to collecting qualitative data and critically analyzing it, to choosing how to present it. The course also addresses the ethical implications and responsibilities that accompany learning about human beings by interacting with them, and then representing them to others. The readings, lectures, and discussions will explore how anthropological knowledge is generated and anthropology's relationship to political-economic power, historical experience, and personal identity. Students will also gain valuable research methods skills for career choices. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: ANTH 102 or ANTH 103 or SOCI 101  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None Formerly: SOAN 211 </P><P>ANTH 226 - Critical Global Health </P><P>In contemporary American society, Western medicine-or biomedicine-is seen as offering quick, effective, and technologically advanced solutions to pain and suffering. Biomedicine is a medical system that privileges the physiological and biological causes of disease. As a clinical science, biomedicine is usually seen as culture-less, as universally effective on all bodies. But what happens when Western medicine goes &quot;global,&quot; that is, when it encounters cultural values or beliefs that conceptualize illness, healing, or the body in different ways? Is medicine itself &quot;cultural,&quot; and if so, how? This course examines how people experience, use, and critique global health interventions across the globe, and why sociological and anthropological approaches to global health are critical to improving these interventions. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 228 - Women and Gender in Prehistory </P><P>Takes a feminist perspective to the study of gender and identity in prehistoric societies and ancient civilizations. By looking at the variation of gender roles and relations throughout history and cross-culturally, students help to deconstruct many modem-day assumptions about gender and gender roles in the present. The course will provide an overview of how material remains are used for understanding social identities in the past. It will review feminist critiques of archaeology and how feminism has impacted the discipline of archaeology. Students examine archaeological resources for gendering the past (burials, art, artifacts) and explore gender in a range of prehistoric cultural contexts (hunter-gatherers, farmers, states, and empires) using archaeological case studies as examples. Students additionally look at the ways in which historical archaeology has helped to better understand gender relations in historical contexts. Students critically examine how gender and identity have been represented in academic research, museums, and popular media, in order to deconstruct modern-day assumptions about gender. Case studies derive from the earliest human origins, ancient complex civilizations, and recent colonial America. This course is designed for students with little or no background in archaeology or anthropology. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior, No Junior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 244 - Who Owns Culture? </P><P>Who owns a song?

Native and indigenous societies, whose views on cultural property and heritage have long been marginalized, bring their own perspectives to these questions. With reference to critical anthropological literature, this course uses specific case studies to examine local and global intellectual property and cultural heritage regimes. The topics in this course intersect with the fields of legal anthropology, cultural studies, Native American studies, museum studies, and indigenous studies. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics </P><P>The words &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;the environment&quot; conjure up visions of wild animals and open landscapes, but are people part of nature, too? Shows how nature and human culture are intertwined, both in terms of how we shape our environment as well as how it shapes us. Through a series of case studies, students explore this relationship, focusing especially on the way that nature and culture are &quot;political&quot;: inequalities, social problems and movements, and power relations all flow from the way that we interact with our environment.

If pious Muslims rejected Islam's mystical (Sufi) traditions in the twentieth century, why are many embracing these traditions today? This course poses and answers such questions by exploring Muslim-majority societies across time and place, emphasizing the changing technologies, institutions, practices, and identities that bind them. Major historical topics addressed in the course include Islam's foundational texts and interpretive traditions, colonial modernity and market capitalism, the rise of nation-states and national identities, and contemporary globalization. Major social-cultural topics include changing media technologies and usage, current Islamic revivalism and Islamic feminist movements, gender and sexuality, knowledge and power, and secularism and non-Muslim religious minorities.  </P><P>Credits: 1.00 </P><P>Crosslisted: MIST 252  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 253 - Field Methods and Interpretation in Archaeology (RI) </P><P>Provides students with hands-on experience in procedures archaeologists employ in collecting, processing, and reporting data. The course revolves around two basic premises: learning about archaeology includes doing archaeology, and doing archaeology involves more than just digging. Training in archaeological fieldwork and data processing is based upon an ongoing research project in Central New York. Each student has the opportunity to participate in various aspects of this research from excavation and field recording to cataloguing and analysis. The culmination of the course is a detailed report based upon research conducted during the semester.

Through readings, lectures, discussions, visits to regional museums, and design of a virtual exhibition, students are introduced to the theory and practice of museology; the care, conservation, and interpretation of material culture collections; and the use of material culture in research and public education. In addition, the course examines 1) the origins and evolution of the ongoing debate concerning representation of Native Americans in museums, 2) the changing relationship between native people and national cultural institutions, and 3) the future of museums on the highly contested multicultural stage of the 21st century. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None </P><P>Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 305 - Science and Society (RI) </P><P>Critically examines techno-science as a transnational social-cultural phenomenon. Using the tools of anthropology, students explores how science is embedded in social, cultural, political and economic systems and processes. Case studies drawn from the Global North and South show how the context in which science is produced and consumed matters. They also demonstrate how techno-science is a transnational phenomenon, in which ideas, objects, methods and practices change as they travel. Critical examination of different sciences and scientists teaches us as much about the social world as it does about the natural one, and challenges the divide between the two.  </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 315 - Gender and Culture </P><P>Focuses on gender as a culturally constructed, historically variable, and politically contested category rather than an immutable biological &quot;given.&quot; Students have two major objectives: first, to develop a cross-cultural understanding of femininity, masculinity, androgyny, and gendered phenomena generally by examining and comparing gender relations and gender ideologies in a wide variety of human societies, ranging from small bands of hunters and gatherers to post-industrial states; and second, to develop a critical understanding of the types of theories, methods, and data that are relevant to the study of gender and sexuality - including heteronormativity, same-sex relations, transgender practices and identities, &quot;third sexes,&quot; and &quot;third genders&quot; - in anthropology and related disciplines. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 316 - Religion, Culture, and Media </P><P>Explores the media practices through which people create and negotiate religious value and meaning.

Interpretations of health and illness, and the experience of one's body are often taken for granted. Yet our ideas about and experiences of health, disease, and medicine are profoundly shaped by culture; by transnational flow of people, ideas, and resources; by histories of colonialism and structural inequalities; and by the development of new technologies. This course introduces students to approaches used by medical anthropologists to study the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of the human experience of the body, health, illness, and healing. Topics covered include cultural interpretations of sickness and healing, cultural ideas about the body, social and environmental causes of illness, the effects of poverty on health, the roles of doctors and healers in society, cultural clashes and ethical issues in health care delivery, anthropological critiques of Western biomedicine, and the place of medical anthropology in the study of public health. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 330 - Deep Time: Representing the Human Past in Contemporary South Africa (Extended Study) </P><P>Focuses on how the &quot;deep African past&quot; has been imagined and represented by authoritative knowledge-producing institutions including academic disciplines like Anthropology and Archaeology, museums, and site-specific public education projects. The course also considers how authoritative interpretations of &quot;the past&quot; reflect contemporary political and nationalist interests, biases, and knowledge-producing projects. The course asks how some indigenous peoples become enshrined as exemplars of the generalized human past, and how their representation shifts with changing views of human nature. The three-week extended study component in South Africa will visit museums, archaeological sites, and historical monuments to more recent events in the history of that country. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 337 - Globalization and Culture </P><P>What does &quot;globalization&quot; mean, and what does it mean for societies and people facing the onslaught of global corporations? Students examine the phenomenon of globalization from a variety of theoretical </P><P>perspectives, ranging from neo-liberal economics to cultural anthropology. They analyzes how each of these works defines the causes of globalization and its effects on traditional cultures, community relationships, economic wealth and justice, and political institutions. To put these theoretical works in perspective, interspersed with them are actual case studies of real people and real communities, ranging from Costa Rican farmers to Thai factory workers, interacting with the forces of globalization. These case studies allow students to test the abstract analyses and see which theories fit reality. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: SOCI 337 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 339 - Corporations and Power (RI) </P><P>Business corporations are among the most influential institutions on the earth today. This course examines the place of corporations in the contemporary world, focusing on their roles critically in global political-economic and social systems, and in our own lives. It considers how studying business corporations can help to better understand capitalism, globalization, work, consumerism, law, inequality, cultural change and personhood. The course delves into case studies that follow transnational corporations from Silicon Valley, to Papua New Guinea, and back again. In addition, the course includes a research component in which students will conduct and analyze original interviews. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 341 - Archaeology of Death &amp; Burial </P><P>People across the globe and through time have had understandings of death that may appear strange or even shocking to many today. For anthropologists and archaeologists, burials provide evidence for understanding conceptions of death, grief, mortuary rituals, and belief systems in the past. They also learn about the world of the living through the study of human remains and burials. Bioarchaeologists study how social identity, political change, colonialism, social inequality, warfare, and other large-scale social processes manifest physically in the human body. Students will take a close look at cross-cultural variation in understandings of death and mortuary practices through archaeological evidence. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 350 - Theorizing Contemporary Cultures </P><P>Anthropologists are philosophers of the social. With firm roots in classical social theory, anthropologists have always questioned the relationship of materiality and imagination in human culture, the dialectic of individual and social, the structures of power and authority, the pull of kinship and cosmology, and the cultural patterning of time, space, gender, and story. Anthropology trains our attention on big questions of comparative and global import, but seeks answers in concrete things that people do, say, and make. Anthropological theory thus rests on the empiricism of ethnography, archaeology, and material studies, and provides the questions that drive research. This course links contemporary theoretical work in the discipline with essential forerunner texts and projects. It also considers influential texts from theorists outside the discipline proper, recognizing that anthropology takes insights from many theoretical quarters, and in turn informs theoretical endeavors across the social sciences and humanities. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: ANTH 102  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 355 - Ancient Aztec Civilization </P><P>Debate key issues surrounding the Aztecs of Central Mexico using archaeological and written evidence to understand ancient Aztec culture. This course explores the great technological achievements of Aztec civilization, its complex rituals and beliefs, bustling marketplaces and cities, and the everyday lives of ordinary people. Questions addressed include: Who were the Aztecs? Why did the Aztecs practice human sacrifice and cannibalism? How did the Aztecs become the largest empire in ancient Mesoamerica? Did the Aztec Empire promote the well-being of its commoners? Was religion used as a tool of domination? What was the role of women in Aztec society? Why did the Aztec Empire fall to the Spanish? What happened to people following the fall of the Aztec Empire? Students will integrate primary sources, archaeological research, and ethnohistory to uncover the Aztec past. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 356 - Ethical Issues in Native American Archaeology </P><P>Examines a range of significant ethical issues relating to the archaeology of Native Americans in North America primarily, but also to some extent in Central and South America. Students not only read about and discuss conflicting perspectives leading to ethical dilemmas, but also propose solutions and evaluate existing policies to combat such problems. Some of the key topics covered in the course include the conservation ethic and stewardship; excavation and repatriation of Native American skeletal remains and sacred objects; looting, collecting, and commodification of Native American archaeological sites and artifacts; and public and postgraduate education. In short, the class actively engages in the critical ethical, theoretical, and legal debates surrounding Native American archaeology that have emerged over the past 30 years. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 358 - Native American Cultures </P><P>Focuses on the comparative and historical study of Native American cultures and societies throughout the Americas.

Warfare, globalization, market economies, food production, ethnic conflicts, and disease are all contingent on the relationship between human beings and their environments. Focuses on the complexity and nuance of those relationships through both space and time by utilizing an archaeological perspective. While many academic fields now focus on topics relating to environments, archaeology works with a dataset that spans the entirety of human history. Such a dataset allows archaeological researchers to ask powerful and fundamental questions, such as: How do human societies respond to environmental change? Have human beings ever successfully found a balance between themselves and their natural world? What events created today's environmental challenges? What leads to the downfall of a society? Students consider questions like these through various case-studies across the globe that deal with the diversity of human societies and the specific environments from which they emerged. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 365 - Andean Lives </P><P>While the Andes region may evoke quaint images often seen in tourism advertisements, a focus on the people living in this region reflects globally interconnected dynamics. Students engage with diverse authors who write about the Andes: as a place steeped in highland indigenous traditions; as the place of the Inca Empire; as a place of rural communities in which collective action can take priority over individual interest; as the original source of the coca leaf that has ritual significance through the region and contested political significance in the international sphere; as the birthplace of a Maoist guerrilla movement in the last gasp of the Cold War; and as the place where social movements have challenged global economic systems and brought an indigenous president to power. Through details about the lives of those who reside in the Andes, anthropological and historical views of this region with cases primarily from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador are brought together. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ALST 365   Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 371 - Gender and Society in Africa </P><P>Examines traditional notions about men, women, and reproduction from a number of African societies.

Formal archaeology in the U.S. was a latecomer to anthropology, appearing during the era of Franz Boas. Somewhat later, the field became methodologically standardized as a result of the New Deal. After World War II, Americanist archaeology became a battle ground for competing perspectives in anthropology, fueled in part by the appearance of the National Science Foundation. Today, archaeology in the United States and Europe confronts and integrates numerous new critiques and theoretical perspectives, many of which arrive from recent trends in anthropology and various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Among the topics addressed are cultural evolutionary theory, geoarchaeology, postcolonial critiques, practice theory, embodiment theory, gender archaeology, critical theory, discourse analysis, and indigenous archaeologies. The overarching goal is to assess the state of the art in anthropological approaches to the production of knowledge in archaeology. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 374 - Media, Community, Crisis: Mass-Mediated and Digital Cultures </P><P>Examines local, national, and global media platforms and practices as primary forces shaping social collectives and individual subjects.

Then, drawing on anthropological and historical case studies of their technological and commoditized reproduction in the 19th-21st centuries, students identify vast and accelerating forces shaping human communications, communities, and consciousness in the new millennium.  </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: FMST 374 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ANTH 378 - Social Theory of Everyday Life (RI) </P><P>Since classical times, philosophers and historians have studied and recorded the details of everyday life with an eye to grasping the meaning of social practice. The past 50 years, however, have seen the bourgeoning of an exciting body of critical theory on the quotidian. Much of this work is concerned with profound questions about how the systems, structures, and practices of modernity shape basic human interactions with things, with places, and with other persons, and how these, in turn, reproduce social structures. This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: SOCI 378  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ANTH 382 - Nations, Power, Islam: Muslim Identity and Community in the Global Age </P><P>Muslims today belong at once to a global community of the faithful and to particular ethnic and national bodies. Students examine the social significance of these intersections of identity and community: What political, cultural, and religious conflicts and negotiations mark Muslim identity in the global age? Initial readings survey the colonial age, which forced the integration of Muslim communities into the global capitalist and state systems. With this foundation students then address specific conflicts and congruencies of contemporary Muslim identity in both the Muslim world and the West: between Islamic law and national-state laws; between local Islamic norms and transnational flows of media, persons, and products; between popular Islam and political power. How do these issues affect Muslims and their neighbors? How do they affect geopolitics?

Normally focuses on at least two related exhibitions that are currently on view either on Colgate's campus or at nearby institutions. Students will meet with curators to learn about the exhibit and the decision-making process behind it. Students will examine how museums use wall text, labels, juxtapositions, frames, cases, lighting, architecture, and, above all, their choices of what to include and exclude, to craft particular narratives and encourage particular interpretations of objects and historical phenomena. May also include a hands-on practicum as well, giving students the opportunity to curate and install a real exhibition of their own design. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ARTS 257 - Colonizing and Decolonizing Museums </P><P>Museums have meant many things to different people over the centuries. The mandate to display and preserve objects of historical interest is a relatively recent meaning. But museums have always had agendas, implicit judgements about the structure of history and the value of culture. Museums came to serve new and quite specific purposes during the 18-19th centuries as European presence expanded around the globe as colonialism and imperialism. Students explore the thinking driving the collecting processes that fed these museums and the display strategies that animated them, both in Europe and in the spaces Europeans colonized. India will serve as the main case study, with comparison cases drawn from Africa and North America. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ARTS 260 - Social Practice Art </P><P>An introduction to Social Practice Art that covers a selection of practices and methodologies, including participatory art, public art, the role of research, performance, interventionist works, eco-art, political art, and community-based works. Students consider local, global, systemic, networked, and cultural contexts for their work, which might expose, solve, or complicate political or social conflicts. Issues of form, ethics, exhibition, the role of the studio, and the role of the artist in society are addressed in the context of larger discourses in 21st-century contemporary arts practice, where context is often researched prior to generating the form and content of the art work. Students are encouraged to explore practices beyond the basics; group and individual projects require both rigorous concept development and demonstrated concern with relational form. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: ARTS 100 None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ARTS 263 - Sculpture: Surface and Form (SA) </P><P>Introduces, through a series of directed projects, basic sculptural concepts and processes, both analog and digital, in a contemporary critical context.

An important aspect of the course will be thinking about how photography — the primary medium through which we can now know how past exhibitions looked like — operates as a medium of visual representation as well as a force of cultural innovation by circulating modern art. In addition to the study of the history of exhibitions, students will also investigate the changing role of the art critic and the curator. As part of the course, students will study exhibitions on campus, applying to contemporary shows the critical skills learned by studying art displays from the past. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ARTS 350 - Art and the Goddess </P><P>Looks at the recent popularity of goddesses and the ancient art that have celebrated the worship of goddesses in various parts of the world.

In its territorial extent, it would be matched only by the Roman Empire at its height, some 600 years later. To the Greeks, who managed to repel Darius's invasion as well as that of his son, Xerxes, the Persians were both fearsome and fascinating, the &quot;other&quot; against whom they fought but also defined themselves as Greeks, and the possessors of untold riches, unseen wonders, and unbelievable marvels.

Instead of asking &quot;How does one do research?&quot;, students focus our inquiry on a broader set of questions about research within the field of educational studies. Namely: What is research? Who does research and/or who gets researched? What does research produce? What is the relationship between research and knowledge? Research and truth? Research and power? How has research been done? Who has it traditionally served? And what does research do? By asking these (and other) questions about what comprises &quot;research&quot;, students engage in unpacking how it is we see, observe, perceive, and analyze the educational worlds around us, specifically through the lenses of race, gender, class, sexuality, Indigeneity, and ability. Because educational studies is a field that investigates how and what we learn and because research, put succinctly, deals with the production and reproduction of knowledges, studying research through the field of Educational Studies allows us to study how we learn about knowledge itself. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: EDUC 101  Major/Minor Restrictions: Open to Majors only Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 231 - Inquiry Based Teaching in the Schools </P><P>An opportunity to connect theory to pragmatic issues of teaching.

K-12 education offers few curricular and institutional spaces where queer identities are affirmed and queer voices are heard. From sex education to the prom, most schools and educators operate under the ahistorical guise of heteronormativity--a term used to describe ideologies and practices that organize and privilege opposite-sex gender relations and normative gender and sexual identities. Using critical lenses developed by queer and feminist theorists and critical pedagogues, this course seeks both to explore how heteronormativity operates in a variety of educational spaces and how students and educators are confronting these processes by using schools as sites of resistance. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: LGBT 241  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: ALST 242 or EDUC 101 or LGBT 220 or LGBT 227 or LGBT 242 or RELG 253 or SOCI 220 </P><P>Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 245 -Globalization's Children: The Education of the &quot;New&quot; Immigrants in the United States </P><P>Set against the larger backdrop of globalization and transnational migration, this course examines the educational experiences of contemporary or &quot;new" im/migrants and the children of im/migrants in U.S. schools, focusing on migrants from countries in Asia and Latin America. Drawing heavily from anthropological and sociological perspectives on the schooling of &quot;the new second-generation,&quot; the course charts the changing demography of the nation-state post-1965 and explores issues of acculturation and assimilation, the tensions and contradictions of &quot;learning a new land,&quot; and the ways in which cultural and structural factors intersect with immigrant students' everyday realities to shape school performance and opportunity. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: EDUC 101  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 246 -Forced Migration and Education </P><P>Explores forced migration through the lens of human rights, and specifically the right to a quality education.

Through a critical analysis of notions of &quot;crisis&quot; and &quot;emergency&quot;, students gain a deeper understanding of global, national, and local refugee policy and practice. Drawing on memoirs, documentaries, and primary documents, students examine the intimate nature of forced migration, countering the image of faceless masses moving within and across borders. Students investigate and assess education programs as part of a short term response to conflict and long term peacebuilding efforts. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: EDUC 101  None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 303 -Decolonizing Development: Gender, Power &amp; Education in International Development </P><P>Development, rather than a benign and neutral process, must be analyzed for how it traffics with power.

Through reading texts, primary sources, and watching films students will encounter pedagogy and educative practices not only in the classroom, the school, and educational theory but also through the study of public intellectuals, popular culture, and in grassroots activism and social movements. Decentering educative and pedagogical practices that advance either dominant structures or democratic reconfigurations, students explore questions about educational access and equity by examining the intersections of gender, sexuality; race and racialized-gender; class; (im)migration and labor; humanitarianism, and legalities; ableism, disability, and the body; and society. This includes discussions of the ethical dimensions of education, the ways in which education is implicated in the formation of individual and social identities, and the role of teachers in the formation of personal and social identity. Throughout the semester, students delve into analyses of education, power, and hegemony culminating in substantive student-designed critical pedagogy research papers and projects. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: EDUC 101 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None </P><P>Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 317 -Democracy and Education </P><P>An opportunity to engage in in-depth analysis of the interrelationship between democratic and educational theory.

Students look at how different aspects of a person's identity – their ability, their gender, their race, their sexuality, their class – intersect to position them as citizens or non-citizens, members or threats to the future of the family and the nation. Students are introduced to the theoretical, analytical, and methodological tools of feminist disability studies, and the emerging field of DisCrit (Disability studies and Critical Race Theory). Using these theoretical and analytic tools, students look to the ways that activists, artists, and scholars have re-imagined the disabled body/mind as a complex identity. </P><P>Credits: 1 Crosslisted: WMST 339  Prerequisites: EDUC 101  or WMST 202  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>EDUC 440 -Special Topics in Educational Studies </P><P>Members of the Department of Educational Studies rotate teaching this senior seminar that is designed for students who are interested in producing a traditional senior thesis.

Modernity and postmodernity can thus be understood only in relation to one another. This course pursues that relation by focusing on poets like W.H. Auden, Sterling Brown, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Muriel Rukeyser, Wallace Stevens, Melvin Tolson, or William Carlos Williams. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 340 - Critical Theory: Language, Semiotics, and Form </P><P>A survey of important developments in the formation of literary criticism as a modern discipline.

Reading across time, space, and genre, students examine how African American writers have developed traditions of protest and political dissent, navigated the evolution of racial discourse after Reconstruction, and explored the terms of freedom, citizenship and belonging in the United States. Students also engage African American literary production across a variety of forms to consider how African American writers respond to social and cultural movements of the 20th and 21st centuries. Topics include the artistic renaissance in Harlem and Chicago, the Civil Rights movement, the Black Arts movement, the emergence of the New Black Aesthetic, and Black writing in the age of Black Lives Matter.

Texts include works by such writers as Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, Wilkie Collins, Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, George Egerton, and George Gissing. Attention is paid to the many forms that Victorian fiction took, and to the variety of topics that it addressed. There are opportunities to consider such subjects as Victorian publishing practices, fiction as a vehicle for social criticism, the relationship of fiction to other cultural forms, and the growing frankness of mainstream fiction. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 346 - Victorian Poets &amp; Essayists </P><P>A close study of works by British poets and essayists of the Victorian era (1837-1901), with emphasis on their place in 19th-century thought and art and on their varied responses to the period's sweeping political, economic, scientific and technological transformations.

Chaucer's Canterbury Tales capture the liveliness and precision of Middle English and the variety of late medieval English life. In them Chaucer explores issues of community, gender, identity,  and authority as the pilgrims tell tales, quarrel with one another, and assert themselves. Through their narratives, the pilgrims attempt to make sense of the social, religious, and political challenges of a world at least as confusing as our own.

To uncover the racial and political meanings of twentieth-century mobilities in the Americas, we will explore texts in a variety of media - narrative fiction, poetry, literary nonfiction, photography, sound recordings, and film - and theorize these mediums from a range of perspectives. Major figures include Dorothea Lange, William Faulkner, Susan Sontag, Toni Morrison, Cormac McCarthy, Ida B. Wells, Louise Erdrich, and Richard Wright. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 368 - After Genocide: Memory and Representation </P><P>An investigation of the impact of genocide on the self and the imagination's representations in literature, film, and art. Primary texts include poetry, memoir, video testimony, film, and visual art. Scholarly methodology involves readings of literary criticism and theoretical work in the study of trauma, literary theory, and testimony. Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PCON 368 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 370 - Prophecy and Doubt: Romantic and Victorian British Poetry </P><P>Deeply troubled by accelerating change and alarming social upheaval, 19th century British poetry veers between prophecy and doubt, neither entirely sure of its vision nor willing to surrender hope. Perhaps even more than ourselves, the poets of this era felt keenly the forces of social fragmentation and the constriction of the human spirit by machinery and technology. Students start with fiery seers like William Blake or Percy Shelly, observe poets like Tennyson, Barrett-Browning, Arnold or the Rossettis wrestling with the role of the poet in modern society, and follow the self-described &quot;last of the Romantics,&quot; the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, as he prepares the way for modernism precisely by digging deeper yet into tradition. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 371 - South Asian Diasporas </P><P>An introduction to literatures, films, and critical theory from the South Asian diasporas in North America, England, and South Africa.

Jane Austen has held an unchallenged place in a great tradition of 19th-century authors, but has only recently been read in the context of her female predecessors. Reading Maria Edgeworth, Fanny Burney, and Charlotte Lennox gives students a new way to read Austen; reading among the many current critical theories about women as producers and consumers of fiction in the 18th century helps raise more general questions about the literary canon and how it has been formed.

Students review the tumultuous decade of the 1950s during which time the United States was catapulted into a Cold War with the Soviet Union and a congruent episode of anticommunist hysteria known as McCarthyism. This initiated the new nuclear age created with the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. It was also a decade defined by the struggle with Jim Crow racism and the emergence of a new Civil Rights movement, the birth of the second wave of feminism, and the emergence of a rich range of cultural criticism focused on issues including the social construction of the American family, corporate and suburban conformism, sexual repression, and the destructive capacities of the new military industrial complex. Out of this charged political and cultural situation, writers created some of the most innovative literary works in modern American history. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 431 - Ethnographic Fictions: Travel Writing, Bearing Witness, and Human Rights </P><P>Helps students navigate fiction's complex relationship with representation and reality. Scans a broad spectrum of texts, beginning with 18th- and 19th-century European novels, and continue onto contemporary writings from the postcolonial world. Students discuss the complex ways in which fiction documents the social world, produces historical archives, bears witness to trauma and violence, and memorializes loss, but also rejects and/or makes readers critically aware of realism's positivist impulses. Also guides students in reading theoretical texts on the topic. Possible authors include Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Leonard Woolf, Bertolt Brecht, Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Michael Ondaatje, and David Henry Hwang. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ENGL 433 - Caribbean Literature </P><P>A study of the literature and culture of the Caribbean through prose and poetry written in English.

It differs from, say, maxims, proverbs, or apothegms in that it turns on paradox and antithesis; it differs from earlier forms in the ways it undermines rather than supports certainty. Students explore the relations of literary form to convictions about the nature and limits of human knowledge, habits of reading, and its uses in life. Students follow the transformation of the aphorism both as form and as impulse as it is reinvented in the Modern period-chiefly following the example of Friedrich Nietzsche-and explores its character as a lyrical corrective to overly definitive and linear ways of organizing and writing about experience. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENGL 445 - Life-Writing: The Renaissance </P><P>How do we tell stories about people?

Questions of how environments are inflected by gender and racial positions, as well as literature's insights into issues of environmental justice and sustainability, are addressed through works by writers such as Wendell Berry, Charles Chesnutt, Annie Dillard, William Faulkner, bell hooks, Aldo Leopold, Marilynne Robinson, Wallace Stevens, and Jean Toomer. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ENGL 219 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENST 232 - Environmental Justice </P><P>In the wake of the environmental movement and the civil rights movement rose a crosscurrent of issues combining problems of social justice and environmental issues. During the past four decades, this crosscurrent has swelled to produce a new social movement: the environmental justice movement. This course explores the terms and ideas of environmental justice by addressing the key issues of environmental racism, distributive justice, procedural justice, and justice as recognition, and the ways in which these concepts explain environmental inequality. It embraces the deep interrogation of the historical context of environmental problems and the ways in which systems of oppression contribute to environmental issues. These issues are introduced and discussed mainly in the context of the U.S. environmental justice movement, with some international context highlighted periodically. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENST 234 - Case Studies in Global Environmental Health </P><P>Environmental health is a field of interdisciplinary study that integrates human society and behavior with ecological processes to understand environmental dimensions of human health. Students focus on not only knowledge generated in the natural and social sciences that concerns human-environmental interactions and its implications for human health risk, but also includes an extensive case study on various emergent issues in public health. Case Studies in Global Environmental Health Issues introduces students to the conceptual and empirical underpinning of the direct and indirect relationships between environment and health, approaches to measuring these relationships, and the ways in which health policies, programs and clinical practices have been organized to reduce risk at various geographic scales: locally, nationally and internationally. Students have an opportunity to complete an extensive research project on issues of environmental health during the second half of the semester. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Restrictions: Not open to students who have taken ENST 233 and ENST333 Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>ENST 240 - Sustainability: Science and Analysis </P><P>Using scientific evidence and tools, this course presents sustainability issues and solutions through environmental science and engineering perspectives.

A close examination of the theoretical North-South relationship, in terms of dependency and exploitation of peripheral (South) countries by core (North) countries, is central to the course. It analyzes a constellation of issues labeled as global environmental justice, such as tribal exterminations, dislocations of marginalized communities, and resource conflicts. Real world examples of environmental justice cases are critically assessed to develop an understanding of the complex relationships among actors that lead to environmental injustices. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ENST 324 - Hunting, Eating, Vegetarianism </P><P>Historically, hunting for food has represented one of the most direct ways in which people have engaged with nature. Some scholars even believe that the &quot;hunting instinct&quot; is a fundamental aspect of human identity. People in modern industrialized societies, however, often have little idea about the origins of the flesh they consume, most of which is raised and slaughtered on an industrial-scale. While the majority continue to eat meat, poultry, and/or fish, a minority have chosen to become vegetarians or even vegans for ethical, religious, cultural, health-oriented, or environmental reasons. Others continue to hunt and fish but within ecosystems dramatically altered by human intervention and amidst cultural landscapes complicated by commercialized and trophy hunting.  Drawing upon a wide range of sources including literature, artistic and documentary films, works of popular culture, autobiographical accounts, online hunting (and anti-hunting) forums, diverse web resources, self-reflective essays, and scholarly approaches ranging from animal studies to humanistic ecocriticism, this course investigates the intertwined themes of hunting, industrial versus small-scale farming and fishing, eating, vegetarianism, and the ethical and existential choices they present to members of modern industrialized societies. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>ENST 335 - US Environmental Politics </P><P>Public policies to protect the environment are among the most important and controversial issues in local, state, and national government.

Simultaneously, how should we understand contemporary mass media themselves as &quot;global&quot;? Have transformations in print, broadcast, and digital media fundamentally altered how we think of the near and the far, the familiar and the foreign, the national and the transnational, the West and the non-West? This course will address these questions through the two structuring notions of the &quot;flow&quot; and the &quot;counter-flow,&quot; and analyze the role that media play as both a unifying and a divisive agent, consolidating identities and nationalisms in some instances, and deterritorializing the same in others. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: FMST 212L Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>FMST 212L - Required Film Screening </P><P>Required corequisite to FMST 212. </P><P>Credits: 0.00 Corequisite: FMST 212  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>FMST 224 - Introduction to Italian Cinema </P><P>An introduction to major works of Italian cinema from the silent era to contemporary productions.

They help shift political opinions and shape cultural tastes. However, the logic on which algorithmic systems are based and the infrastructures that sustain them are still largely unknown to their users (and, increasingly, to their developers). Students will explore several case studies – from Netflix's recommendation system to voice assistants – in order to demystify the logic of algorithms and map the understudied ways in which they paradoxically decrease diversity of tastes, opinions, and experiences despite the techno-utopian promise of endless choice. This process of &quot;un-black boxing&quot; will emphasize &quot;the implantation gap&quot; in algorithmic systems and the ways in which they give birth to new systems of control, surveillance, and biopower. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None </P><P>Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>FMST 380 - New York Media (Study Group) </P><P>Examines the diverse film and media ecosystem of New York, including the interplay between independent film and media-making, community-based media projects, and corporate film and media-making, in order to develop a nuanced understanding of the aesthetic, cultural, political, and economic context in which media operate in New York. Students explore New York's role as an exhibition hub for globally-produced film and media, applying academic discourses on film and media to the critical analysis of film/media festivals, institutions, organizations. Throughout, students simultaneously engage the historical and contemporary forces shaping various regions of New York, including immigration, racial and economic disparity, rural/urban and upstate/downstate politics, and gentrification and displacement. How do New York's complex social issues shape, manifest in, and impact its arts and media institutions, its artists and media-makers, and the art/media they create? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: FMST 200  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>FMST 382 - Media Industries: Practice and Perspectives (Study Group) </P><P>Explores the contours and practices of media industries (film, television, print, video game, podcast, and mobile technologies through both academic study and structured internship and shadowing opportunities.

That people are dramatically altering the climate is now the resounding consensus in the scientific community. Potential short- and long-term impacts include biodiversity loss, sea-level rise and coastal flooding, more intense storms, threats to human health, and disruptions of freshwater supplies and food security. But while the global community increasingly understands the basic processes driving climate change, and is starting to appreciate the consequences of a warmer world, the coupled social and biophysical dynamics of global warming are complex and the issue remains controversial. This course explores climate-society relationships in industrial and pre-industrial periods, and considers the multifaceted natural and human dimensions of global warming.

The analytical powers of GIS are rooted in its ability to manage large volumes of geographically referenced data representing both physical and social characteristics. As such, GIS has become an important analytical approach in most subfields of geography. Students begin with an examination of basic mapping concepts, geographic data issues, symbolism, and generalization. Emphasis then shifts to issues in GIS data structure, collection, and input. Once a solid understanding of these GIS foundation issues is achieved, attention turns to the analytical powers and applications of GIS. These topics are reinforced by a series of exercises dealing with local geographic data. Students make use of the ArcGIS geographic information system and involves map digitization, geographic data collection (using global positioning systems, satellite imagery, and aerial photography), database management, and spatial analysis. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: GEOG 245L Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 245L - Geographic Information Systems Lab </P><P>Required corequisite to GEOG 245. </P><P>Credits: 0.25 Corequisite: GEOG 245 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 250 - Research Methods </P><P>Acquaints students with key principles and practices of original scholarly research.

Then focuses on the techniques and rationale of a particular method of research, which will vary from semester to semester. Examples of possible foci include statistical analysis, interviews, community-based and participatory research, content analysis, or the interpretation of historical primary sources. In close consultation with the instructor, students design, carry out, and report on a research project employing that method to answer a question of their own design. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 251 - Media Frames and Content Analysis </P><P>Mass media is a key set of institutions in modernity that shape our perceptions of the world, with important impacts on what we take to be reality. The media &quot;frames&quot; that structure how media is produced, conveyed, and consumed form the discourses that we use to understand mass politics and culture in our daily lives. This course provides students with the methodological tools to empirically study media frames through content analysis. Content analysis takes the stuff of media, such as music lyrics, news stories, or advertisements, and systematically analyzes the content for the explicit and implicit frames that represent the issues and perspectives conveyed through media. The course provides students hands-on training in content analysis through a series of workshops on content sampling, collection, coding, and analysis that culminate in a final research project.

In modern and contemporary history, authoritarian states and democracies alike have developed concentration camps, internment camps, refugee camps, detention camps, and displaced persons camps --in ever increasing numbers. Countries have done so in order to separate and define populations they would or could not assimilate within the political life of the nation state, thereby relegating those populations to an exceptional status instead. To study the geographic spread of camps as technologies for advancing a state of exception, then, is to learn how –and to what extent-- human rights have been acknowledged or betrayed in contemporary history. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PCON 303 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 304 - Criminal Underworld: Drugs, Guns, Bodies </P><P>Examines the violent networks of the illicit global economy: from guns and drugs smuggling, to human trafficking and animal poaching among others. Drawing from multiple scholarly traditions, it compares the concrete geographical organization of these illicit networks - that is, where and how they become grounded -and asks the following questions: What are the relationships of these illegal activities to legal circuits of power and profit?

Certainly, a huge industry has emerged in recent years to feed the public's desire for ways to improve their happiness. There is also a rapidly growing amount of research on the subject. This course starts with an overview of the diverse, multidisciplinary scholarship on factors that may contribute to happiness. But the main goal of the course is to consider themes central to the discipline of geography: how do environmental changes, efforts to achieve sustainable development, and culture affect the geography of happiness? Do people achieve a greater sense of well-being when interacting with wilderness or by exploring nature in their backyards? Does environmental stewardship improve happiness? What roles do attitudes about food and leisure play in how happy people are? Students explore these questions via out-of-class excursions, films, a diverse mix of scholarly and popular press readings, guest speakers, and individual research projects. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior, No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 307 - What's in your cup? The Geography of what we Drink </P><P>What people eat and drink connects them to a global socioecology and a complex exchange of commodities. What's in your cup? uses our daily consumption of beverages to analyze the social and environmental implications of how people live. From the energy used to boil water for a morning coffee to the biota disturbed by farmers across the world, what we drink may be linked to carbon emissions, water pollution, and public health hazards, all of which have implications for consumers and producers alike. Challenges, such as climate change, limited access to land, and market shifts, often leave farmers vulnerable. But there are also many examples of efforts that empower farmers to live well and care for the land, provide consumers access to ethically produced beverages, and initiatives that promote sustainable development. Using examples from around the world students explore the geography of what people drink. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations, Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 309 - Latin America: Critical Landscapes of Development </P><P>Explores the development experience of Latin America through examination of pressing environmental, economic, political, and social issues that currently face the region as a whole and play out differently across the region. The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, Andean countries, the Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ALST 309   Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None </P><P>Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>GEOG 310 - Geopolitics </P><P>Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of &quot;the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation.&quot; As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the &quot;closed system&quot; we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified </P><P>- various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th century, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PCON 310 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 311 - Global Urban </P><P>An exploration of contemporary urban geography and academic writing about the city. It introduces students to the ways in which urban geography has played a role, along with other disciplines that focus on the urban, in understanding cities and the issues that surround them. This includes an examination of how cities are conceived, lived, and represented. The course investigates the following topics: What are the various ways that people create, and attempt to materialize, their geographical imaginations of what they want the city to be? What are the ways in which different social groups make claims on space and place, and how does the scale at which these activities occur have effects? What are the critical questions to ask about urban landscapes today? How would you formulate a research proposal on such topics? The course offers a theoretical and practical framework within which to examine the city as a site of socio-cultural and political-economic transformation. In this framework, students analyze how the state, market, and civil society intersect, and how this has changed over the 20th century in the U.S. and other parts of the world. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>GEOG 312 - The American City </P><P>Focuses on the historical development and contemporary spatial patterns and processes of American cities. Topics emphasized include the decentralization of people and jobs within urban areas, metropolitan political fragmentation, racial residential segregation, inner-city gentrification, urban public service provision issues, the role of new immigrant groups, and feminist perspectives on urban geography, plus international and interregional comparisons to elicit distinctive characteristics of urbanization in the US. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>GEOG 313 - Geographical Political Economy: Asia in Globalization </P><P>Contemporary sociocultural and environmental issues cannot be understood without a good grasp of globalizing, yet place-specific political economic contexts in which these issues are embedded. The course aims to prepare students with conceptual and analytical foundations of economic geography with a particular attention to the roles of states, firms, and workers in the increasingly interconnected world. A strong empirical emphasis is given to Asia, although other world regions are addressed throughout the course for comparative and integrative purposes. Questions asked in this course include: what causes territorial economic growth and decline? How do place-specific economic structures influence policies? How are &quot;the economy&quot; and environment interrelated? Does advanced technology make geography irrelevant? Does economic growth produce socio-spatial inequality? In answering these questions, Asia offers a critical empirical arena to test theories and hypotheses, many of which have been developed primarily in the Euro-American contexts. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 315 - Sustainable Livelihoods in Asia </P><P>We are living in the world of growing uncertainty filled with various &quot;shocks&quot; such as natural disasters, financial crises, and development projects, and more insidious &quot;distress&quot; via resource depletion, excessive industrial specialization, and demographic transitions. This course focuses on how households and communities cope with, resist, adapt to, and challenge these large structural &quot;disturbances&quot; in locally specific and ingenious ways in order to take control and enhance their livelihood opportunities and cultural identities. Case studies are drawn from various parts of Asia, with a particular focus on Japan. Although theoretical foundations of this course are grounded in the literature on sustainable livelihood and community resilience in geography and neighboring fields, it is designed for students with various disciplinary backgrounds and interest in Asia. Students are expected to apply their disciplinary skills and regional knowledge to the course project. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 316 - Environmental and Public Health Geographies </P><P>Considers patterns of spatial and social distribution of disease and of health and medical resources.

These topics are explored within the historical and contemporary context of the United States and New York. The class considers theoretical perspectives that have been applied to the study of migration as well as approaches used by sociologists and geographers in empirical analyses of US immigration, immigrant populations, and ethnic relations. These analytical issues are considered in detail for immigrant and ethnic groups within New York State and the New York metropolitan community. Finally, students consider the relationships among patterns of immigration and ethnic relations, cultural change, international relations and transnational linkages, and US immigration policy reform. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: SOCI 318  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 321 - Transnational Feminist Geography </P><P>Introduces students to major themes and issues in feminist geography, both in the U.S. and globally. Explores how environments shape, and are shaped by, gendered power dynamics in society. Addresses geographic issues from feminist approaches to social justice to advance students' understandings of the complex relationships between spatiality and power relations. To this end, students work across diverse geographies to explore (1) the social relations underlying geographic problems; (2) the ways in which gender, class, race, sexuality, nationality, and dis/ability intersect in environmental issues; and (3) feminist geographic methods and theories of knowledge production. Students bring a global perspective to the issues by drawing out local-global linkages. Case studies are drawn from North America, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>GEOG 322 - Ecologies of the City </P><P>With half of the world's population living in and around cities, the needs of urban-based populations and economies dominate non-urban peoples, places, and habitats worldwide. This course begins with an introduction to political ecology, a body of knowledge combining political economy and cultural ecology. Political economy is the study of how different societies are connected globally, and cultural ecology is the study of the relationship between a society and its natural environment. Although political ecology largely focuses on places and cultures of &quot;pristine&quot; or &quot;native&quot; nature in &quot;other&quot; countries, this course turns to urban settings to explore how people understand urban areas and what their relationship to the environment in these areas is. Case studies of specific places (from small cities in upstate New York to global cities in distant countries) are used to learn about urban political ecological issues through readings, assignments, discussion, and interaction with local/regional experts on urban environmental problems. Students apply their knowledge about urban political ecology both collaboratively, in a final project conducted in a workshop-type setting, and individually, in a final term paper. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 323 - Arctic Transformations </P><P>The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing regions of the world today, environmentally, culturally, and politically. Rapid biophysical change occurs here today due to climate change, but equally noteworthy are cultural, social, and political transformations experienced by people living and working in the Arctic. People are under increasing pressure to change along with transformation of their biophysical environments, particularly as new actors express interest in the Arctic as space opening up to global transportation, mineral exploration, and trade and ecotourism. Within geography, interest in Arctic phenomena includes grappling with complex issues related to social and biophysical changes in this region, which often originate beyond the region but have specific meaning for the region. Students investigate three vibrant areas of Arctic transformation: cultural transformation occurring among indigenous and local peoples, biological and physical transformation of the environment, and political transformation within and related to the region. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: REST 323  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>GEOG 325 - Water and Society </P><P>No natural substance is more vital to human existence or used in more different ways than fresh water. This course considers the natural and social processes (with primary focus on the latter) that shape water use both within and outside of the United States, including physical factors, technology, economics, culture, law, and political systems and ideologies. The focus is on the services that water provides, the causes and consequences of water scarcity, and the ways in which water's services might be obtained in more sustainable ways. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 326 - Environmental Hazards </P><P>Environmental hazards are threats to people and the things they value. Hazards are a complex mix of natural processes and human actions; thus, they do not just happen, but are caused. Emphasis is on the role of institutions, technology, and human behavior in hazard creation, as well as ways in which society responds to hazards of multiple origins: case studies center on earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfire (natural hazards); toxic pollution (technological hazards); and invasive species (biological hazards). A key theme explores ways in which society may mitigate the risk of environmental hazards and manage them more effectively. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 328 - Sustainability and Natural Resources </P><P>Uses social science perspectives on sustainability and sustainable development to analyze the production and consumption of major natural resources. Addresses the following questions: What are natural resources, and how do their geographies combine with those of wealth and poverty, of political power and technological and institutional capacity, to affect the potential for actions towards sustainable development? How is our understanding of sustainable resource development enriched by critical perspectives from the social sciences about the meaning of such contested concepts as sustainability and development, and about issues of equity, power, participation, property rights, and unequal impacts (of both resource depletion and environmental policies)? How can the three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) of sustainability better guide the production and consumption of natural resources, renewable or nonrenewable, in different places and by different actors? The topical and regional focus of the course varies from year to year; it may, for example, focus on oil (or energy more generally), on minerals, or on biological and genetic resources; and on specific geographic areas, such as central New York, Latin America, or the Arctic. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None </P><P>Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>GEOG 329 - Environmental Security </P><P>About how the environment poses one of the most important security threats of the 21st century. From an interdisciplinary perspective, students are introduced to the different ways that climate change and environmental problems more generally are presenting new kinds of security threats. In many ways, greater environmental concern from governments and international organizations over the dramatic environmental changes afoot in the world is a welcome development. But will the &quot;environmental security&quot; framework reinforce global inequalities and maintain the status quo? Or might it mean rethinking the very foundations of what we mean by &quot;security&quot;? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PCON 329  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Sophomore, No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 331 - Environmental Data Science </P><P>Introduces fundamental concepts and tools central to the emerging field of Environmental Data Science. Satellites, environmental sensors, and citizen science networks collect a tremendous amount of geospatial data that offers unprecedented insight into the environment. The integration of computational tools, statistics, and an understanding of the earth system is essential for utilizing big data to understand environmental processes (e.g. climate change, food security). Topics covered include data provenance and reproducibility, data fusion, visualization, and statistical programing for environmental data. Students learn how to manipulate and analyze large climatic, ecological, and geospatial data sets using a statistical programing language. No prior programming experience is required. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: GEOG 245 or COSC 101 None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 332 - Weather and Climate </P><P>Focuses on the principles of meteorology and climatology with particular emphasis on Earth/energy dynamics, atmospheric circulation, and middle latitude climatology. Elements of Earth's energy system are used first to establish the basic causal forces that drive all weather phenomena. These concepts are extended into a section on atmospheric forces and thermodynamics, and used to build an understanding of the middle latitude climate system, including middle tropospheric circulation vorticity concepts and surface cyclone and anticyclone development. During this process, students perform several exercises that focus on atmospheric data analysis and forecasting. These exercises make use of numerous online meteorological data resources and culminate in a case study project involving the detailed analysis of a significant weather event. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 335 - Soil Geography </P><P>Focuses on the factors that influence soil distributions at scales ranging from a hillside to an entire continent.

These concepts are extended into a section on soil geomorphology and the role soils play in global change research. Additional topics to be emphasized include soil survey and predictive soil mapping. Throughout the course students perform exercises and/or participate in field excursions that focus on learning how to differentiate soils on the landscape. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: GEOG 231 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 336 - Biogeography </P><P>Focuses on the factors that influence plant and animal distributions at scales ranging from population to biome. To set the stage for discussing the geography of life, students first examine the earth's physical setting. This leads to consideration of the fundamental processes determining plant and animal distributions. The interactions among these processes are also examined, thereby introducing the concept of the ecosystem. The functions of an ecosystem are discussed with focuses on energy and matter flow, population dynamics, succession, and disturbance. The culmination of these processes is reflected in broad-scale geographic patterns. Thus, the characteristics of the major biomes are examined. Finally, because humans and the environment are inextricably linked, students explore several impacts humans have on the landscape, including fragmentation, extinction, and species introductions. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 338 - Earth System Ecology </P><P>Examines how plants influence exchanges of energy, carbon, and water between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Begins with an examination of key biological and physical processes that regulate ecosystem </P><P>carbon and water cycles, paying particular attention to critical linkages between the two. This leads to a consideration of how these processes function at larger spatial scales, and how they vary with time in response to climatic drivers. The land surface energy balance is discussed here as well, because it is inextricably linked with ecosystem carbon and water cycling. Finally, the interplay between ecosystems and climate is examined. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 340 - Geographic Information Systems and Society </P><P>Explores the impact of geographic information systems (GIS) on society. Begins by considering how technological advances in GIS have transformed the nature of geographic data creation and opened up entirely new fields of spatial analysis. Various theoretical perspectives are employed to better understand issues of privacy and ethics as they relate to GIS technologies. Specific topics include locational privacy, participatory GIS, volunteered geographic information, location-based services, the geoweb and new media, digital social/spatial inequalities, and the role of GIS in security and surveillance. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 341 - Cartography </P><P>As an academic discipline, geography focuses on the nature and causes of spatial variation. This focus is wide ranging and includes human and geophysical processes. Although the scope of geography is broad and the interest and expertise among geographers varied, one commonality is the use of maps and/or graphics for spatial analysis and visual communication. This course provides students with a fundamental understanding of cartography, including mapping theory, technique, and application. This objective is accomplished through a blend of lecture and exercises that introduce students to the theory and philosophy of cartography, map and graphic design, and appropriate forms of visual communication. The course begins with an introduction to cartography, including its history, and proceeds through examinations of statistical graphing, map projections, map design, symbology, and thematic mapping. </P><P>Credits: 0.50 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 346 - Advanced Geographic Information Systems </P><P>Focuses on geographic information systems (GIS) theory and complex spatial analysis.

The first segment explores the evolution of GIS from a set of cartographic and data analytical tools used primarily by geographers to a more encompassing set of ideas and tools used by many disciplines to examine spatial processes. Included in the first segment is a thorough examination of issues associated with mapping and referencing the non-spherical earth, conceptual models for representing spatial phenomena, and data-quality issues. The second segment focuses on a select set of spatial analytical issues that can be addressed using GIS. These issues include analysis of continuous spatial phenomena (e.g., terrain), model building using multiple sources of spatial data, network analysis, and the integration of remotely sensed data in a GIS. </P><P>Credits: 0.50 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: GEOG 245 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 347 - Satellite Image Analysis </P><P>Image analysis is a method used in geography to analyze remotely sensed data, including both satellite images and data collected from aircraft, in order to obtain information about earth's surface phenomena from afar. The primary objective is to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. Most typically, image analysis involves generating landcover maps using multi-spectral data collected by satellites. This course begins by focusing on the physical principles upon which image analysis is based, including the principles of acquiring and interpreting electromagnetic data collected by non-photographic sensors. Students then explore the basic tools of digital image processing (e.g., image enhancement, contract manipulation, etc.). This leads to a consideration of the process of image classification. Lastly, students discuss accuracy assessment as it applies to landcover classification, and spend a significant amount of time in the geography department computer lab performing analysis on remote sensing data. </P><P>Credits: 0.50 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: GEOG 245 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GEOG 401 - Seminar in Geography </P><P>The senior seminar focuses on emerging research within a subfield of contemporary geography chosen by the instructor.

Deepening students' familiarity with Germanophone Europe, the course adopts a multimedia approach to German studies (print, visual art, stage, radio and film) to advance cultural and transcultural literacy. The focus of the course depends on the instructor, who may emphasize linguistic structures through the study of advanced grammar and syntax; the relationship between crisis and critique in the history of Germanophone Europe; the gray zones between the past and the present, the living and the dead in studies of ghosts and the uncanny; or the borderlands of European multiculture.

Topics include Goethe's interest and influence in various cultural spheres, such as the visual arts, the scientific fields of his time, and politics in the age of revolutions. Students explore his comparative approach to world languages and literatures, his changing aesthetic positions during his lifetime, and his literary explorations of gender and love. The seminar interprets Goethe in the context of his time and also examines his dominant and debated position in the German cultural tradition. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: Two GERM 300-level courses Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 463 - Contemporary Jewish German Literature </P><P>What does it mean to write in German as a Jew today? A diverse group of contemporary German-language authors position themselves as Jewish writers engaged in probing the complex constellations of identity and intergenerational trauma and memory after the Shoah. Much of their work is centered on the Jewish experience in German and Austrian cultures, yet always in a web of relations to other places, their contexts, and languages - for example, Israel and the US, France and Algeria, Russia and Poland. Seismic shifts in national borders and transnational mobility, including German unification in 1990, the immigration of many Jews from the former Soviet Union to Germany and more recent demographic influences of migration of the 21st century, are further reshaping the topographies of intersectional identities and society that these writers explore. Students examine the relationships of generational position, gender, and literary voice; the interfaces of personal stories, historical knowledge, and contemporary local contexts; the politics and collective understandings of the memory of the Shoah; and the roles of literary representations in shaping that memory as time passes and personal memory disappears. Readings include fiction, essays, interviews, songs, and articles by Wolf Biermann, Ruth Beckermann, Maxim Biller, Irene Dische, Olga Grjasnowa, Lena Gorelik, Barbara Honigmann, Wladimir Kaminer, Ruth Kliiger, Katja Petrowskaja, Doron Rabinovici, Robert Schindel and others.  </P><P>May be taught in English translation or in German, depending on the semester and student interests and background. When the course is taught in English, students counting it for German major or minor requirements must also register for the additional (.25 credit) FLAC section (GERM 463X) and do readings and written work in German; students registered for the course as JWST may also join the FLAC course, with instructor permission. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: JWST 463  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 467 - Body Cinema &amp; Cinematic Bodies </P><P>Presents a history of German and German-speaking film with special focus on the depiction of the human body. Drawn from nearly a century (1929 – 2019) of cinematic history, course materials include silent films from the Weimar Republic, post-war Austrian filmic activism, East and West German cinemas, and contemporary Berlin School and transnational European Cinema. Assembling a number of filmmakers with an emphasis on German/European traditions, the course revisits the filmic canon and introduces filmmakers from outside film studies' canonical scope. Established auteurs such as Werner Herzog or VALIE EXPORT are juxtaposed and paired with lesser-known artists such as Heiner Carow or Mara Mattuschka, as well as newcomers such as Jan Soldat or Pia Hellenthal, to convey the diversity within film's and filmmakers' exploration of the human body. As the thematic vector brings together auteurs of entirely different traditions, it also draws attention to filmic genres often neglected by academics, such as anime, music videos, pornography or short films. &quot;Kinokörper&quot; or &quot;cinematic bodies&quot;, become significant by means of their actions, they take shape in the disciplining of their representation, and fulfill different functions for the genres they traverse. The unsettling effect cinematic bodies have on filmic genre distinctions – such as those between fiction and report, pornography and its documentation, scripted narrative and spontaneous improvisation – are of particular interest. The seminar is conducted in German. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 467L - Required Film Screening </P><P>Required corequisite to GERM 467. </P><P>Credits: 0 Corequisite: GERM 467 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 477 - Literature at the Turn of the Century </P><P>At the dawn of the 20th-century, central Europeans lived, debated, and created amidst great doubts that their world had any future. At the heart of a conflicted and paradoxical modernity arose a keen sense of the unreality and futility of human affairs. Yet modernity's seemingly unresolvable challenges—including questions about the political arrangements of diverse and multilingual societies, the constitution of the human psyche, the chances of human survival on the eve of World War I, as well as class, inter-ethnic and gender relations—spawned a furor of pioneering responses in the urban centers of Germanophone Europe. Exploring the resources of this rich period (1890-1924), this course investigates the cultural, literary, philosophical, artistic, and musical activity abounding in Vienna, Prague, and other sites of central European modernity. Readings include works by Zweig, Roth, Hofmannsthal, Schnitzler, Freud, Musil, Kraus, V. </P><P>Canetti, and Kafka. Focus on reading and writing about central Europe will be supplemented by visual works of art, architecture and cinema relevant to the period. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: Two GERM 300-level courses Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 479 - 20th-Century Literature </P><P>Examines the literature and cultures of German-speaking Europe in the 20th century.

As theater continues to thrive as a unique aesthetic and social institution of German-speaking Europe, students conduct a performance-oriented study of theater as a medium of cultural and transcultural communication. Canonical playwrights to be studied may include Lessing, Schiller, Goethe, Kleist, Büchner, Nestroy, Ibsen, Brecht, Soyfer, Peter Weiss, or Heiner Müller. Contemporary playwrights may include Sibylle Berg, Nurkan Erpulat, Elfriede Jelinek, Dea Loher, Falk Richter, Yael Ronen or Roland Schimmelpfennig. Investigating the genres of the bürgerliches Trauerspiel, the Volksstück, epic theater, postdrama, and postmigratory theater, students also undertake experiments in drama pedagogy. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: GERM 485L Prerequisites: Two GERM 300-level courses Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 485L - Required Film Screening </P><P>Required corequisite to GERM 485. </P><P>Credits: 0.00 Corequisite: GERM 485 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>GERM 486 - What is German World Literature? </P><P>What is German World Literature? This question highlights the relationship between the idea of a national or a single linguistic literary tradition and a broader concept of literature that crosses linguistic, cultural, or national boundaries. This seminar focuses on theories of &quot;world literature/s&quot; and on primary literary texts written in German as examples of works that circulate through and reflect multiple cultural and linguistic contexts. How are the Grimm fairy tales mediated by Disney? What do we understand by the term &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;? Why did Goethe emulate the Persian poet Hafis? Do Senoçak's readers in America contribute to a new idea of German and German-Turkish literature? Topics include the roles of translation, migration, economic and media globalization, nationalisms, and contemporary and historical transnational identities in shaping world literature written originally in German.

This course explores the formation of the Atlantic communities as the result of interactions between European, African, and Native American peoples as well as the circulation of diseases, natural products, labor systems, imperial designs, economic policies, and frontier zones in the Atlantic world. Many of the consequences of this process of interaction were unintended. Students explore the configuration of European, African, and Native American societies before contact and the configuration of new communities in the New World; the slave trade and the establishment of the plantation complex from Brazil to South Carolina; the spread of Christianity in the New World; the development of scientific practices in the service of imperial and national states; the establishment of labor systems; and the different strategies of accommodation, resistance, and rebellion of the different actors trying to find/protect their place in the Atlantic world. This course intends to provide a regional framework for the study of colonial societies in the western hemisphere as well as for the study of emerging empires and states in Europe.

Focusing on the 16th through the early 20th centuries, students trace how global empires facilitated environmental changes and exchanges, as well as the spread of diseases across distant sites. Students study the shifting understanding of disease and health, as well as health disparities between enslaved and colonized populations and colonizers. These disparities had far-reaching geopolitical, economic, and social ramifications, including major influences on ideas of race and human difference. Students gain an understanding of how practices of medicine and public health developed in imperial contexts as contested techniques of governance.

Nonetheless, this is a relatively recent idea. This course takes this idea as its starting point, and in doing so explores oceans and coastal areas as more than simply spaces, but as complex historical entities. Marine environmental history will provide the main framework for the course, although maritime history and oceanic studies concepts--such as Atlantic and Pacific Worlds--will also feature prominently. The course gives particular attention to the period of increasing globalization and drastically intensifying human exploitation of the oceans since roughly the fifteenth century. It also, however, considers pre-modern, pre-industrial relations between humans, oceans, and marine environments, suggesting their mutual influences long before the period usually associated with major human effects on the environment.

The examination is centered on the 1860s to the present, the period in which the demarcation and policing of national borders came to define what it meant to be a &quot;modern&quot; nation state. Just as students consider the rise and solidification of efforts to police borders, they also consider the entangled lives and relationships that were built across and in the space between borders. As students consider the United States' history as both a nation of immigrants and a gatekeeping nation, the categories of race, gender, sexuality, and class is at the center of the interrogation.

These relationships can be intimate and mundane (mowing a lawn, eating an avocado) or much grander in scale (testing nuclear weapons, creating a national park); they are also connected to global processes of colonialism and industrial development. Focusing on the modern period, students investigate how a wide range of people around the globe-from indigenous peoples to plantation workers to suburban families-have used, transformed, and made sense of their environments over time. This history is also considered for its relevance to contemporary environmental politics and activism.

This act of savagery earned the crusade fame in Christian Europe and infamy in the Islamic world, prompting a crusade movement in the West and a military reaction in the East. The forces stirred up by these events also led Western Europe toward the conquest of Spain, Eastern Europe, Greece, and eventually the Americas and beyond. In this course, students study the causes, progress, and results of the Crusades themselves, as well as the new colonial societies that developed in their wake. Students focus on the transformation of four cultures: western Christendom, Judaism, Byzantium, and Islam.

France experienced a range of different governments, from absolute monarchy, to the Reign of Terror, to the Napoleonic Empire, a progression that was accompanied by an expansion of the existing war (from 1792 on) into a massive European-wide war. There were serious claims for citizenship and equality from working class men, from women of all classes, and from enslaved and free people of color in France's colonial empire; there were disturbing acts of violence committed by crowds as well as by the government itself. Designed to introduce students to the major events and personalities and the political evolution of the state during this time, as well as to discuss some of the important historiographical arguments.

A second-rate power in Europe, his kingdom had been torn apart by dynastic struggles and civil war. By 1714, when the last of the Stuart monarchs died, everything had changed. England was now part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which included Scotland and Wales, and whose king also ruled over the neighboring island of Ireland. The medieval feudal kingship had been replaced by a well-established parliamentary monarchy, with many stops along the way. Britain was now a world power, at the center of a far-flung empire, and competing with France for dominance in Europe and beyond. This course will explore precisely how these monumental changes came about, taking a close look at British history over the long 16th and 17th centuries from a number of different perspectives: political, religious, social, cultural, commercial, and intellectual.

How does American history look different when we reverse this perspective and put the continent's original people at the center of the story? What has been the experience of America's Indigenous people, both before and after European contact? And why is this history essential for understanding the world we live in today? With these questions in mind, students will examine the history of indigenous peoples in what is now the United States from 1492 to the present day. Particular focus will be placed on Native Americans' history of adaptation and resilience in the face of European and American colonialism.

Russia's modern wars have been particularly (although certainly not uniquely) traumatic, with profound impacts on government and citizens alike. The course examines the ways in which the events leading up to war, wartime conditions, and eyewitness accounts were recorded and internalized by citizens and managed by an autocratic state to create collective historical understandings of events. By analyzing the changing ways in which social hierarchy, gender and exclusivity have been structured during and in the aftermath of war, the course offers an important guide to understanding the emergence of ethno-nationalism in one of the world's largest and longest lasting multi-ethnic Empires.

Far from being an apolitical exercise or a straightforward empirical investigation, history is contested and sometimes hijacked by individuals and groups who seek to use it to advance their interests and promote their agendas. History is not only subject to intense and divisive public debates, it frequently appears at the center of both latent and active inter-group conflicts. Through close readings of key texts and hands-on engagement with contemporary case studies, students are provided an overview of the politics of history. The scope is global, and the methodological approach is multi-disciplinary, spanning such fields as history, political science, public and international affairs, memory studies, museum studies, and peace and conflict studies.

Readings and discussions range from 16th-century Turkish coffeehouses to 21st-century Starbucks, and from the prohibition by King James I of tobacco to contemporary debates on second-hand smoke. Other historical topics include the discovery and diffusion of coffee and tobacco; the establishment and spread of coffeehouses; early prohibitions on tobacco use; the connections between colonialism and consumer goods; and the medical, economic, and political debates surrounding these products in the 20th century.

Students examine the social, political, and economic life of the Ottoman state from its beginnings among nomadic tribesmen to the fall of the &quot;Grand Turk&quot; in World War I. Issues addressed include the organization of structures of control over such a large and heterogeneous population and the maintenance of a relatively high level of integration in society over time. The factors that led to the disintegration of this empire, including nationalism and colonialism, are also examined.

Although the independence struggle and Anglo-Irish relations in general feature prominently, the course goes beyond the &quot;national question&quot; to examine such issues as the growth of Irish culture, images of Irishness at home and abroad, developments in social and economic history, and the complex roots of the conflict in Northern Ireland.

The course focuses on the fabled &quot;Silk Road,&quot; overlapping of overland trade routes through Central Asia that connected China and Japan with western Europe. The impact of the Silk Road was as often regional and local as it was intercontinental; most travelers did not cover the whole route but remained in areas that were indigenous to them. The course examines a number of very broad themes, such as the interaction of nomadic and sedentary peoples, the spread of religions, cultural confrontation, and syncretism. The course is a challenging one for both instructor and students in that it covers an enormous geographic, cultural, and chronological span.

First, students look at the internal organization of armies, their place in domestic politics and society, and their role in foreign relations. Second, they examine the impact of war on religion, economics, politics, and the arts. Third, because of its importance, violence was tightly linked to religion, literature, and popular theater. Finally, students consider the various ways that these traditions attempted to prevent, control, and manipulate violence through examining political philosophy, law codes, and social mores.

Students also look at the different political, economic, and cultural trajectories that these nation states, particularly India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, have taken since independence. With the aim of developing a historical perspective to the complex and often paradoxical social, religious, and political identities that the region of South Asia exhibits today, students are introduced to a diverse set of primary sources ranging from Mughal court chronicles, European travel accounts and autobiographies to public speeches and official correspondences. Although this course complements the survey of the ancient and medieval history of South Asia taught in HIST 268, no prior background in South Asian history is required.

Why did men continue to fight amid horror and misery? And how did total war rend the fabric of society, politics, and everyday life? To answer these and other questions, this course examines the First World War from a variety of perspectives. Attention will be paid to its origins and outbreak, its conduct by generals and common soldiers, its effect on women and workers, and its wide ranging consequences, both on individuals and empires. The course concludes with a discussion of how the First World War has shaped the world in which we live today.

During the early modern period (15th to 18th centuries), violence and robbery at sea became very intense, giving rise to famous figures. In the second half of the 17th century, pirates established a permanent presence in the Caribbean Sea, and their activities in the area are associated with the first Golden Age of Piracy. A second Golden Age dates from 1713 (Treaty of Utrecht) to the 1730s. The British Navy led an intense campaign against piracy in the 18th century and eventually removed pirates from the Caribbean Sea. Students explore the role pirates played in the development of Atlantic empires, colonial American societies, the transatlantic slave trade, and the Atlantic commercial system from the 16th to the 18th centuries, as well as international legal issues and gender issues.

The long New Deal refers to the period of United States history from the election of President Roosevelt in 1932 to the election of President Eisenhower in 1952. Across this time period, the people of the United States lived through the crises of economic catastrophe, global war, reconversion from total war, and the Cold War's beginning. American society then, as now, was divided and stratified along fractures of race, class, gender, sexuality, physical ability, geographic location, and political ideology. The American people did not experience or respond to the crises and transformations of this era in a unitary fashion. Nor did they share a single vision of how the United States government should steer the country through this era of uncertainty and into the future. Our course will examine how, across this prolonged period of crisis, different Americans thought up and fought to implement different configurations of the relationship between citizen, state, and society. In our course we will repeatedly return to the possibilities, limits, unexpected consequences, and contradictions of these varied efforts to reshape American society.

What does &quot;indigenous&quot; mean, and how does world history look different when approached from the perspective of indigenous people? How does such an approach change the way we think about our national stories, and why does that matter? With these questions in mind, students explore the history of indigenous peoples from around the world, including communities in the United States, Latin America, Pacific island nations, Canada, and Australia. By examining these diverse people's experiences with outside colonization from the 15th century to the present, students are offered new perspectives on ongoing histories of colonialism, resistance, adaptation, and cultural resilience.

Rather than treating Indigenous peoples as passive players in the political and social struggles of the 16th and 17th centuries, students consider how they actively shaped processes of conquest and colonization.

Borderlands were—and continue to be—perplexing places, where national identities and boundaries often held little sway, and where marginalized peoples sought to forge new paths. A focus on borderlands has the power to change our perspective on the history of North America, and to lend insight into the complex politics that define the border up to the present day, including heated debates over migration and the building of border walls. With this in mind, students examine the history of Indigenous, U.S.-Mexican, U.S-Canadian, and imperial borderlands from the 16th through the 21st centuries, including their political, social, and environmental dimensions.

In the second half, students think about how Kyoto looks from the perspective of global history. Students look at Kyoto's cultural, political, military, economic, and ethnic ties to the world, with particular attention to developments of recent decades. Classroom work is closely tied to specific sites and organizations in Kyoto and environs, including Buddhist monasteries, Shinto shrines, public architecture, civic associations, and museums. To better contextualize Kyoto as a city, students consider it in a comparative light with places like Tokyo, Osaka, Nara, Kobe, Kanazawa, and Kagoshima, which are visited over the course of the semester. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>HIST 365 - Warriors, Emperors and Temples in Japan (AS) </P><P>Examines three very different kinds of Japanese culture and government during the medieval and early modern periods. Study begins with the transforming influences of continental civilization such as Buddhism, Chinese techniques of government, and state building. Students then look at the ways in which these influences were integrated into Japanese society and trace the emergence of the highly refined court culture during the classical Heian period. Next, students explore the erosion of the central government's power and the rise of the first warrior government, the Kamakura military government, and the new ethos of the &quot;way of the warrior.&quot; Finally, students examine the fate of the samurai in an age when the arts of peace and administration were more critical than skill with a sword. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations, Institutions, and Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>HIST 368 - China, the Great Wall, and Beyond (AS) </P><P>Examines key questions in military, cultural, social, and political history in China from 1200 to 1750.

Then, the Chinese efforts to meet the challenges of the new world order first through a Confucian revival and later through embracing Western technology and ideas are examined. Students trace the development of the Chinese Communist party and the KMT, warlordism, China's involvement in World War II, and the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Following the end of European colonial rule in Africa in the 1960s, the United States stepped in to exert its influence. Newly independent African countries were seen as a great opportunity to promote US economic, political and sociocultural agenda particularly during the Cold War. On the other hand, many African immigrants started to permanently settle in the US following the passage of the 1980 Refugee Act consolidating interactions between the US and Africa. Major themes include: African immigrants &amp; Refugees in the US; Cold War; Public Awareness of African Issues in the US; USAID; Disease Control in Africa; US &amp; Apartheid; War on Extremist Groups; Peace Corps and Humanitarian Interventions.

One of the moral justifications for the European conquest of Africa was the ending of slavery and slave trade. While colonialism led to the demise of the trade, slavery itself continued to exist well to the end of the colonial era. Finding it difficult to organize labor, the colonial authorities used forced labor with no or little compensation and, since independence modern forms of slavery are still practiced in many parts of the continent. Major themes include: abolition laws and emancipation in practice; colonial rule and the slow attack on slavery; plantation labor in East Africa; slavery as an international issue; forced labor, contemporary human trafficking and migrations.

But epidemics are not simply random events that shape and constrain individual people, societies, and institutions. Epidemics are the creations of particular and varied contexts, both human and ecological. Students examine some of the conditions of possibility for historical epidemics, emphasizing social and cultural factors, as well as the variable effects epidemic diseases had on people and societies in the past. Students also consider challenges of writing history in a pandemic, the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic might influence how we understand historical epidemics, and the extent to which we can draw parallels between past and present. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>HIST 388 - The American South: From Reconstruction to the Present (US) </P><P>Examines the historical and social changes of the American South from the end of the Civil War throughout the twentieth century. The South, a region left almost destitute following the Civil War, underwent a major transformation which saw enslaved labor replaced with prison labor, industrialization driven by southern progressives who envisioned a &quot;new South&quot; and race relation struggles that would and still do plague the region. Material and visual culture, literature, journalism, music, food, religion, and recreation serve as course materials. Discussions cover a variety of topics including race, class, gender, southern agriculture, Jim Crow, the southern penal system, immigration, the South and the New Deal, southern labor, religion, cultural expressions through jazz, blues, country, and hip-hop, the civil rights movement, Southern conservatism, and voting rights.

The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: RELG 213 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 222 - Comparative Scripture </P><P>Comparative scriptural analysis or what is now called &quot;Scriptural Reasoning.&quot; The focus will be on close readings of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Qur'an with an eye to common themes and differences. Students will engage in a comparison of interpretive traditions in Judaism, Christianity and Islam to see how particular scriptural passages are understood in the religious traditions. The course will also spend time studying the ways in which scriptural reasoning has been used as a form of religious conflict resolution and peace-building in situations of conflict in the UK and Middle East. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: RELG 222 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 226 - Reason, Religion, and God </P><P>Examines the similarities and differences between rational and religious understandings of God. By pursuing close readings of classic texts in the field of philosophy of religion, students considers how both philosophical and religious ideas are often developed together. Students explore various arguments about the rationality of God as responses to wider intellectual, cultural, and historical contexts in which they are made and to the specific shape and needs of a particular religious tradition (e.g., Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism). Students also explore the &quot;rationality&quot; of religious forms such as scripture, symbol, ritual, and prayer. In different semesters, select themes such as revelation, theodicy (the justification of God in the face of human suffering), providence and free will, or the theism/atheism debate are investigated. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: RELG 226 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 242 - Antisemitism, past and present </P><P>Examines the enduring problem of antisemitism in its religious and racial manifestations.

Topics include expulsions and migrations, emancipation and acculturation, anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, modern Jewish nationalism movements such as Zionism, the establishment of the State of Israel, and the expansion of American Jewish communities and the reassertion of Jewish life in Europe in the aftermath of the Holocaust. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: HIST 275  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 283 - Introduction to Judaism </P><P>Judaism is a dynamic religious tradition that has developed many forms during a more than 3000-year history that has spanned nearly the entire globe. Students in this course consider how Jewish communities from the biblical period to the present day have shaped their practices and beliefs within their own specific historical circumstances. Students read primary sources such as the Bible, the Talmud, the Zohar, midrashim, prayers, response literature, and philosophical and theological discussions. In an effort to understand the ways in which Jews have lived their lives religiously, students explore how Jewish self-identity, textual traditions, and religious practices combine to define &quot;Judaism.&quot; </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: RELG 283 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 308 - End of the World: Apocalyptic Thought and Movements in Historical Perspective </P><P>Investigates the origin and evolution of apocalyptic literature and movements from antiquity to the present, beginning with the Second Temple and early Christian periods.

Why do apocalyptic movements forecast the inevitability of such life-threatening catastrophes as national or global revolution and warfare, plagues, ecological catastrophes, or profound existential threats from bioengineering or artificial intelligence menaces gone awry? Particular attention is focused on the sociohistorical factors that fuel and heighten apocalyptic fervor within discrete historical periods, inclusive of contemporary post-apocalyptic reconstructions of new world orders that inspire allegiance, hope, and notions of paradisal tranquility. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: RELG 308 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>JWST 329 - The Politics of Nationalism and Memory in Eastern Europe (Extended Study) </P><P>How is history used to advance state-building and nation-building projects?

A diverse group of contemporary German-language authors position themselves as Jewish writers engaged in probing the complex constellations of identity and intergenerational trauma and memory after the Shoah. Much of their work is centered on the Jewish experience in German and Austrian cultures, yet always in a web of relations to other places, their contexts, and languages - for example, Israel and the US, France and Algeria, Russia and Poland. Seismic shifts in national borders and transnational mobility, including German unification in 1990, the immigration of many Jews from the former Soviet Union to Germany and more recent demographic influences of migration of the 21st century, are further reshaping the topographies of intersectional identities and society that these writers explore. Students examine the relationships of generational position, gender, and literary voice; the interfaces of personal stories, historical knowledge, and contemporary local contexts; the politics and collective understandings of the memory of the Shoah; and the roles of literary representations in shaping that memory as time passes and personal memory disappears. Readings include fiction, essays, interviews, songs, and articles by Wolf Biermann, Ruth Beckermann, Maxim Biller, Irene Dische, Olga Grjasnowa, Lena Gorelik, Barbara Honigmann, Wladimir Kaminer, Ruth Kliiger, Katja Petrowskaja, Doron Rabinovici, Robert Schindel and others.  </P><P>May be taught in English translation or in German, depending on the semester and student interests and background.

Particular emphases may vary, but topics typically explore LGBTQ communities and families, cultures, and subcultures; histories, institutions, and literatures; and/or economic and political lives. Selected topics serve to expose complex cultural forces that continue to shape sexuality and regulate its various expressions. The course promotes the examination of new theories and methodologies in relation to established disciplines as it underscores the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields of scholarship. By examining sexualities, students gain an understanding of and respect for other differences in human lives such as age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>LGBT 227 - Machismo &amp; the Latin Lover </P><P>Interrogates the intersection of sexuality and gender in Latin American and Iberian literature and film.

Lastly, students examine how the figure of the Latin Lover has been appropriated and critiqued by writers and directors in non-Hispanic contexts. These are analyzed together with critical works on masculinity, gender theory, and cultural studies. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>LGBT 241 - Queering Education </P><P>LGBTQ youth have traditionally been marginalized in schools. K-12 education offers few curricular and institutional spaces where queer identities are affirmed and queer voices are heard. From sex education to the prom, most schools and educators operate under the ahistorical guise of heteronormativity--a term used to describe ideologies and practices that organize and privilege opposite-sex gender relations and normative gender and sexual identities. Using critical lenses developed by queer and feminist theorists and critical pedagogues, this course seeks both to explore how heteronormativity operates in a variety of educational spaces and how students and educators are confronting these processes by using schools as sites of resistance. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: EDUC 241 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: ALST 242 or EDUC 101 or LGBT 220 or LGBT 227 or LGBT 242 or RELG 253 or SOCI 220 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>LGBT 242 - Religions of Resistance: Gender, Sexuality and Performance in the Caribbean </P><P>Studies African-derived religions and practices in the Caribbean, particularly the ways in which they constitute anticolonial and decolonial perspectives and practices. By exploring texts drawn from cultural studies, religious studies, literature, theatre and anthropology, students will develop an analytical framework through which to examine concepts such as syncretism and hybridity, ritual and bodily performance, and the construction of gender and sexuality. Key concerns in this course are the empowerment of women and people of diverse gender and sexual identities in religious contexts, black identity in the Caribbean and beyond, and the creation of new spaces for marginalized voices to be heard. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ALST 242 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>LGBT 303 - Queer Identities and Global Discourses </P><P>Queer identities are -- and have long been -- enmeshed within large-scale circuits of exchange engendered by the movement of people, ideologies, markets, and capital. This course considers transnational conceptualizations and circulations associated with gender or sexual nonconformity. In doing so, it emphasizes ways of interrogating queer citizenship that purposefully attend to dynamics exemplifying complex interactions on global and local scales. Rather than assuming a particular narrative, the course examines the way by which queer identities are variously constructed and contested. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>LGBT 310 - Imagining Queer Caribbean Futures </P><P>Students will study LGBTQ-themed graphic novels, speculative fiction, and films from across the Caribbean and its US diasporic communities that draw on Afrofuturism as well as African-derived and indigenous traditions and visual cultures to imagine alternative pasts, decolonized futures, and solutions to environmental problems. Legacies of colonial violence, destructive weather events, and damaging policies have made it difficult to imagine a way forward, especially for those with non-hegemonic racial, gender, and sexual identities. Studied alongside political, sociological, and historical works, textual and performative artistic productions will be employed as contestatory discourses that center those who are most marginalized and imagine creative responses to the economic, environmental, and social issues the region and its diasporas face. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>LGBT 340 - Rural Sexualities and Genders </P><P>Global LGBTQ politics and historiography have produced a dominant narrative that celebrates urban centers and Western metropolises as the spaces in which queer life and communities thrive. However, non-normative sexualities and expressions of gender have long been cultivated in rural spaces. This course draws on theoretical, literary and cinematic works that engage with the challenges and complexities of being queer in rural spaces, particularly when compounded by poverty, racism, the degradation of the environment, and exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, this course explores the potential of rural LGBTQ communities to offer new models and definitions of queerness that are anti-consumerist, anti-urban, decolonial and sustainable. Students are prompted to understand gender and sexual diversity as intimately tied to issues such as environmental justice, biodiversity, and indigeneity through examples taken from around the world and in upstate New York. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>LGBT 350 - Sexuality, Gender, and the Law </P><P>The course examines the effects of the U.S. legal system on the lives of the LGBTQ communities; the influence of religion, science, and culture on the laws affecting LGBTQ individuals; and the processes by which LGBTQ citizens may advance their legal rights. Constitutional theories such as equal protection, privacy, due process, liberty interests, and states' rights are applied to issues such as consensual sodomy, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ parenting, employment rights, military policy, and freedoms of public school students. The power of the U.S. Supreme Court to shape laws concerning LGBTQ issues not only for the present society but for future generations is also examined. Cases studied are supplemented with secondary works. These works include writings by traditional legal scholars as well as works by feminists, race-based scholars, and queer theorists to create a fuller perspective. Through this exploration into the legal reality of a marginalized group, students see how the U.S. legal system continues to evolve in its struggle to provide equality for all of its citizens. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>LGBT 355 - Partners and Crime: Queer Outlaws in Literature and Film </P><P>An intersection of sexuality and legality in literature and film. Beginning with topics of LGBTQ activism, homosociality and homonormativity, students will analyze how certain bodies and sexualities come to be on the right or wrong side of the law and how these sexual norms are quite literally policed. Focus will shift to literary writings and films from artists whose queer protagonists choose not to seek acceptance but rather to move outside of the law. Through bank robbery, border crossing, terrorism and homicide, these figures threaten not only the sexual order but also structures of class, race, and national security. Students will inquire into the true nature of these crimes, and determine how their crimes are sexualized and their sexualities criminalized. These will be analyzed together with critical works on queer and dissident genders and sexualities. The course may vary between semesters to focus on different regions or periods. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>LGBT 360 - Special Topics in LGBTQ Studies </P><P>A theme-based seminar taught by different members of the LGBTQ Studies Program and the content of the course will vary depending on the instructor.

What stays the same and what changes? What is the fate of Marxist-inspired Jews in Palestine and in Soviet Russia? What happened, and what did they think as it happened? The course starts in the 1880s and ends in 1953 (the end of World War II, the formation of the State of Israel, the death of Stalin). The group we are studying is both a historical community, with roots going back 3,000 years, and a community of practice. </P><P>Credits: 1 Crosslisted: JWST 250  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities </P><P>CORE C144 - Time </P><P>What is time? The question has been asked by philosophers, theologians, scientists, as well as many other serious thinkers over the centuries. Nevertheless, human beings are still far from deciphering the enigmatic qualities of time today. Students spend a semester together tackling the profound question of time from diverse angles and through diverse means. Students engage in the conversations between scientists and religious thinkers; take a moment to meditate; look at how temporality in other cultures reflects and shapes alternative relationships between man and nature; watch and discuss films; also indulge in dance and music; explore how time is connected to our body, to social structures, and to power; also make the effort to capture, reconstruct and present time through art works...... This intellectual / experiential / artistic journey through &quot;time&quot; is intended to serve as a mirror that reflects on ourselves — our body and mind, our history, our society, and ultimately, who we are. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities </P><P>CORE C165/165C - China </P><P>China has the distinction of being one of the world's oldest continuous cultures, with 5,000 years of rich, complex history.

India as it is known today, with its population of more than a billion, is a recent creation, a product of the partition of the South Asian colonies of the British Raj (Empire). How has such a diverse region come together, and been held together, as one nation? How have its conflicts and contradictions—of class, caste, ethnicity, language, religion and politics— been managed by its rulers and politicians? How have these conflicts and contradictions been captured in novels and on film? The course goal is to subject the &quot;Idea of India&quot; to a detailed investigation, beginning in the present, and working through a process of excavation, discovery, and critique. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE C175/175C - Wilderness </P><P>A multidisciplinary engagement with the idea of wilderness and the lived experience of the people and communities that have been shaped and reshaped by the local, regional, and global forces involved in the conservation and preservation movements in the US and internationally. Students explore the lives of the, often, land-based or agrarian local peoples who, in the service of environmental protection, are excluded from places and social and economic activities that are tied to their identities and livelihoods. Reading and research topics include historical and contemporary case studies such as national parks, national forests, national monuments, wildlife refuges, and ocean preserves and the forces that have formed these places and changed the communities of practice that have access. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities </P><P>CORE C180/180C - Francophone &amp; Creole Identities </P><P>Martinique, a 400 square-mile island, is an official part of France today despite being 4200 miles away from mainland France. French is the official language but most Martinicans freely express themselves in Creole. The majority of Martinicans will declare that they are, first and foremost, citizens of the French Republic, but will also readily admit that they are Martinican by culture. What is striking about Martinique is the dizzying array of cultural signifiers that seem to coexist in a veritable braided community, in which it can be genuinely difficult to tell where one cultural identity strand ends and another begins. Martinique is thus a fabulous lens through which this process of negotiating and renegotiating of cultures, languages, and identities can be viewed, and can be considered a precursor to modern-day globalization. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE C184/184C - The Danube </P><P>The Danube is Europe's second largest river: from its beginnings in the German Black Forest to the Romanian and Ukrainian shores where it meets the Black Sea, the Danube flows through and/or borders ten countries, while its watershed covers four more. The river serves as a unifying artery of economic, cultural, and international exchanges in the diverse region of central and southeastern Europe. The course structures its multidisciplinary inquiry around the river to examine the region's long-standing history as a neglected, maligned, and contested multilingual, multicultural, and multinational space. Culturally mapping the region by focusing on the river's peoples, their intertwined histories, and their cultural imaginaries, the course traces the turbulent history of the region from antiquity, with an emphasis on the 19th century up to the present, to explore the Danube as a quintessential site of cross-cultural engagement in the New Europe. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: CORE C184L/184CL Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE C184L/184CL - Required Film Screening </P><P>Required corequisite to CORE C184/184C. </P><P>Credits: 0.00 Corequisite: CORE C184/184C Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>CORE C187/187C - Russia at the Crossroads </P><P>Examines Russian society, culture, and identity through eras of Tsarism, revolution, social engineering, war, and societal transformations.

Examining the roots of Russian identity, students consider the images of leaders from Peter the Great to Stalin and Vladimir Putin, as well as the work and legacies of artists, writers, and composers. Another major focus is peoples' everyday lives during political and social upheavals. Students examine what life was like during the Stalinist 1930s, through the traumas of World War II (&quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot;), Perestroika in the 1980s, and the post-Soviet present. Students learn about the dynamic ways that culture, history, politics, and identity intertwine in any society. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE C188/188C - Haudenosaunee </P><P>Examines the archaeology, culture, history, economics, religion, literature, arts, politics, law, and individual lives of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Indians - Colgate's closest Native American neighbors - from the period before European contact to the present day.

This is largely a recent phenomenon brought about unwittingly by the ethnocentric policies imposed throughout the Tibetan Plateau by the modern Chinese state. However, earlier processes were already under way before the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in the 1950s, which made the transition from a constellation of feudal polities to a nation possible. These included a common written language, common subsistence patterns (farming, pastoralism, and trade), Buddhism, participation in common rituals and festivals (especially religious pilgrimage), a certain respect for the authority of the Dalai Lamas, and so on. Students examine these processes as well as the consequences of China's political and economic incorporation of Tibetan areas into its nascent nation-state. Specific topics to be explored include &quot;the Tibet Problem&quot; (i.e. contemporary Sino-Tibetan relations and conflict), the historic colonial and religious ties between China Proper and Tibet, religious life and everyday Tibetans, &quot;nomadism&quot; (or pastoralism), polyandry and women in Tibet, and Tibetans' encounter with modernity and the West. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 111 - Conversations </P><P>Employs a set of five common texts – selected by the faculty teaching the course – to promote wide-ranging conversations, anchored in the past and directed toward the present.

The course title, which is inspired by the Black southern vernacular phrase for the region, marks the course's focus on the particularly diverse mixture of cross-cultural, diasporic traditions, beliefs and practices that define the south, from Virginia to Texas and all points in between. Course materials include readings that chronicle histories of slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarnation and gentrification, personal narratives that provide insights into historical and contemporary political realities and social movement organizing, and music, film, and visual art that lend an affective window into the sensory, spatial, and creative dimensions of the Black south. In addition to considering the profound social fabric of Black southern life and its larger impact on the United States, students also explore how this culture and region present a generative challenge to conventional notions that posit identity and geographical boundaries as clear and distinct categories.  </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: ALST 245  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 146C - Haiti </P><P>Students seek to understand the lived experiences of Haitians in Haiti and other particular geographically distinct regions of the world, with a focus on different enclaves in the Dominican Republic and United States. </P><P>Students critically examine the multiple forms of social life and analyzes the ways in which the Haitian society functions as a unified whole and yet encompasses multiple, sometimes conflicting identities (based, for example, on gender, race, color, status, class, religion, and immigration status).

Focusing on postcolonial Senegal and the diaspora, we will study the lived experiences of and theoretical scholarship on gender, sexual, religious, racial, national, and class categories and identities. The course asks how these are informed by shifting political economic agendas including decolonization, nationalism, and global capitalism. Employing a decolonial perspective, we will pay particular attention to the afterlife of French colonialism, based on the premise that &quot;postcolonial&quot; describes not the end but the shifting nature of European domination. The objectives are to unpack how Senegalese people of various identities are positioned in the world, to understand the constructed nature and fluidity of intersecting identities, and to encounter the ways in which individuals and communities creatively respond to identity-based oppression. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 148C - Black Migrations </P><P>An investigation of the contemporary dispersal of African-descended people throughout the world. While students focus primarily on dispersion to the Americas, some attention is also given to Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Indian Ocean Basin. Recognizing the value of a complex diasporic lens that includes race, gender, sexuality, immigration status, and class, students are introduced to diasporic encounters African descendants have experienced, the formation of transnational social movements, black internationalism, Pan Africanism, post-1965 immigration, and contemporary Black life. To this end, coursework will challenge and expand students' understandings of the diverse and complex history of people of the African Diaspora, what it means to be Black in the 21st Century, and how contemporary Black life is been informed by cultural exchanges in addition to migration, colonialism, slavery, and the quest for political enfranchisement. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 149C - Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic) </P><P>A single island, both divided and unified by distinct languages and colonial legacies, students explore the complex negotiations of race and nation in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. By studying works of literature, film, cultural studies, history, and politics from both sides of the border and its diasporas, students consider how the various articulations of colonial and postcolonial identities by states and different social actors have affected the national and international narratives of what it means to be from Hispaniola. Throughout the course, students ponder how physical and notional borders are employed as both tools of exclusion and sites for cooperation and exchange, while considering the complex processes by which national identities are constructed, disputed, and negated. In particular, students focus on discourses of race, language, gender, class, and migration as key to understanding the complexity of these issues, both on the island and in its diasporas. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 150C - Native Peoples of the Great Plains </P><P>The Native people of the Great Plains are among the most familiar, yet least understood, cultural groups in all of North America. This course seeks to understand Plains Indian people beyond the simplistic renderings of Hollywood films. How have Plains people adapted to their unique environment, and how have their livelihoods changed over time? What historical processes underlay Plains Indian people's relationship to settler society, and how can we understand changes to plains life through lenses like race and gender? And what is happening in Plains Indian communities today? With these questions in mind, this Core Communities and Identities seminar will trace the experiences of Plains Indian people from the colonial era through the present day. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 153C - Appalachia </P><P>A multidisciplinary introduction to the Appalachian region of the United States, with a particular focus on representation, culture, sense of place, the history of the labor movement, and issues of social and environmental justice. Books, articles, movies, songs, and art that engage the reader critically with the history, people, environment, and economy of central Appalachia will serve as the texts for this course. The course seeks to complicate and challenge popular myths and stereotypical renderings of the Appalachian region, which typically portray its people as devastatingly and deservedly impoverished: economically, intellectually, and culturally. Through the works of Appalachian authors, filmmakers, songwriters and musicians, artists, storytellers, and scholars, students develop a deeper understanding of Appalachian identity, an appreciation for the phrase &quot;sense of place,&quot; and a new critical lens through which to view American society and their role within it. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 154C - Indonesia </P><P>As the world's fourth most populous country, modern Indonesia is home to over 260 million religiously and ethnically diverse individuals. Despite its substantial population and rich regional cultures, Indonesia is often overlooked both in American popular discourse and at American universities. This course pushes back against this unfortunate pattern of neglect. Students approach Indonesia as a valuable window into a whole host of global issues including: the legacy of European colonialism, the complexities of nation-building, cultural evolution, religious revivals, literature and the arts, economic development, and climate change. The vibrancy and paradoxes of modern Indonesian lives are highlighted. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 156C - Southern Africa </P><P>Introduces students to the history of the major countries of Southern Africa. The course emphasizes that these countries are connected by patterns of culture, migration and economic exchange, political contingencies and warfare. It ranges from the precolonial period, through the time of the British, Portuguese, Belgian and German Empires, to conflicts in the region during the independence and Cold War eras. It seeks to give a picture of the cultures of these countries, and their political, social and economic conditions, today. There is a particular focus on interactions between nations, and issues of migration and transborder initiatives. South Africa has a central place in the course but attention will particularly be given to Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and the 'Copperbelt' region of northern Zambia and Katanga/Shaba. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 157C - France </P><P>A multidisciplinary survey of the varied communities and identities of France. It focuses on France as a leading member of the European Union, as a former major colonial power, and as a leader in the arts. Using history, films, photography, literature, and journalism, the course will examine France's efforts to come to terms with its colonial past; its self-examination through the &quot;politics of memory&quot;; the different &quot;communities&quot; within France itself--youth, religious groups (e.g., Jewish, Muslim, Catholic), the communities of refugees and immigrants and the divisions within those groups; and its vibrant culture, with a particular focus on French cinema. The course will also examine the current political landscape in France. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 158C - Puerto Rico </P><P>Understand the cultural, political and social complexities of Puerto Rican identity, with particular attention given to the effects of Spanish and U.S. colonialism on gender and race relations in the stateless nation. Students will study how the colonial discourses that shaped the earliest modern Puerto Rican imaginary continues to inform current political discourse. Through the study of a wide-ranging body of Puerto Rican work that includes literature, cinema, history, and politics, students seek answers to how national identity is articulated in a colonial context, how migration to the mainland has altered the cultural landscape and what kinds of collective cultural and political movements have emerged in response to the island's socioeconomic and political problems. Focused on issues of gender and sexuality to understand how these, along with issues of race and class today are linked to the island's colonial legacy, in order to develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships between nation, gender and race on the island and within Puerto Rican communities in the U.S. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 159C - Maya </P><P>The term &quot;Maya&quot; typically conjures images of ancient pyramids and/or ancient civilizations that are now found in ruins. Some forms of popular media, particularly science fiction, even go as far as describing the Maya people as a civilization that mysteriously disappeared sometime around AD. 900. The Maya currently total over 7 million people in what is today Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. Furthermore, the word &quot;Maya&quot; serves as an umbrella term that refers to a number of diverse populations, each with distinct culture, language, and material culture. This course will focus on both the construction of the pan-Maya identity, and the numerous populations included within the concept, such as the Tzel Tal, Tzotzil, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Chantal, and the Lacandon, just to name a few. Each of these groups has distinct histories, which often demonstrated significant clashes with colonial and modem national hegemonies. This course also highlights how tradition, language, and identity are preserved under the forces of colonial and nationalistic domination and will also delve into the subject of changing traditions, as these Maya movements of resistance have integrated social media, rock music, and hip-hop to engage younger generations. Ultimately, the Maya provide a means of deconstructing the concept of identity itself by demonstrating how shared identities are constructed, contested, and negotiated. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 160C - Latin America </P><P>Explores how the idea of &quot;Latin America&quot; came to be and the various political purposes it has served from the colonial encounter to the contemporary moment. This is not a traditional survey course that gives an overview of the regional mosaic we have come to call &quot;Latin America.&quot; Instead, it illuminates how the very notion of Latin America as a discrete world-region has been conjured and politicized at key historical moments, emphasizing the underlying social inclusions, exclusions, and global relations fueling these multiple (re)inventions. In addition to the central themes of race, nature, and anti-imperialism, the crucial role of the United States as an interventionist foreign power also looms large in this story. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 163C - The Caribbean </P><P>The archipelago of islands and mainland nations called the Caribbean constitutes a complex montage of races, ethnic groups, languages, and nations.

This course studies literature, film, and music of the region to trace a socio-cultural history of the Caribbean. What are the continued effects of slavery and imperialism on the Caribbean? How does African-Creole culture in particular respond to these continued effects? How do tourism, advertising, music, and film inform/construct people's relationship to the Caribbean in the global present? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ALST 203  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 164C - Argentina </P><P>From gauchos in the Pampa, to immigrants in Buenos Aires, to oil workers in Patagonia, Argentina offers a fascinating place to examine the creation, transformation and contestation of identities and communities.

Examines such topics as changing 'western' views on the Japanese, diversity in Japanese society, socio-demographic challenges, literature and religion, Japanese political economy and globalization, societal response to natural disasters, and popular culture. Employs a wide range of learning methods, including lecture, class discussion, films, hands-on experiences (e.g., calligraphy), and intensive projects which require students to collect, analyze, and synthesize a wide range of scholarly and non-scholarly sources. Ultimately aims to nurture students' ability to understand and empathize with the logic (and illogic), experiences and emotions of the Japanese people; that is to say, to understand them as you would understand yourselves. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 169C - Rwanda </P><P>A multidisciplinary examination of the ways in which community and identity have been formed, are politicized, and remain relatively static over time. This is not a course about the 1994 genocide, but rather one about how such an event could have happened. This world-defining event is historically situated and culturally contextualized as a way to study Rwanda's past and the questions it raises about its future. The experience of Rwandans and consideration of how they understand themselves are analyzed. Assesses the historical and social implications of being ethnic Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa in Rwanda, whether at particular watershed moments — in for example 1894, 1931, 1959, or 1994 — or during periods of so-called 'normalcy' that the country has enjoyed in the past and is experiencing at the moment. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 170C - Islamic North Africa </P><P>Surveys the varied ethno-national and religious identities and communities of Islamic North Africa, or &quot;the Maghreb&quot;: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and sometimes Libya, Western Sahara, and Mauritania. Students briefly survey pre-modern Maghreb history from the 7th-century advance of Islam to 19th-century French colonialism. Students focus on the modern Maghreb from the colonial 19th century to the global 21st. Pursuing central CI themes, students examine the region from &quot;the natives' point of view,&quot; i.e., from North Africans' perspectives on Islam and politics, European and American imperialism, authoritarianism and democracy, technological media, gender, and class. Central to this discussion are the recent Arab revolutions and their continuing aftermath. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 171C - Mexico </P><P>An interdisciplinary introduction to the history, people, art and cultures of Mexico, a country of diverse ethnic, sexual, gendered, class, and political identities that shares a 2,000-mile border with the United States. How does Mexico's colonial past inform the present? On what terms has a Mexican national identity been defined and who is included or excluded from rights and citizenship? Objectives are to examine Mexico's complex history and social fabric; to study Mexican identities, politics, and cultural expressions with relation to this history; and to gain a general understanding of contemporary Mexico in the context of current events and Mexico's relationship to the United States. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 172C - California </P><P>Examines the fabric of California's syncretic cultures in historical, geographic, sociologic, artistic, racial, literary, political, and economic contexts. The diverse settlement patterns, environmental and economic challenge/opportunity, explosion of art forms, and continuous creation of new communities often foreshadowed trends of the entire nation. Readings explore major themes and issues of California history, while literary and personal narratives provide insight into social and political realities, including the struggles of successive waves of immigrants to interact with the established populations. Artistic and architectural expressions that document cultural phenomena offer tangible examples of the creative forces that shaped Californian intellectual and physical communities. Sociological case studies as well as economic, political, and environmental reporting assist students to understand the challenges, failures, and victories of the composite California culture. Underlying all of this is a continuous study of the variegated geography of California, which has both offered and required substantial human choices. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 173C - Ethiopia </P><P>Surveys the culture, religion, communities, history, and socio-economic developments of Ethiopia from the ancient times to the modern period. Ethiopia is home to over 80 ethnic groups with striking cultures that are distinct from Western traditions. Major themes include peoples and languages; traditional customs and beliefs; Christianity and Islam; marriages; community service organizations; literature, novels; education; ethnic relations; traditional art and music; colonial resistance; sports; socio-economic developments; natural resources usage; Ethiopia and Europe; the Ethiopian revolution; Ethiopian immigrants in the United States; traditional harmful practices; and politics. Emphasis is also given to contemporary issues. Lectures are supplemented by discussions, film presentation, group activity, and coffee ceremony. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 176C - North American Indians </P><P>Provides an overview of North American Indians by drawing on case studies from four groupings: New England tribes; Iroquois; Cheyenne; and Pueblos. These cultures are studied in terms of their historical and political relationship to Anglo-American society and institutions, attending to Native Americans' resistance to attempted conquest by European or American powers, the creation of reservation systems, and the use of institutions (e.g., the Bureau of Indian Affairs, schools, missions) to change Native American cultures. Students also examine the response of Native Americans to outside pressures. Students explore other issues, such as sovereignty, identity, gambling, repatriation, land claims, and education, and their impact on North American Indians. Videotapes and Native American artifacts are studied throughout the semester. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 177C - Peru </P><P>The Latin American country Peru evokes dramatic and conflicting images of spectacular natural settings, ancient ruins, cosmopolitan cities, shantytowns, street children, poverty and more. It is a country of extremes. This course offers an interdisciplinary inquiry into this ecologically and culturally diverse land. The course begins by exploring the distinct geography and ecology of the central Andean region (rainforest, mountains, desert, and ocean) in order to understand how these features have shaped the societies that inhabit the region of present-day Peru. This involves analyzing the evolution and organization of Pre-Columbian societies, paying special attention to the Inca civilization. It also examines the ideologies, institutions and practices introduced with the Spanish conquest and era of colonialism in order to understand their impact on indigenous society and their relevance to the state of underdevelopment that characterizes contemporary Peru. Study of present-day Peru juxtaposes rural and urban life, the ties between the two spheres, and the crisis conditions that enveloped both ways of life until recently. Specific issues include the internal armed conflict, the coca culture and cocaine economy, shantytowns and land invasions, oil extraction and indigenous resistance, among other compelling issues. Throughout the term, this course emphasizes the many paradoxes of this intriguing land. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 179C - Central Asia </P><P>Central Asia lies at the intersection of East and South Asian, Islamic, and European worlds. Yet Central Asia possesses a unique culture of its own, shared by nomads of the steppes and settled peoples of the oasis cities throughout the region constituted by the modern nation-states of Afghanistan, Kirghizstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan (and, to some extent, Mongolia). This course offers an introduction to this multiethnic, multinational community through the eyes of its participants, from medieval geographers to nomad bards to pan-Turkist revolutionaries and post-Soviet autocrats. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 183C - The Middle East </P><P>A multi-disciplinary introduction both to the region conventionally referred to as the Middle East, and also to the academic discipline of Middle Eastern Studies. In other words, it is a study of the people, religion, history, and culture of the region, and also about the politics of studying that region. One of the presuppositions is that a careful, rigorous, and critical study of cultural studies can help one understand one's own assumptions, presuppositions, etc. Among the topics students examine are the multiple interpretations of religion, including sects within Islam, that exist in the region; a variety of cultural practices and various languages; and the effect of imperialism and colonialism on the area. Readings include what current native commentators are saying on cultural, economic, and social debates. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 189C - Africa </P><P>An introduction to the interdisciplinary study of Africa and to the African Studies major and minor at Colgate. The goal is to introduce students to a major world area with which many, even highly educated, Westerners are unfamiliar. Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as &quot;the Dark Continent&quot; in European discourses of the nineteenth century. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ALST 201   Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 190C - South Africa </P><P>Aims to provide students with an overview of the social, cultural, political, and economic dynamics that have shaped life in South Africa. Students and faculty work together to better understand the way in which the country of South Africa came into being, how that national identity has been a site of struggle and contestation, particularly in the case of the struggle to overcome Apartheid, and how South Africans are working to overcome the legacy of racism and oppression that has marked much of the social and cultural experience of South Africa. In doing so, students investigate the changing dynamics of race, gender, and culture in South Africa, with a particular focus on understanding the ways South Africans are actively reshaping and unsettling existing social identities and distinctions. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 191C - Spain </P><P>Covers diverse aspects of &quot;Spanish&quot; society, history, and culture, past and present. Tracing Spain's cultural self-image and national identities through its encounters with war, fascism, democracy, and societal transformations during our global era, students explore its place in the world, its collective struggles, its encounters and negotiations of diversity, and how these have been understood and contested by &quot;Spaniards&quot; themselves. Drawing on fictional works, art, music, and ethnographic texts, a significant portion of the course examines peoples' everyday lives in contexts of violence, war, and socio-cultural change. In sum, students grapple with an inherent paradox in the study of &quot;Spain&quot;: the failure to create a homogenous national identity and a coherent, commonly shared historical memory. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 192C - Native Americans in the Southwest </P><P>Focusing on the words from people within the Pueblo, Apache, and Dine communities of what is now called the American southwest, students are introduced to Native American intellectual traditions and their longstanding history. Works from poets, storytellers, educators, artists, scientists, tribal council members, elders are the heart of this course in a sustained consideration of interdependence, complementarity, and the vital interconnections across past and present that are held within specific places. Particular attention is given to the importance of the land, to language retention, and to the power of story as an interventionary force in colonialism and neocolonialism. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities and Identities </P><P>CORE 195C - West Africa </P><P>In contrast to Western journalists' focus on Africa's underdevelopment and widespread disease, West Africa stands out as an area of remarkably vibrant culture. West Africa has always been a space of much social interaction between its various peoples, with many shared cultural practices. In this course, students examine how the pre-colonial and colonial histories shaped social identities. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students analyze how people in West Africa express and reinvent their identities through art, music, dance, clothes, and food. The course draws further on film and literature to understand the specific experiences of West African peoples. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 198C - Cuba </P><P>Examines the complex geographic, historic, social, racial, literary, political, and artistic fabric of Cuba.

These themes are complemented by a study of Cuban film, dance, and music as agents of identity formation. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 199C - Bolivia </P><P>A multidisciplinary look at communities and identities in Bolivia, a country in the heart of South America that has captured transnational attention for its Andean panpipe music, its majority indigenous population, and its social movements. The course uses music, dance, film, history, memoir, political documents, policy reports, anthropology, and journalism to grasp different community articulations in Bolivia. Along with historical understandings of Bolivian communities, the course takes a special look at thematic issues that, while locally grounded, have global resonances: indigenous rights, water, resource extraction, neoliberalism, coca and cocaine, and Andean music and dance. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities &amp; Identities </P><P>CORE 151 - Legacies of the Ancient World </P><P>Explores ancient texts that articulate perennial issues: the nature of the human and the divine; virtue and the good life; the true, the just and the beautiful; the difference between subjective opinion and objective knowledge. These texts exemplify basic modes of speech, literary forms, and patterns of thinking that establish the terminology of academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought across many different societies: epic, rhetoric, tragedy, epistemology, science, democracy, rationality, the soul, spirit, law, grace. Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that have been continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. Moreover, the course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with &quot;The West,&quot; emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions, some of which lie beyond the geographical area of &quot;The West.&quot; Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text. Complementary texts or visual materials from the ancient period, in and beyond the Western world, and/or response texts from the medieval or contemporary periods are added in individual sections or groups of sections. Thus, some groups of sections may have particular themes. These themes will be identified at registration every term. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Legacies of Ancient World </P><P>CORE 152 - Challenges of Modernity </P><P>Modernity is a crucial element of the intellectual legacy to which we are heirs. A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Challenges of Modernity </P><P>CORE 400 - Core Distinction Seminar </P><P>The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement major work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their research of creative projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student's departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways: 1) by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project; 2) by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or 3) by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental projects. If selected to enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental honors with the completion of the department honors project, and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>CORE S110/110S - Discovering Biology: Hormones </P><P>Examines some of the major questions that inform human understanding of the living world. Covering longstanding biological questions as well as questions emerging from the latest discoveries, students explore the great diversity of life and how organisms adapt and change. Students use this framework to tackle new and relevant issues arising from our study of biology. The approach is student-active and hands-on; students work together to explore a few of the mysteries of the natural world. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE S138/138S - The Advent of the Atomic Bomb </P><P>Examines the scientific evolution of nuclear weapons and the historical context in which they were developed. World War II made urgent the exploitation of atomic power for military purposes. Topics include the scientific thought that made harnessing nuclear power possible, the political pressure that shaped that process, the ramifications of the bomb for science and politics during and immediately after the war, and the subsequent impact of nuclear bomb use on the population and the environment. Includes consideration of post-WWII developments of nuclear weapons, weapons testing, and nuclear power generation, with an emphasis on their environmental impact. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE S194/194S - Electrons and Our Civilization </P><P>Since the early civilizations, phenomena associated with electric charges in various forms such as the lightning in the sky, static electricity, and northern lights have inspired human minds. However, it was only after the development of the modern scientific methods in the 16th and17th century that the major discoveries related to electric charges and their flow was understood, which eventually led to the discovery of electrons in the 19th century. Those discoveries spurred humanity's quest to control the flow of electric charges for their own good. With electrons, humans created light without fire, were able to send long-distance messages, and developed computing devices. Within a span of about two hundred years after the first modern inventions associated with electrons, human civilization has completely been transformed. Structured around lectures, discussions, demonstrations, readings, and research assignments, students learn about the human endeavor to understand electrons and how that understanding has shaped our civilization. Following the historical timeline of major discoveries associated with electricity &amp; magnetism, students learn about the process of scientific discoveries and the development of electronics through the stories of individuals behind major discoveries in the context of contemporary sociocultural structures. Furthermore, students learn about the ongoing impact of electronics beyond the consumer market and contemplate the future of electronics and hence, the future of human civilization. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Sciences </P><P>CORE S195/195S - Networks: Friends, Terrorists, and Epidemics </P><P>A network, in its most basic form, is a collection of interconnected people or things. A friendship network, for example, is made up of individuals and their interactions. Indeed, networks are all around us, from the human brain to the internet to your circle of friends. All networks have an underlying order and adhere to basic mathematical laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of networks allows us to identify terrorists and halt disease outbreaks before they spread. Students are provided a broad overview of network science-including both the computational techniques as well as their applications and implications in biology, sociology, technology, and other fields. Students build networks in various fields, demonstrating that social networks, the internet, and cells are more alike than they are distinct, revealing crucial new insights into the world around us. Aside from the simple structural properties of real-world networks, topics covered include dynamic network activities, including epidemics, network robustness, and communities in networks. Students discuss the societal effects and implications of network analysis. Students have the opportunity to apply what they've learned about network science to real-world data sets of their choosing. Students are presented with an exciting glimpse of the next century of science in an inherently and increasingly interconnected world. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Sciences </P><P>CORE S196/196S - Environmental Science and Storytelling </P><P>Earth is in the midst of unprecedented climate change driven by human activity colliding with complex environmental feedback. How do we know Earth's climate system and ecosystems are changing, and how will humans be affected? Students examine the science of environmental change through hands-on investigation of global change data from across Earth's land, air, water, and ecological systems, while also exploring how storytelling techniques and narrative analysis explain how we make sense of these changes and communicate them to ourselves and others. In this workshop-model course, students work together to develop scientific analysis and storytelling skills, tackling climate change science, environmental news stories, and personal interactions with the Earth from the global scale to their own home environment. Students investigate the causes of environmental change, the impacts of climate change on natural systems, the impact of climate change on humans, and the roles of interpretation, bias, lived experience, and different values systems on making sense of environmental scientific information. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Sciences </P><P>CORE S197/197S - Ethics, Algorithms, &amp; AI </P><P>Machine-learning algorithms and autonomous systems introduce a wide range of morally significant questions: about rights, fairness, consent, accountability, trust, transparency, exploitation, and sustainability, among others. For example, are there moral costs to the design and training processes of such algorithms? ls it acceptable for an algorithm to classify people differently on the basis of things they have no control over, even if it's very accurate? How do we tell a machine we want its outcomes to be fair? What should we do when there is entrenched disagreement about moral values? More broadly, is it a problem if a machine-learning system develops a standard that is too complex to be recognizable as a human moral concept, or even understood by humans at all? If a machine reaches a certain level of sophistication, can it acquire moral status, e.g. responsibility for its decisions? </P><P>Students consider questions like these systematically and philosophically, with knowledge of the predictive reasoning underlying such systems. Special attention is paid to the difficulty of narrowing the gap between mathematical precision and human intuition. Readings come from a range of fields: computer science, contemporary philosophy, statistics, cognitive science, and law. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Sciences </P><P>CORE 101S - Energy and Sustainability </P><P>Our current use of energy is unsustainable. Fossil fuels, which were deposited on Earth over hundreds of millions of years, will largely be exhausted over the course of just a few hundred years. Global climate change makes our situation even more unsustainable—we need to stop using fossil fuels long before they run out if we want to avoid catastrophic environmental change. This course takes a quantitative approach to learning about our current energy use, so that students can understand how our personal choices and lifestyles affect energy use. Discussion includes how our energy needs are met in the future through renewable resources: what technologies are available now, what are their costs, and how much energy can they provide. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 102S - Molecules, Energy, and Environment </P><P>When reduced to fundamentals, virtually all of our environmental problems deal with chemicals in the wrong place: noxious and reactive gases in our atmosphere, insecticides and toxic metals in our ground and drinking water, and spilled nuclear wastes. Unfortunately, many citizens in our society do not understand the fundamentals of these environmental problems. This course -- designed for students without experience in other university-level science courses -- explores the chemistry behind some of our more pressing environmental dilemmas. Topics include some consequences of fossil fuel combustion (the greenhouse effect, acid rain, urban smog), the ozone hole, nuclear energy/wastes, and groundwater contamination. The emphasis is on the science behind these problems, what we know about how the problems have come about, and what we can do, if anything, to ease the problems. This course is for the student who has not taken college-level chemistry, but is concerned about our threatened environment. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None </P><P>Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 103S - Remote Sensing of the Environment </P><P>Remote sensing is the art and science of obtaining information about a phenomenon through a device that is not in contact with the object. The remote sensing process involves collection and analysis of data about energy, reflected from or emitted by an object. Remote sensing is used to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. After an introduction to the interplay among science, technology, and remote sensing, students examine the development of remote sensing technology. Students focus on the physical principles upon which remote sensing is based, explore the basic tools of photography and photograph interpretation, and consider the principles of acquiring and interpreting data collected by non-photographic sensors. Throughout the semester, students consider how remote sensing has improved our understanding of biophysical processes using a case-study approach to demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings. Finally, consideration is given to the ethical implications of remote sensing. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 105S - The Science and Potential Implications of Nanotechnology </P><P>Imagine repairing your body without surgery and no longer burning fossil fuels.

Such are the hopes, hype, and fears of nanotechnology </P><P>— the study of materials and devices with dimensions on the nanoscale (1 x 10-9m, the realm of assemblies of molecules). This course provides an introduction to the science and potential implications of molecular nanotechnology. Scientific and sensationalist visions of nanotechnology are critically examined through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, and presentations. The course forges an appreciation for the nanoscale, an understanding of the excitement and the challenges, and an awareness of the societal and ethical implications. Through the lens of nanotechnology, students gain insights applicable to the broad landscape of emerging technologies — and encourage curiosity towards the future. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 106S - Saving the Appearances: Galileo, the Church, and the Scientific Endeavor </P><P>Four hundred years ago, Galileo Galilei turned his modest telescope skyward. The universe he discovered was a stark contrast to the universe described by the ancient Greek philosophers whose cosmology had held sway for over a millennium. Some 60 years after the publication of Copernicus' treatise &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres,&quot; Galileo used his newfound insight into the nature of the heavens to support the heliocentric model of the universe. In so doing, Galileo challenged not only the authority of Aristotelian cosmology, but also the religious tradition and interpretation of the scripture by the Holy Fathers of the Catholic Church. This episode in the history of western science and the development of the Church is often cited as one of the original clashes between modern science and religious traditions. The discoveries, writings, and trial of Galileo Galilei will serve as both a focus and backdrop for students to explore the practical development of scientific thought and the near simultaneous invention and re-invention of the Church. In addition to readings, written responses, and classroom discussions, the course requires students to repeat many of the ground-breaking observations Galileo made using a hand-held refracting telescope similar in size and shape to the one he built. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 108S - The Story of Colorants </P><P>Colors are all around and people tend to take them for granted. Throughout history, humans have employed colors in artistic and creative expression, particularly in jewelry, ceramics, textile and metal art and in paintings. Some colorants occur naturally. Other colorants are manufactured, and thus the result of scientific and industrial development. In this course, students explore the history and material science of colorants. The interplay between artistic expression and science/technological discovery is considered with emphasis on the materials used in textile art and in paintings. In the process, students find out how science can be used to authenticate artwork. Is a work of art an original by a &quot;famous artist,&quot; have parts been reworked by someone else, or is it a forgery? In addition to lectures and discussions, students participate in small group hands-on projects. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 109S - In Data We Trust: The Promise and Perils of a Data-Driven Society </P><P>Examines fundamental concepts related to data processing and automated analysis. Students are expected to develop a conceptual understanding of how algorithms for processing and analysis work and apply this understanding in lab-like activities. The latter part of the course examines potential implications for society and contemplates questions relevant to the use of data in everyday life. Representative examples include the following: What are the consequences of massive data collection on privacy and liberty? How does one judge the fairness of a decision made using sophisticated data analytics? If a decision making process is shown to be biased, who is accountable? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 </P><P>Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 111S - The Artful Brain: An Exploration in Neuro-aesthetics </P><P>Consists of an exploration in the aesthetic experience of art as it relates to the sensory and perceptual mechanisms of the brain. Many of the topics discussed are centered on the view that the function of art and the function of the visual brain are one and the same. Students thus consider that the aims of the artist in rendering a particular piece of art essentially constitute an extension of the processes of the visual brain. By taking this point of view (through an introductory understanding of the sensory and perceptual processes of the visual brain) students discuss possible outlines of a theory of aesthetics that is biologically based. Students are required to read chapters from different textbooks devoted to sensory and perceptual processes as they relate to visual art, as well as review articles from professional journals. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 112S - Science of Relationships </P><P>Close relationships are central to our lives; friends, parents, siblings, romantic partners, acquaintances, and coworkers have an enormous influence on one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The purpose of this course is to understand the processes that regulate human relationships using a scientific perspective. It will include an overview of social psychology theories of relationships research and an exploration of the current literature. Students will be exposed to a variety of research methods and will have the opportunity to design their own experiment about relationships. Topics include attraction, intimacy, attachment, friendship, interdependence, communication, dissolution and loss, love, and maintaining relationships. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 113S - How to Build a Baby </P><P>If one were a highly developed, extraterrestrial scientist with advanced technology to engineer organisms from other planets, how would one build a human baby? What kind of brain would one design? What kinds of social, emotional, and cognitive predispositions would be included? What kind of environment would one provide? To answer these questions, one must determine what is innate and what is learned in human development. Although this &quot;nature-nurture" question can be traced back to ancient philosophers (right here on Earth!), modern-day science has made great strides in exploring (and reformulating) this question. In this class, students first explore some pop-culture approaches to this issue. Then, they briefly trace the history of the debate to its foundations in classical and modern philosophy. Finally, students compare these philosophical and pop-culture perspectives to modern-day scientific approaches. This is accomplished through primary and secondary readings, class discussions, and group presentations. In the end, students may discover that the answers to the &quot;nature-nurture&quot; question are not on a planet far, far way - but rather closer to home than they have ever been. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 114S - Ecology, Ethics, and Wilderness </P><P>Explores the ways in which scientific concepts, such as deep geologic time and Earth history, biological evolution and co-evolution, and ecosystem dynamics can inform humans about radical moral stances (e.g., biocentrism, deep ecology).

What goes on in the brains of newborn infants before they discover the meanings of words? What might be the linguistic and social consequence of acquiring an English dialectal accent, distinguishing or not distinguishing between Mary, merry, and marry? Why do some adults succeed in learning a second language, while others do not? Why are some Japanese unable to tell the difference between rice and lice? When a girl has had no contact with a language speaking community, is she able to acquire her first language after puberty? Are bonobo chimpanzees able to learn human language? Students read books and articles that address these issues, watch films and have some direct experience of learning a difficult second language. Physiological, linguistic, psychological, and social factors that determine whether one succeeds or fails to acquire native and foreign languages are discussed. </P></Div><Div><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 120S - Earth Resources </P><P>Management of the Earth's energy, mineral, and water resources is a subject of ongoing controversy and debate. This debate revolves around two related issues: the diminishing supply of some resources and the environmental cost of resource extraction and energy production. This course examines the origin and geologic setting of Earth's resources, and how these factors influence resource exploration, extraction, and use. Environmental and economic aspects of resource extraction are explored. Students examine the public debate about resource management and conservation, as well as the roles of politics and the media in shaping this debate. This course emphasizes student-led discussions of case studies dealing with current resource-related topics. The purpose of this course is to create a framework in which resource issues can be evaluated, integrating the scientific and social issues inherent in resource development. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 122S - Life in the Universe: A Cosmic Perspective </P><P>Examines the historical debate on the concept of whether extraterrestrial life exists.

Also examined are the astronomical, geological, chemical, and biological conditions that were responsible for the origin and evolution of life on Earth, and speculate about the possibility of life on other planets in our solar system or on planets around other stars. How would one detect the presence of life on other planets in the solar system; in the galaxy? The development of intelligent life and the possibility of contact between civilizations are examined. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 123S - Climate Change and Human History </P><P>As the &quot;Global Warming Summit&quot; made clear, anthropogenic activity has the potential to dramatically alter global climate. The increased introduction of greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, and dust through human activities may result in a variety of regional responses, including warming and cooling, changes in precipitation and drought patterns, and rising sea level. Climate change as a force driving human history, however, is not unique to the 20th century. The primary objectives of this course are to present case studies that demonstrate the strong role of climate in driving human evolution, adaptation, and societies; and to assess the relationship between climate forcing and man, with a view toward understanding the potential consequences of modern anthropogenic impacts. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 124S - Cells and Human Development </P><P>The fusion of sperm and egg cells to form a single-celled zygote is the initial step in development in most multi-cellular organisms. In humans, repeated divisions of this single fertilized egg are responsible for the production of more than 70 trillion cells of greater than 200 different types. In this course students examine how a fertilized egg undergoes division, how the stem cells produced by these divisions become &quot;determined&quot; to form cells of particular types, and how these determined cells finally differentiate into the highly specialized cells that make up most tissues and organs. As this process is examined, students also explore the relationship between cells and developmental patterns, and investigate how genetic and environmental factors can influence (and alter) cell fate. Biological, social, and ethical aspects of the human manipulation of development are also considered, including examination of such topics as cloning by nuclear transfer, reproductive technology, fetal surgery, stem cells, and embryonic gene therapy. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 128S - Global Change and You </P><P>Our planet is currently undergoing a level of abiotic and biotic change that is unprecedented in recent history and the scientific consensus is that it is anthropogenic. This course introduces students to the recent data on climate change and inferred causes and consequences of that change. Throughout the course, the way in which humans influence these changes and also the ways in which these changes impact humans are explored. The main focus of the course is the carbon cycle, specifically on human energy consumption, food production, and water use, and how they are linked to biodiversity loss. The many sides of issues (e.g., biofuels) are explored and debated throughout the course. The immediate consequences of global change are demonstrated in a required weekend field trip to the Adirondacks in the third week of the classes to learn about the effects of pollution and climate on our local ecosystems. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 129S - Dangerous Earth: Science of Geologic Disasters </P><P>Geologic disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, serve as dramatic reminders of the power of nature and the catastrophic impact that these disasters have on society. As recent events such as the 2003 tsunami in Sumatra demonstrate, these disasters can exact a terrible cost in both economic terms and loss of life. Society has a clear interest in understanding what causes these disasters and how to reduce their impact on human populations. Geology provides a scientific framework for understanding the potential risks and effects of geologic disasters. This course examines the science behind four disasters that pose major risks to society: floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and meteoric impacts. Students examine significant case studies to understand the types of data collected to study these disasters, ambiguities in the data, and how risk is estimated. Students also examine potential ways to reduce the damage caused by such hazards and the scientific, economic, political, and societal implications of these approaches. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 132S - Mathematical (Counter) Culture </P><P>Students take a close look at mathematics, mathematical communities, and the applications of mathematics throughout history. The origins of mathematical thought, and how its foundations have changed over time, are explored. Along the way, the role of mathematics within the sciences is questioned. For example, in what ways is mathematics similar or dissimilar to other sciences? Unlike many courses focused on the history of math, there is additional emphasis on how mathematics is viewed by and used by society, in both positive and negative ways. Indeed, are shown how, in many cases, the prevailing mathematical culture of the time – explicitly or implicitly – rewarded malicious and, generally, unkind behavior. Questions raised include: how much have these aspects of mathematical culture changed? How have society's attitudes towards mathematics contributed to a problematic culture? How can one use mathematical literacy as a positive force? In this way, students examine how doing mathematics responsibly can be considered a countercultural act. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 134S - The Sixth Extinction </P><P>The fossil record reveals that Earth has experienced five cataclysmic events, or mass extinctions, which in each instance had a profound effect on its history by redirecting the course of evolution. As detectives attempting to solve the world's greatest murder mysteries, students of this course examine when each of these catastrophic events occurred, what caused ecosystems and evolutionary processes to be disrupted, why and where biological diversity was greatly diminished, and who survived to begin the evolutionary repair of life during subsequent recovery and radiation phases. In the final part of the course, students use their knowledge of these past events to hypothesize about and investigate the severity of the Sixth Extinction. The course addresses modern conservation practices and specific actions that hope to enhance the future existence of a biologically diverse planet. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 139S - Election Methods and Voting Technology </P><P>How should we elect our president and other officials?

We develop tools to assess the fairness of our election methods in this country and how they might make policy decisions related to elections. These policies concern the ways of casting our votes (voting technology) and the election methods. One part of the course compares different ways of electing candidates and the mathematical theory behind these methods. The second part of the course considers different ways that votes can be cast. This includes the history of different methods of voting and their vulnerability to fraud. This leads to current debates about voting technology: How effective are different modern systems, such as electronically scanned ballots and direct recording electronic (DRE) voting machines, for accurately and securely recording votes and protecting against voting fraud? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 140S - Language and Cognition </P><P>What is the relationship between language and cognition? To answer this question this course explores the interrelation between verbal expression and such cognitive faculties as bodily experience, imagination, memory, categorization, and abstract thought. The study of language as a cognitive phenomenon is a relatively new discipline. It originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since then, cognitive linguistics has been a rapidly growing field that has both benefited from and contributed to its allied disciplines of cognitive psychology, cognitive anthropology, and cognitive neuroscience. The course begins by examining the advantages and shortcomings of the cognitive perspective on the different levels of language (e.g., sounds, words, sentences, texts, etc.). Students explore the connections of cognitive linguistics with the related fields that are broadly referred to as the &quot;cognitive sciences.&quot; No background in linguistics is required, but interest in linguistics is expected. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 143S - Introduction to Statistics </P><P>Introduces students to statistical thinking by examining data collected to solve real-world problems.

What is the nature of human happiness, joy, and pleasure? How can people most effectively cope with the inevitable difficulties faced in life? Are some people simply born more content than others? How are happiness and life satisfaction affected by health, relationships, material wealth, culture, habits of thought, and spiritual practice? This course focuses on how contemporary psychological research can be used to answer these enduring questions. Students read original research articles on these topics and gain hands-on experience collecting and analyzing data. Throughout the course, students are helped to recognize the strengths and limitations of the scientific method for approaching questions such as these, and students are encouraged to articulate their own emerging views of what constitutes a life worth living. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 147S - Emerging Global Challenges: Science, Technology, and Culture </P><P>In the 21st century, global citizenship will require a comprehensive understanding of key challenges on a planetary scale, including global warming, diminishing energy resources, population pressures (adequate water and food supplies, humane living conditions), urbanization, and the impact of natural disasters. This course will explore the underlying scientific concepts essential to developing a thorough understanding of the phenomenon and developing a healthy skepticism and critical analysis of complex, global-scale processes.

The Adirondack Mountains are particularly sensitive to acid deposition because of their geology and topography. Many different collaborative studies were conducted with geologists, biologists, hydrologists and atmospheric scientists, and their results led legislators to enact the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Twenty five years later, we examine how scientists addressed skeptical concerns about the extent of the acid rain problem, how effective the legislation has been in recovery of lakes, streams and forests as well as efforts to mitigate the effects of acid deposition through lime applications that neutralize acid and restore chemistry to lakes, streams and forests. Students will gain an understanding of linkages between soils, forests, streams and lakes, and we will compare how scientists and legislators addressed the acid rain problem versus our current actions to address climate change. Students compare restoration &quot;success&quot; in the Adirondack Mountains to changes in precipitation chemistry and biota in other parts of the world such as Canada, different European countries, the United Kingdom and Asia. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 156S - Drugs, Brain, and Behavior </P><P>Drugs, used recreationally and medicinally, can have physiological and behavioral consequences that are important to both the individual and society.

In the late 18th and 19th centuries new findings about the Earth's history and fossil record came into conflict with religious and cultural understandings of creation, evolution, and the place of man in the universe. These issues have been debated since Darwin first articulated his theory of evolution by natural selection. More recently, controversy over anthropogenic climate change has provoked similar questions: How long has our present climate lasted, and what has been the scale of climate change in the past? Knowledge of the Earth's vast age has reached past scientific debates and influenced all aspects of life, including religion, poetry, art, and architecture. In this course, students explore the changing cultural and scientific views of the age of the Earth and how these longstanding debates influence how science is seen by non-scientists. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 166S - The Air Up There </P><P>Weather and climate command our attention because they deeply affect life on Earth.

Initially focuses on the body's ability to repair itself. Students examine the nature of stem cells, as well as the limitations and potential for future work with these cells. Students then explore how gene therapy techniques have the potential to repair a wide variety of genetic disorders, but may also bring about the possibility of selective improvement in normally functioning bodies. Finally, students look at how scientists are developing techniques to grow organs in the laboratory to replace damaged or injured organs, and how bionic parts are being investigated increasingly as alternatives to biological replacements. Along the way, students consider the ethical and social concerns that surround each of these approaches, and explore whether current definitions of humanity will apply well to a future where we can increasingly manipulate fundamental aspects of the human body. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 170S - Media Effects </P><P>Uses a social scientific approach to examine the effects that media exposure has on audience members.

Key types of media studied include television, music, video games, and social media. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 172S - The Biology of Women: Sex, Gender, Reproduction, and Disease </P><P>Myths regarding the female body have been circulating for centuries and still influence human behavior throughout the world. Though female and male anatomies differ, the underlying genetic material of each is very similar. This course investigates the historical and environmental construction of gender, the biological aspects of sex, the unique characteristics of female anatomy and reproduction, and the effect of sexually transmitted diseases and cancer on female health. Lectures, discussions, and in-class exercises explore the scientific methods used to acquire our current understanding of hormonal signaling, genetic inheritance, development, microbial pathogenesis, and cell biology that underlie these topics. Social and ethical issues that exist and are raised by the biological differences between males and females are also discussed, including hormonal therapy, in vitro fertilization, prenatal genetic testing, female genital mutilation, and the use of birth control to prevent AIDS transmission.

This course will explore what the science of social psychology tells us about how social inequality shapes the ways we think, live, and die. Because social inequality is about the relative status of people based on their group memberships, we will begin the course by exploring social psychological theories that help explain the centrality of our group memberships to our identity. As we will see, these group memberships can be based on many different aspects of our identity: race, gender, socioeconomic status, among many others. Next, we will explore what experimental data tell us about the sources of, and consequences of, group-based disparities. In particular, we will examine the roles of limited resources, identity, power, morality, and prejudice in perpetuating inequality. Finally, we will discuss the emerging literature on how to coexist more peacefully in an unequal world. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 180S - The Science of Music </P><P>What is music?

Students also explore how these scientific findings can shed light on human behaviors and help us to better understand ourselves. Moreover, students examine the impacts of human-created environmental changes on the behavior, reproduction, and survival of these precious creatures, and how citizen science has helped contribute to numerous bird conservation projects. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 188S - It's a Dog Life </P><P>Dogs are a fascinating study organism. From their very beginnings their evolutionary history contains unpredicted effects across all levels of biological organization. From the social construct of being a wild animal (wolf), to becoming dependent on man (domestication), and colonizing our homes and our beds (inter-species bonding). The history of this single species provides a rich learning opportunity to introductory students. Readings and discussions include a brief introduction and exploration of most branches of biology, in an interdisciplinary manner: evolution, ecology, genetics, physiology, and behavior, with the underlying theme of how dogs are unique to each of those branches in biology. Emphasis is placed on the interaction between wild animals and early humans, and tracks that interaction through time as the domestication of the dog has progressed. Further exploration occurs on physiological aspects of canine biology that are beneficial for humans, for example, cancer research. Students are challenged to formulate questions about science and how science relates to the inter-species relationship we have created with &quot;man's best friend.&quot; </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 189S - Sleep </P><P>Why do we sleep? Why do we dream? Do we really need to get 8 hours of sleep a night to perform our best? How is sleep affected by a person's neighborhood, job, family, or culture? Students will study the theories and empirical research that seek to answer these questions. The course begins examining sleep at multiple levels of analysis, including its biological underpinnings, methods of assessment, and developmental changes, as well as common sleep disorders and connections between sleep and learning, dreaming, and health. The second half of the course will address environmental influences on sleep and explore ways to improve sleep in diverse populations via intervention and policy. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 190S - The Unreliable Internet </P><P>In our hyperconnected world, we expect the Internet, and its abundance of information, entertainment, social networking, e-commerce, and more, to always be accessible. Our expectations are usually satisfied thanks to a complex system of specialized devices and software. However, this infrastructure is susceptible to physical failures, human errors, cyber attacks, and censorship that compromise our ability to access (parts of) the Internet. In this course, students will learn how the Internet works and explore Internet design flaws and operational limitations that have been demonstrated by scientific measurements of Internet infrastructure. Additionally, students will examine a variety of technology-and policy-based solutions for making the Internet more reliable and open. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 192S - The Anthropocene: Earth Systems With and Without Us </P><P>Temperatures are increasing, sea levels are rising, many species are on the move, and some have gone extinct. These changes in Earth's environments profoundly shape our lives, influencing where we live, the food we eat, the work we do, and how we see ourselves and others. Geologists have proposed that we live in a new interval in the history of our planet, the Anthropocene, in which the activities of our species have transformed Earth systems in ways that will leave an indelible signature in the geologic record. How do we know that these environmental changes are underway and that humans are responsible? Students explore the scientific evidence for the Anthropocene, considering how Earth systems operate both with and without us. Students learn about the process of science by critically reading the scientific literature, by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting scientific data, by communicating scientific research to different audiences, and by considering the social context in which science is done. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>CORE 193S - Climate Change in Cultural Context </P><P>Human-induced climate change is a defining issue of our time. That people are dramatically altering the climate is now the consensus in the global scientific community. Potential short- and long-term impacts include biodiversity loss, sea-level rise and coastal flooding, more intense storms, threats to human health, and disruptions of freshwater supplies and food security. But while the global community increasingly understands the basic processes driving climate change, and is starting to appreciate the consequences of a warmer world, the cultures (different societies, scientists, policymakers, to name a few) grappling with the dynamics of global warming are complex and the issue remains controversial and less well addressed, globally, than needed to stem dramatic climate change over the next century. Understanding climate-society relationships requires examining both the climatic effects of human activity as well as the cultural responses to addressing climate throughout history. Students examine climate change in cultural context in order to create engaged global citizens who grapple with the science and scientific uncertainty of climate change alongside the social, political, ethical, and economic matrix of society's responses. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Scientific Perspectives </P><P>LING 200 - Science of Language Acquisition </P><P>Explores scientific questions regarding infants' and adults' acquisition of native and non-native languages. Students read journal articles and book chapters in the interdisciplinary field of linguistics, and engage in collecting and analyzing spoken language data. What goes on in the brains of new-born infants before they discover the meanings of words? Why do some adults succeed in learning a second language, while others do not? What might be the linguistic and social consequences of acquiring an English dialectal accent? Do non-human animals use language? Addressing these questions illuminates physiological, linguistic, psychological, and social factors that determine success or failure of acquiring language. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None Formerly: CORE 115S and CORE 150S </P><P>LING 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>LING 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>LING 491 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>MATH 105 - Introduction to Statistics </P><P>An introduction to the basic concepts of statistics.

What does &quot;indigenous&quot; mean, and how does world history look different when approached from the perspective of indigenous people? How does such an approach change the way we think about our national stories, and why does that matter? With these questions in mind, students explore the history of indigenous peoples from around the world, including communities in the United States, Latin America, Pacific island nations, Canada, and Australia. By examining these diverse people's experiences with outside colonization from the 15th century to the present, students are offered new perspectives on ongoing histories of colonialism, resistance, adaptation, and cultural resilience. </P><P>Credits: 1 Crosslisted: HIST 356  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>NAST 360 - Borderlands of North America </P><P>Instead of looking at history from the vantage of national centers, borderlands history focuses on the complicated places where empires, nations, and Indigenous peoples have collided, converged, and overlapped over time. Borderlands were—and continue to be—perplexing places, where national identities and boundaries often held little sway, and where marginalized peoples sought to forge new paths. A focus on borderlands has the power to change our perspective on the history of North America, and to lend insight into the complex politics that define the border up to the present day, including heated debates over migration and the building of border walls. With this in mind, students examine the history of Indigenous, U.S.-Mexican, U.S-Canadian, and imperial borderlands from the 16th through the 21st centuries, including their political, social, and environmental dimensions.

Despite such a belief, many of our decisions and actions depend on perceptual inferences derived from our internalized representations of external information. Put another way, many of our decisions and subsequent actions are the direct result of our brains making guesses based on fabricated information. The purpose of this course is to explore how perceptual and cognitive processes act to formulate low- and high-level visual representations of the physical world, and how those representations inform (and are informed by) our knowledge of the world. The vast majority of the readings for this course employ behavioral paradigms that target the neurological (functional) underpinnings associated with visual representations and knowledge structures. Therefore, it contains a mix of both behavioral and neurophysiological components (with an emphasis on functional neuroscience). </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PSYC 353 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: (NEUR 170 or PSYC 275) and (NEUR 201 or NEUR 202 or PSYC 200) Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Recommended: PSYC 200 is recommended.

Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PSYC 355 Corequisite: None </P><P>Prerequisites: (NEUR 170 or PSYC 275) and (NEUR 201 or NEUR 202 or PSYC 200) Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>NEUR 374 - Computational Neuroscience </P><P>Computational neuroscience is one of the fastest growing fields in neuroscience.

Focuses on attempts to study and explain the evolution of warfare and the dynamics of peace from the early Modern period to today's most imminent and controversial security issues. Students explore the relationships between global and historical patterns of mass violence, the theoretical paradigms that attempt to account for these patterns, and the various disciplinary and methodological approaches used to explore war and peace at all levels of analysis. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 191 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations, Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 218 - Practices of Peace and Conflict: War in Lived Experience </P><P>Introduces students to a range of approaches and problems in the descriptive analysis of peace and conflict. Students juxtapose core theoretical texts on war and violence from the social and human sciences with detailed ethnographic case studies. Practices of contemporary conflict are paired with the interpretive paradigms whose aim is to understand and resolve them. For example, case studies in terror are paired with the field of trauma studies; specific regional conflicts with theories of global networks; and contemporary mass violence with analysis of genocide perpetration. In the process, introduces students to important methodological paradigms from the social sciences, chiefly from anthropology, sociology, and geography, as well as humanities-based approaches from comparative religion, literature, and language studies. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PCON 225 - Theories of Peace and Conflict: War, State, and Society </P><P>Examines problems of institutional systems and the articulation of power. Students are introduced to critical evaluation of the major theoretical approaches to the study of power and politics. Students consider rationalist, functionalist, and interpretive approaches in the social sciences, as they relate to questions of peace and conflict. Students examine the specific operative theories that have emerged out of these intellectual traditions - theories of state formation, security, international norms, and transnational networks - as they have been incorporated into and further developed in the study of peace and conflict. Students test major theories on case studies linked to major world events. For example, deterrence theory is examined in light of the end of the Cold War. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 245 - Organizing War: Military Organization, Culture, and Thought Since the Beginning of the Modern Age </P><P>How are modern militaries built and how does it impact their world – and ours? Students discuss major themes from the first precursors of modern military organization to contemporary conflicts, with a focus on military organization.  Students explore how and why militaries change and adapt – or fail to – and ask what exactly they are meant to do in the first place. Special focus is given to the interrelatedness of military organization and cultural, social, and economic factors.  Part of our challenge is to try and understand the nature of the relationship among these factors. On the way, students gain literacy in major topics in military studies as well as major issues in current military policymaking. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 260 - Gender in Conflict and Peace </P><P>Aims to make a feminist sense of contemporary wars and conflicts. Students trace the gendered processes of defining citizenship, national identity and security, and examine the role of the military in the construction of femininity and masculinity. One of the most prominent social constructions of gender is that of the male provider/warrior and the female caregiver/peacemaker. The making of war depends in large part on the maintenance of this simplistic conceptualization. In addition, the inequalities and power imbalances that lead to situations of conflict, at both macro- and micro-levels, reflect and reinforce the structural and discursive inequality between men and women. The class is interdisciplinary and gives equal weight to theory and practice while drawing on writings by local and global activists. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PCON 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 301 - International Human Rights and Advocacy </P><P>The gap between the promise of international human rights law and its actual practice is vast. For many advocates and activists, the gap is a source of frustration as international human rights laws and norms rarely translate into basic protections at the level of the individual. This course is designed to make students aware of the contentious nature of human rights, both in theory and in practice. It is premised on the idea that human rights are constantly claimed and developed, if not made anew, by multiple actors--whether as rights-holders, advocates, or otherwise, and that this takes place in the context of intense struggle between state and non-state actors. Students examine both the international human rights regime and the struggle for human rights, and how they interact in practice. The course takes a purposeful right-based and victim-centered approach, with the goal of introducing students to the profession of human rights advocacy. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PCON 111 or PCON 218 or PCON 225 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PCON 303 - The Camp: A Global History of Civilian Internment </P><P>Reviews a history of civilian internment by analyzing the geographic proliferation of camps throughout the planet. In modern and contemporary history, authoritarian states and democracies alike have developed concentration camps, internment camps, refugee camps, detention camps, and displaced persons camps --in ever increasing numbers. Countries have done so in order to separate and define populations they would or could not assimilate within the political life of the nation state, thereby relegating those populations to an exceptional status instead. To study the geographic spread of camps as technologies for advancing a state of exception, then, is to learn how –and to what extent-- human rights have been acknowledged or betrayed in contemporary history. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: GEOG 303   Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations, Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 304 - Criminal Underworld: Drugs, Guns, Bodies </P><P>Examines the violent networks of the illicit global economy: from guns and drugs smuggling, to human trafficking and animal poaching among others. Drawing from multiple scholarly traditions, it compares the concrete geographical organization of these illicit networks - that is, where and how they become grounded -and asks the following questions: What are the relationships of these illegal activities to legal circuits of power and profit? In what ways are transnational criminal networks redefining the nature of contemporary violence and the meaning of peace? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: GEOG 304  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 310 - Geopolitics </P><P>Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of &quot;the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation.&quot; As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the &quot;closed system&quot; we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified </P><P>- various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: GEOG 310  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 314 - Media War: Peace and Conflict in the Digital Age </P><P>The first purpose of the course is to demonstrate the central importance of media in defining the reality of war, peace, and violence in modern culture. The second goal is to introduce, in a selective manner, film, art, and written works that shaped these definitions. The primary framework is chronological, beginning with a survey of images of war and peace in art, covering in detail World War I and World War II, and ending with current images of war and of preparations for nuclear war. The secondary framework distinguishes types or degrees of war: World War I and World War II, civil wars (Spain) and genocide (the Armenians, the Jews in Europe); struggles of national liberation (Vietnam and Algeria); and prospects of global holocaust, this last creating new imagery -both positive and negative - in art, poetry, fiction, and film. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 322 - Weapons and War: Interdisciplinary Perspectives </P><P>Mustard gas, airpower, submarines, A-bombs, Agent Orange, landmines, terror wars, &quot;Star Wars&quot;: weapons technology profoundly shaped the science, politics, and culture of the last century. This course explores the myriad effects of the production, deployment, and use of weapons. Specifically, the course considers how the horizons of science and technology have been shaped by the quest for ever-more-powerful or sophisticated weaponry; how the creation of new weapons changes the nature of war and peace; how new weapons may impact lives and the planet; terror as a weapon, and scientific and social responses to it; the role of media images in the public consciousness of weaponry and war; and impacts of the global arms trade. While critically theorizing the social, environmental, and philosophical impacts of war over the past century, the course also examines the place of global ethics in discussions about weapons and war. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PCON 111 or PCON 218 or PCON 225 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PCON 329 - Environmental Security </P><P>The environment poses one of the most important security threats of the 21st century. Taught from an interdisciplinary perspective, this course introduces students to the different ways that climate change and environmental problems more generally are presenting new kinds of security threats. In many ways, greater environmental concern from governments and international organizations over the dramatic environmental changes afoot in the world is a welcome development. But will the &quot;environmental security&quot; framework reinforce global inequalities and maintain the status quo? Or might it mean rethinking the very foundations of what we mean by &quot;security&quot;? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: GEOG 329  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Sophomore, No First-Year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 340 - Terror and Counter - Terror: Histories and Logics of Asymmetric Warfare </P><P>For as long as empires and states have been going to war, people have been fighting them with the tactics and technologies now known as terrorism and guerrilla warfare. Asymmetric warfare, however, is no mere historical artifact. It dominates headlines as much as it confounds leaders around the world. Central to this course are several in depth case studies of counter-insurgency and terrorism, including France in Algeria and Indochina; the British in Malaya, East Africa and Northern Ireland; state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War; and the United States in the Philippines, Vietnam, and, after September 11, 2001, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The evolution of non-state terrorism — from the violent acts of Anarchists in the late 19th Century to the potentially apocalyptic terrorism of radical religious groups the early 21st Century — also comes under scrutiny. From Clausewitz to General Petraeus, from Mao Zedong to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, this class explores how asymmetric war is lived and understood by various observers and participants. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PCON 111 or PCON 218 or PCON 225  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 341 - War and the Shaping of American Politics </P><P>Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the &quot;military-industrial complex;&quot; and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: POSC 341 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 345 - Transitional and Historical Justice </P><P>In what ways and under what conditions do states pursue justice for past wrongs? Is democracy credible without confronting the abuses of previous regimes? Do programs for transitional and historical justice unwittingly mask or even perpetuate injustice by recognizing certain types and forms of violence, while ignoring others? Students examine the theories and practices of transitional and historical justice since 1945. A global line-up of case studies are presented, which students evaluate in a comparative framework. </P><P>Specific topics may include Post-WWII Germany, Latin America, South Africa, Rwanda, Eastern Europe after 1989, Cambodia, Australia, and the United States. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Years Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 351 - The Israel/Palestine Conflict </P><P>Focuses on the longstanding struggle between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as on the history of the way the conflict has been defined (e.g., an Arab-Israeli conflict, a religious war between Jews and Muslims, etc.). The course profiles episodes in the history of the conflict--and of the efforts to resolve it--in light of contemporary developments across the globe. The war of 1948 is analyzed in light of decolonization struggles following WWII, just as the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; of 1967 is studied in light of Cold War politics. In addition to focusing on flashpoints in the history of the conflict, the course also examines international agendas for ending it. Repeated US efforts to broker a peace are analyzed in light of geopolitical developments elsewhere. Students will become well-versed in the historical and social developments of the conflict and study the various treaties, armistice agreements, and memoranda that have guided efforts to bring it to a conclusion. They also study outstanding issues in the contest between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as current peace and armistice proposals. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: MIST 351  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 358 - Transnational Politics </P><P>Examines the segment of world politics that includes interactions and transactions between actors who are not representatives of governments or intergovernmental institutions. Non-state actors as diverse as global social movements, multinational corporations, religious communities, and even terrorist networks are now recognized as playing crucial roles on the world's political stage. This course focuses on a variety of these transnational actors, as we seek to stretch the limits of state-based approaches, and emphasize the rich variety of relationships and interactions that characterizes contemporary world politics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: POSC 358 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PCON 368 - After Genocide: Memory and Representation </P><P>An investigation of the impact of genocide on the self and the imagination's representations in literature, film, and art. Primary texts include poetry, memoir, video testimony, film, and visual art. Scholarly methodology involves readings of literary criticism and theoretical work in the study of trauma, literary theory, and testimony. Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ENGL 368 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PCON 479 - Research Seminar: Peace and Conflict, Themes and Analysis </P><P>This is a theme-based seminar that examines the literature of peace and conflict studies and other relevant theoretical and analytical work relating to violence and conflict resolution at all levels of society.

Should doctors act solely for the goal of improving their patients' health, or is their central obligation to respect patient autonomy? Other questions are more recent. When exactly is a person dead, such that withdrawing life-saving equipment is appropriate? Should parents and doctors take steps to see that their children are born with more desirable traits and characteristics?

Topics to be considered include the aim and method of Socratic inquiry; Plato's epistemology, theory of forms and defense of justice; Aristotle's logic, ontology and ethical theory; Stoic and Epicurean cosmology and ethics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 302 - Modern Philosophy (MF) </P><P>The rise of modern science together with the Reformation's challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church created an era of intense intellectual and cultural ferment in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The philosophy of this period is called 'modern' because it made a distinct break with older traditions and because the questions it asked remain the central issues for philosophers today. Studying modern philosophy will help students think creatively about what there is, what we are, and what we can know. Readings will be selected from classic works by Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Locke, Berkeley, and Kant. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 303 - Medieval Philosophy (MF) </P><P>Medieval philosophy involved the absorption and transformation of Greek and Hellenistic thought by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers, often in relations of mutual influence. The period is crucial not only for its project of reconciling reason and faith but also for philosophical insights, arguments, and formulations that have remained influential in several of the main areas of philosophy. The course focuses on questions concerning freedom of the will, the nature of moral requirements and obligation, the role of rational considerations in morality, the virtues, and ideals of human excellence. Students read figures from the three faith traditions and explore their interactions and mutual influences, as well as their differences. Coverage of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers is roughly equal, and students look at the Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Aristotelian background to their thought as well as the new directions in which they took philosophy. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 304 - Kant and German Idealism (MF) </P><P>German Idealism continues to be one of the most influential movements in philosophy, leaving its mark on many different fields of thought and experience, including epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and religion. Designed as an overview of the thought of the major representatives of German Idealism: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Students will examine the problems that motivated the emergence and development of this philosophical tradition, and the new forms of philosophical argument that each of these thinkers employed in order to address these problems. In doing so, students will see that there is a sense in which Kant can be considered the father of Existentialism. The topics discussed include the doctrine of transcendental idealism, the nature and possibility of knowledge, the ground of moral obligation, human freedom, and religious belief. No prior familiarity with these issues or thinkers will be assumed. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: One course in philosophy Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 306 - Recent Continental Philosophy </P><P>A study of some of the major movements in recent continental philosophy.

Do all human beings have rights, and if they do, what are they? What duties do wealthy countries have to aid poor ones? Are there moral constraints on how war must be conducted, and if so, what are they? In this course students engage with the work of contemporary theorists exploring these and related questions. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Recommended: At least one course in ethics or political theory is recommended. Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PHIL 320 - 20th-Century Analytic Philosophy (M&amp;E) </P><P>Employs the tools of analytic philosophy to address the large topic of the mind, the world, and the relation between them; students also explore the closely related topics of how our concepts get their content and how our language gets its meaning. By analyzing both our concepts and our experience, students will try to answer questions like: What is the relation between experience and the world beyond the mind? Do beliefs about the world amount to knowledge? Is the content of experience conceptual – and so fully expressible in language – or does experience have a richness that always surpasses the expressive power of language? Where do concepts come from? What fixes their content, and what fixes the meaning of the words that express them? If the content of language is based in part on experience, can one understand the language of someone whose experience is different? Course readings will include works by Russell, Carnap, Quine, Sellars, Davidson, and McDowell. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: One course in philosophy Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 321 - Philosophy of Literature </P><P>The philosophy of literature concerns both philosophical questions about the nature of literature, and philosophical questions that arise within particular literary works. Questions of the first kind might include: In what sense do fictional characters and stories exist? In what sense, if any, is it true that Sherlock Holmes is a detective? Are there correct or better interpretations of a literary work, and do the intentions of the author matter? Why do people choose to read works that can be frightening or sad? Questions of the second kind might include questions concerning the nature of knowledge, epistemic bubbles, and the reliability of testimony in Orwell's 1984, or questions concerning the nature of virtue in the works of Jane Austen. Readings and themes, both philosophical and literary, will vary from semester to semester. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 322 - Philosophy of Physics </P><P>Modem physics overturned many assumptions about the fundamental nature of reality that had been widely accepted since Greek antiquity. Students trace the transition from Aristotelian mechanics to modern theories of motion, and then survey the main philosophical problems raised by three of our most successful physical theories: Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Topics discussed include the problem of action at a distance, thermodynamics and the arrow of time, theories of probability, non-locality, and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: One course in philosophy or one course in physics Major/Minor Restrictions: None </P><P>Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 325 - Logic II </P><P>Covers a selection of advanced topics in logic: computability, Turing machines, soundness and completeness theorems, undecidability of predicate logic, Skolem-Löwenheim theorems, nonstandard models, and Gödel's incompleteness theorems. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PHIL 225 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 326 - Philosophical Theology </P><P>Philosophical theology is the systematic articulation of divine revelation. Its origin as a discipline trace to antiquity, as early Christians sought to compose a coherent alternative to &quot;pagan&quot; philosophies (Platonic, Stoic, etc.), using the tools of those very philosophies (e.g., conceptual analysis and the determination of logical consistency as a means to metaphysical system-building). Philosophical theology flourished in the Middle Ages, as Jews, Christians, and Muslims grappled with the rediscovered Aristotelian corpus; it is in the midst of a renaissance begun in the second half of the 20th century. After examining the epistemological framework in which philosophical theology takes place, the course discusses particular issues, which may include: revelation and scripture, the concept of prayer, the oneness of God, mitzvoth (commandments), halakhah (law), the Trinity, the Incarnation, sin and original sin, the Atonement, and the eternal destiny of the soul. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 329 - Philosophy of Law (VT) </P><P>Examines some central ideas of jurisprudence and the philosophy of law.

An emphasis is placed on exploring the connections between philosophical theory and environmental policy and practice. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 335 - Contemporary Epistemology (M&amp;E) </P><P>Examines central questions about knowledge and justification, including whether and how knowledge is possible, whether we must always be able to access the foundations of our justified beliefs, and how a knower can be virtuous or vicious. In answering these questions, students explore various sources of knowledge and justification, including perception, testimony, memory, and introspection. Students may also explore challenges to the dominant epistemological paradigms of the last century from naturalistic, experimental, feminist, and Bayesian perspectives. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: One course in philosophy Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 340 - Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </P><P>A systematic study of central issues involved in theorizing about reality at the most general level. Is the world a world of substances or a world of events? What is the nature of causation? Do concepts and statements refer to the world as it is in itself, or is such a notion idle or incoherent? How are such things as possibility and necessity and laws of nature to be understood? The topics are handled in a way that stresses the historical persistence of the debates over these issues but focuses on recent and contemporary discussions of the topics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: Two courses in philosophy Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 341 - Philosophy of Mind (M&amp;E) </P><P>Examines the historical and contemporary debates about the nature of the mind.

Core questions include: How does linguistic meaning relate to how people use language to communicate? What is meaning's relationship to concepts like reference, truth, verification and use? Is there a systematic theory that can generate the meaning of every sentence in a language? In answering the above questions, students master the logical and conceptual tools necessary for analyzing particular parts of language, which may include names, definite descriptions, demonstratives, metaphors, slurs, and other interesting linguistic expressions. Among the thinkers discussed are Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Grice, Quine, Searle, Davidson, and Kripke. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Recommended: A prior course in logic is recommended.

Is immortality  relevant to the possibility of well-being or meaningfulness? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 360 - Feminist Philosophy </P><P>Explores questions like: How have gendered assumptions influenced philosophical views about what knowledge is and how knowledge is best pursued? What roles, if any, should considerations of gender play in our theories of knowledge? How have gendered assumptions influenced political discourse?  What conceptual advances might be won if we take the woman to be the paradigm of personhood rather than the man? Students may address issues in feminist philosophy of science, specifically issues concerning the scientific study of sexual differences in behavior and brain structure; or issues in feminist political philosophy, including the role of justice in the family and the effects of power inequality on autonomous decision-making. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 365E - Freedom, Tyranny, and Philosophy in the Ancient Mediterranean (Extended Study) </P><P>A three-week extended study course aiming acquaint students with the geography, topography, and material culture of ancient Greece, southern Italy, and Rome; with the concepts and vocabularies of ancient political thought (in particular binaries such as freedom and tyranny, democracy and empire, republic and monarchy, citizenship and authority); and with the deep continuity between Greco-Roman political theory and ancient (as well as much contemporary) philosophical thought about ethics and human psychology. </P><P>Credits: Variable Prerequisites: PHIL 301 or CLAS 236 or GREK 121 or LATN 122 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PHIL 380 - Issues in Epistemology and Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </P><P>This is an umbrella course designed to allow students to delve into specific topics in epistemology or metaphysics.

How did scientists determine whether the things they studied consisted of waves or particles; that is, what are the defining characteristics of each, and how can they be measured? To answer these questions, we introduce ideas from mechanics, electricity, and special relativity. Students are then confronted with one of physics's great mysteries: how can the same object act as either a particle or a wave? While we may not completely resolve this mystery, we learn a little quantum mechanics that helps us predict the behavior of these systems. Some physics background is helpful, but none is assumed. Students must be very comfortable with algebra and trigonometry, but they will not need calculus until the next physics course.

Using a wide variety of texts, the moral underpinnings of different political systems are discussed in terms of fundamental normative concepts such as right, duty, virtue, liberty, and equality. Other essential terms, basic to building a foundational political vocabulary, such as liberalism, conservatism, individualism, communalism, and modernity are also explored. This introduction to normative political theory gives special emphasis to the genesis and development of liberal democracy and the tensions between its component parts, particularly as they relate to visions of a well-lived, moral life.

Although they are all unique, political scientists study them in systematic ways, comparing them to discover fundamental political patterns that can help produce broadly applicable generalizations across different cultures and geographies. Themes such as democratic or authoritarian regime type, models of economic development, state institutions, civil society, and issues of national and ethnic identity all form important realms of inquiry for researchers engaged in the practice of comparative politics. This course introduces students to the principle themes and basic theories of comparative politics using examples from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including both authoritarian and unstable democratic countries.

The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue -racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics.

Latin America's 20th-century experiences of coups, revolutions, and instability also present important lessons for comparative politics. This course introduces students to the countries of Latin America and the important patterns of similarity and difference that can help them understand political development and elucidate comparative trends. Regime type is one prism through which students examine the region's countries, including democracy, semi-democracy, and various authoritarian regimes, especially bureaucratic authoritarianism. Another important topic is the United States' relationship with the region's polities, on issues like the Cold War, drug wars, and economic policies. In addition to big countries like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, the course also focuses on countries of particular student interest.

It analyzes the evolution of Chinese economic market reforms and China's uneven integration into the Liberal World Order since 1978. This two-pronged developmental trajectory, however, encounters major challenges such as socioeconomic problems, ecological degradations, political dysfunctions, ideational crises, and international impediments. With varying efficacy, the Chinese government has attempted to redress these daunting problems through administrative reforms, economic rebalancing, anti-corruption campaigns, and international institutions. These major challenges and their attempted ameliorations are analyzed in-depth. The course concludes by examining the practical and discursive ramifications of China's development model for Chinese society, world politics, and the philosophical search for alternative modernities. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 331 - Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa </P><P>Provides an understanding of politics in 48 countries that constitute sub-Saharan Africa. Following the independence era of the early 1960s and 1970s, much of the sub-continent exploded into a seemingly endless cycle of violence underscored by military coups d'état and civil wars. Over the last decade, various conflicts subsided enough for some states to institute political and market reforms. Others remained stuck in the throes of economic stagnation, on the verge of disintegration and vulnerable to terrorist groups and drug runners who exploit their vast ungovernable territories. What explains the various transitions that some states have experienced in sub-Saharan Africa? Why did most states disintegrate in violence following the end of colonial rule? Drawing upon pre-colonial accounts and histories of state formation and the theoretical, methodological, and conceptual tools that various Africanists have used to analyze key events, this course offers answers to these and other important questions about political and socio-economic developments on the continent of Africa. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 335 - U.S. Environmental Politics </P><P>Public policies to protect the environment are among the most important and controversial issues in local, state, and national government.

These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's &quot;culture wars&quot; in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 </P><P>Crosslisted: RELG 338 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 341 - War and the Shaping of American Politics </P><P>Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the &quot;military-industrial complex;&quot; and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: PCON 341 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 342 - The Politics of Nuclear Proliferation </P><P>Why do states want to have nuclear weapons?

This course is an analysis of politics and the media from the inside out, beginning with the ways people receive, interpret, or ignore the media messages directed at them. News reporting and questions of bias are treated in the context of a group analysis of important stories. The class also considers the evolution and refinement of media campaigning techniques. Those who cannot purchase time or space in the mass media may resort to protest, terror, and violence in order to air their views. The class discusses these cases along with the ethical issues they pose.

Introduces students to the study of courts as political institutions and, in doing so, provides some understanding of the political nature of the role of courts in American society. Departs from the view that landmark national decisions such as Roe v. Wade, Baker v. Carr, and Brown v. Bd. of Education, along with their more recent conservative corollaries, are solely the product of adherence to constitutional standards of interpretation. Instead, it posits that these controversial rulings and judicial policy in general can be explained through careful examination of certain political factors. In short, the course is based on the premise that the judiciary is a permeable structure that is responsive to democratic processes and that, in turn, exerts influence upon those processes. Two major theoretical concerns integrate the lectures and materials covered: 1) the dynamic relationship between court decision-making processes and major features of the larger American political arena, and 2) the inherent tensions between judicial independence and democratic politics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: 100-level POSC course Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 348 - The Rise and Fall of Communism </P><P>Examines the spread of political and economic ideas and practices in the shocking advent and demise of state socialism and subsequent transitions to market capitalism.

Second, even when these countries all share a past of colonial rule and a &quot;peripheral&quot; location in the international system, the economic differences within the countries of the region are staggering. Seeking to shed light on this puzzle, this course surveys existing theories on the relationship between political institutions and economic outcomes and explores the historical co-evolution of states, regimes, and markets in the region. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>POSC 357 - International Institutions </P><P>Examines how international institutions shape states' behavior and why some institutions are more effective than others.

The bourgeois sensibilities of Montesquieu, Hume, Smith, and Voltaire are compared — culminating in the tenets of classical liberalism — to the more radical and perfectionist aspirations of Rousseau, Diderot, and Condorcet. For both schools of thought, the focus is on those aspects and ideas that cast light on matters of continuing concern and that help explain the 19th–century emergence of liberalism, romanticism, and radicalism. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 387 - Reason and Power in Social and Political Thought </P><P>How can one understand human beings when they seem to have such a complicated variety of interests and motives? The intent of this course is to look at the controversies that divide social and political theorists in their effort to understand human beings and the human condition. In the process students discover that beneath conflicting theories are recurring themes concerning subjectivity and objectivity, the nature of human beings, theories of self and other, as well as a debate over rationality, irrationality, truth, and knowledge. By better understanding these controversies students gain new insights into human nature, human knowledge, and the human condition. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 388 - Constitutional Law: Civil Rights and Liberties </P><P>Students examine the nature of civil rights and liberties under the Constitution; such include freedom of speech and the press, religious freedom, equal protection (with major attention to race and gender), due process, property, and privacy/autonomy (abortion, right to die, sexual orientation).

More specifically, students focus on the structural characteristics of the American regime, or Constitution--separation of powers, federalism, emergency powers, property rights; but students are equally concerned with the politics of interpretation itself--the complex process by which people determine what is the Constitution, how it is to be understood, and who has authority to interpret it. The responsibility for constitutional interpretation is broadly distributed, but it is also obvious that the preeminent voice for interpreting the Constitution has become the Supreme Court. Accordingly, students spend the greater portion of the course with the analysis of cases, that is, the Court's opinion of what the Constitution means. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 390 - Silent Warfare: Intelligence Analysis and Statecraft </P><P>Introduces students to the complex and crucial process of obtaining, analyzing, and producing intelligence in the making of American foreign policy. Subjects covered include problems with the structure of the intelligence community, covert action, psychological and bureaucratic constraints on analysts and policymakers, and how the intelligence community has responded to key threats. Students also explore ethical issues raised with intelligence gathering such as the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, the role of whistleblowers, and accountability of the intelligence community. By addressing these issues, students tackle critical problems associated with the collection, analysis, and use of intelligence to meet the American national interest. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 410 - Our Constitutional Order: Continuity and Change (Study Group) </P><P>An inquiry into the enduring principles and changing features of our constitutional order.

The course compares theories about democratic transition and consolidation that were generated by cases that took place across different regions and periods, such as the Western European examples of the 19th century and the Latin American and East Asian cases of the 20th century. Major topics include the role of political parties, political elites, and grassroots organizations, the design of electoral rules and other institutional arrangements, the effect of capitalist development, and the influence of international actors upon patterns of democratization and prospects for democratic stability. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 417 - Seminar: Law and Order </P><P>In the American criminal justice policy process the people are represented by two separate, but equally important groups: the politicians who enact anti-crime laws and criminal justice officials who are empowered to enforce them. Students investigate &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; politics and policymaking in the U.S. by way of probing the extent to which the adoption of criminal justice policies by lawmakers and the administration of criminal law are driven and chiefly so by democratic pressures. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None Formerly: POSC 337 </P><P>POSC 421 - Seminar: Information Warfare </P><P>Misinformation, disinformation, fake news — the political world around us is full of claims about the use and abuse of information. Students explore some of the key questions surrounding information warfare in international relations. Is information warfare a new sort of war — or the continuation of traditional conflict by other means? How do states and non-state actors use and manipulate information to achieve their goals on the international stage? How can states best protect themselves? And can it ever be ethical to engage in information warfare? </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 433 - Seminar: Topics in Globalization </P><P>Addresses the causes and implications of globalization from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including political science, economics, sociology, and philosophy.

The liberalization of American immigration law in the 1960s provides the basis for the discussion of push-pull factors of migration of South Asians from various states in the subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal). Today South Asians are deemed to be a model minority, a label that at the same time extols and dehumanizes South Asians depending on their class position and their country of origin. To counter the stereotypical narratives of doctors and engineers on the one hand and cab drivers and convenience-store clerks on the other, students are encouraged to engage with various texts to recognize ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity of South Asian migrants, and to consider the challenges of acculturation and assimilation as immigrants become citizens. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 436 - Seminar: Continuity and Change in International Politics </P><P>An analysis of contemporary conceptual approaches to international politics and of the trends and developments that are altering some traditional assumptions about the nature of the international arena. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None </P><P>Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Recommended: Recommended for all international relations honors students and for students going to graduate school.

In this seminar, students will read a range of books on inequality and political participation in Europe and the United States, focusing on how the ideas of legitimation, participation, and representation-used to varying extents in the European and American literatures-compare. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 466 - Seminar: Dispelling American Founding Myths: The Declaration of Independence and the Framing of the Constitution </P><P>What did the Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution mean when written? Students focus on the essays, debates, and events in the American colonies and young nation that preceded and led to the drafting of these two foundational documents. Students explore still contested questions such as: was the Declaration's language of equality intended to include all men and women in a land marked with all manner of inequalities? Were the Constitution's Framers seeking to facilitate democratic governance or to limit it as much as possible? In writing the Constitution, how did they understand the essential institutions they created and/or effectively endorsed: the Electoral College, the Supreme Court, Senate representation, and slavery? In answering these questions, participants are asked to read carefully primary American Founding-era documents, rather than research the views of secondary scholars and pundits. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp;amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>POSC 475 - Seminar: Philosophies of Law: Theory and Practice </P><P>Introduces students to philosophies of law as found in theories of natural law, international law, and positive law.

This course is not a survey as it focuses on a few areas within attention and memory and studies these areas in depth, exploring seminal and current theories and empirical findings in human attention and memory from a cognitive perspective. Examples of problems which may be addressed include bottom-up vs. top-down attention allocation, dual-task performance, inhibition and attention control, attention and working memory, memory for skills, auto-biographical and emotional memories, memory impairments, and memory in everyday life (e.g., memory loss with age, Alzheimer's dementia, alcoholic dementia). </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 and (PSYC 250 or PSYC 251) Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 352 - Origins of Human Thought </P><P>Studies the origins of human thought from a variety of perspectives, including developmental, cross-cultural, and comparative. Each of these perspectives provides unique evidence concerning &quot;origins.&quot; Developmental psychology examines the origins of thought within the lifespan of the individual within a particular culture; cross-cultural psychology examines the degree to which ways of thinking originate culturally; comparative psychology studies the evolutionary origins of thinking by making comparisons among species. These different approaches to studying &quot;origins&quot; are applied to a few focused topics in human cognition, such as origins of speech, concepts and categories, perception of objects, and perception of music. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 353 - Visual Perception and Cognition </P><P>Our everyday visual experiences typically yield a sense of certainty in that we believe we are operating directly from information in the world around us. Despite such a belief, many of our decisions and actions depend on perceptual inferences derived from our internalized representations of external information. Put another way, many of our decisions and subsequent actions are the direct result of our brains making guesses based on fabricated information. The purpose of this course is to explore how perceptual and cognitive processes act to formulate low- and high-level visual representations of the physical world, and how those representations inform (and are informed by) our knowledge of the world. The vast majority of the readings for this course employ behavioral paradigms that target the neurological (functional) underpinnings associated with visual representations and knowledge structures. Therefore, it contains a mix of both behavioral and neurophysiological components (with an emphasis on functional neuroscience). </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: NEUR 353 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: (NEUR 170 or PSYC 275) and (NEUR 201 or NEUR 202 or PSYC 200) Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 355 - Language and Thought </P><P>Language is a distinctive human ability that distances humans from the rest of the animal kingdom - including chimpanzees, with whom people share 98 percent of the same genetic inheritance. Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: NEUR 355  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: (NEUR 170 or PSYC 275) and (NEUR 201 or NEUR 202 or PSYC 200) Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>PSYC 360 - Bonding across Boundaries: A Service Learning Experience </P><P>Aims to engage students in considering ways to break down the barriers that young adults with disabilities face as they seek vocational, social and recreational opportunities within our communities. Students read research literature at the intersection of social psychology and disability studies that explores the psychological and social experience of disability. They then participate in an extended service-learning experience in which they collaborate with local teens and young adults with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders on projects that build on their common interests and serve the wider community. Students keep a journal throughout the semester, prepare a proposal describing their collaborative community engagement project, and complete an evaluation study of their project. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 361 - Psychotherapy and Behavior Change </P><P>Explores the major models of psychological treatment in adults and children. Each treatment model is examined in terms of its perspective on human behavior and psychopathology, its mechanisms and techniques of therapeutic change, and its empirical evidence. Also addressed are some of the recurring controversies in the field of clinical psychology: Should clinical research and practice inform each other and, if so, how? Can the disparate treatment models and their implicit world-views be integrated? To what extent is lasting behavior change possible? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 362 - Social Bonds </P><P>Explores the ontogenetic (developmental) and phylogenetic (evolutionary) roots underlying human social relationships. Social bonds are traced through the lifespan, beginning with parent-infant attachments, moving next to peer relationships, and ending with pair bonds. Students examine the interplay of social cognition, social perception, emotion, and communication in human sociability. Patterns underlying human social bonds are deciphered using research from child, social, cross-cultural, evolutionary, biological, and comparative psychology. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 363 - Developmental Psychopathology </P><P>Introduces the study of psychological problems in the context of human development. Using a broad, integrative framework, the course examines childhood psychological problems from a variety of perspectives (genetic, biological, temperament, socioemotional, family, and cultural). Syndromes that often first appear in childhood and adolescence are discussed, including autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder and youth violence, depression and suicide, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. The course also examines developmental resilience, environments that place children at risk for poor outcomes, and prevention. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 364 - Human Motivation </P><P>Motivation is the energy behind human actions. Can people control their own desires? How do emotions energize behavior? What satisfactions contribute to a happy life? These questions are of interest to psychologists studying human motivation. This course begins by examining basic biological motives, such as hunger and aggression, and progresses toward the study of more complex motivational phenomena such as curiosity, striving for success, and falling in love. By drawing from physiological, cognitive, social, and personality psychology, this course provides a unique opportunity to examine some of the most interesting questions in psychology from a variety of perspectives. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 365 - Cross-Cultural Human Development </P><P>To what degree does culture shape and constrain the development of human ability, thought, and behavior? What features of human behavior lie beyond culture's reach? In pursuing these questions, students study how sensorimotor, perceptual, emotional, cognitive, social, and personality development proceed in diverse cultural contexts. Theories of human development and the cross-cultural methodologies used to test them are critiqued in detail. Inquiry is framed by an understanding of cultural and biological evolution and incorporates readings from developmental and cross-cultural psychological science, and from anthropology and sociology. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Recommended: PSYC 309 is recommended. </P><P>Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 366 - Psychology of Leadership </P><P>An exploration of the psychological forces that give root to human dominance, hierarchy, and leadership. Guided by evolutionary, developmental, and cross-cultural perspectives, questions about social power and leadership are addressed using empirical literature: To what degree are motives for social dominance--and social docility--embedded in human nature and traceable through primate evolution? What traits and competencies distinguish leaders from followers, how early do these differences develop, and is the pattern the same for girls and boys, and for men and women, across the globe? How do some leaders and groups cultivate followers so devoted that they adhere to destructive directives? Contemporary problems in leadership provide illustrations. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 367 - Advanced Social Psychology </P><P>Perhaps more than anything else, people think about other people- the people with whom they are close, those who shape conceptions of the self, motivate behavior, and produce strong emotional reactions. The field of social psychology is devoted to understanding how people feel about, think about, and interact with others. This advanced social psychology seminar offers a contemporary, in-depth exploration of different topic areas within the field of social psychology. Students investigate primary literature on some of the most vexing, provocative, and important issues of our time. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 368 - Prejudice and Racism </P><P>Provides a survey of the psychology of prejudice and racism, the scientific study of human feeling, thinking, and behavior in situations involving conflict between groups. More broadly, the course examines the psychological factors that contribute to the perpetuation of inequality and discrimination. Students consider both proximate (immediate) influences on behavior, such as the immediate social situation, as well as distal (more remote) influences on behavior, such as human evolution. Both motivational approaches to understanding prejudice (e.g., explaining prejudice as a consequence of the desire for social dominance) as well as cognitive approaches (e.g., explaining prejudice as a byproduct of automatic associations people learn) are examined. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None </P><P>Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 369 - Industrial/Organizational Psychology </P><P>Most adults spend the majority of their waking hours working. This is a greater investment of time and energy than is made into any other single endeavor. Thus, understanding the reasons why people work, the psychological dynamics of the workplace, and the potential benefits and costs of various work situations is of considerable practical importance. This course introduces students to the field of industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology, with an emphasis on studying the workplace as an important context for human interaction, the realization of personal goals, and the development of competencies. Students also discuss the role that I/O psychologists play in organizations. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: PSYC 200 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>PSYC 372 - Health Psychology </P><P>Health psychologists seek to understand the relationships among psychological factors, behavior, and physical health.

The course explores and compares religious beliefs, values, practices, rituals, texts, images, and stories, in their historical, cultural, and political contexts. It examines diversity and concordance within each tradition, encouraging students to reflect thoughtfully on the nature of religion and the ways it shapes communities and individuals through the world. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 102 - Religion and the Contemporary World </P><P>Explores the mutual impact between religions and contemporary global issues. How do diverse religious individuals and communities address the prominent moral concerns of our times? What do religions offer the contemporary world, especially in an era in which secular, atheistic, and spiritual critics alike have singled out religion as a noxious influence in human society? Potential topics of focus include terrorism, genocide, religion and politics, war, gender and sexuality, health and medicine, poverty and class disparity, environmental justice, science and technology, and secularization. In examining such questions the class serves to sharpen students' present-day understanding of religion and to provide students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most controversial political, social, and philosophical issues. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 203 - Comparative Religious Ethics </P><P>Examines the ethical dimensions of a variety of religious traditions and considers them in light of one another. As a comparative course in the study of religion it aims to give students a better sense of what role religious traditions play in cultivating forms of moral thought and behavior, and how specific traditions might begin to think about ethical issues. That is, students investigate how these traditions envision morality as such but also how they think concretely about violence, gender, poverty, and the value of human life. This comparative approach to the study of religion ultimately hopes to prompt students toward a consideration of what is, as well as what is not, ethical about these traditions. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 204 - Hindu Mythology </P><P>An exploration of the Hindu gods and goddesses of India through their myths. For centuries Indians have been telling stories about the gods through sacred scripture, folklore, and pilgrimage traditions, and more recently in comic books, television series, and films. Through close readings of India's mythic and epic texts communicated through diverse media, students gain an introduction to Hinduism as a dynamic, living religious tradition. Anyone attempting to understand the complexities of Indian culture, politics, and society soon encounters the gods and goddesses of the Hindu tradition. Besides introducing students to these fascinating figures and their stories, the course seeks to explore broader questions in the study of religion including the politics of gendered visions of the divine, and the effects of the medium on the transmission of religious messages. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 206 - Hindu Goddesses </P><P>Divine feminine power (shakti) has stood the test of time in the Indian subcontinent. Goddess theology has thrived, transformed and expanded throughout known history. Students examine conceptions of shakti through literary, oral, and other artistic expressions. Mythological narratives of goddesses and epic heroines, taken from classical Sanskrit texts, folkloric traditions and iconography-as well as from contemporary genres such as novel, film and comics-will serve as primary source material in this introduction to divine feminine power in Hindu Goddess traditions. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 207 - Chinese Ways of Thought </P><P>Provides an introduction to the Chinese worldview, examining Chinese philosophical and religious thought from the Warring States period (453-221 BCE), Neo-Confucian thought from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and later periods. Classical Chinese thought was defined by the violence of the times and was therefore directed toward the question of how social harmony might be established and maintained. Later Confucian thought, under the influence of Buddhism, introduced additional questions about ethics and the human relationship to the cosmos. These intellectual traditions influenced generations of Chinese scholars and officials, and they also give insight into some of the unique aspects of Chinese society today. The course considers attempts by modern-day scholars (&quot;New Confucians&quot;) to apply Chinese thought to contemporary ethical and political problems. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 208 - The Hebrew Bible in America </P><P>The Bible is not only the best-selling book in America, but is arguably the book that has most profoundly shaped the United States. This course is an introduction to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in its American contexts, particularly American public life. In reading the Hebrew Bible, students ask themselves how these scriptures have shaped American politics, culture, history, and literature. Who has used the Bible and how? To whom does the Bible now speak, and what does it say? In what sense is the Bible understood to be an American text? This course presumes no knowledge of the Christian or Jewish Bibles. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 208  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 213 - The Bible as/and Literature </P><P>What role does literary art play in the shaping of biblical narrative? How does the construction of the sacred text reflect its theological meaning? The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 213  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 214 - Muhammad and the Qur'an </P><P>Provides an in-depth introduction to the Qur'an, the life of the Prophet Muhammad, and the centuries of interpretative debates among both Muslims and non-Muslims over the meaning of these two foundations of the Islamic tradition. Students begin with an immersion in the earliest Islamic primary sources, reading excerpts from the Qur'an itself and the first biography of Muhammad ever written. Next, students examine recent scholarly debates over the nature of Muhammad's movement and message. The second half of the course adopts a more thematic approach, looking at issues like the place of women in the Qur'an, the authority of reason vs. revelation, Islamic education, and Qur'anic ethics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: MIST 214  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 218 - Seeing, Feeling, Believing: Black Religious Thought through Visual Art and Performance </P><P>What can visual art and performance tell us about Black religion? Students explore this question by considering how historical and contemporary Black artists use mediums such as photography, painting, tactile installation, embodied movement, and sound to consider religious ideas. Students bring these creative works into conversation with scholarship in Black religious thought concerning a range of themes, including conjure/ancestral connection, Black liberation, ecstatic feeling, otherwise worlds, hope/pessimism, and the human. As a result, students gain an understanding of the profound ways that questions of religion and life meaning deeply inform and animate Black artistic and aesthetic cultural expression. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: ALST 218  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 221 - Religious Diversity in Asia </P><P>How should we understand the relationship between religious texts and lived experiences? Why do religious differences sometimes harden and sometimes become porous depending on the context? Focusing on a single place and its people can help us break down traditional frameworks for understanding religion and reveals instead a much more dynamic image of religious diversity. Students are introduced to at least three major religions in a particular Asian region. In the process, it problematizes the traditional portrait of distinct and timeless world religions by taking a deeper look at the lived experiences of religious practitioners in one designated Asian society. The course utilizes a kaleidoscopic and multidisciplinary approach to the study of religion, allowing students to identify and appreciate the complex and sometimes unexpected ways in which religious practitioners live in diverse societies.  </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None Formerly: RELG 321 </P><P>RELG 222 - Comparative Scripture </P><P>Based on comparative scriptural analysis or what is now called &quot;Scriptural Reasoning.&quot; The focus will be on close readings of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Qur'an with an eye to common themes and differences. Students will engage in a comparison of interpretive traditions in Judaism, Christianity and Islam to see how particular scriptural passages are understood in the religious traditions. The course will also spend time studying the ways in which scriptural reasoning has been used as a form of religious conflict resolution and peace-building in situations of conflict in the UK and Middle East. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 222  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 226 - Reason, Religion, and God </P><P>Examines the similarities and differences between rational and religious understandings of God. By pursuing close readings of classic texts in the field of philosophy of religion, students considers how both philosophical and religious ideas are often developed together. Students explore various arguments about the rationality of God as responses to wider intellectual, cultural, and historical contexts in which they are made and to the specific shape and needs of a particular religious tradition (e.g., Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism). Students also explore the &quot;rationality&quot; of religious forms such as scripture, symbol, ritual, and prayer. In different semesters, select themes such as revelation, theodicy (the justification of God in the face of human suffering), providence and free will, or the theism/atheism debate are investigated. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 226  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 230 - Feasting and Fasting: Religion and Food </P><P>Examines a range of religious and cultural attitudes about food. What foods are celebrated? What foods forbidden? Who can eat what and when? Through a comparative approach to food restrictions and injunctions, feasts and fasts, and food-based rituals and liturgies in Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu traditions, students investigate the role food plays in defining religious boundaries and identities. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 232 - Health and Healing in Asian Religions </P><P>A look at how illness, health, and healing are understood and experienced in parts of Asia where illness is not defined merely as a physiological problem, but is also seen to have important spiritual, aesthetic, social, and political causes and effects. Similarly, while biomedicine defines health as the absence of disease, in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, health is about achieving balance between different elements in the body, such as wind, water, and fire. Students will develop an appreciation for the culturally and historically patterned ways in which people come to identify and treat bodily, psychological, and social distress. For instance, students will examine spirit possession in a variety of contexts as both a form of affliction and as a mode of healing. Students will look at the role of traditional healers; how cultures vary in what they consider to be the causes of illness; who gets sick; what forms illness takes; and how the social, political, and aesthetic dimensions of health and healing affect treatment outcomes. Readings will be drawn from the fields of ethnomedicine, medical anthropology, and the anthropology of religion, to explore how illness and health are conceptualized and experienced in different cultures and across different sites of healing. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 234 - Women and Religious Traditions </P><P>Examines autobiographical, biographical, descriptive, and historical materials that present and analyze the lives of women in the context of various religious traditions.

Students examine the scriptural, theological, and ethical teachings of various religions on justice, conflict resolution, peace, and reconciliation. Students also examine the theological writings on justice, war, and peace by Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, and Schleiermacher. Using concrete case studies of conflict and reconciliation, students explore the teachings of African religion, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam on nonviolence, peace-making, relationship of peace and justice, as well as evaluate the negative and positive contributions of these religions toward conflict. Students examine religious and interreligious conflicts (Northern Ireland, India/Pakistan), religious language and symbols (Rwanda), current attempts at peace reconciliations (Bosnia, Liberia), and the role of religions and the causes of situations of conflict (the Middle East). Of particular interest is an examination of situations in which the political process was shaped and defined to a greater degree by religious leaders and their communities (South Africa). </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 236 - Religion, Science, and the Environment </P><P>In the 17th century, religion lost its claim to the cosmos; the religious knowledge of the order of nature ceased to possess any legitimacy in the new paradigm of science that came to dominate the West. Until the 1960s, Christian thinkers considered it the great glory of Christianity that it alone among the world's religions had permitted purely secular science to develop in a civilization in which it was dominant. After several centuries of an ever-increasing eclipse of the religious significance of nature in the West and neglect of the order of nature, humans are now experiencing environmental crisis: global warming; the destruction of the ozone layer; climatic and weather pattern changes; soil erosion; death of animals, birds, and marine life; and the disappearance of some plant species. Today the very fabric of life is threatened and the future of our world hangs in the balance as nature is threatened by destruction caused by an environmental crisis that has gone unchecked for several centuries. What can be learned from religions of the world that will save humanity and nature? What is the relationship between religion, nature, science, and technology? Discussions include views from various religious traditions concerning nature, concept of the human, notions of progress and destiny, faith and science, ecological theology, ecofeminism, justice and sustainability, and spirituality. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 240 - Religion and Terrorism </P><P>Terrorists are often driven by extremist beliefs staunchly rooted in religious, racial, and ethical rationales for torture, violence, and genocide. The course provides a theoretical and empirical understanding, and explanation of terrorism. While tracing the history of terrorism to the ancient West, students will also identify various analytical approaches to the study of terrorism, recognize terrorist groups, and review terrorist tactics. Students will examine the ways that states counter terror, and the choices and the tradeoffs states face when confronting terrorism. Students will examine terrorist individuals and groups in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Sikhism such as the Ku Klux Klan, Timothy Mc Veigh, Republican Army in Ireland, Orthodox Rabbi Meir Kahane, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, Osama bin Laden, Boko Haram, Islamic State, and Shoko Asahara in Japan. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 243 - History of Religion in America </P><P>Studies selected significant religious questions, themes and texts from American religious history.

Students study themes and controversies in American culture during the decades since the end of the Second World War, focusing upon the study of religious diversity and the changing religious landscape of America; issues of church and state; religion and politics; and religious ideas and values as they have shaped, and been expressed in, popular culture. Special attention is paid to the aftershocks of 9/11 on American religious dynamics. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 247 - Death and Afterlife </P><P>Examines various ways humans have attempted to anticipate, accept, deny, defeat, or transcend death. If death is rebirth, what is birth? What survives death? What stories and techniques have people shared to imagine immortality? Our approach is comparative, with emphasis on sacred stories and practices of Buddhists, Hindus, ancient Greeks and Egyptians, Jews, Christians, and Muslims and their legacies for our current debates over personal identity, sustainability, and memory. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 248 - Christianity, Islam, and Political Change in Africa </P><P>The course explores how Christianity and Islam have caused or influenced conflict and division or greater political and social freedoms in Africa. Select countries are examined as case studies: Nigeria and Sudan for conflict and division; South Africa and Malawi for democratization of society. The course covers the spread of Christianity and Islam, colonial (British, French, and German) policy and Christian missionaries' attitude toward Islam, separation of religion and state (the debate over Islamic Law, Shar'ia), and religion and politics. Movements within Islam (Islamic brotherhoods, Madhist movement) and Christianity (liberation, black, womanist/feminist theologies) are also studied. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 250 - Religion, Othering, Violence in the Middle Ages </P><P>Slaves, Muslims, Jews, Black Africans, lepers, prostitutes, homosexuals (now LGBTQ), and witches, were often viewed as foreigners and foes in the European Middle Ages. Students deconstruct the shifting and nuanced role religion played in constructing and regulating identity alterity, and notions of deviance, heresy, and Otherness across selected chronological periods and discrete geographical contexts. Primary and secondary sources foreground the strategic ways in which religious practices, prescriptions, canons, sacred texts, and mythic ideologies and prejudices coalesced with regional laws and practices to legitimate or transgress social and political boundaries, delimit daily social interactions, and foment individual, inter-religious, and group violence. Medieval religious texts, legal narratives, courtly literature, plays, romance, art, and iconography provide captivating records of religion's role in fomenting justifications of militant piety, and conversely, tolerance and inclusion, toward minorities in the Middle Ages. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 251 - Faith after the Holocaust </P><P>The death of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis in the Second World War represents a radical challenge to faith in Judaism, in Christianity, and in humanism. Study begins with a historical overview of the Holocaust and uses accounts of Holocaust survivors to articulate the challenge of the Holocaust to faith. Then students review philosophical and theological responses to this challenge by a variety of Jewish, Christian, and secular authors. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 251  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 252 - Religion, Plagues, Pandemics </P><P>Plagues, pandemics, and epidemics have visited fear, chaos, and death upon global communities and nations for millennia. Catastrophes like the Bubonic Plague of 14th century Europe (1348-50), plagues in the Ottoman capital (1522-921), early modern Africa (1494-1554), China (1770/71), and the 1918 American Flu pandemic, among others, precipitated world-shattering disruptions that mandated rapid and comprehensive recalibrations of social constructions of normalcy, social identity, and socio-cultural cohesion. The course identifies religion as a requisite multidimensional construct situated at the intersection of interdisciplinary theorizing and explanatory models regarding the etiologies of, and responses to, death-dealing disease and contagion. Religious understandings of calamitous plagues, pandemics, and epidemics are juxtaposed with the rise of medical and scientific understandings of these maladies within discrete periods. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 253 - Love, God, and Sexuality </P><P>A cross-cultural and multi-disciplinary approach to the questions of how the social and cultural significance of sexuality has been shaped by religious discourse, myth, doctrine, and ritual. How have various forms of sexual expression come to be seen as normal, while others are seen as deviant? How has passionate love served as a metaphor for the expression of religious experiences, such as the union of the soul with God? How have people thought to &quot;channel&quot; sexual energy to pursue spiritual projects, as in tantra and religious celibacy? Topics of study may include marriage, different- and same-sex love, virginity, celibacy, sacred prostitution, ecstasy and mysticism, and the role of transvestites, transsexuals, androgynes, and third-gender people in religious myth and ritual in contexts such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 255 - Church, State, and Law in the U.S </P><P>What do we mean when we talk about &quot;the separation of church and state&quot;? Where does this principle originate? Are there exceptions? This course explores the relationship between religion and law in the United States. Students consider the question of what Americans mean when they speak of the separation of church and state and explore the ways in which the U.S. Supreme Court has attempted to implement this principle within American law. Students examine a variety of influential theories of church-state separation, and read some of the most important First Amendment cases of the 20th and early 21st centuries. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of U.S. religion or U.S. law. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 262 - Islam in Our Post-9/11 World </P><P>The September 11th attacks left an indelible mark on both American political discourse and the experiences of Muslim communities across the globe. This course asks: how should we conceptualize the relationship between Islam and the West in our post-9/11 world? Together, we will explore the history and ideas behind contemporary headlines in an effort to understand the roots of Islamist violence, American foreign policy towards Muslim-majority countries, Muslim debates over the future of their faith, and popular discourse on Islam in the West. We will look at a wide range of sources and perspectives in order to tackle these difficult but exceedingly relevant issues. </P><P>Credits: 1 Crosslisted: MIST 262  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 265 - Global Bioethics and Religion </P><P>The revolution in biotechnology has given humanity powers unimaginable a few decades ago. Bioethics within the Western cultural tradition examines moral and ethical dilemmas arising from the interface of human experience and advances in biology, medicine, and technology (human embryonic stem cell applications, cloning, genetic engineering, euthanasia, etc.). Global bioethical inquiry places moral and ethical bioethics deliberations on the international stage, with a focused exploration of diverse and competing transnational theoretical debates. The course undertakes a critical study of comparative religious ethics and global bioethics issues within Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 281 - Hindu Traditions </P><P>As one of the world's most ancient, complex, and fascinating religious traditions, the study of Hinduism provides an ideal arena for examining central questions in the study of religion. Through close readings of primary texts in translation, this course focuses on the history of Hindu traditions from their origins to the development of devotional movements in medieval and early modern India. Following a chronological order, these texts include the hymns of the ancient Vedas, the investigations into salvific reality in the Upanishads, the religious epics, devotional poems in praise of gods, religious philosophy (Yoga and Advaita Vedanta), and classical mythology. While exploring the variety of forms Hinduism has taken, the class engages broader questions in the study of religions such as the construction of religious authority, the definition of the good life, conceptions of the soul, differences between elite and non-elite styles of religiosity, and the significance of gender in conceptualizations of the divine. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 282 - Introduction to Islam </P><P>In the desert landscape of 7th century Arabia, a middle-aged Arab tribesman and caravan trader named Muhammad began to hear the word of God and declared himself a prophet. Within decades, Muhammad's message sparked a religious and social revolution that changed the course of human history. Students examine the rise of Islam, its emergence as a diverse global religion, and its multi-faceted encounters with Western-style modernity. Students begin by studying the Qur'an, the life of Muhammad, and the stories of his immediate successors. Who exactly was Muhammad, and what was the nature of his message? What challenges did the early Muslim community face? Following our exploration of the earliest phases of Islamic history, students then delve into the formation of two major streams of Islamic thought: shari'a (Islamic law) and Sufism (Islamic mysticism). The final third of the semester focuses on Muslim responses to European colonialism and Western-style modernity. Specifically, we examine colonial-era changes to shari'a, the Iranian Revolution, the rise of violent Islamists like Al Qaeda and ISIS, and modern Muslims living in the West. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 283 - Introduction to Judaism </P><P>As a minority culture, throughout history, Jews and Judaism have always been subject to the influence of the majority cultures in which Jews have found themselves. In response to the shocks of modernity, ruptures, scientific advancements, and philosophical ideas and challenges, Jewish thinkers, culture, and individuals formulated responses—religious and otherwise. In Experiencing Judaism, students will explore how Judaism has responded to modernity, the &quot;age of secularism.&quot; To wit, students will focus on distinctively modern expressions of Judaism: the range of denominations, their historical origins, ideologies, and attitudes to Jewish law and its development, secularism, religious and secular Zionism. Students will explore these developments through primary texts within their historical contexts to better understand contemporary Judaism as it is expressed and practiced, mainly in North America and Israel, as a religion and also as a culture. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 283  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 284 - Christian Traditions </P><P>This historical study of the development of the central Christian beliefs examines the development of the early creeds, the emerging of ecumenical consensus, and philosophical elaborations.

Some of the major themes running through Buddhism in various times and places include the allure of the motif of renunciation, the roles of scripture and literature in orienting devotion and community, an economy of merit wherein material goods and respect are offered to the Buddha and his community of monks and nuns in exchange for better rebirth and, ultimately, salvation, and Buddhism's confrontation with modernity, the West, and science. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 286 - Catholic Traditions </P><P>Central to this study is the understanding of Roman Catholicism as a living, dynamic, multi-faceted set of religious traditions. The focus may change each term. The time frame is usually from the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) to the present, although the full panoply of Catholic history, doctrine, and liturgy is under review, especially during the Catholic Reformation of the 1500s. Topics may include the Church's self-understanding, the historical context of American Catholicism, cultural pluralism within global Catholicism, and contemporary issues such as war and peace, social and economic justice, sexuality and reproduction, grassroots liberation efforts, and environmental concerns. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 287 - Protestant Traditions: Revolutions and Reformations </P><P>Considers the Protestant tradition in Europe and the United States. The great theological doctrines of the Reformation of 16th-century Europe are examined: salvation by grace, the authority of scripture as opposed to ecclesiastical edicts, freedom of conscience, the priesthood of all believers, and separation of church and state. The great themes articulated by Luther, Calvin, and others constituted a challenge to established authority that involved the Church, the monarchies, and the dissenters. The Protestant tradition that emerged gave rise to new conceptions of political order that profoundly impacted the ideological, social, and political foundations of the United States. Protestant vision contributed heavily to biblical metaphors shaping American self-understanding. Protestant vision and Protestant thinkers gave rise to various forms of Christian communities, such as the Society of Shakers, and provided the impetus for reform movements such as abolition of slavery, the Social Gospel, Prohibition, and the Civil Rights movement. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 288 - American Indian Religions </P><P>Introduces students to the variety of American Indian traditional religions and historical religious movements. After an evaluation of the methods used in understanding Indian religions and a survey of culture areas, students look at American Indian concepts of the supernatural, mythology, ceremonialism, dreams and visions, medicine, witchcraft, shamanism, nature-relations, and conceptions of the soul. In a given semester, examples from Navajo, Lakota, Skagit, Inuit, Hopi, and Ojibwa religions are described in some detail, in order to show how the individual characteristics are integrated; then students examine the effects of Christian missions and the most important religious movements among American Indians since white contact: Handsome Lake's Religion, Ghost Dance, Peyote Religion, and others. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 289 - African Religious Traditions </P><P>This course is an exploration of the nature and varieties of indigenous African religions. Issues examined include cosmology; concepts of divinity; ancestors; person; meaning of sacrifice; symbols and ritual practice; the relationships among art and religion, politics, and religious institutions; and the challenge of social change, Christianity, and Islam to indigenous religions. In addition, students examine the different methods used in studying African religions. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 295 - Tibetan Buddhism </P><P>What accounts for the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism among certain Hollywood elite as well as a growing number of Chinese in the world today? Why did Tibet give rise to the unique institution of the reincarnating lama, best known in the West through the figure of the Dalai Lama? What goes on in Tibetan monasteries, the largest monasteries in world history? Understanding the answers to these questions requires that one examine the place and privilege of religion and Buddhism in particular in Tibetan culture. Through the close reading of the autobiography of a Tibetan saint, Buddhist myth, ethnographic descriptions, and philosophical treatises, as well as Buddhist art and other media, students come to understand the centrality of religion to many aspects of life in Tibet, and gain a basic understanding of Buddhist philosophy, ritual/contemplative practices, pilgrimage, popular practices, monastic life, and other facets of religion and life in Tibet. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 308 - End of the World: Apocalyptic Thought and Movements in Historical Perspective </P><P>Investigates the origin and evolution of apocalyptic literature and movements from antiquity to the present, beginning with the Second Temple and early Christian periods. What existential and ideological factors give </P><P>rise to convictions of the world's cataclysmic destruction, or civilization-altering fate? Why do apocalyptic movements forecast the inevitability of such life-threatening catastrophes as national or global revolution and warfare, plagues, ecological catastrophes, or profound existential threats from bioengineering or artificial intelligence menaces gone awry? Particular attention is focused on the sociohistorical factors that fuel and heighten apocalyptic fervor within discrete historical periods, inclusive of contemporary post-apocalyptic reconstructions of new world orders that inspire allegiance, hope, and notions of paradisal tranquility. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 308  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 313 - The &quot;Word&quot; in the World: The Bible in Global Perspective </P><P>Using a form of biblical interpretation called contextual interpretation, this course explores how the Bible is read and interpreted by people around the world. Contextual interpretation takes the context or social location of the interpreter (their gender, class, race, nationality, etc.) as the starting point in the hermeneutical (interpretive) process. De-centering the predominantly male, patriarchal, and first-world orientation of more traditional biblical scholarship, the readings for this course foreground the perspectives and commitments of the interpreters as well as issues of identity, ethnicity, gender, class, location, and power. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 320 - In the Courts of the Conqueror: Native American Religious Freedom </P><P>Explores the interaction of indigenous religions and secular law in the United States. What does the U.S. Constitution say about Indigenous religious beliefs and practices? Why have Indigenous beliefs and practices been historically marginalized within U.S. law, and what does this history tell us about the separation of church and state? Students address these questions through an exploration of key U.S. Supreme Court cases from the 20th and 21st centuries. No prior knowledge of U.S. religion or U.S. law is assumed. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: NAST 320  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 329 - Modern Islamic Thought </P><P>Over the past two centuries, Islam - like many other religions - has experienced a series of radical challenges and transformations. This course untangles the nature of these changes by focusing on the two most significant streams of modern Islamic thought: Islamism and Islamic modernism. Students explore questions like: how did various Muslims respond to European colonialism? How do Islamist thinkers envision justice, relations with other religious groups, and the role of violence in constructing an Islamic state, and what are the differences among them? How have Muslim modernists in turn worked to fuse Western-style modernity and the Islamic tradition? In order to answer these questions, students read a variety of primary sources from influential Muslim thinkers as well as contemporary scholarship on the Islamist and modernist movements. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: One course in RELG or MIST Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 331 - The Problem of Evil </P><P>Why do bad things happen to good people?

Most of the course focuses on liberation theologies, with their emphasis on hope, empowerment, and right relationships. Voices of liberation theologians may be drawn from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, as well as marginalized people in the United States. The latter include womanist, mujerista, Latino/a, Asian-American, African-American, Jewish, homosexual, and feminist groups; most integrate personal experience with theological reflection. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 335 - Religion in the Genetic Age </P><P>Twenty-first century genetic technologies present humanity with unprecedented possibilities for re-engineering human life and experience: genetic tailoring to treat and eradicate diseases, the creation of designer children, cyberconsciousness and unlimited physical prowess, radical life-extension technologies, and the development of virtual human beings. Scientific tinkering with food DNA heightens interest in &quot;Frankenfoods," while genetic tinkering with animals has raised the spectre of &quot;Frankenbeasts.&quot; The course foregrounds issues in the science of genetics and genethics—the social, ethical, legal, and, in this course, the notably religious implications of modern genomic and technological development - with an assessment of the promise and perils of these achievements for the future of humankind. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 336 - Religion and Capitalism </P><P>&quot;Christianity is freedom.

The course will investigate how worldviews and religious teachings order a lifestyle and a value system that inform and influence a particular economic activity. The course includes: what capitalism is (i.e., its elements and types, and the classical theories of capitalism); investigate the religious views, the cultural and social history that gave rise to capitalism, and the intellectual and economic innovations that turned capitalism into a system. Topics of discussions will include: capitalism and the environment, poverty and the Puritan work ethic, culture and global capitalism, capitalism and moral values, and the relation between contemporary spirituality and capitalism. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 338 - Sex, Law, and the American Culture Wars </P><P>Explores the American church-state debate through the lens of abortion, contraception, and same-sex marriage. These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's &quot;culture wars&quot; in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 </P><P>Crosslisted: POSC 338 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 339 - Modern Jewish Philosophy </P><P>A course on European and American Jewish thought, covering a spectrum of liberal and traditional figures. The course studies the ways in which Jewish thinkers have responded to the challenges of modern philosophy, religious pluralism, and feminism. Modern reformulations of traditional Jewish ideas and religious practices are discussed as well as contemporary theological exchanges between Jews and Christians. Readings are taken from such figures as Mendelssohn, Buber, Rosenzweig, Heschel, Fackenheim, and Plaskow. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 339 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Recommended: Previous courses in the Jewish tradition and/or philosophy are recommended.

Most of us would assert that we do, but what do we mean when we make this claim? Are we referring to the political separation of church and state, to a decline in religious beliefs and practices, or to something else? These questions have recently come to occupy a central place within the study of religion. This course explores the topic of secularism from a variety of angles, including differing notions of what is meant by the term &quot;secular&quot;; an examination of the historical development of secular ideas and institutions; a comparison of different secular political projects; and a series of important critiques of secularism. This course encourages students to think critically and creatively about the relationship between &quot;the religious&quot; and &quot;the secular,&quot; and it thus enhances students' understanding of religion, secularism, and modernity more broadly. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 343 - Gender and Judaism </P><P>Focused on the creation and conception of gender within Judaism. Students explore the ways in which gender is built into the scriptures, structures, institutions, and ideologies of Judaism, into Jewish religious, cultural and social life. According to Genesis, from the beginning there were male and female. To what degree are these two categories essential? To what degree artificial? How do religion and tradition enforce the gender divide, and in what ways can they be used to blur the distinctions between male and female? </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: JWST 343  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 345 - Religion and Human Rights </P><P>What is the relationship between religion and human rights?

This course explores the complex relationship between religion and human rights from a variety of perspectives: theological, philosophical, sociological, and legal-political. Students will examine some of today's most prominent voices on this topic, and will explore a variety of case studies involving both positive and negative interactions between religion and human rights. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of religion or human rights law. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>RELG 346 - Cognitive Science of Religion </P><P>Central to much research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is the question of how the human brain and its evolved capacities inform and constrain the transmission of religious beliefs and ritual practices. The cognitive science of religion also seeks to answer why it is that certain beliefs and specific practices appear to outperform and outlive others. More generally, the CSR seeks to explain the persistence and pervasiveness of religious beliefs and practices throughout human history by drawing on the theories and methodologies of a range of disciplines, including cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, behavioral ecology, and several others, as well as disciplines more traditionally associated with the study of religion. Scholars in CSR embrace a variety of methods, including textual analysis, quantification of historical and archaeological data, statistical analysis of ethnographic data, controlled laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling. This course is a survey of the most influential of the CSR theories and methods in the field. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>RELG 352 - Theory and Method in the Study of Religion </P><P>Takes a critical look at the history of religious studies in the modern West and proceeds to chart some contemporary developments.

Russia's modern wars have been particularly (although certainly not uniquely) traumatic, with profound impacts on government and citizen alike. The course examines the ways in which the events leading up to war, wartime conditions, and eyewitness accounts were recorded and internalized by citizens and managed by an autocratic state to create collective historical understandings of events. By analyzing the changing ways in which social hierarchy, gender and exclusivity have been structured during and in the aftermath of war, the course offers an important guide to understanding the emergence of ethno-nationalism in one of the world's largest and longestlasting multi-ethnic Empires. </P><P>Credits: 1 Crosslisted: HIST 245 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>REST 250 - Cyborgs, Unite! Sci-Fi for Post-Humans </P><P>Introduces students to a wide range of science fiction literature and film from the 20th century to the present day, with a strong emphasis on works from Russia, the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe. This region offers some of the most sophisticated works of science fiction, owing to the radical &quot;otherness&quot; of its philosophical and political traditions and the challenges it offers to dominant Western constructions of self, nature, and society. Focusing on philosophical, ethical, and environmental questions, students will discuss such topics as human-machine interfaces and ethics, life-extension and transhumanism, space travel and colonization, and the prospects and perils of the rationally-planned society. Course readings are in English. No prior experience in Russian studies required. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>REST 253 - Lust, Murder, Redemption </P><P>Written by an educated elite, eerily self-conscious because of czarist censorship and political repression, 19th-century Russian literature nevertheless confronts many of the crucial concerns of human existence. It often focuses upon characters who are at an existential breaking point because of ideological, spiritual, sexual, or economic pressures. Students read a combination of short stories and novels, concentrating upon canonical &quot;greats&quot; (Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov) but also sampling lesser-known writers, including neglected female authors. By examining literary depictions of such social institutions as warfare, dueling and gambling, courtship and marriage, adultery and spousal abuse, work and leisure, the course emphasizes the relationship between literary text and cultural context. Particular attention is paid to the cultural construction of gender, as well as the relationship between humans and nature. A range of theoretical and critical texts informs discussions, as do film adaptations of certain works. All works are read in translation, but a FLAC section of the course may be offered for advanced Russian language students who are interested in trying to read selections in the original Russian. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>REST 254 - Hope and Reality, Delusion and Dissent: Story-telling in the age of Communism, Nazism and Exile </P><P>Examines life under Communism as distilled through the fiction of Russian, East European, and Jewish writers who experienced it firsthand. Students follow the intertwining of political and private life from the inception of a new regime, with many people exuberantly hopeful, through the various stages of acquiescence, resistance, escape, and sometimes death.

Beginning with the idealists, nihilists, and terrorists determined to bring the Russian monarchy to an end in the 19th century, students explore history, politics, and culture through a range of genres and media--from the 19th-century Russian realist novel, the political manifesto, the avant-garde film, revolutionary poetry, to the works of seminal historians who have shaped how we &quot;read&quot; the Russian revolution today. Is the revolution over, so to speak? Are we ever finished with an historical event of such monumental consequence?

Rapid biophysical change occurs here today due to climate change, but equally noteworthy are cultural, social, and political transformations experienced by people living and working in the Arctic. People are under increasing pressure to change along with transformation of their biophysical environments, particularly as new actors express interest in the Arctic as space opening up to global transportation, mineral exploration, and trade and ecotourism. Within geography, interest in Arctic phenomena includes grappling with complex issues related to social and biophysical changes in this region, which often originate beyond the region but have specific meaning for the regions. Students investigate three vibrant areas of Arctic transformation: cultural transformation occurring among indigenous and local peoples, biological and physical transformation of the environment, and political transformation within and related to the region. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: GEOG 323  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>REST 333 - Human Rights in Russia and Eurasia </P><P>Addresses human rights in Russia and Eurasia. Begins by comparing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the Soviet Union's conceptualization of citizen rights and builds from there to understand current issues and concerns regarding rights in this world region. Part 1 provides an historical understanding of how human rights were envisioned and practiced in the Soviet era. Part 2 explores how human rights conceptualizations changed when the Soviet Union and Russia engaged openly with the West during perestroika and the 1990s. Parts 3 and 4 investigate the continuing legacy of authoritarianism in this region and what this suggests for individual (Part 3) and societal (Part 4) rights. A mixture of lecture and discussion assumes timely completion of readings and assignments to participate in small- and large-group class discussions throughout the semester. The final project asks students to develop a country profile to examine one human rights concern in one of the fifteen post-Soviet republics. Final student presentations place human rights in Russia and Eurasia in historical, cultural, and spatial contexts to understand how they are linked by shared histories and enduring entangled futures. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>REST 343 - The Formation of the Russian Empire </P><P>A study of politics and society in the Russian lands from Kiev to Alexander I.

Students examine the rise of Russian power and prestige under Vladimir Putin and his centralizing innovations to strengthen political and economic institutions. The course also considers dissent and protest movements, the national conflicts with internal minorities, as in Chechnya, and projection of power over the post-Soviet &quot;Near Abroad&quot; and the construction of a corporatist-style system that presents new challenges to the global dominance of ideas about democracy and capitalism. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: POSC 359 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>REST 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>REST 395 - Advanced-Level Russian Language Abroad </P><P>Advanced-level language courses taken abroad with a Colgate study group, an approved program, or in a foreign institution of higher learning. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>REST 412 - Senior Seminar </P><P>In this seminar students explore the theoretical, methodological, and linguistic challenges that underlie serious research in Russian and Eurasian studies.

Narratives are the stories we learn, share, and retell that help us understand the world and our place in it. Meanings include the embedded assumptions and values that we assign to social situations and encounters. Identities are often given to us through social structures but are also intensely personal and provide ways for us to cultivate a sense of self. Students explore narratives, meanings, and identities by learning and practicing qualitative research techniques such as interviews, oral histories, content analysis, and observation. Qualitative data analysis software is used to plan, organize, and analyze the research, and students gain hands-on experience in all stages of the qualitative research process. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-Year Recommended: SOCI 101 Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 216 - Sociology of War </P><P>An examination of the impact of modern global warfare on societies across the world, seeking to understand how modern wars led to unprecedentedly brutal and technologically advanced forms of mass killing, but also have paradoxically accelerated innovation and weakened social inequality.

This course deals with these trends in a number of major countries (including the US, UK, Germany and India), examining the various sociological approaches that attempt to explain these movements through analyses of economic change, cultural change, and racial/ethnic ideologies. Centrally, students are asked whether or not there are parallels or continuities between these movements and the historical Fascism of the 1919-1945 period. Students will consider the major theoretical approaches to the study of Fascism and Populism in the sociological literature and survey some key examples of historical Fascist regimes and movements. Students will also study movements, both in the present and the past, which have attempted to oppose right wing extremism, asking whether they comprise a coherent political tradition. </P><P>Credits: 1 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior </P><P>Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics </P><P>The words &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;the environment&quot; conjure up visions of wild animals and open landscapes, but are people part of nature, too?

Through a series of case studies, students explore this relationship, focusing especially on the way that nature and culture are &quot;political&quot;: inequalities, social problems and movements, and power relations all flow from the way that we interact with our environment. Takes a global, comparative, and historical view of this process, and includes the following special topics: the rise of environmental awareness and environmental social movements; globalization and environmental values; consumption and the environment; environmental inequalities and justice; risk, technology, and environmental politics; and public policy and the environment. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ANTH 245  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 250 - Sociological Research Design and Methods </P><P>Introduces students to both the dominant areas of inquiry in sociology and the methods that have been devised to investigate them.

Students employ several levels of analysis: social history, social interaction, work roles, organizations, organizational relationships, and social policy. The framework for this course is that of social organization to show that the social organization of a society influences, to some degree, the type and distribution of disease, illness, and death found in that society. The social organization of a society also influences, to a significant degree, how the system of medical care responds. The values and assumptions underlying the medical definition of health are not necessarily the same as those underlying the sociological definition of health. A focus of the course is to examine race, class, and gender issues that influence the delivery of healthcare in this country. Attention is given to such topics as social epidemiology, the social demography of health, social stress, and illness behavior. Students also review the sick role, doctor-patient interaction, medical health professionals, hospitals and other health care agencies, and the healthcare delivery system in the United States and other countries. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 326 - Nations and Nationalism </P><P>Nationalism is on the rise in the United Kingdom and the United States again, as well as in China, Russia, and elsewhere.

Individuals live their lives within socio-historical contexts and age-based frameworks. It is this framework that orders transitions between the various stages of life, constructs the various roles that individuals occupy over the course of their lives, and provides the set of historical conditions, ideas, and institutions by which individuals give meaning to their existence. Human lives are characterized by both continuity and change, and each human must negotiate the path of his or her life through a web of institutional networks. These pre-existing frameworks through which individuals travel are subject to the constraints of the past but are also open to possibilities created by each new generation. Understanding this complex relationship can not only broaden our notion of what it means to be human, but take our humanity to new heights as well. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 333L - Sociology of the Life Course Field Component/Lab </P><P>This community-based learning &quot;field&quot; component, offered on an irregular basis, is an add-on to SOCI 333.

Students examine death from the perspective of US- based health-care professionals, family members, institutions, the funeral industry, and the dying themselves. In so doing, students discuss who has access to &quot;a good death,&quot; ethical issues in how death is defined, how these realities are shaped by structural inequalities, and policy suggestions for the future. Initially, students focus on intersections between death and dying, COVID-19, race, gender, and age. From there the course readings expand out to biographical, journalistic and social science sources to explore cross-cultural rituals of death, dying, and grieving.Students visit (in some cases, virtually) a hospice home for the dying and/or a funeral home, and a local cemetery, participate in a Death Café, and explore writing their own obituaries.

Students examine the phenomenon of globalization from a variety of theoretical perspectives, ranging from neo-liberal economics to cultural anthropology. They analyzes how each of these works defines the causes of globalization and its effects on traditional cultures, community relationships, economic wealth and justice, and political institutions. To put these theoretical works in perspective, interspersed with them are actual case studies of real people and real communities, ranging from Costa Rican farmers to Thai factory workers, interacting with the forces of globalization. These case studies allow students to test the abstract analyses and see which theories fit reality. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ANTH 337  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>SOCI 340 - Work and Society </P><P>This study of the organization of work in industrialized societies includes the following topics: technology and work; hierarchy and control in the workplace; women, minorities, and work; worker discontent; and the professionalization of work.

This course views popular culture as an essential site in the cultural politics of America that involves the formation of ideas, identities, pleasures, and even desires. A central element in this cultural politics is the contested nature of American identity as well as the contested nature of social identities based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality, etc. Students also read theoretical texts that place popular culture and mass media in their social, economic, and political contexts. From conflicts over high art and popular art, to leisure and social class, to race and ethnicity, to film and the spectacle, to gender and the family, to sexuality and deviance, to cultural appropriation, students explore the rich, complex, and fraught history of American popular culture over the last 150 years. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 or FMST 200  Major/Minor Restrictions: Only Sociology &amp; Anthropology, Sociology, Film &amp; Media Studies Majors and Minors Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 355 - Culture, Class, Politics: Social Theory </P><P>Charts the development of social theory since the classical social theorists, with a particular focus on how critical social thinkers have understood inequality and forms of social power. Students give special attention to the relationship between social thought and its historical-political context, and notably its relationship to labor and anti-colonial movements and the &quot;new social movements.&quot;  Central themes include the problems of the idea of &quot;culture&quot;; how much an understanding of &quot;class&quot; can or cannot explain; and the status of notions of ideology, discourse, and materialism in contemporary social thought. Theorists who work may be covered include Gramsci, Norbert Elias, Karl Polanyi, C.

Considers questions such as: What leads to social movement? What do social movements do? What are the tools they use? The approach is historical and comparative. Students consider what social movements can tell us about society, and apply key sociological concepts to considerations of collective action. Students consider the building blocks of social movements from the perspective of a social movement participant, exercising the notion of 'sociological competence.' By studying social movements through the perspectives of both scholar and activist, students gain helpful tools for collective action and social change. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 or WMST 202  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 367 - Sociology of Gender </P><P>Drawing on theoretical and empirical research, as well as visual media and print news reporting, students explore gender as a primary market of social inequality in our society and a major impetus for social change. Specifically, students analyze how gendered ideologies, practices, and contexts shape social institutions such as work, family, medicine, sport, military, religion, and the beauty industry. They examine how institutions and bodies become contested sites for gender and sexual politics. Students also pays close attention to how gendered ideologies work in tandem with race, class, and sexual expectations, constraining (and sometimes enabling) bodies and lives.

The past 50 years, however, have seen the bourgeoning of an exciting body of critical theory on the quotidian. Much of this work is concerned with profound questions about how the systems, structures, and practices of modernity shape basic human interactions with things, with places, and with other persons, and how these, in turn, reproduce social structures. This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ANTH 378  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: SOCI 201 or SOCI 250 Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No First-year </P><P>Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>SOCI 453 - Senior Seminar in Sociology </P><P>In this capstone seminar for the sociology major, students conduct original sociological research on the topics of their choice.

It focuses on the external history (i.e., cultural, social, historical, and political factors that contributed to the evolution of Spanish from Latin to early romance, and then to the modern language), as well as the internal linguistic changes (i.e., changes in sounds, word formation, sentence structure, and vocabulary). These external and internal developments are considered within the context of linguistic diversity of pre-modern Iberia. Special attention is paid to historical explanations of &quot;irregularities&quot; found in modern Spanish. Therefore, the course is of interest to students who wish to improve their understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the Spanish language.

Students explore gender through a variety of frameworks, and in tandem with race, ethnicity, class, religion, sexuality, and other markers of identity. By enrolling in WMST 202, students agree to engage in an interdisciplinary and transnational journey that investigates gender as ever-evolving, cultural, sociohistorical, and differentially read and experienced in varying contexts. Students develop the language and analytical tools to speak and think critically about oppression, patriarchy, and social change, to unlearn common assumptions about the world and people around us. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>WMST 205 - Queer Latina Visualities: Art, Theory, and Resistance </P><P>An introduction to queer Latina art as a field of interdisciplinary feminist inquiry, with a focus on art by Chicana, Xicana, Indigenous, Central American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban artists. Students examine the synergetic relation between queer Latina feminist art, theory, and resistance. Students learn how queer Latina visualities are shaped by historical, social, and political forces - like colonialism, racism, and globalization - and how queer Latina artists, in turn, act upon and shape the social world. Students investigate queer Chicana/Latina feminist texts, asking how artists challenge existing power dynamics and embody decolonial knowledge. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 217 - Corridors of Black Girlhood </P><P>An introduction to the emergent field of Black Girlhood Studies. An interdisciplinary journey, it engages theories, methods, and analytical approaches that recognize the power and potential of Black girlhood. Through interpretive and pragmatic inquiry of Black girls' lives, students will develop and enact an intersectional approach to interrogate the ways power, systems of oppression, and culture mediate girlhood. To expose discrepancies in popularized narratives of Black girls and women in the United States, the course is organized around the tenet of celebration and other foundational concepts and scholars within the field. Drawing on theories and concepts derived from Black feminist thought, budding scholars will approach Black girlhood as a political category of identity and symbol of agency. Working within and beyond hip-hop feminist and womanist frameworks, learning will involve critical thinking and embodiment of theories and practices as produced by Black girls, artists, and scholars. With attention to knowledge and creativity engendered amidst legacies of anti-Black racism and racialized femininity, Corridors of Black Girlhood reveals the contributions of Black girls, girlhood, and Black feminist thought to the expansion of theory, praxis, and power analyses. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Crosslisted: ALST 217  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 260 - Intersectionality in Theory and Practice </P><P>Traces an intellectual genealogy of intersectionality's emergence as one the most significant theories coming out of feminist scholarship. In our present, intersectionality has become axiomatic insofar as multiple discourses both inside and outside of academia demand that all feminism be intersectional. Yet the history of intersectionality's emergence from black women's lived experience is often rendered opaque. Intersectionality as a feminist theory is one response to the often-forgotten Sojourner Truth question and demand &quot;Ain't I a woman?&quot; that causes problems for feminist's attempts to reconcile questions of difference and exclusion in feminist scholarship and activism. Hence, students will explore the historical conditions that produce intersectionality by interrogating the very question of black women's relationship to the category of woman. And, more broadly, students will discuss the various ways feminist respond to questions of difference, inclusion, and exclusion in feminist social and political worlds. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 </P><P>Prerequisites: Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents </P><P>WMST 279 - Black Feminist Thinkers </P><P>An interdisciplinary journey into historical and emergent intellectual contributions engendered from navigating, refusing, and subverting systemic gendered oppression. As an homage to the distinct and layered legacy of Black feminist thought, students will learn concepts (i.e., interlocking systems of oppression, misogynoir), methodological tools (i.e., outsider within, blended scripting), and practice/organizing orientations (i.e., interdependence, homegirling). With a focus on contributions from the late 20th and 21st century, students historicize contemporary conversations by tracing conceptual and pragmatic topics back to key historical developments of Black feminist thought. Black feminists have always sought to understand how Black sexualities have been used to maintain gender and racial hierarchies. Such scholarship is the foundation of Queer of Color Critique and Black queer and sexuality studies. At the end of the course, students will have explored and had discussions about counter-hegemonic concepts, practices, and theory at the heart of Black women's embodiment, labor, and creativity. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 301 - Feminist Methodologies: Theory and Praxis </P><P>Is there a distinct feminist method of conducting research?

Students will investigate the complexities of the U.S. carceral state while unearthing the harsh realities that Black girls and women endured as they faced a system that criminalized their race, gender, and social status. Students will further investigate the historical nature of African American girls and women's lived experiences, both within and right outside of a criminal justice system that, in many ways, has worked to criminalized their very being. This course is meant to illustrate that African American girls and women have not had one singular experience within the criminal justice system while illustrating that their experiences differed over time and across lines of age, class, regional, organizational, and sexual orientation. Students will consider multiple issues that African American girls and women have faced while confined, both physical and mentally, by the United States penal system including their struggle for freedom, the exploitation of their labor, physical and mental abuse within the penal system, their personal practices of self-salvation, family life and love relationships, and their ongoing efforts to not only denounce the prison industrial complex while pushing for the abolition of carceral state. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: ALST 312  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations, Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 339 - Critical and Feminist Disability Studies </P><P>Students consider (dis)ability as a gendered, racialized, and classed category of difference. Students discuss how dominant cultural, scientific, and educational understandings of the body/mind construct the boundaries of normalcy and determine the material conditions of our lives. Students look at how different aspects of a person's identity – their ability, their gender, their race, their sexuality, their class – intersect to position them as citizens or non-citizens, members or threats to the future of the family and the nation. Students are introduced to the theoretical, analytical, and methodological tools of feminist disability studies, and the emerging field of DisCrit (Disability studies and Critical Race Theory). Using these theoretical and analytic tools, students look to the ways that activists, artists, and scholars have re-imagined the disabled body/mind as a complex identity. </P><P>Credits: 1 Crosslisted: EDUC 339 Prerequisites: EDUC 101 or WMST 202  Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WMST 490 - Women's Studies Senior Seminar </P><P>The course is taught by the members of the women's studies faculty, and the content of the course takes a different shape depending on the instructor.

These arts numbered seven in the medieval curriculum, the language arts--grammar, logic, and rhetoric--constituting the first three or trivium. While the trivium has all but disappeared in today's college curriculum, increasingly scholars across the disciplines are discovering the integral role rhetoric plays in equipping citizens for effective participation in a democracy. Drawing upon the liberal arts tradition, the aim is to cultivate students' capacity for eloquence through inquiry. To foster this human impulse to inquire, students will engage in a number of inquiry projects that will ask them to reflect on their personal experiences, to analyze the forces that shaped those experiences, and to look critically at the way that social and cultural identity is formed. In conjunction with the three inquiry projects, students engage in an intense amount of work on rhetorical invention (the discovery of ideas for writing), composing a workable draft, reading and revising the draft, and rereading and editing it for fluency in grammar, punctuation, and style. The course fulfills the writing requirement. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 103 - Rhetoric and Writing </P><P>Teaches the basic elements of college writing, strategies for reading and effective note-taking, the discovery and development of ideas, thesis development, organization and coherence, and editing skills.

Students engage in analytic essays and research projects within the discipline of rhetoric, developing facility with analytic habits of mind, discursive moves typical in academic writing, and the construction of clear, complex, and logical arguments about civic discourse. The course focuses on several essential elements of college writing and research: strategies for active analytic reading and effective note taking; compiling and critical reading of research sources; the discovery and development of a strong thesis supported by persuasive evidence; the skills of summary, definition, analysis, interpretation, and synthesis; organization and coherence; revision processes; and editing skills.

Both academic and popular sources are analyzed for their use of evidence, the presence of logical appeals, and their use of rhetorical devices. Special attention is paid to problems arising from more complex critical analysis, such as appropriate ways to treat conflicting sources, detecting the biases in both primary and secondary source material, and examining the biases of the student's own arguments. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 210 - The Rhetoric of Style </P><P>In ancient Greece and Rome, teachers of rhetoric taught style (L. elocutio) as one of five essential canons, or considerations, for effective language use. Students study how the stylistic choices of non-fiction writers can affect readers' reception and interpretation of texts. With the goal of improving the clarity and power of their own writing, students closely analyze published authors' diction, syntactical structures, punctuation, and figures of speech. Students also study conventions of mechanics and usage to make increasingly conscious, informed choices regarding varieties of English and levels of formality across genres. Readings include writing by James Baldwin, Judith Ortiz Cofer, Brian Doyle, Chang-Rae Lee, Nancy Mairs, and Brent Staples. Writing assignments include homework exercises and peer reviews, as well as three essays composed and revised for a Final Portfolio.

This course fuses theory to praxis in introducing students to basic public speaking skills, including researching, organization, and writing effective oral presentations; developing skills of critical listening and audience analysis; surveying key examples of public address; and providing students the opportunity to work in different speech situations. Students develop poise and self-confidence in public speaking as they deepen their understanding of the evolving aesthetics of public discourse in the context of new media and global cultures.

How does the combination of verbal and visual elements communicate different arguments to different audiences? How do verbal/visual texts reflect or even create cultural identities, norms, values, and practices? With the goal of becoming effective rhetorical critics, as well as incisive consumers and producers of visual culture, students both study and create a variety of visual texts. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: FMST 225  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 231 - Ethos and the Personal Essay </P><P>By exploring the boundary between private and public writing, students examine how personal reflection intersects with critical analysis to develop a disciplined expository essay.

At its root, the word &quot;essay&quot; means &quot;inquiry&quot; from the Latin exagere, &quot;to weigh, try, prove, measure, adjust, ascertain, examine, inquire into.&quot; A central premise for this course, then, is that every narrative - every story - inquires into experiences and ideas, and that writers compose not just what they know but in order to know. Thus, students are asked to mediate the subjective and objective positions of what Roland Barthes terms the &quot;writerly&quot; text in an effort to invite readers to see anew and to read and experience stories through aural and visual media. </P><P>Credits: 1.0 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 242 - Stand and Speak: Feminist Rhetorics and Social Change </P><P>As an introduction to rhetoric, rhetorical history and criticism, and feminist rhetorics, this course fore-grounds the study of how 19th-century women used both pen and voice with rhetorical precision to &quot;stand and speak&quot; to issues that marked their personal lives and their times. By studying women who composed and embodied what is now understood as the early years of the first wave of U.S. feminism, students access a genealogy of women rhectors who serve as exemplars -and cautions - for later waves and for their own contemporary visions of social change. By positioning the study of rhetoric as the study of language as it constitutes social relations, power, and knowledge, students become more acutely aware of and fluent in the composition, circulation, and criticism of private and public discourses, the verbal material through which they construct social worlds. The work for this course requires close reading and active discussion of course texts through a rhetorical lens and through the category of gender. This course does not meet the writing requirement. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>WRIT 248 - Discourses of Race and Racism </P><P>Until the late 17th century in Europe, nobody thought to classify or divide the people of the world by race. With no basis in biology, race is a purely social construct existing only in thought and language. Accordingly, this course will consider the many different social discourses of race and racism, how they have evolved in different ways around the globe and how they are employed today in multiple trans-national contexts. The course will adopt a multidisciplinary approach, examining a variety of texts from different intellectual perspectives. </P><P>Credits: 1 </P><P>Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>WRIT 250 - Kairos: The Art of Rhetoric from Ancient to Modern Times </P><P>Rhetoric--the effective use of language to persuade a given audience--is as old as human speech itself. Yet attuned as they were to &quot;kairos,&quot; the opportune time of a fledgling democracy in Athens, the ancient Greeks were perhaps the first to codify rhetorical practice as an art. This is a course about time, about the art of rhetoric as a most effective medium of change at the right time. Students see this when rhetoric served as a vehicle for change in 5th-century Greece, when it equipped individuals to write and preach to effect change in the so-called dark ages, and when it gave women and former slaves the voice to change attitudes and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students survey the entire history of western rhetoric from the earliest treatises to the most recent theories. In addition to examining this history through a close reading of canonical texts, students come to know the rhetorical tradition through experience, by engaging in the very practices (e.g., medieval preaching and letter writing, and 18th-century exercises in elocution) associated with rhetoric in a particular historical period. The many rhetorical terms, concepts, principles, and practices covered in the course provide students the proper background for further study in the more specialized areas of rhetoric. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 260 - Biblical Rhetoric </P><P>Examines the various ways that writers and speakers draw on the Bible for rhetorical force. Many of the works that call on the Bible for inspiration are not of a religious nature at all, raising questions about the nature of biblical style. Readings range from the Venerable Bede and Queen Elizabeth I to Bob Marley and Douglas Rushkoff, in addition to source material from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. No previous knowledge of the Bible is needed. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 280 - Rhetorical &quot;Borderlands&quot;: Introduction to Comparative Intercultural Rhetoric </P><P>By taking a transnational comparative perspective, this course introduces students to several key questions in comparative and intercultural rhetoric, from the most basic question of &quot;How does culture shape language, and how does language, in turn, shape culture?&quot; to more complicated questions: How do cross-border and cross-cultural engagements constrain and influence rhetorical practices and interactions? How do cultural logics, values, and assumptions hierarchically govern different geo-political spaces? In what ways have individuals and groups both conformed to and resisted discursive structures of power and privilege? And finally, in what ways can comparative and intercultural study sharpen our own critical insights about and rhetorical agency within such dominant structures? This course will address these questions and others as students work to develop and strengthen skills in critical analysis, research, and reflective practices through the lens of transnational comparative intercultural rhetoric. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 291 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 303 - The Rhetoric of Data Visualization &amp; Infographics </P><P>Our world is increasingly visual; more and more of the information we consume and produce is presented in images. This course focuses on the visual presentation of numerical information — everything from box-andwhisker plots to flashy infographics — and specifically how such information can effectively persuade its readers. Emphasis will be on both analyzing and making visualizations; there will be no attention to data collection or analysis. Students can expect to improve their visual literacy skills. No facility with statistics or software packages is required. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: FMST 303  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 325 - The Narrative in New Media </P><P>Students will explore the ways in which innovations in media have changed the shape of narrative and textuality. People often assume that new media is a 20th-century development, but this course will be a more historicized view; the printing press, after all, changed media more fundamentally than anything since. </P><P>Starting with a foundation of media theory and narrative theory, the course will then work through the ages: printing; newspapers; color printing; radio; television; electronic fiction; fan fiction; hypertext; remix aesthetics; and video games. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: FMST 325  Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None Formerly: WRIT 222 </P><P>WRIT 342 - Rhetoric in Black and White: Communication and Culture in Conflict </P><P>In the nearly 400-year history of social relations between Blacks and Whites in America, rhetoric has often failed. Civil war, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, and Black Power were all actions or movements that ensued largely because words fell short of persuading persons of good will to submit to reasoned arguments. Arguably a pillar of American democracy (as in the freedom to speak and to dissent), why has rhetoric been so seemingly ineffective in securing mutual respect and understanding between America's Black and White citizens? This course seeks to answer this question by closely examining the styles of communication that historically have shaped the cultural identities and public personas of the two groups. From slave speech to the languages of protest in the 1960s to verbal expression in rap music and social media today, the course considers why communication or dialogue involving race is often doomed to fail. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 345 - Crafting Bodies: Movement, Gender, and Performance </P><P>This class engages with recent developments in the field of rhetoric to consider how persuasion and meaning making are impacted by movement, gender, and performance. To this end, the course will introduce students to the dominant conversations, theories, and methods for studying embodiment within rhetoric and related fields. Students will apply these ideas to case studies from sports, dance, popular culture, politics, and law to better understand how dominant narratives constrain or enable certain types of bodily behavior. Through this theoretical and practical study, students will become critically aware of the intersections of bodies and their representations and how these intersections influence our capacity for engaged deliberation and social action </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 346 - Hip Hop: Race, Sex, and the Struggle in Urban America </P><P>Examines the ways in which language has reinforced racial and ethnic identities and divisions in post-Civil Rights America. Explores the conceptual origins of race, ethnicity, and other categories of difference, particularly those produced through legal, political, socioeconomic, and humanistic discourses. Recognizing that the United States is not just a multicultural society but a multilingual one, students investigate how urban American youth have &quot;talked back&quot; to power and seized the power to name. Focuses in particular on uses of the Hip Hop vernacular by urban Latin Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and white Americans to give voice to their reality and the urban struggle. Students also trace the causes and consequences of historical silences, as suggested by Martin Luther King's dictum: &quot;A riot is the language of the unheard." </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 348 - Discourses of Whiteness </P><P>Claims that whiteness--white racial identity--is more about language than biology. Whiteness is a rhetorical construct that exists only in discourse, yet its concrete effects impact societies all over the globe. Drawing on texts from around the world, students trace the evolution of this construct from its inception up to the present day, examining the rhetorical strategies whereby whiteness is both hidden and revealed in a variety of genres: personal memoirs, philosophical essays, scientific investigations, political writings, legal documents, critical analyses, historical essays, and such mass media as television, film, newspapers, and magazines. By engaging in the rhetorical analysis of these texts, students examine how the discourses of whiteness continue to frame reality and mediate power relations. A required evening film series accompanying the class has students viewing, discussing, and analyzing feature films, documentary films, and television shows. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: WRIT 348L  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>WRIT 348L - Required Film Screening </P><P>Required corequisite to WRIT 348. </P><P>Credits: 0.00 Corequisite: WRIT 348  Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 350 - Rhetoric &amp; Citizenship </P><P>To engage students in both the analysis and production of public discourse through examining the rhetoric of citizenship. It is through the language and symbols of citizenship that individuals come to understand themselves as political subjectivities and engage with others as democratic agents. Students will examine how the meaning of citizenship is shaped and contested through public discourse. Students will analyze debates over citizenship, mainly in the context of immigration debates in the US and in other parts of the world. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: Global Engagements </P><P>WRIT 354 - Dialogue and Deliberation in Democratic Life </P><P>Public communication is a vital part of democratic life. It is through the circulation and exchange of public speech that citizens shape the contours of public life, build community, and determine their core civic values. More importantly, it is through the work of democratic dialogue that citizens struggle with their inevitable differences and seek to find ways of working together despite those differences. The purpose of this class is to examine both the theory and practice of deliberative democracy, with the aim of better understanding how communities might use dialogue and deliberation to effectively engage across different perspectives. Students are asked to think critically about the possibilities and challenges of democratic dialogue. Students are also trained in facilitation techniques, with the major project for this class providing students an opportunity to facilitate an open forum on a campus-related issue. </P><P>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 391 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>WRIT 491 - Independent Study </P><P>Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. </P><P>Credits: variable Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: None </P><P>Course Information </P><P>Curriculum </P><P>Colgate's curriculum is established around four academic divisions: arts and humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, social sciences, and university studies. Within the departments and programs that make up those divisions, Colgate offers 56 majors, including several interdisciplinary choices, all of which have honors programs. </P><P>Course Designations and Scheduling </P><P>The courses listed in the catalog are currently being offered within departments and programs. Some courses are offered annually and others are offered every other year. Students should consult the course offerings posted online prior to each term by the registrar to identify courses that will be offered in the next term. Classes, laboratories, and seminars meet according to the schedule posted on the course offerings for each term. Students are encouraged to discuss their course schedules and major programs with their faculty advisers or with department chairs or program directors. </P><P>Course Numbering </P><P>Courses are numbered according to level: the 100-level and 200-level courses are primarily for first-year students and sophomores, the 300-level courses for juniors, and 400-level courses for seniors. A prefix of C indicates a course offered as Core Communities, a suffix of C indicates a course offered as Core Communities and Identities, a prefix of S indicates a course offered as Core Sciences, and a suffix of S indicates a course offered as Core Scientific Perspectives on the World. </P><P>Language Courses </P><P>In the foreign and classical languages, courses designated 100 are first-year level, 200 are second-year level, 300 are third-year level, and 400 are advanced level. Students from any class who possess the appropriate background may take any level. Students who have not had third-year level courses at Colgate need faculty permission to take advanced-level courses. </P><P>Two-term Courses </P><P>Departments and programs may offer courses, usually at the 400 level, which extend over two terms. These courses may carry two course credits toward graduation, and may have two course numbers, although a single grade will be assigned at the completion of the second course. Students should register for a two-semester course in sequence, ordinarily the fall and spring term of the senior year. Students successfully completing the fall term course will be temporarily assigned a grade of T (for two-term course). The final permanent grade will be assigned at the end of the second term, when all materials have been evaluated, and the grade of T will be changed to the final grade. </P><P>Abbreviations </P><P>In the descriptions of academic programs and courses, the abbreviations listed below are used: AHUM Arts and Humanities (formerly HUMN) ALST Africana and Latin American Studies ANTH Anthropology ARTS Art and Art History ASIA Asian Studies ASTR Astronomy BIOL Biology CHEM Chemistry CHIN Chinese CLAS Classics CORE Liberal Arts Core Curriculum COSC Computer Science ECON Economics EDUC Educational Studies ENGL English ENST Environmental Studies FMST Film and Media Studies FREN French GEOG Geography GEOL Geology GERM German GPEH Global Public and Environmental Health GREK Greek HEBR Hebrew HIST History HUMN Humanities (as of fall 2016 changed to AHUM) ITAL Italian JAPN Japanese JWST Jewish Studies LATN Latin LCTL Less Commonly Taught Languages LGBT Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies LING Linguistics MATH Mathematics MIST Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies MUSI Music NASC Natural Science NAST Native American Studies NEUR Neuroscience PCON Peace and Conflict Studies PHED Physical Education/Outdoor Education PHIL Philosophy PHYS Physics POSC Political Science PSYC Psychology RELG Religion REST Russian and Eurasian Studies SOCI Sociology SOSC Social Sciences SPAN Spanish THEA Theater UNST University Studies WMST Women's Studies WRIT Writing and Rhetoric </P><P>Faculty Awards and Endowed Professorships </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Faculty Awards </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Endowed Professorships </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Endowed Visiting Professors and Artists </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Endowed Administrative Positions </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Endowed Coaching Positions </LBody></LI></L><P>Faculty Awards </P><P>AAUP Professor-of-the-Year, awarded by the Colgate chapter of the American Association of University Professors to a member of the faculty who has demonstrated (over time) the virtues of insight, integrity, and </P><P>dedication to their professional career; who has shown commitment to the liberal arts and to the academic community at Colgate; and who has worked with notable honesty and courage. </P><P>Jerome Balmuth Award for Teaching, established in 2009 by Mark Siegel '73 in honor of Jerome Balmuth, the Harry Emerson Fosdick Professor of Philosophy and Religion, and awarded for superb teaching of undergraduates by Colgate faculty members. </P><P>Sidney J. and Florence Felten French Prize, awarded annually for excellence in inspirational teaching; it may go to one teacher or to more than one teacher if awarded for inspirational team teaching. </P><P>Howard N.

and Latin American Studies Humphrey </TH></TR></Table><P>Africana and Latin American Studies (ALST) is an interdisciplinary program that studies the histories and cultures, both material and expressive, of the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, and of African American and Latinx communities in the United States. The ALST curriculum centers Black diaspora experiences, Indigenous articulations, and transhemispheric migrations–while engaging historical and ongoing structures of racism and colonialism, and anti-colonial projects of resistance within these contexts. Underpinning our curriculum is the belief that Africans, African Americans, Latin Americans &amp; Latinxs, and the peoples of the Caribbean share historical and political experiences, as well as relationships to Blackness and Indigeneity, that provide rich opportunities for interdisciplinary and comparative studies.  </P><P>The major in Africana and Latin American studies consists of nine courses. There are three required courses: the introductory course (ALST 199); a 300-level course on a major concept, figure, or key knowledge producing community in Black &amp; Latinx Studies (ALST 3XX); and a 400-level capstone seminar (ALST 4XX or UNST 410). Students will choose six electives from across different disciplines according to their intellectual and professional interests. These electives may center on a particular region (i.e., Latin America, Africa, the U.S., or the Caribbean), a set of themes, or a disciplinary approach. All students are encouraged to pursue language and off campus study opportunities relevant to their interests. For majors, a maximum of two courses from a student's second major or minors may be counted for the ALST major, with the approval of the ALST director. </P><P>The minor in Africana and Latin American studies consists of six courses: ALST 199 or ALST 3XX, and five electives from across different disciplines according to the student's intellectual and professional interests. No more than one of these courses may also be counted toward a student's major or another minor. </P><P>Substitution of other appropriate or equivalent courses, independent studies, or special study groups for the degree requirements may be possible, but must be approved by the director of Africana and Latin American Studies. Transfer courses, field study, and one-time-only courses by visiting professors can be credited toward the major or minor only with approval of the program director. A minimum average GPA of 2.00 in the courses chosen to count toward the major or minor in Africana and Latin American studies is required for graduation. </P><P>The relationship between students and their advisor is a vital one, and it is imperative that each major and minor meet with their advisor at least once a semester to assess progress toward meeting graduation requirements. </P><P>More than one Core Communities or Core Communities and Identities course may be counted toward the major or minor, but only one Core course used to meet Liberal Arts Core Curriculum requirements may also be counted toward the major or minor. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Wangari Maathai and Nelson Mandela Award for Excellence in African Studies -- awarded to a graduating senior with the highest grade point average in African studies courses. The award celebrates Wangarĩ Maathai and Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela.  </P><P>Wangarĩ Maathai was a Kenyan educator, environmentalist, and political activist who became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. She was also the founder of the Green Belt Movement, a broad-based grassroots organization, whose main focus is poverty reduction and environmental conservation through tree planting. Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela was a South African lawyer, anti-apartheid activist, and political leader who served as South Africa's first democratically-elected president </P><P>(c. 1994-99). He also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. </P><P>The Pauli Murray Award for Excellence in African American Studies -- awarded to a graduating senior in recognition of their outstanding academic achievements in African American studies courses and their distinction as an ambassador of our program's values. This award celebrates the legal trailblazing, intellectual life, and legacy of Pauli Murray and represents the African American Studies program's commitment to studying the histories, cultures, and traditions of African Americans in the United States and around the world. </P><P>Rev. Pauli Murray, lawyer, author, and women's rights activist-intellectual was the first Black person to earn a Doctorate of the Science of Law degree from Yale Law School, a founder of the National Organization for Women, and the first Black woman to be ordained an Episcopal priest. As a lawyer, Murray was committed to tackling oppression in the law and legal statutes that contributed to the advancement of legislative rights and religious life. Murray's scholarship and service addressed Murray's acute awareness of the inequities on account of race and gender. </P><P>Bartolina Sisa Award for Excellence in Latin American Studies -- awarded to a graduating senior in recognition of their outstanding academic achievements in Latin American studies courses and their distinction as an ambassador of our program's values. </P><P>Bartolina Sisa was an Amayra revolutionary leader who led rebellions against Spanish colonial rule in the Andean region. Today she remains a symbol of anticolonial resistance, indigenous persistence, and the defense of the land and peoples of Latin America. This award celebrates her legacy and represents the Latin American Studies program's commitment to studying the histories, cultures and traditions of the region. </P><P>The 1804 Award for Caribbean Studies is given to a graduating senior in Caribbean Studies who has demonstrated academic excellence and a deep engagement with the program's core values of distinction. </P><P>Upon declaring independence on January 1, 1804, Haiti became the first Black republic in the Western Hemisphere. This date not only marks the end of the long struggle against colonial rule for Haiti; it catalyzed a ripple effect across the Caribbean that would eventually result in the emancipation of millions of enslaved Africans. Today, it remains a potent symbol of the spirit of ongoing resistance and the right to self-determination and to freedom from oppression.  </P><P>The Manning Marable Award for Service -- this award, named after the visionary founder of our program in Africana &amp; Latin American Studies, will be given to a graduating senior who has contributed to the visibility of African-American, African, Caribbean and Latin American cultures on campus, through organizing, event planning, and service. Ideally, the student will have worked to forge alliances across the different components, bringing students together from across the four components and areas of study.  </P><P>Dr. Manning Marable, Colgate University's Africana And Latin American Studies Program (ALST) program's founding director was an esteemed public intellectual, and activist whose work was grounded in, and advanced, the Black Radical Tradition. In scholarship and early works, and culminating with his Pulitzer Prize-winning opus, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention, which was published days after his death, Marable's scholarship and intellectual commitments reflected a commitment to transnational, Afro-diasporic, collaborative democratic thought. Beginning in 1976, Marable had a nationally syndicated column &quot;Along the Color Line&quot; which was printed in dozens of newspapers and was fodder for public radio programs. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Majors may graduate with honors or high honors in Africana and Latin American studies. Qualifications for honors include, at graduation, a minimum overall average of 3.00, a major average of 3.30, and a successful defense before a designated faculty committee of an honors paper or project prepared under the direction of a member of the Africana and Latin American studies faculty. The committee that evaluates the final paper will be identified by the program director in consultation with the student and the student's faculty adviser. Prospective honors students should notify the appropriate coordinators of their intentions by the first week of October of the senior year. A student with a double major in Africana and Latin American studies and a second field may apply for honors in both areas by submitting and defending a paper in each. The paper topics may be related, but the focus and/or content of the two papers must differ substantially. Beyond the requirements for honors, high honors requires a major average of 3.7. High honors projects are usually begun in the fall of the senior year. Students who expect to qualify for honors or high honors should register for ALST 499. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>Study Groups Periodically, the Africana and Latin American Studies Program has sponsored study groups in Africa, Latin America, or the Caribbean under the direction of faculty members associated with the program. Decisions on the awarding of credits are set prior to the consolidation of each study group. See Off-Campus Study for further information about interdisciplinary study groups in Jamaica; Trinidad; and Capetown, South Africa. </P><P>Additionally, the Africana and Latin American Studies Program supports extended study groups to Cuba (ALST 211E) and Ghana (ALST 237E). For more information, see Extended Study. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the ALST program.

Classroom lectures are supplemented by visits to museums in the area and in New York City, as well as Colgate's Clifford Gallery, Picker Art Gallery, and Longyear Museum. In this way, students increase their understanding of the visual arts as expressions of fundamental cultural values. </P><P>Studio Art Courses explore creative modes of expression and problem solving while gaining familiarity with contemporary issues in visual art. The curriculum supports a variety of mediums including digital art, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video art at the introductory and advanced levels. Studio arts courses are enriched by an ongoing series of visiting artists' lectures, exhibitions, and screenings as well as regular visits to New York City galleries, museums, and artists' studios. </P><P>Departmental Exhibitions, Lectures and Screenings </P><P>The Clifford Gallery is a teaching gallery featuring four to six exhibitions a year. Exhibitions are selected by the art and art history faculty to explore issues central to the academic curriculum, with the primary focus on professional work by contemporary artists. These artists are often featured in the weekly public lecture series described below. The Clifford Gallery is open to the entire community and contributes to the cultural life of the central New York area. </P><P>The Department of Art and Art History Lecture Series Lectures take place throughout the semester in Little Hall's Golden Auditorium. The series features presentations by studio artists, art historians, and critics, and serves as an arena for discussion of a wide range of subjects relevant to the study of the visual arts. Recent participants have included art historians and practicing sculptors, painters, film and video makers, printmakers, photographers, architects, and artists working in digital art and performance. The series is required as part of the curriculum and is open to the community. It also serves as a venue for welcoming Colgate graduates back to discuss their work in the visual arts and architecture. </P><P>The Alternative Cinema Series takes place weekly on Tuesday evenings. Tied to the film and video art curriculum, this series is programmed to include films and videos ranging from &quot;classic&quot; cinema to the current avant-garde. Each semester several film/video makers, historians, or curators visit campus and present work in person. </P><P>University Museums </P><P>The Picker Art Gallery This professional gallery maintains the Colgate University collections, including some 11,000 works from a wide range of cultures and historical periods. Although it is not part of the Department of Art and Art History, the Picker Art Gallery provides an important resource to students, faculty, alumni, and friends of Colgate through exhibitions and sponsorship of the Friends of the Visual Arts. </P><P>The Longyear Museum of Anthropology For a full description, please see Sociology and Anthropology. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>Course classifications: </P><P>Studio Arts (SA) Art History (AH) </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>After completing ARTS 475 Senior Project: Art History (AH) or ARTS 406 - Senior Project: Studio Art (SA) in the fall semester, students have the opportunity to apply to continue their work with an honors-eligible project in the spring semester. The award of honors in art and art history is dependent on departmental evaluation. </P><P>The honors-eligible project can be a substantial reworking of the senior project completed in the fall semester of senior year, or a discrete project that meaningfully engages and builds on ideas raised in ARTS 406 or 475. The senior project coordinator will decide on the student's application to continue on to honors-eligible work. Students pursuing honors-eligible work in the spring enroll in an independent study (ARTS </P><P>499) with their senior project adviser. Honors presentations take place at the end of the term and faculty decide whether the project is worthy of honors. Honors will be conferred only on work of outstanding quality. </P><P>GPA Requirements: Honors — 3.20 in courses within the department; High Honors — 3.70 in courses within the department. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Fitchen Award for Excellence in Art and Art History — awarded by the department to an outstanding art and at history major. </P><P>The Harriette Wagner Memorial Award — established in 2004 by Professor Joseph Wagner, created in memory of Harriette Zeppinick Wagner. The award will be given annually to the senior art and art history major whose work exemplifies the way visual arts enrich the spirit and express the dignity of human beings. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>The department allows two courses to be transferred for credit toward the major, with prior approval of the courses by the department. No more than one period requirement may be fulfilled by means of courses transferred and no seminar taken outside Colgate will fulfill the seminar requirement within the art history major. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>Students are encouraged to participate in study groups; they may not schedule off-campus study during the senior year. Study abroad must be scheduled around the seminar requirement in art history or the ARTS 240 or ARTS 243 requirement in studio art. For information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>Architecture Minor </P><P>The Architecture minor offers a program of study in which our undergraduates can become more adept at understanding the power of the built environment to shape lives and embody societal values. </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>The minor includes a minimum of six courses as follows. </P><P>Introductory Course </P></Div><Div><P> ARTS 105 - Introduction to Architecture in Cultural Context (AH) </P><P>Four Courses </P><P>Students may apply to the Architectural Studies Minor Coordinator for permission to integrate one course from outside the ARTS department into their minor concentration, as a substitute for one of the following requirements. </P><P>At least two courses must be focused on the history and theory of architecture from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 220 - Early Modern European Architecture (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 244 - Housing the Sacred in Ancient India (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 273 - Architecture of Art Museums (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 275 - American Campus Architecture (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 277 - Modern Architecture 1880-1970 (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 344 - Hindu Temples: Architecture and Sculpture, Architecture as Sculpture (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 350 - Art and the Goddess </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 357 - Storytelling Without Words (AH) </LBody></LI><LI>No more than two of the four courses may be drawn from those focused on architecture and its interaction with other arts and cultural forms: </LI></L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 207 - Roman Art (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 245 - Palaces and Paintings of India (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 360 - Borderlands (AH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 363 - War and Plunder (AH) </LBody></LI></L><P>Electives </P><P>Complete at least one course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 211 - Drawing (SA) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 263 - Sculpture: Surface and Form (SA) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 264 - Sculpture: Material &amp; Process (SA) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 271 - Architectural Design I (SA) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 274 - Sustainability in Architectural Design (SA) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 312 - Advanced Drawing (SA) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 364 - Advanced Sculpture (SA) </LBody></LI></L><P>Graduate Study Recommendations </P><P>Students anticipating graduate work in architecture should be aware that liberal arts experience is highly valued by the best graduate schools. To prepare for graduate work in architecture, students should take PHYS 105 or PHYS 111 and one semester of calculus. Experience in studio courses, especially drawing (ARTS 211), sculpture (ARTS 263 or ARTS 264), is extremely valuable in the preparation of a graduate portfolio. The study of historical architecture and the ways in which architecture connects to society is promoted in many art courses such as ARTS 207, ARTS 216, ARTS 220, ARTS 226, ARTS 275, ARTS 277, ARTS 344, ARTS 360, and ARTS 372 .

Home to an extraordinary range of linguistic and ethnic groups, this broad and dynamic region is rich in cultural and environmental diversity. Engaging the many changes taking place in Asian societies today requires a similarly diverse set of intellectual skills. To this end, the Asian Studies Program at Colgate integrates scholarly approaches spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences: from literature, art, and religion to history, politics, economics, and geography. The Asian studies major encourages students to undertake their own interdisciplinary explorations of this region. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Area Studies (South and Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Comparative) — awarded by the program to students on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework taken within the major. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>The Asian Studies Program strongly encourages majors to participate in Colgate study groups and in approved programs in India or other locations in Asia. Faculty of the program serve as directors of study-abroad programs in China, Japan, and Korea. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>China Study Group </P><P>Spends approximately four months in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, in intensive language training and firsthand observation of recent cultural, political, and economic changes. </P><P>Japan Study Group </P><P>Based in Kyoto, provides lodging with Japanese families; intensive language training; and instruction in Japanese politics, economics, business, religion, art, linguistics, and literature. </P><P>Korea Study Group </P><P>Hosted by Yonsei University in Seoul, serves the academic needs of students interested in educational studies and Asian studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors in Asian Studies </P><P>Asian studies majors who have GPAs of 3.30 or better in the major and an overall GPA of 3.00 are encouraged to pursue honors study. A candidate for high honors must have a GPA of 3.70 in the major and an overall GPA of 3.00. Each eligible student undertakes a project, the form of which — a written research paper, an exhibition, a performance — is decided in consultation with the student's honors adviser. To qualify for honors, the project must be judged by a committee of two faculty members to be of at least A quality. For high honors the project must be judged by three faculty members from at least two different departments, and in addition the candidate must pass with distinction an oral examination conducted by the three-member committee. Often, the project for honors or high honors is begun on a study group, or during the junior year or fall semester of the senior year, in any 300- or 400-level course or any independent study course. The project is continued through the spring term in ASIA 499 - Special Studies for Honors. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the ASIA program. As an interdisciplinary program, select courses from other departments/programs may also count toward the ASIA major and minor requirements. Use the major/minor links below to find other courses that count toward these requirements.  </P><P>Asian Studies Major </P><P>Asian studies offers students a flexible set of course options to explore Asia widely while focusing upon a specific region of Asia: East Asia (China or Japan), or South and Southeast Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam). </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>Nine courses are required for the major, of which four courses must be at the 300 or 400 level. </P><P>The introductory course may count toward the five courses focused on a single region of Asia. Three other courses should be chosen from the list of Governed Electives (below) and may address any region of Asia. Other courses may also serve as electives for this major if they are at the 300 or 400 level and if at least 40 percent of the course and of the student's work concerns Asia. Students must gain approval from the director of Asian Studies prior to taking these courses for them to count toward the major. </P><P>Majors are strongly encouraged to acquire proficiency in one or more Asian languages, although no more than three language courses at any level may count toward the nine courses required for the major. Normally, the nine courses will include courses from at least two of these three divisions: arts and humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics. </P><P>Students completing two majors (i.e. double-majors) may only count two courses toward both of those majors. </P><P>Major credit will be awarded for no more than two courses taken at another institution. </P><P>Introductory Course </P><P>One introductory course drawn from the following Liberal Arts Core Curriculum courses: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CORE 154C -

Although the majority of majors ultimately pursue careers in the life sciences, a significant number of individuals with other career interests choose the major within the liberal arts context. The department's majors are found today in positions of responsibility in many fields outside the life sciences, including business, theology, law, and the performing arts. Biology majors who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching should refer to Educational Studies. </P><P>Students expecting to attend graduate or professional schools are reminded that these schools frequently recommend or require calculus, statistics, computer science, chemistry (typically through organic), and a year of physics as cognates to the biology major. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Oswald T. Avery Award — awarded by the department in honor of Dr. Oswald T. Avery, who graduated in the class of 1900 and subsequently made major research discoveries in molecular biology at the Rockefeller Institute.

Students choosing this course are encouraged to take CHEM 212 in the spring of their first year, providing an early start into the chemistry major. Exceptionally well-prepared students from other pre-matriculation programs should consult with the department chair regarding advanced standing. </P><P>Students may also receive course credit for an AP score of 4 or 5 or British A-level grade of A or B. Those who enroll in CHEM 111 receive credit for CHEM 101. Students who choose not to take any introductory chemistry courses may receive one credit toward graduation for an AP score of 4 or A-level grade of B (CHEM 101) or two credits for an AP score of 5 or A-level grade of A (CHEM 101 and CHEM 102). The department discourages the latter choice for students who plan to take chemistry courses at the 200 level or higher. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Honors and High Honors in Biochemistry </P><P>Honors in biochemistry may be awarded on the same basis as honors in chemistry (see below), except that a student must have at least an overall GPA of 3.00 and a combined GPA of at least 3.00 in all chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics courses taken. </P><P>Honors and High Honors in Chemistry </P><P>Honors in chemistry may be awarded to majors who accumulate an overall GPA of at least 3.00 and a combined GPA of at least 3.00 in all chemistry, mathematics, and physics courses taken; complete approved honors projects; and present the results of their projects in both a written thesis and an oral defense to the department. The decision to award honors, high honors, or neither is based on the quality of the honors project, the quality of its presentation and defense, and other evidence of distinction. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer students generally receive credit for satisfactorily completed chemistry courses taken at other institutions that correspond to courses at Colgate. The department considers such transfer credits individually, and students should provide information about the courses (syllabi, catalog statements, lab notebooks, textbooks, etc.) to the department chair for consideration. These arrangements should be made well before beginning classes at Colgate. </P><P>Matriculated Colgate students may receive credit for chemistry courses taken at other colleges/universities. Summer courses must meet several criteria established by the department concerning the course content, the length of the course, and the number and length of class and laboratory meetings. Students considering transferring credit to Colgate for a summer chemistry course should obtain a copy of the department's criteria for an acceptable course, discuss the course with the department chair, and receive approval before taking the summer course. Final acceptance of the transfer credit is contingent upon satisfactory performance on a competency exam; the department administers this exam prior to the drop/add period for the fall term immediately following the summer course. </P><P>Other International Exam Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., International Baccalaureate, Abitur) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P><P>Summer Research Opportunities </P><P>Colgate's chemistry department has a rich summer research program and there are numerous summer research opportunities at university, government, and private labs around the country. It is recommended that chemistry and biochemistry majors participate in a full-time research experience before they graduate, in addition to the required year of senior research (CHEM 481/CHEM 482). Students receive stipends, and campus housing is available at reduced rates. </P><P>Recommendations </P><P>Students wishing to earn an American Chemical Society certified bachelor's degree in chemistry are required to take CHEM 212/CHEM 212L, CHEM 353, and two 400-level courses. </P><P>MATH 163 and MATH 214 are recommended for students considering graduate study in physical or theoretical chemistry, physical or theoretical biochemistry, or biophysics. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>Colgate sponsors several off-campus study groups especially appropriate for majors in chemistry and biochemistry, including the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Australia II Study Group at the University of Wollongong </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Bethesda Biomedical Research in Bethesda, Maryland </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Singapore Exchange at the National University of Singapore </LBody></LI></L><P> Wales Study Group at Cardiff University For more information, consult with the department chair and see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>Biochemistry Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The major program consists of the following requirements: </P><P>All of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 182 -

Computer science is a mix of theory, application, design, and experiment. Theory addresses questions about the nature and limits of computation, the abstract properties of machine models, the complexity of algorithms, and the formalization of programming languages. Applications include machine and systems design, the design and implementation of programming languages, artificial intelligence, networks, graphics, and simulation. An important aspect of computer science is the development of methods for the systematic design of large systems in hardware and software. Both applications and theoretical issues must be tested experimentally. </P><P>The computer science major prepares students either for graduate study in computer science or for a variety of professional careers. The computer science minor and the major in computer science/mathematics prepare students for professions in which computer science overlaps significantly with another discipline. COSC 140 provides opportunities for non-majors to learn about computer applications in the liberal arts and to survey, at an introductory level, some topics in computer science. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence — awarded by the department to a student on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework taken within the department. </P><P>The Laura Sanchis Award for Excellence in Research — awarded by the department to a student on the basis of outstanding research performed within the department. </P><P>The Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Computer Science Community — awarded by the department to a student who has made outstanding contributions to the students and faculty in computer science.

The geosciences are a multi-disciplinary effort aimed at understanding the physical and chemical nature of the Earth, the evolution and impact of life on our planet, and how global processes operate now, in the past, and in the future. The Earth and environmental geosciences combine the scientific study of Earth materials, such as minerals, rocks, and fossils, and planet-scale processes uncovered through Earth-observing data derived from satellites, geophysical instruments, and models. The geosciences explain how past and present-day ecosystems and environments have been and continue to be shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, mountain building, climate change, evolution, and human activity through time. </P><P>Introductory courses are designed to contribute significantly to a liberal arts education and an understanding of Earth and the environment. Advanced courses are more specialized and provide the highest possible level of general and pre-professional training for majors. </P><P>Students in the department pursue a Geology or Environmental Geology concentration that prepares students to pursue careers in the geological and environmental sciences, business, and education, as well as government and public service. Upon graduation, many majors attend graduate school in geology, hydrology, oceanography, environmental sciences, and environmental policy and law. Other graduates go directly into a wide spectrum of employment situations, including business, environmental consulting, teaching, administration in schools and museums, and mineral resources and petroleum-related jobs. </P><P>Students interested in pursuing graduate school in the geosciences should note that some graduate schools expect applicants to have supplemented their undergraduate geology courses with introductory calculus, chemistry, and physics or biology. The Earth and Environmental Geosciences department encourages all majors to take these courses; they are required for honors in geology. </P><P>Teacher Certification </P><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for Geology or Environmental Geology majors who are interested in careers in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies . </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Geoscience — awarded annually by the department to the student who best demonstrates a combination of excellence in the classroom and creativity and perseverance in research. </P><P>The Robert M. Linsley Prize for Excellence in Geology — awarded mid-way through the junior year to a rising senior who has demonstrated the promise and potential for leadership and excellence in earth science scholarship and research. The prize is to be given by consensus of the geology department faculty to a student who plans to pursue earth sciences as a career, with preference given to a student with an interest in paleontology, historical geology, and stratigraphy/sedimentation. In selecting the awardee, emphasis is to be placed on a balance of leadership, research, and communication/teaching interests, in Bob's spirit. </P><P>The Norma Vergo Prize in Geology — established as an award to a geology major who, as determined by the faculty of the geology department, significantly contributes to the spirit of excellence among fellow students in the department. </P><P>The Kevin Williams '10 Endowed Memorial Fellowship Award — established in 2012 in memory of Kevin Williams '10 to provide stipend support for one or more geology and/or geography majors to study abroad. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. Placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., A–Levels, International Baccalaureate) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>The department allows two courses to be transferred for credit toward the major and one course towards the minor, with prior approval of the courses by the department. </P><P>Honors </P><P>All geology and environmental geology majors are encouraged to consider the advantages and challenges of undertaking honors in geology. A GPA of 3.20 or higher in the five core courses (GEOL 190 , GEOL 201 , GEOL 215 , GEOL 225 , and GEOL 235 ), plus the two required 400-level courses are required for a student to become eligible for honors. In addition, at least six full-credit courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics must be taken to become eligible for honors. GEOG 245  can be taken in place of one of these six courses. </P><P>Honors candidates must also complete a year-long senior thesis, which represents the culmination of a research project that typically begins during the summer before the senior year and continues during the fall and spring terms of the senior year. The written thesis must be completed and orally presented by the end of the spring semester. Following the defense, and with the recommendation of the thesis committee, the Earth and Environmental Geosciences faculty will vote to award honors. Awarding the distinction of honors is based primarily on the quality of the written thesis but will also include an overall assessment of the student's academic record. Students who may be eligible for honors will be notified in the spring of the junior year by their academic adviser.  </P><P>Related Majors </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Environmental Geology Major </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Astrogeophysics Major </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Natural Sciences, Topical Concentration: Marine Science - Freshwater Science Major  Topical Concentration: Marine — Freshwater Science is offered with the cooperation of the biology department through the Division of Natural Sciences.

Lindsay O'Connor Chair Shin </P><P>The basic objective of the Department of Economics is the development of students' understanding of economics as the social science that deals with production, consumption, and market exchange activities. All students begin with ECON 151 - Introduction to Economics. Majors advance through a core of analytical courses and choose among a series of options in theoretical and applied economics. Students with an interest in graduate work leading to careers in such fields as economics, law, business, public administration, or the foreign service are asked to discuss these objectives early in their college careers in order to plan an adequate program in economics. While not an undergraduate business or professional school, the department provides essential background for a variety of career interests. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>ECON 151 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered above 200. ECON 251 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered between 300 and 349. ECON 251 and ECON 252 are prerequisites for all courses numbered between 350 and 374. ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375 are prerequisites for all courses above 375. </P><P>Courses numbered below ECON 150, including ECON 105, cannot be counted as part of the major program. </P><P>Preparation for Graduate School </P><P>For students considering graduate school in business administration, at least two courses in mathematics (preferably MATH 161 and MATH 162) and one computer science course (such as COSC 101) are strongly recommended. Students considering graduate school in economics are strongly encouraged to take these courses, as well as additional courses in mathematics, including MATH 214 and MATH 377. Students with these interests should also consider the mathematical economics major described here and consult with their academic adviser as early as possible. Students considering graduate work in economics leading to a PhD should consider pursuing a double major in economics and mathematics. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Chi-Ming Hou Award for Excellence in International Economics — established in honor of the late Chi-Ming Hou, who was a member of the Colgate economics department from 1956 to 1991, for outstanding achievement in international economics. </P><P>The Marshall-Keynes Award for Excellence in Economics — awarded by the department to the senior with the strongest, sustained performance in analytical economics. </P><P>The J. Melbourne Shortliffe Prizes — established in honor of the late J. Melbourne Shortliffe, chair of the economics department emeritus, and awarded to outstanding graduating seniors who have majored in economics. </P><P>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credits </P><P>A score of 4 or 5 on both the microeconomics and macroeconomics AP exams will exempt incoming students from ECON 151; no credit is given if only one AP exam is taken or if a score of 3 or lower is received on either exam. No transfer credit is given for ECON 105 - Principles of Accounting. Except for students transferring from another college or university, no transfer credit will be given for ECON 251, ECON 252, or ECON 375, and no more than two courses in economics taken elsewhere can be accepted for major credit. An exception may be made in cases when the student has pre-matriculation credit for ECON 151; students should contact the department chair. Courses taken elsewhere must be comparable to what is offered in a liberal arts economics program. </P><P>Students who hope to transfer course credit must consult with the department prior to enrolling elsewhere. Students returning from summer courses, study groups or approved programs are not entitled to retroactively seek major credit in the department. Students are eligible to transfer up to two economics electives towards the major (and one elective for the minor), pending pre-approval from the department. Major or minor credit is normally only granted for courses taken while participating in an approved program that is on the economics department list.  </P><P>All transfer courses must have a minimum prerequisite that is equivalent to Colgate's ECON 151 course and the department recommends taking courses that have ECON 251 and/or ECON 252 as prerequisites. Students who transfer to Colgate from other institutions may be granted more than two course credits toward the major at the discretion of the department chair. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Economics </P><P>To be invited to participate in the honors program, students need a minimum 3.33 GPA in the three core courses: ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375. To qualify for departmental honors, a student must enroll in the year-long honors seminar (ECON 489 and ECON 490) in which each student writes an honors thesis. Students also present their projects to the seminar and act as discussants of other projects. Certification of honors and high honors will be based mainly on the quality of the honors paper. In addition, honors candidates must have, at graduation, a B+ average (A– for high honors) in the nine economics courses taken for major credit, and must receive a satisfactory grade in ECON 490. </P><P>Mathematical Economics </P><P>Special rules apply to honors in mathematical economics. </P><P>Since the major also includes the requirements for an economics program, special rules apply for honors. A mathematical economics major has two mutually exclusive options: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>qualifying for honors or high honors in economics by satisfying the honors criteria for the economics major. Under the first option the student will receive the honors certification in economics as a mathematical economics major, or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>qualifying for these honors in mathematical economics by satisfying the same criteria except that the departmental GPA is calculated for all 13 of the required courses. </LBody></LI></L><P>Related Major </P><P> Environmental Economics Major The London Economics Study Group </P><P>Based in London, the group studies selected economic problems and institutions of the United Kingdom and the European community.

This major should be considered seriously by all those intending to pursue graduate studies in economics, business, or quantitative social science, and also by those desiring a more flexible commitment to the major programs in these two departments. As its name suggests, the Mathematical Economics major is mathematically intense. Students declaring this major should possess a high level of aptitude in both mathematics and economics, and they should be prepared to apply advanced mathematical skills toward problems in economics. Similar to the economics major, the mathematical economics major meets the classification as a STEM discipline according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) so that international students are eligible for a 24-month Optional Practical Training (OPT) extension. </P><P>Students who are considering graduate school in economics are strongly encouraged to take additional mathematics courses, including MATH 377 - Real Analysis I. </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>Prospective majors should aim to complete ECON 151, ECON 251, ECON 252, statistics, and MATH 163 - Calculus III by the end of sophomore year, especially if they plan to study abroad during their junior year. </P><P>At least one of the ten economics courses must be a senior-level seminar (at the 410 level or above).

The department also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program for students preparing to teach at both the elementary and secondary level. </P><P>Given these programs, the department offers a comprehensive study of formal and informal educational institutions and practices, and the ways they are affected by social forces. Interdisciplinary by design, classes draw on diverse methods of inquiry to critically analyze the historical and contemporary ways that people educate and are educated in the United States and societies across the globe. Theory, research, and practice work together to help students become more reflective and engaged as cultural workers, citizens, and critical thinkers. Students learn to ask questions about the relationships between knowledge, power, and identity in educational contexts, and to reimagine education and its contribution to a democratic society. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>The South Korea Study Group is a joint program between Educational Studies and Asian Studies. The program offers a dynamic experience for any Colgate University student due in part to its efforts to become a leader in the newly forming globalized world in which we live. South Korea is highly regarded for its rapid modernization, yet the people still hold to its traditional ways in mind and spirit. While the focus is on students' development of educational studies theory and practice from a global perspective, they also gain a fascinating sociocultural experience. </P><P>Students enroll in four courses. The Director provides two courses for the students, one of which provides an opportunity to design a research project with a fieldwork component. Students then take two courses from the host university, Yonsei University. Yonsei offers a variety of courses in English. One course must be on the topic of Korea or East Asia. Prerequisites normally include EDUC 101 and at least one course in Asian Studies. </P><P>The Philadelphia Study Group offers students who are interested in a wide range of questions in and around education, urban studies, public policy, and social justice a full semester of coursework and experience in one of the most historically iconic and dynamic cities in the world. Lauded as &quot;the birthplace of American democracy,&quot; Philadelphia offers students a place to explore some of the most pressing questions around contemporary education policy and its relationship to material questions about the changing spatial and demographic topographies of American cities. In close conversations with students, teachers, families, and community members, this program provides an experimental platform to gain a more critical understanding about the issues surrounding contemporary education and urban policy and the community-based struggles that have emerged in response. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Childhood Education — awarded by the department for excellence in elementary student teaching. </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Adolescence Education — awarded by the department for excellence in secondary student teaching. </P><P>The Charles H. Thurber Award — named after the first professor of pedagogy at Colgate (1893) and awarded by the department to an outstanding senior major. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students majoring in educational studies will have the option to apply for the EDUC 460 Honors Seminar, which will be offered during the spring term of their senior year. GPA is only one factor in the application, but generally students with an overall GPA of 3.30 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 will be considered for graduation with honors in educational studies. An award of &quot;high honors&quot; is only awarded to work that shows exceptional scholarly insight and innovation. </P><P>All majors will be notified at the beginning of the fall semester of their senior year of the honors application procedures. The application deadline will normally be in late October and includes a current transcript, a letter of recommendation, and a full proposal of the honors project to be conducted in the Honors Seminar. </P><P>Students will need to work closely with a department faculty member, ideally the faculty member leading EDUC 450 Senior Seminar Capstone in the fall semester, prior to submitting the proposal. Seniors will normally develop their honors project proposal during the fall term while enrolled in EDUC 450; however, completion of EDUC 450 is not a prerequisite for the honors seminar.  </P><P>Department faculty will review all proposals and will notify students of their standing prior to the end of the fall semester. Once admitted, students will typically enroll in the Honors Seminar during the spring term of their senior year. </P><P>Students are required to defend their thesis. The defense will normally take place during the last week of classes in the spring semester. This involves a formal presentation of the thesis. The entire Department of Educational Studies faculty will attend the defense and provide input to the Honors Seminar professor and the faculty adviser.   </P><P>The designation of 'honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or neither will be determined by the Honors Seminar professor, the faculty adviser, and any assigned reader. </P><P>An honors project must bring something new into the world—it must teach us something or consider a particular question in a new light. In order to do this well, students will need to clearly articulate what the field of Educational Studies is and how their project is situated within our modes of inquiry/knowledge production. </P><P>The Teacher Preparation Program </P><P>Director Gardner </P><P>The preparation of teachers is an all-university responsibility, generally directed by the Department of Educational Studies. The program encompasses liberal studies in education as well as studies and experiences designed to develop teaching effectiveness and professional leadership. The emphasis is on developing the student's ability to relate knowledge and theory to skillful teaching in the interest of promoting greater social justice and environmental sustainability. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) childhood and adolescence programs are currently accredited through the Teacher Education Accreditation Council. Colgate University is a member in good standing of the Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP) with an anticipated Quality Assurance Review in Spring 2022. </P><P>There are five ways to become a certified public school teacher through the Teacher Preparation Program at Colgate. The first is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the four-year undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in childhood education (grades 1–6). The second is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the four-year undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in secondary education (grades 7–12 in Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, English, Mathematics, Physics, or Social Studies). The third is the undergraduate option where teacher candidates return for a ninth semester to complete the professional semester including student teaching for either the elementary or secondary level. The fourth and fifth pathways are through Colgate's MAT program in both childhood education and adolescent education. </P><P>Successful completion of all requirements in all certification programs leads to recommendation for New York State initial teacher certification. </P><P>Students interested in pursuing teacher certification in New York State are strongly encouraged to have taken EDUC 101, one of the Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning classes and one of The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  courses prior to the end of their sophomore year. </P><P>Students who wish to enter the program should submit an application to the Director of Teacher Preparation as soon as possible. Application materials include a personal teaching statement, transcripts, an academic writing piece, and a letter of recommendation. Acceptance into a teacher certification program does not guarantee acceptance into the student-teaching semester. </P><P>Students are tentatively approved for student teaching in the spring of their junior year for undergraduates. Final approval depends on successful completion of all prerequisite courses in their program by the end of the spring term. A decision is made by the department to approve a candidate for student teaching based on previous academic performance at Colgate as well as the apparent suitability of the candidate for the teaching profession. The student must also submit to the program a letter of recommendation written by an individual who, ideally, has observed the student in some teaching/learning capacity in a school setting. For content and pedagogical core courses required by the New York undergraduate students must receive a grade of C or above and graduate students must receive a grade of B- or above in order to meet expectations. Students must achieve at least a 3.0 cumulative grade point average, or its equivalent, in the program leading to the baccalaureate or graduate degree in order to be eligible for program completion and certification. </P><P>Candidates for teacher certification in New York must pass competency examinations prepared by the State Education Department (for comparative data from Colgate and other teacher education programs within New York State see www.highered.nysed.gov). Teacher certification students are required to spend a minimum of 100 hours in a variety of field experiences related to coursework prior to student teaching. Please note that completing certification requirements is not the same as majoring in educational studies. </P><P>Students who wish to gain New York State teacher certification have the option of completing their professional semester in the fall term following graduation as part of the ninth semester program. To be eligible for this special program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification prerequisites prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students admitted into the ninth semester program will be charged a small administrative fee (currently waived), must meet the usual requirements for enrollment at Colgate (such as proof of health insurance), and are responsible for locating their own off-campus housing. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their senior year. </P><P>Childhood Education Teacher Certification </P><P>The elementary certification program is currently offered at both the undergraduate and graduate level. The program leads to New York State teacher certification in grades 1–6. It combines a program of study with both liberal arts and educational coursework. Students are required to obtain 24 liberal arts credits out of a total of 32 in order to be eligible for state certification as an undergraduate. </P><P>Students should begin the certification program as early as possible in their academic career at Colgate. Students are required to apply to the teacher preparation program with a suggested deadline of November 1 of their sophomore year. Students will complete student teaching during the fall term of their senior year or in an extended ninth-semester. This professional semester includes two teaching methodology seminars, and an advanced course on the diagnosis and remediation of reading problems. </P><P>For more information visit the educational studies department page. </P><P>Certificate Requirements </P><P>Education as a Social Institution </P><P> EDUC 101 - The American School </P><P>Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning </P><P>One course from Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning </P><P>The Nature of Childhood Education and Development </P><P>All of the courses from The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  </P><P>Professional Student Teaching Semester </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 451 - Seminar on Curriculum and Instruction in English/Social Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 453 - Seminar on Curriculum and Instruction in Science/Mathematics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 454 - Diagnosis and Remediation of Reading Problems </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 455 - Student Teaching </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 456 - Dignity in Schools (0.25 credits), also satisfies DASA training </LBody></LI></L><P>Course requirements outside of Educational Studies </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One laboratory science course in biology, chemistry, physics, geology, or astronomy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One American history course </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One mathematics course </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One computer literacy course from the following:  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>COSC 100 Computers in the Arts and Sciences   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>MATH 105 or CORE 143S - Introduction to Statistics   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>PSYC 309 - Quantitative Methods in Behavioral Research </LBody></LI></L></L></L><P>Other Requirements </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Fieldwork — 100 hours </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Child abuse workshop (two hours of training in the identification of suspected child abuse/maltreatment) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Violence intervention and prevention workshop </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Fingerprinting </LBody></LI></L><P>Educational Studies Major </P><P>Courses are designed for liberal arts students interested in studying the problems and prospects of education, the nature and function of educational inquiry, the processes and outcomes of educational practices, the role of educational theory in school practice, and the relation of educational institutions to other social institutions.

Students who have applied and been accepted into the Teacher Preparation Program will follow either the Elementary Education or Secondary Education Track (please consult with the Director of Teacher Preparation Programs). Students seeking teacher certification at the Elementary Education level (grades 1-6) will follow the Elementary Education Track. And students seeking teacher certification at the Secondary Education level (grades 7-12) will follow the Secondary Education Track. </P><P>General Track Requirements </P><P>A minor in Educational Studies - General Track provides a mix between different areas of inquiry open to students interested in pursuing careers in the field of education, such as teaching, policy, and research. </P><P>For the minor in Educational Studies - General Track, students are required to take a total of five courses as follows: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 101 The American School </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Four additional courses, which will depend upon the student's area of interest. </LBody></LI></L><P>Elementary Education Track Requirements </P><P>For the minor in Educational Studies - Elementary Education Track, students are required to take a total of six courses prior to student teaching as follows: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 101 The American School </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Five additional courses will consist of:  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>One course in Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>Four courses in pedagogy, including The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  </LBody></LI></L></L></L><P>Secondary Education Track Requirements </P><P>For the minor in Educational Studies - Secondary Education Track, students are required to take a total of six courses prior to student teaching as follows: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>EDUC 101 The American School </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Five additional courses will consist of:  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>One course in Social and Cultural Diversity in Schooling, Teaching, and Learning  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>Four courses in pedagogy, including The Nature of Childhood Education and Development  </LBody></LI></L></L></L><P>Secondary Education Teacher Certification </P><P>The secondary education certification program is offered at the undergraduate and MAT levels.

Johnson, Maurer, Staley (Chair) Associate Professors Ames, Brice, Child, Hauser, Page, Rajasingham Assistant Professors Clayton, Cypress, Martino, Padilla Rios </P><P>The Department of English offers courses in two programs of study, one in literature written in the English language and the second in English with an emphasis in creative writing. Students may pursue majors and minors in both these areas. </P><P>An English major develops students' ability to use language effectively and enhances their critical and analytical skills by making them aware of the social and historical context in which writing, in any of its forms, is produced. English study provides an excellent basis for professional programs in law, journalism, publishing, and business as well as for graduate study in literature, the theater, or creative writing. </P><P>Students pursuing one of the majors in the department take courses in specified categories described in detail below. There is considerable choice from among the courses that fulfill these requirements, and students should discuss their programs with an adviser in planning a major. English courses also serve as electives for students in other programs. Normally 200-level courses are for first-year and sophomore students; 300-level courses, for sophomores, juniors, and seniors; and 400-level courses for juniors and seniors. There are a few specified prerequisites for individual courses. Non-majoring students considering 400-level English courses as electives, however, should consult catalog descriptions and may wish to speak with instructors to determine their readiness for particular courses. </P><P>Continued study of a foreign language or work in the literature of other languages in translation is particularly recommended as complementary to an English major and is especially important for students interested in further literary studies. Writing is an important component of coursework. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Allen Prizes in English Composition — established in memory of Hattie Boyd Allen — two prizes in English composition. </P><P>The Jonathan H. Kistler Memorial Curricular Innovation Fund in English — established to support and nurture new curricular and pedagogical ideas within the English department. </P><P>The Lasher Prize — established as an award to a member of the junior class in recognition of outstanding talent. </P><P>The Lasher Prize for Distinction in English Composition —awarded for distinction in the various types of writing. </P><P>The Scott Saunders Prize for Excellence in Literature — established in memory of Scott Saunders '89, and awarded annually to a senior major in English who participated in the Colgate London English Study Group, in recognition of work done in London that is distinguished in its own right or which contributed to the completion of a distinguished project. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Because transferred courses must conform in rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in English literature at another institution must meet with the department's transfer-credit adviser before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for an English course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The transfer-credit adviser grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major. </P><P>Honors and High Honors in English </P><P>The privilege to work toward honors is granted at the discretion of the faculty. Seniors with an average of 3.5 in ENGL courses are eligible to apply to pursue an honors project. Interested students should begin discussing their projects with potential directors in their junior year. </P><P>Candidates in literary criticism must enroll in ENGL 489, a 0.25-credit course offered in the fall semester. In consultation with a member of the faculty, the student selects a topic and submits a formal prospectus, which must be approved by two faculty supervisors, the director of the honors program, and the department as a whole. The deadline for submission of the prospectus normally falls in October, while the deadline for an annotated bibliography normally falls in December. </P><P>Candidates in creative writing must enroll in ENGL 477 - Advanced Workshop in the fall of their senior year and must submit a formal prospectus. They should also speak with a creative writing professor(s) in the spring of their junior year. Permission to pursue a creative writing honors the next spring will be granted on the basis of the quality of work in ENGL 477. </P><P>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in ENGL 490 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates during the spring term of their senior year. ENGL 490 must be taken in addition to the required 400-level seminar and in addition to the minimum number of courses required for the major. Students must successfully complete the honors seminar and submit a final version of the thesis on a date specified by the department. If the thesis is provisionally approved by the faculty supervisors and the director of the honors program, the student then discusses the project at an oral presentation scheduled during finals week. </P><P>A student who completes a project judged worthy of honors by the department and maintains at least a 3.5 average in all ENGL courses, including ENGL 490, is awarded a degree in English with honors. Students with an outstanding overall record in the major who complete a superior thesis and oral presentation may be awarded high honors. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the thesis is not approved for honors, ENGL 490 is converted to ENGL 491 - Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the faculty member who supervises the completion of the work. </P><P>Students with further questions should contact the director of honors in the Department of English. </P><P>Preparation for Graduate Study </P><P>Students interested in graduate study should consult with their advisers and the department chair early in their programs to be advised about preparation for advanced work. The department also designates special advisers to meet with students interested in graduate work, and informational meetings are held to help juniors and seniors plan their applications for fellowships and graduate admission. </P><P>Teacher Certification </P><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in English who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies. </P><P>MAT Degree in English </P><P>The Master of Arts in Teaching with a major in English is awarded by Colgate in the program. See Graduate Program. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>London </P><P>Each year, and often twice a year, a group of juniors and seniors spends a term in London studying British literature and theater under the direction of a member of the English department. Preference normally is given to majors or prospective majors who have completed at least three courses toward the requirements for the major. ENGL 290 - London English Study Group Preparation is a 0.25-credit course limited to participants in the London English Study Group in a subsequent term. The course prepares students for the English coursework to be undertaken in London. For further information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>Santa Fe </P><P>Students interested in American literature are encouraged to consider participation in the Santa Fe Study Group.

Students in environmental studies learn to think, speak, and write clearly and articulately about environmental issues from a variety of perspectives. The environmental studies curriculum combines interdisciplinary breadth with depth in a chosen field of study. </P><P>The Environmental Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program located within the Division of University Studies and staffed by faculty from a number of departments who apply their knowledge and expertise to teaching and research endeavors that cross disciplinary boundaries. The program administers five majors: environmental studies plus four departmentally affiliated majors including environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology. All five majors include a common set of courses that ensures a shared interdisciplinary experience. Each student achieves depth in analytical ability by taking a specified set of courses, usually in a particular discipline, chosen in consultation with her or his adviser. To fulfill environmental studies graduation requirements, students must possess a minimum overall GPA of at least 2.00 in all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Environmental studies majors wishing to pursue honors should consult with the environmental studies program director and a research sponsor no later than the spring of their junior year. Honors may be awarded to students majoring in environmental studies who accumulate a GPA of 3.30 in courses counted toward the major, and complete a semester-long independent research project under faculty guidance through enrollment in ENST 491 - Independent Study. Students pursuing honors will submit a proposal developed in consultation with an ENST-affiliated faculty member who will serve as research sponsor. The proposal describing the project will be submitted to the environmental studies steering committee in the fall semester of their senior year for approval. The research project should reflect the student's area of focus but must also demonstrate the understanding gained using an interdisciplinary perspective and approach. The Director of the program will normally serve as second reader to the honors project. Alternatively, the director and research sponsor may designate up to three faculty members to evaluate the merit of the work and report to the environmental studies steering committee. Students standing for honors will deliver an oral presentation to faculty and students of the program, and produce a report in a format most appropriate to the project. The environmental studies steering committee and the research sponsor must determine whether the oral presentation and report are of high quality and worthy of honors in the program. Students demonstrating exceptional commitment to research and meeting all the requirements for honors may be awarded high honors if the overall quality of their work is deemed to be outstanding by the environmental studies steering committee and research sponsor. </P><P>To qualify for graduation with honors or high honors in environmental biology, environmental economics, or environmental geography, students must take ENST 490 - Seminar in Environmental Studies and also meet the requirements for honors or high honors in the biology, economics, or geography major (depending on the area of specialization). The major GPA is calculated from all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. </P><P>Honors and High Honors for Environmental Geology </P><P>To be eligible for honors in environmental geology, students must complete the following requirements in addition to the environmental geology major: (1) Complete ENST 490 - Seminar in Environmental Studies, </P><P>(2) take four full-credit courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or biology, (3) complete a year-long senior thesis as described in the honors section of the geology major, and (4) achieve a minimum average GPA of 3.0 in the three 200-level core courses and 400-level capstone course. If additional courses are taken in these categories, the highest grades will be used to compute this GPA. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>A maximum of two course credits transferred from other institutions may be applied toward the environmental studies major. One course credit transferred from another institution may be applied toward the environmental studies minor. If the requirement for Focus in a Particular Field of Study is waived because of a second major or minor, transfer credits contributing to the second major or minor do not count toward this maximum. Approved courses taken as part of Colgate sponsored study groups, such as the Australia study group affiliated with the Environmental Studies Program, are not considered transfer credits and do not count toward the maximum. In many cases, courses that might be applied toward the environmental studies major or minor will be approved for university credit by another department on campus. For example, an environmental economics course would be reviewed for credit by the economics department. Once approved for university credit, the course must be approved by the director of environmental studies for credit toward the major or minor. In some cases, a course might be approved for university credit as an environmental studies (ENST) course. Students must supply the director with a course description and syllabus to apply for transfer credit in these cases. Limits on the transfer of courses toward environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology majors are determined by the biology, economics, geography, and geology departments, respectively, and are available in the affiliated department section in this chapter. </P><P>Australia Study Group </P><P>This program at the University of Wollongong provides a unique opportunity for junior majors and minors to expand their studies of the environment.

In collaboration with the major adviser, environmental geography majors select a specific theme within environmental studies on which to focus. Examples that correspond to geography faculty expertise include climatology, population studies, environmental health, environmental systems analysis, gender and the environment, geographic information systems (GIS), political economy of the global environment, sustainable agriculture, and sustainable development. </P><P>This major in affiliation with the Environmental Studies Program (ENST) provides students with an opportunity to consider explicitly environmental issues from a geographic perspective. Courses in geography and a common set of courses in the ENST program are combined in an interdisciplinary course of study that focuses on climatology, population studies, environmental health, urban ecology, environmental systems analysis, geographic information systems analysis, sustainable agriculture, sustainable development, and gender and environment. </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The major program consists of the following requirements: </P><P>Environmental Studies Courses (four) </P><P>All of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ENST 202/PHIL 202 - Environmental Ethics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ENST 390 - Community-based Study of Environmental Issues </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One full-credit course or two half-credit courses from the ENST list of Interdisciplinary Courses Focused on the Environment </LBody></LI></L><P>One of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ENST 232 - Environmental Justice </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ENST 321 - Global Environmental Justice </LBody></LI></L><P>Geography Courses (seven) </P><P>All of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 211 - Geographies of Nature, Economy, Society </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 231 - Geography of the Physical Environment </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 245 - Geographic Information Systems and GEOG 245L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 250 - Research Methods (which must be taken on campus by the end of the senior fall semester) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 401 - Seminar in Geography </LBody></LI></L><P>Two of the following </P><P>Only one may be a 100-level course </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 105 - Climate and Society </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 107 - Is the Planet Doomed? </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 315 - Sustainable Livelihoods in Asia </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 316 - Environmental and Public Health Geographies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 321 - Transnational Feminist Geography </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 322 - Ecologies of the City </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 323/REST 323 Arctic Transformations  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 325 - Water and Society </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 326 - Environmental Hazards </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 328 - Sustainability and Natural Resources </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 329/PCON 329 Environmental Security </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 332 - Weather and Climate </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 335 - Soil Geography </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 336 - Biogeography </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOG 338 - Earth System Ecology </LBody></LI></L><P>Other Required Courses (three) </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One course from the Earth Systems and Processes list, or with permission of the program director an additional course that satisfies the Interdisciplinary Courses Focused on the Environment requirement. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One course from the Social Science Investigations of Environmental Issues list, or with permission of the program director an additional course that satisfies the Interdisciplinary Courses Focused on the Environment requirement. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One course from the Arts and Humanities Courses Related to the Environment list, or with permission of the program director an additional course that satisfies the Interdisciplinary Courses Focused on the Environment requirement. </LBody></LI></L><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Environmental Studies program page. </P><P>Environmental Studies Program </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Environmental Studies program catalog page. </P><P>Environmental Geology Major </P><P>Advisers Adams, Harnick, Harpp, Leventer, Levy </P><P>The Environmental Geology concentration focuses on the intersection between the Earth's environment and human activity.

Through the study of history and theory, formal analysis, and production experiences, the program examines how film and media serve as powerful determinants of ideology, identity, and historical consciousness. Courses offered in a range of departments and programs constitute the major and minor, reflecting the fact that cinema and media-based research cuts across disciplines. </P><P>It has been said that the mass media collectively represent the most important and widely shared context for the receipt of information and ideas in our contemporary experience. Courses in Film and Media Studies question the consequences of our passive consumption of mass media as both entertainment and information. Students learn the history and theory of film and media, analytical approaches and strategies; they also come to understand the various ways in which film and media are produced, circulated, and consumed locally, nationally, and globally. </P><P>The film and media studies curriculum encompasses history, theory, and practice, with the goal of developing in students the critical skills necessary to analyze representation and experience as they are constructed by new and emerging visual technologies, and to put theoretical and historical knowledge into practice through media production courses and exercises. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Film and Media Studies Award — awarded for outstanding achievement in film and media studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>The award of honors in film and media studies is dependent on faculty evaluation of work done on an independent research project in FMST 410 and the student's GPA. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Independent Research Project: Every major undertakes a senior project (in FMST 410) in their senior year. Upon completion, the project may be nominated for honors. If nominated, the project is prepared by the senior for a public presentation. Following that presentation, faculty decide whether the project is worthy of honors. Honors will be conferred only on work of outstanding quality, while high honors will be awarded only to exceptional work of highest distinction. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GPA Requirements: Film and media studies majors who have a GPA of 3.30 or better in the major and 3.00 overall will be considered for Honors.

Typically, the department will accept for major credit a maximum of two geography courses taken from department-approved study abroad programs and/or Colgate study groups. Courses taken from non-approved programs may be eligible for one major credit with department approval. Regardless of the source, the number of non-Colgate courses used for major credit in geography cannot exceed two. To be accepted, courses must be comparable in quality and scope to courses offered at Colgate. Students who hope to transfer course credit must consult with the department chair prior to enrolling elsewhere. Transfer credits may not be used to satisfy the department's required courses. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students in geography wishing to pursue honors must have a major GPA of 3.50 or better. Students pursuing honors who have a major GPA of 3.70 or better may be eligible for high honors. In such cases, the geography faculty will determine whether the completed honors project is of sufficient quality to warrant such an award. Eligible seniors who wish to pursue honors must follow the guidelines for honors in geography. If approved for preliminary honors work, students will register for GEOG 490, a half-credit course in preparation for honors work, during the fall semester. If given final approval for honors work, students will register for GEOG 499 during the spring term. At the end of the spring term, candidates for honors will make oral presentations of their completed honors projects to the members of the department. The decision to award honors will be made by the department in consultation with the faculty advisers based on the quality of the honors project, oral defense, and other evidence of distinction. </P><P>Related Major </P><P> Environmental Geography Major  </P><P>Australia Study Group (fall term) </P><P>This study group is sponsored by the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies Program (ENST) and focuses on the social and environmental diversity of Australia.

Serving as a gateway to rich literary and artistic traditions as well as the discourses of philosophy and critical theory, German also enables students to access Germanophone Europe's many contributions to the social and natural sciences. The department's academic program is structured to enable students to pursue their interests in German as well as related fields: the beginning and intermediate language courses emphasize cultural knowledge about contemporary German-speaking societies and provide a strong foundation in the skills of speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing German. German 351 fosters students' capacities for advanced study of German language, literature, and cultural history, while enabling them to conduct related academic work in German. Additional courses at the 300 level feature diverse topics in German literary and cultural studies, while seminars at the 400 level undertake focused investigations of seminal periods, genres, and sites of the German literary and cultural imagination. </P><P>The study of German can be integral to students' academic pursuits as a whole. The department encourages students to enroll in related courses in other disciplines such as philosophy, history, music, international relations, linguistics, and art history. A major in German is an excellent preparation for graduate studies in these fields as well as in literature and German Studies, and can also give students a competitive edge in economics, politics, law, business, journalism, consulting, and publishing. German not only provides students with the necessary basis for a rigorous and sophisticated understanding of central European culture, but also fosters a more profound understanding of their native language and of the relationship between language and knowledge: to speak with Goethe, &quot;Wer fremde Sprachen nicht kennt, weiß nichts von seiner eignen&quot; (those who don't know foreign languages know nothing of their own). </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Valentine Piotrow German Prizes — two awards for excellence in German. </P><P>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </P><P>Both university and major credits are normally granted to students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examinations in German language and literature or a score of 6 or 7 on the higher level International Baccalaureate German exam. Transfer credit for courses taken at other institutions may be granted with the approval of the department chair. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>An honors project allows students to build on their knowledge to pursue independent research on a topic of their interest in close consultation with one or several faculty members. Students with a GPA of 3.30 in courses included in the major and with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 are eligible for honors in German. Students who have attained that average may apply to pursue honors by the early fall of the senior year. Each candidate must complete a thesis or its equivalent under the guidance of a faculty adviser and must discuss the thesis at an oral presentation normally scheduled in April. Research on this project begins in the fall semester of the senior year. In the spring semester candidates register for GERM 490. This course must be taken in addition to the minimum of eight courses required for the major. The quality of the project resulting from this course, as judged by the adviser and one other faculty member, determines whether the student receives honors or a grade in GERM 491 - Independent Study. </P><P>Successful honors students whose departmental average is 3.50 or higher are eligible for high honors. For this distinction the student must fulfill all regular honors requirements and must also pass an additional oral examination based on his or her cumulative work in German courses. </P><P>Acceptance in Delta Phi Alpha (the national German honor society) is possible for all students who have at least two years of college German, a minimum GPA of 3.30 in all German courses, and an overall GPA of 3.00, and who show a continued interest in the study of German language and literature. </P><P>Study Group </P><P>Every spring the department conducts a study group at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität in Freiburg, Germany. Majors in German are normally expected to avail themselves of this opportunity. The study group is also open to non-majors who have sufficient German language skills. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>Facilities </P><P>The Max Kade German Center in Lawrence Hall serves the department both as a seminar room and as a common room. It offers audiovisual facilities, German television broadcasts, a German reference library, and current German periodicals. The center is also the site of lectures, film screenings, and a weekly coffee hour. </P><P>In addition, the German department shares the Keck Humanities Resource Center with other arts and humanities departments. Here German audio, video, and computer resources are available for laboratory work in connection with language classes as well as for independent studies. </P><P>University of Freiburg Visiting Instructors </P><P>Each year, two German visitors from the University of Freiburg join the department to support our curriculum and our students. The department Intern serves as tutor, and advises the student-run German Club and the </P><P>student-taught Foreign Language Program for second graders at Hamilton Central School. The Max Kade Teaching Fellow offers first- and second-year German language courses in the department. </P><P>German Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>A major in German literature and culture consists of a minimum of eight courses. Normally these include at least three 400-level seminars and two 300-level courses. The remaining major credits may be fulfilled through additional courses in the department at the 200-level and above, or up to two cognate courses on German Studies topics taught in English outside the department, with departmental approval. Exceptions require the permission of the department chair. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>University regulations require that a student maintain a minimum GPA of 2.00 in the courses comprising the major program. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the German department page. </P><P>German Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, the Freiburg study group, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the German department catalog page. </P><P>German Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>The minor in German literature and culture consists of a minimum of five courses.

Tomlinson </TH></TR></Table><P>Today the study of human history is critical to global survival; the experiences of others serve as guides to present and future conduct. At the same time, exposure to rigorous historical method and clear narrative style develops conceptual skills, research competence, writing fluency, and sensitivity to the uses and abuses of language and historical knowledge. The history department curriculum includes courses on African, Asian, Caribbean, European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and North American subjects, and on contact and interaction among these societies. Majors are encouraged to take courses in related departments and programs. Competence in at least one foreign language is also desirable. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>Course classifications: </P><P>Africa (AF) Asia (AS) Europe (EU) Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Middle East (ME) Transregional (TR) United States (US) </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence in History — awarded to the student judged by the faculty to demonstrate outstanding merit, perseverance, and promise on the basis of work done in the department. </P><P>The History Honors Award — awarded annually to a senior major in recognition of a distinguished thesis in history. </P><P>The Douglas K. Reading Prize — awarded in memory of Douglas K. Reading, professor of history from 1938 to 1980. The Reading Prize is given annually to an outstanding junior or senior major, with preference to a student of modern European history, Russian history, or ancient or medieval history. </P><P>The Scott Saunders Prize for Excellence in History — established in memory of Scott Saunders '89 and awarded annually to a senior major in history who participated in the Colgate London History Study Group, in recognition of work done in London that is distinguished in its own right or which contributed to the completion of a distinguished project. </P><P>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </P><P>Students with scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) exam in European or American history will receive credit toward graduation but not toward the major or minor. Those granted AP credit in European history may not repeat HIST 101 and/or HIST 102 without permission of the department chair; those granted AP credit in American history may not repeat HIST 103 and/or HIST 104 without permission of the department chair. No department credit or exemption is given for an AP score of 3 or for AP courses taken without the AP examination. Majors may not count course credit given for AP in history toward the nine total courses required. Minors may not count course credit given for AP in history toward the five total courses required. </P><P>Requests for transfer of external credits toward the major or minor should be directed to the department chair. Courses must be of comparable quality to ones offered at Colgate to be approved for transfer. </P><P>Colgate students who have not transferred from another institution should consult the department chair before enrolling in courses at other institutions or in approved off–campus study programs. Permission to use such courses for major or minor credit is granted selectively, and only one course may be approved. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Candidates for honors in history must: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Have or exceed, by the time of graduation, a major GPA of 3.50 and an overall GPA of 3.00; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Complete an honors thesis that has been judged by the major adviser and one other department faculty member to be of A or A– quality.

Please refer to Educational Studies for more information. </P><P>Only Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Graduate students may take graduate-level versions of history department classes, which are given 500-level course numbers. For further details, see the MAT entry under Educational Studies. </P><P>London Study Group </P><P>Every year the history department conducts a study group in London. Admission is selective and limited to students of suitable interest and academic background. Interested students should inquire the preceding year. Prospective students must take HIST 199 - History Workshop and HIST 300 - The London Colloquium (EU) before going to London, and should be on campus the semester before departure. For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>History Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>There are two pathways through the history major: The Field of Focus (FoF) Pathway and the Global Pathway.

Moore, Riley, Sparber </TH></TR></Table><P>For those interested in world affairs, Colgate offers a major program in International Relations (IR). Students may also take IR as a minor. Study in the program begins with POSC 232, which is normally taken in the sophomore year. </P><P>Honors </P><P>A candidate for honors in IR must choose an adviser for an honors paper and fulfill the honors requirements for the department of the faculty adviser. In addition, the honors student must (1) achieve a minimum GPA of </P><P>3.50 in the nine IR courses, (2) attain a minimum overall GPA of 3.25, (3) submit a substantial research paper that is judged superior (A– or higher) by two program faculty members. </P><P>A student whose adviser is a member of the Department of Political Science must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium (POSC 498 and POSC 499) in which each student writes an honors thesis. POSC 498 will be taken in the fall semester, followed by POSC 499 in the spring semester. A grade will be given in both POSC 498 and POSC 499. Seniors who anticipate graduating with a GPA eligible for honors should speak with their advisers or the IR director in the semester prior to doing honors. POSC 498 and POSC 499 are to be taken in addition to the nine courses counted toward the IR major. </P><P>A candidate for high honors in IR must fulfill the following additional requirements: (1) achieve a minimum GPA of 3.60 in IR courses, (2) attain an overall GPA of at least 3.40, (3) gain approval of the paper as superior by a third reader, and (4) pass with distinction an oral examination by the three readers of the submitted paper. As above, the professor supervising the research must give prior approval of the paper. </P><P>Students may choose whether the grades received in both POSC 498 and 499, or neither, are to be counted toward their major GPA. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>Students are encouraged but not required to participate in off-campus study. The IR program cosponsors a study group in Geneva that typically runs once per year. On the Geneva study group, students receive one core subfield credit for POSC 357, and two elective credits: one for an internship course and the other for a course taken at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. IR majors who are pursuing French to complete their foreign language requirement can receive credit at the 100 or 200 level for an intensive course taken at the beginning of the Geneva study group. See Off-Campus Study for more information. </P><P>Transfer Credits </P><P>Students participating in off-campus approved programs can seek transfer credits to satisfy certain IR major and minor requirements—most commonly language courses, IR electives, or History electives. Students wishing to receive the upper-level Economics credit must seek additional approval from Colgate's economics department. In very rare circumstances students may receive credit for a core subfield class. POSC 232 - Fundamentals of International Relations (IR) and the IR seminar must be taken on campus. </P><P>Students should seek preapproval for any off-campus courses from the IR director, who will evaluate individual courses with respect to their rigor and substantive appropriateness. Courses whose subject matter is not international cannot receive IR credit; courses with reading and/or writing assignments below Colgate standards can only receive credit on a two-for-one basis—i.e., two off-campus courses count for one IR credit. This two-for-one formula applies to most courses taken on non-Colgate programs. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Paul O. Stillman '55 Award — given annually to an outstanding senior(s) majoring in International Relations. </P><P>International Relations Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>Students are strongly encouraged to complete most required courses by the end of the junior year. As a general rule, the only requirements students can complete off campus are the elective and History courses as well as appropriate language courses; in all such cases, students must seek prior approval from the IR director. </P><P>For students seeking a major in International Relations and a minor in Political Science, no courses may be counted toward both. </P><P>POSC 152 - Global Peace and War (IR), does not ordinarily count toward the IR major. Students who take POSC 152 before deciding on an IR major must also take POSC 232, but may count POSC 152 as one of the two IR electives with written permission from the IR program director. </P><P>Students who have AP credit for ECON 151 must take one additional elective course. </P><P>The major program consists of the following requirements: </P><P>Foundational Course </P><P> POSC 232 - Fundamentals of International Relations (IR) (a prerequisite for upper-level courses for IR majors) </P><P>Core Political Science Subfield Courses </P><P>At least two of the following POSC courses: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 349 - The International Political Economy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 353 - National Security </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 357 - International Institutions </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 366 - Contemporary American Foreign Policy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 374 - International Law </LBody></LI></L><P>Economics Courses </P><P>All of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ECON 151 - Introduction to Economics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ECON 249 - International Economics (Students who have completed the relevant prerequisites may take ECON 349 in place of ECON 249.) </LBody></LI></L><P>Students are strongly encouraged to take ECON 249 before their senior year </P><P>History Courses </P><P>One of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 105 - Introduction to the Modern Middle East (ME) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 216 - U.S. Foreign Policy, 1917 - Present (US) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 219 - Oceanic Histories (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 232 - The Crusades (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 237 - Empires and Global History:1400-1700 (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 238 - Europe in the Age of the Renaissance and Reformation (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 255 - The Ottoman Empire, 1300 - 1924 (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 263 - Cities of the Silk Road (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 265 - War and Violence in East Asia (AS) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 271 - The First World War (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 272 - War and Holocaust in Europe (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 284 - Decolonization in Africa (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 316 - The United States in Vietnam, 1945 - 1975 (US) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 350 - Contemporary European History, 1945 to the Present (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 358 - Conquest and Colony: Cultural Encounters in the Americas (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 368 - China, the Great Wall, and Beyond (AS) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 370 - The Mongol Empire (TR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 381 - Pre-Colonial Africa (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 382 - Modern Africa (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 385 - Darfur in Historical Perspective (AF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 482 - Seminar on Problems in British History since 1800 (EU) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>HIST 489 - Seminar on Problems in Military History (TR) </LBody></LI></L><P>IR Seminar </P><P>Unless the director grants specific permission, the seminar must be taken on campus.

Tomlinson, Woolley </P><P>The affiliated minor in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies (LGBT) examines the lives and representations of individuals and groups considered sexual minorities, as well as the various forces that have affected them across cultures and throughout time. Sexuality offers a critical lens to analyze communities, cultures, and subcultures; institutions, discourses, and literatures; economic and political movements; the social construction of power, status, and hierarchies; and identity categories configured on the basis of age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. Moreover, sexuality is considered as the subject of biological, medical, and psychological research. LGBT studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary minor that emphasizes the application of new theories and methodologies (e.g., queer, feminist, critical race, and multicultural theories) to established disciplines as it promotes the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields. Through the minor, students gain critical understandings of normative categorization, query unspoken assumptions, examine social stratification and distributions of power, and explore the diversity of forms that sexuality has taken historically and in contemporary contexts. </P><P>Related Major </P><P> Women's Studies Major </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Award for Academic Excellence, in honor of Marilyn Thie — awarded by the program to a senior, on the basis of completion of the minor or three or more courses, a GPA of 3.30 or higher, and significant scholarly achievement in LGBTQ studies. </P><P>The Ken Valente Award for Leadership in LGBTQ Studies and Community, in honor of Ken Valente — awarded by the program to a senior who has demonstrated outstanding leadership in LGBTQ studies and community. </P><P>Courses </P><P>Use the minor link below to find courses that count toward the LGBT minor requirements.  </P><P>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Completing the minor requires students to work closely with their course instructors, their advisers, and the LGBT director.

Students at Colgate who major in mathematics go on to careers in medicine, law, or business administration as well as areas of industry and education having an orientation in science. Non-majors often require mathematical skills to carry on work in other disciplines, and all students can use the study of mathematics to assist them in forming habits of precise expression, in developing their ability to reason logically, and in learning how to deal with abstract concepts. There are also many people who view mathematics as an art form, to be studied for its own intrinsic beauty. </P><P>All mathematics courses are open to qualified students. Entering first-year students who have successfully completed at least three years of secondary school mathematics, including trigonometry, should be adequately prepared for MATH 161. Students who have studied calculus in secondary school are typically ready to enter MATH 162 or MATH 163. </P><P>Students who are planning to undertake graduate study in mathematics are advised to take MATH 485 and MATH 487. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>The following classification scheme is used for MATH courses: </P><P>100-149: Only requires knowledge of mathematics before Calculus </P><P>150-199: Calculus-level knowledge and/or sophistication  </P><P>200-249: Linear Algebra level (gentle transition-type course) </P><P>250-299: Transition to the major level </P><P>300-349: Courses with requirements at Math 150-249 level </P><P>350-399: Courses with requirements at the Math 250-299 level </P><P>400-449: Courses with requirements at the Math 300-349 level </P><P>450-474: Courses with requirements at the Math 350-399 level </P><P>475-484: Research experience seminars </P><P>485-499: Advanced material The expected rotation schedule of course offerings is described on the Department of Mathematics webpage. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>To be considered for honors in Mathematics or in Applied Mathematics, a student must achieve a 3.3 GPA in the respective major. In order to be considered for high honors, a 3.7 GPA in the major is required. For both honors and high honors, completion of a course numbered 400 or above besides 481-483 is required. </P><P>Honors / High Honors are attained by a student's production and defense of a thesis of distinction. The student's thesis adviser puts forward the thesis for honors consideration. Subsequently, a committee of three faculty members is formed, one being the student's thesis advisor, the others chosen by the department. The student must give a defense of the thesis. The committee of three, with other faculty members acting in an advisory capacity with a recommendation, then grades the project, consisting of the thesis and defense. In order for honors to be granted, the committee of three must grade the project as A- or better. In the event all three grade the project as A or better, high honors will be granted. </P><P>Joint theses are allowed but will not normally be considered for honors. Exceptions may be made with departmental permission. </P><P>As a reminder to the student writing theses for two different departments: Colgate's Honor Code states that substantial portions of the same academic work may not be submitted for credit or honors more than once without the permission of the instructor(s). </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Allen First-Year Mathematical Prize — awarded for excellence in mathematical work on the basis of scores attained on the first year prize exam covering material from Math 161 and 162. </P><P>The Edwin J. Downie '33 Award for Mathematics — created in memory of Edwin J. Downie '33, Professor of Mathematics Emeritus, given annually to a senior majoring in mathematics who has made outstanding contributions to the mathematics department through exemplary leadership, service, and achievement. </P><P>The Osborne Mathematics Prizes — established in honor of Professor Lucien M. Osborne, Class of 1847, awarded on the basis of the score attained by the student on an exam covering the content from the 300level courses required for their major. </P><P>The Sisson Mathematics Prizes — established in honor of Eugene Pardon Sisson, a teacher of mathematics in the academy 1873–1912, awarded to a student who maintains a high average in one or more 200-level mathematics courses. </P><P>Calculus Placement </P><P>Students should review the MATH 161, MATH 162, and MATH 163 course descriptions for information on topics and prerequisites, or consult with a department faculty member. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in a higher-level course. Students may drop back from MATH 162 to MATH 161 within the first three weeks, subject to available space in an acceptable MATH 161 section. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>Students who have taken the Calculus-BC, Calculus-AB, or Statistics Advanced Placement exam of the College Entrance Examination Board will be granted credit according to the following policy: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Students earning 4 or 5 on the Calculus-BC Advanced Placement exam will receive credit for MATH 161 and MATH 162.

The systems examined may range in scale from molecular through cellular and tissue levels to the scale of organisms and entire ecosystems. The unifying feature of this field is quantitative description of interactions between components of biological systems. </P><P>The interface between mathematics and biology is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of research in the sciences. The technological development of methods for generating large amounts of biological data — </P><P>including genome sequence information, total protein analysis, metabolic information, etc. — demands the development of mathematical and computational methods for analyzing these data and for developing predictive models that use such large data sets. The multidisciplinary field of systems biology requires an understanding of both mathematical and biological concepts, insights into interesting questions in biology, and comprehension of the mathematical methods that can be used to address many of those questions. The mathematical systems biology minor provides students with the coursework in mathematics and biology required to begin to gain insights and experience in this important new field. </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Course requirements are described below (six courses) </P><P>Required Courses </P><P>Both of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 163 - Calculus III </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 214 - Linear Algebra </LBody></LI></L><P>One of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 181 - Evolution, Ecology, and Diversity and BIOL 181L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 182 - Molecules, Cells, and Genes and BIOL 182L </LBody></LI></L><P>One of the Following </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 302/BIOL 302 - Systems Biology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 315 - Mathematical Biology </LBody></LI></L><P>Biology </P><P>One additional biology course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 181 - Evolution, Ecology, and Diversity </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>BIOL 182 - Molecules, Cells, and Genes </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Any 200-, 300-, or 400-level BIOL elective course </LBody></LI></L><P>Mathematics </P><P>One additional mathematics course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 260 - Computational Mathematics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 302/BIOL 302 - Systems Biology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 308 - Differential Equations </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 310 - Combinatorial Problem Solving </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 312 - Math Modeling: Social Sciences </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 313 - Functions of a Complex Variable </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 315 - Mathematical Biology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 316 - Probability </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 354 - Data Analysis I - Generalized Linear Models </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 360 - Graph Theory </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 376 - Numerical Analysis (formerly MATH 329) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 408 - Partial Differential Equations (formerly MATH 311) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 416 - Mathematical Statistics (formerly MATH 317) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 448/PHYS 448 - Nonlinear Dynamics &amp; Chaos (formerly MATH/PHYS 458) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 454 - Data Analysis II - Nonlinear Model Inference </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 481/BIOL 481 - Modeling of Biological Systems     </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 482 - Research Seminar: Applied Mathematics </LBody></LI></L><P>Note: </P><P>Students declaring a minor in mathematical systems biology select an adviser from either the mathematics department or biology department.

Across time and place, it advances the study of cross-cultural and comparative influence in the period both within and beyond Europe's geographical borders. Broadly interdisciplinary, it is intended as a supplement to traditional majors. Spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences, MARS engages history, art, literature, music, philosophy, science, and religion from the 4th to the 17th centuries. </P><P>A thorough, interdisciplinary examination of the medieval, renaissance, and early modern periods enables students to discover local and regional connections across the cultures in the discipline. Through a deep engagement with the program's courses and programming, students develop an appreciation for and understanding of how the distant past shapes and informs who we are today. </P><P>The emphasis in MARS is on creating interdisciplinary bridges across the curriculum, and the program is structured in a way that encourages students to explore a cross section of traditional fields. To this end, MARS courses can center on a topic area proposed by the student and agreed upon in consultation with a faculty adviser. However, courses in the minor should complement each other. </P><P>Students may elect to minor in either the medieval or Renaissance period or in a combination of both. In order to declare a minor, prospective students must meet with the program director to discuss their choice of courses and how those courses will coalesce. This should normally take place by the spring term of the junior year. In order to take full advantage of course offerings and advising, students are urged to enroll in the program as early as possible in their undergraduate career. </P><P>Award </P><P>Award for Excellence in Medieval and Renaissance Studies — awarded by the program for excellence in medieval and Renaissance studies. </P><P>Courses </P><P>Use the minor link below to find courses that count toward the MARS requirements.  </P><P>Medieval and Renaissance Studies Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>The minor consists of at least five courses selected with the approval of an adviser belonging to the MARS faculty. Courses should be selected from the list below and should include a course in history. At least three different disciplines should be represented. French, Italian, and Spanish are considered to be separate areas of study. Additional courses (notably topical seminars) may be accepted upon petition. It is the responsibility of the student to recognize that certain courses might require departmental prerequisites for which he or she would not necessarily receive credit toward the MARS minor. Only one independent study course and only one non-Colgate course will be counted toward the minor. Courses that are appropriate for the MARS minor are sometimes offered as part of the university's Venice study group program. </P><P>At least three courses should be at the intermediate level and at least one should be at the 300- or 400- (seminar) level — either an existing seminar or an independent research paper. Senior seminars and honors thesis courses in any department could provide a place for the student's capstone experience. </P><P>One year's study of Latin at Colgate is recognized as one course toward the minor. While there is no mandated language requirement, it is strongly recommended that students considering graduate school in a medieval or Renaissance field should study Latin at least through the intermediate level. Students are encouraged to explore early literature in Old and Middle English, as well as early period courses in the foreign language departments. </P><P>Courses from the following list are appropriate for the MARS minor: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ARTS 207 -

It provides students with an understanding of the origins and development of the Islamic faith in its heartland, as well as an awareness of the global, multi-cultural character of modern Islam. Program courses train students in art, literature, history, culture, politics, and political economy of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. </P><P>The Islamic world spans the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. The world's nearly 2 billion Muslims comprise one-quarter of the world's population and include numerous linguistic and ethnic groups such as Arabs, Iranians, Turkic peoples, Kurds, Baluchis, Malays, and others. The Islamic world is the source of rich religious and intellectual traditions that share deep roots with Western traditions and have evolved over a long history of interaction with the West. It also plays an important role in global peace, security, and prosperity. These demographic, cultural, and strategic considerations ensure increasingly deep and dynamic relations among peoples of the Islamic world and the Euro-Atlantic West. The Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Program (MIST) program equips Colgate students with the knowledge and conceptual tools needed to forge and understand these connections. </P><P>The themes addressed by the program include Islam's textual foundations and interpretive traditions; the developement and historical spread of diverse Muslim societies; political institutions, and artistic and literary traditions; European colonialism and its impact on the cultures, economies, and polities of the region; the rise of modern nationalism and its relationship to tribal, religious, and ethnic identities; the emergence and impact of political Islam and Islamic revivalist movements; the Arab-Israeli conflict; democratization and revolutionary movements; and United States foreign policy toward the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. </P><P>GPA Requirements </P><P>Courses taken at Colgate, on a Colgate Study Group, or an Approved Program must have a grade of C or better to count toward the major or minor. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Major major page. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>The MIST faculty and the off-campus study office have identified a small number of programs that we highly encourage students to attend for a summer or a semester. Up to three course credits toward the major may be earned through study in off-campus programs. Approved off-campus language courses may also count toward the major and are not included in the three-credit limit. Consult with MIST faculty for further details. </P><P>Awards </P><P>Award for Excellence in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies — awarded to the graduating senior who has excelled in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. </P><P>The Prize for Excellence in Arabic — awarded by the faculty of Arabic to students who demonstrate excellence in studying Arabic language and culture. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the MIST program.

This may take the form of paid or volunteer work or an internship, and must be at least 140 hours in duration. It is expected that the practicum will deepen the student's understanding of a substantive aspect or aspects of the institution's operations through work in a department such as Curatorial, Development, Education, Collections Management, Communications, or Archives. </P><P>The practicum requirement can be satisfied by an internship at the Picker Art Gallery or Longyear Museum of Anthropology during the academic year or over the summer, or at any other suitable museum over the summer. Students who wish to fulfill this requirement at an off-campus institution must discuss their plans with, and get approval from, the director of the Museum Studies Program in advance. They must also identify the supervisor who will write a brief evaluation upon their completion of the work. This evaluation must be submitted to the director of the Museum Studies Program, who will notify the Registrar when this requirement for the minor has been fulfilled. Financial support for internships is available through Colgate's Summer Funding, but students should be aware of the competitive nature of these grants and of their early deadlines (usually in late February; for more information and specific deadlines visit summer funding). </P><P>Students are encouraged to work with Colgate University's Upstate Institute to identify institutions in central New York where they can fulfill the Museum Studies practicum requirement. The Upstate Institute supports community-based research through the Summer Field School, and can help place students as full-time paid research Fellows with institutions in the region such as the Munson Williams Proctor Institute, Everson Museum of Art, Oneida County Historical Society, Oneida Community Mansion House, Adirondack Museum, Iroquois Indian Museum, Fenimore Art Museum, the Shako:wi Cultural Center, the Corning Museum of Glass, and the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro. For more information about programs and opportunities, visit the Upstate Institute web page. </P><P>Students should also consult with their Museum Studies minor adviser about the various ways this requirement can be fulfilled, and about opportunities that best meet the individual needs and interests of the student. </P><P>Museum Studies Program </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Museum Studies catalog page. </P><P>Music </P><Table><TR><TH>Faculty </TH></TR><TR><TH>Professors Cheng, Klugherz (Chair) Associate Professors Swain Assistant Professor Chase, Coluzzi Concert Manager Joseph Artists in Residence Pilgrim (voice), Heyman (piano) Teachers of Applied Music Berry (cello), Campbell (flute), Cleveland (violin, viola), Ferlo (guitar), Haddock (voice), Hane (bassoon), Johns (drums), Klugherz (violin/viola), Koen (piano), MacDowell (clarinet), Meredith (trombone), Montalbano (jazz piano), Nightingale (trumpet), Ogilvie (French horn), Sharpe (oboe) </TH></TR></Table><P>Many students come to Colgate with significant musical experience behind them, won through arduous and focused study. The fundamental aim of the curriculum in music is to develop that experience to its utmost potential. Performance ensembles and private instruction build directly on that experience, while classroom instruction introduces student musicians to important ideas, histories, and various cultures that inform and broaden that experience. Qualified students can choose to develop in ways that most interest them. Those who choose to major in music will find their development guided by a balanced program of performance and classroom studies. Graduating majors have gone on to graduate study in every area of music or have immediately entered careers in arts management, mathematics, medicine, law, business, sound engineering, and many other fields. </P><P>Another fundamental aim of the curriculum is to introduce students with little or no musical background into the world of music as part of Colgate's liberal arts program. These students should begin with MUSI 101, MUSI 103, MUSI 111, MUSI 151, MUSI 161, or MUSI 221. </P><P>Upper-level courses divided into three groups: history, theory, and performance. The history courses are designed to provide students with an understanding of music through a study of composers and historical periods. The theory sequence teaches how music is created and how to compose it. The performance courses offer opportunities for students to engage in the art of performance and to gain credit in department-sponsored ensembles and private instruction. </P><P>Students with some musical background are encouraged to take MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 or MUSI 203 first. MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 can be taken in any order. </P><P>The music department offers extensive performing opportunities open to all qualified students regardless of major. Performance opportunities are offered in the Colgate University Orchestra, Colgate University Choral Ensembles, the Colgate Chamber Players (chamber music) and the Colgate University Concert Jazz Ensemble. (Auditions required for all ensembles) Private instruction in most instruments and in voice is available to students at an additional fee. All of these programs (except private instruction) may be elected on a credit or non-credit basis, and they are open to all Colgate students regardless of major. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>Course classifications: </P><P>History and Appreciation (H&amp;A) Performance (PF) Theory (TH) </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Class of 1909 Music Prize — awarded by the department to &quot;the person who has, during the year, contributed the most to the advancement of the standards of musical performance on the campus." </P><P>The Donald Lloyd Cotton '36 Endowed Prize — established to recognize one or more outstanding student musician(s). Recipient(s) are eligible to submit a proposal for an additional grant that provides financial support for the furtherance of the student's music education. The grant may be used to cover expenses such as the purchase of musical instruments or relevant equipment, private music lessons, music research projects, summer music school, or music festival participation. Grants are awarded based on the merit of the written proposal, demonstrated musical talent, and participation in music department programs. </P><P>The Felix Eyle Memorial Prize in Music — awarded annually to an outstanding violin student at Colgate. The recipient is chosen by the faculty of the music department solely on the basis of talent, not financial need. The student will be featured during a normally scheduled concert. </P><P>The Robert G. Ingraham Memorial Music Prize — established as an annual award to the graduating senior who, in the judgment of the president, dean, chair of the Department of Music, and director of CSLI, did the most to promote and stimulate good music as an undergraduate by voluntary activity, leadership, performance, or participation in the band, orchestra, choir, glee club, or any other musical endeavor, individual or group. </P><P>The Lorey Family Senior Music Prize — established in 2012 by Evan Lorey and Paul Schupf, in memory of Wilhemine and Fred Lorey, and awarded annually to one or more senior majors in music. This award will benefit talented students who excel in the history, theory, and composition of music. </P><P>Transfer or Advanced Placement Credit </P><P>May be given at the discretion of the department faculty to students who have completed music courses at other institutions or taken an AP exam in music. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Candidates for honors in music must </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Have or exceed, by the time of graduation, a major GPA of 3.50 and an overall GPA of 3.20. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Complete an honors project (MUSI 470) with a grade of at least A–. </LBody></LI></L><L><L><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>Pass a general examination in music history and theory.

The required and elective courses are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, representing the various topical and regional interests of Colgate faculty whose specializations include archaeology, art, cultural anthropology, education, ethnomusicology, geography, history, law, literature, and religion. Themes and topics of the major include the integrity, richness, and complexity of Native cultures; the reciprocal impact of contact between Native and non-Native populations in the Western Hemisphere; modes and processes of culture change; cultural disruption, resistance, and vitality; social movements; indigenous ways of knowing; and an understanding of the variety of methodological and theoretical approaches to Native American Studies, including comparisons with other indigenous cultures. A major in Native American Studies provides an excellent foundation for graduate education in the disciplines mentioned, as well as professional work in areas such as contract archaeology, environmental and cultural resource management, government services, non-governmental and non-profit organizations, law, museums, public health, and teaching. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Majors may achieve honors by having, at graduation, a minimum GPA of 3.30 in major courses and a minimum overall grade of 3.00. The candidate for honors also completes a research paper, written either in a 400-level independent study course or revised from a paper written in a 400-level course, or the equivalent, that is arranged in advance as an honors paper in Native American Studies. The honors paper must be judged to be of honors quality by a committee of two professors in Native American Studies, designated by the candidate in consultation with the program director. The candidate works with both professors (adviser and second reader) who are consulted during thesis development and provide comments on at least one substantive draft of the research paper prior to their final evaluation. The candidate for high honors must have, at graduation, a minimum GPA of 3.70 in major courses and a minimum overall grade of 3.00. The candidate for high honors produces a research paper, as described above, which is arranged in advance as a high honors paper. The paper must be judged to be of high honors by a committee consisting of two professors in Native American Studies, designated by the candidate in consultation with the program director. The candidate receives high honors by defending the paper with distinction in an oral examination conducted by at least three professors identified by the Native American Studies Program director. </P><P>Santa Fe Study Group </P><P>An off-campus study group to Santa Fe, New Mexico, is offered to enable a select group of Colgate students to further their understanding of Native American history, archaeology, life, and culture.

Founded with a generous gift of the Cooley family, the program presents a challenging course of study that integrates trans-disciplinary academic approaches to war and peace with research into specific regional conflicts and their aftermaths. The curriculum offers students opportunities to explore, from a global perspective, the complex origins and impacts of violence, the challenges of human security, and the possibilities for promoting and advancing human rights. With its regular symposia, lectures, film screenings, and unique electives, the program is actively involved in promoting the study of peace, conflict, and security at Colgate and beyond. After taking advantage of the distinctive combination of faculty and program resources at Colgate, peace and conflict studies majors have pursued successful careers in various international arenas, including law, government, development, journalism, academe, and the private sector. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Dag Hammarskjd Prize in Peace and Conflict Studies — awarded by the program to the student chosen by the peace and conflict studies faculty from among students with a major or minor or who have taken at least two courses, in peace and conflict studies, given on the basis of outstanding work in the program and usually judged on one specific written work. </P><P>The Sterling Prize — established in honor of John F. (Jay) Sterling '68, to recognize excellence in international studies and a personal commitment to peaceful cooperation among nations. The prize is awarded annually to a Colgate student whose academic work in international economics, politics, or culture exemplifies Jay Sterling's spirit of endless curiosity, university interest, and constructive work. </P><P>The Clarence Young Award — awarded in memory of Clarence W. Young, a member of the psychology department from 1929 to 1971. Established as an award for academic excellence in peace and conflict studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Majors may qualify for departmental honors by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.50 in major courses and an overall GPA of 3.30. For high honors, Majors must achieve a GPA of 3.70 in major courses and an overall GPA of 3.30 by graduation. Students who expect to qualify and who seek honors or high honors enroll in PCON 499 upon completing PCON 479. Students enrolled in PCON 479 who fail to receive a grade of A– or higher on the seminar paper may not enroll in PCON 499 without the written permission of the program director. Candidates for high honors must have grades of B- or better in all Cluster 1 courses. Working with a principal adviser and a second reader, the student writes and submits a substantial paper for this course and orally defends it before the program faculty. The designation &quot;honors,&quot; &quot;high honors,&quot; or neither, is determined at the conclusion of the defense by the PCON faculty and in consultation with second readers external to the program when applicable. This paper must be a substantially different, revised, and expanded version of the student's PCON 479 seminar paper. Honors and high honors projects should demonstrate the ability to work creatively and independently and to synthesize theoretical, methodological, and substantive materials in peace and conflict studies. Such a project should be planned and initiated in the fall term of the fourth year (or earlier), with the research and final writing completed in the spring term when the student is enrolled in PCON 499. Majors seeking to qualify for high honors in peace and conflict studies are required to demonstrate competency in a foreign language equivalent to two semesters at the 200 level. A student pursuing a double major and enrolling in the honors seminar may petition to have two courses count for both majors. </P><P>Off-Campus Study </P><P>The Peace and Conflict Studies Program strongly encourages majors and minors to participate in Colgate study groups, extended studies, or approved programs, especially in regions relevant to their Cluster 3 geographic area. Students should consult with their PCON advisers and the director, as well as the Office of Off-Campus Study/International Programs, regarding approved off-campus study options, credit approval, and application guidelines. See Off-Campus Study for additional information. </P><P>Related Activities </P><P>The academic program in peace and conflict studies is supplemented by activities coordinated by the director and the program faculty. In addition to lectures, films, and conversations with visiting scholars, the program hosts and sponsors seminars, field trips, conferences, workshops, and collaborative research with </P><P>U.S. and international partners. For more information and current details, refer to the program web page. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the PCON program. As an interdisciplinary program, select courses from other departments/programs may also count toward the PCON major and minor requirements. Use the major/minor links below to find other courses that count toward these requirements.  </P><P>Peace and Conflict Studies Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The major consists of 11 courses, taken in four clusters: </P><P>Cluster 1 (Core Approaches) – These three courses serve as a foundation for the program, introducing students to critical perspectives on the study of peace and conflict. </P><P>Cluster 2 (Elective Offerings) – These four elective courses allow students to develop substantive knowledge of key thematic and topical issues and methodologies within the broader interdisciplinary field of peace and conflict studies. Two of these courses must be at the 300 level or higher. </P><P>Cluster 3 (Geographic Area of Specialization) – PCON majors take three courses related to a specific geographic region to broaden their knowledge and to ensure in-depth understanding of particular regional conflicts. </P><P>Cluster 4 (Thesis) – PCON majors, normally in the fall of their fourth year, will take one course (PCON 479) to develop a thesis project that integrates and synthesizes the knowledge gained in Clusters 1–3. </P><P>Major credit will be awarded for no more than two courses taken at another institution, and no more than one independent study course in the program. </P><P>Only one course from a PCON major can be counted towards any other major or minor. This course should be approved by the student's PCON faculty advisor in order to make sure all applicable major and minor requirements are being met for successful completion and graduation. PCON majors are strongly encouraged to consult with their PCON faculty advisor at least once each semester. </P><P>Cluster 1 – Core Approaches (3 Courses) </P><P>Students are strongly encouraged to take all three core approaches courses during their first and second years, and should have completed all Cluster 1 courses before taking the PCON 479 Research Seminar in the fall of their fourth year. These courses may be taken concurrently or in any order. </P><P>Required Courses </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PCON 111 - Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PCON 218 - Practices of Peace and Conflict: War in Lived Experience </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PCON 225 - Theories of Peace and Conflict: War, State, and Society </LBody></LI></L><P>Cluster 2 – Elective Offerings (4 Courses) </P><P>To deepen and develop their knowledge of issues, methodologies, and current debates in peace and conflict studies, students take four elective courses (see list below). </P><P>These courses help students develop substantive knowledge of key issues/topics in the field. Courses in Cluster 2 expose students to a range of methodologies for studying peace and conflict, engage new and established frameworks for study and understanding, and incorporate critical approaches to theorizing the field. Courses in Cluster 2 deal with war, armed conflict, and genocide, transnational and human security issues, the lived experience of collective violence, and human rights and structural violence in broadly interdisciplinary ways. A student pursuing a double major with another department or program may use one Cluster 2 elective to count for both majors. At least two of these courses must be taken at or above the 300 level. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ANTH 245/SOCI 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CORE S138/138S -

To develop this knowledge base, students are required to take three approved courses on the politics, culture, history, geography, or economics of a geographic region chosen from the following: </P><P>A. Central America, the Caribbean, and South America </P><P>B. North America </P><P>C. West, East, Central, and Southern and Sub-Saharan Africa </P><P>D. Europe </P><P>E. The Middle East and North Africa </P><P>F. Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia </P><P>G. Asia and the Pacific Rim </P><P>H. Transregional Communities Students may take Cluster 3 electives concurrently with courses in Clusters 1 and 2. Other courses, including Liberal Arts Core Curriculum courses, off-campus studies courses, and 300-or 400-level language courses, may count toward the geographic areas requirement, if approved by the program director. Many courses can count for Cluster 3 for each of the regions listed. Students should consult their PCON adviser about specific courses across the curriculum and off campus which may satisfy this requirement. Approved study abroad programs will normally provide two course credits towards this part of the major. Whenever possible, students should declare their area of geographic specialization and seek approval for Cluster 3 courses prior to the start of their senior year. The &quot;Transregional Communities&quot; designation (see above) applies to a thematic course of study on issues such as displacement, forced migration, or refugee and diaspora communities. </P><P>Cluster 4 – Thesis (1 Course) </P><P>To complete the thesis requirement, students must enroll in PCON 479 in the fall semester of the fourth year. In order to advance to the thesis, students should have completed all of the Cluster 1 requirements and taken as many classes as possible in Clusters 2 and 3. Theses developed during the research seminar may be on any topic, but students are expected to integrate expertise in their Cluster 3 geographic area of specialization in their final submissions. </P><P>Declarations </P><P>Students can declare a PCON major at any time. Prospective majors are strongly encouraged to take and successfully complete (with a grade of C or higher) at least one required Cluster 1 course before making the decision. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Peace and Conflict Studies program page. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>To qualify for graduation, a minimum grade of C is required for all courses taken toward the major. </P><P>Peace and Conflict Studies Program </P><P>For more information about the department, including faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Peace and Conflict Studies program catalog page. </P><P>Peace and Conflict Studies Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>The PCON minor requires six courses. </P><P>Students must take PCON 111 and one other Cluster 1 course (PCON 218 or PCON 225), as well as any four Cluster 2 elective offerings (see list below). </P><P>Minors are strongly encouraged to take two geographic areas courses, unless their major is in a department or program in which they are studying a geographic area. Minors may take PCON 479 as one of their electives, with instructor permission. </P><P>Only one course from a PCON minor can be shared with a major or any other minor. This course should be approved by the student's PCON faculty adviser in order to make sure all applicable major and minor requirements are being met for successful completion and graduation. PCON minors are strongly encouraged to consult with their PCON faculty advisor at least once each semester. </P><P>Geographic Areas of Specialization </P><P>A.

Meyer, Tumulty Associate Professors J. Klein, Witherspoon Assistant Professors Lennertz, Stenberg, L. Tomlinson Senior Lecturer Pendleton </TH></TR></Table><P>Philosophy is a central component of a liberal arts education. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the place of human beings within it. What is the nature of morality? What is free will and are human beings free? What is the relation between mind and body? What, if anything, can we know about the material world? Does God exist? What makes a state just? What makes for a good life? </P><P>In attempting to answer such questions, students of philosophy reflect on both their own responses to these questions and the ways in which past thinkers have defended their answers to them. The process of formulating and testing these answers requires education in logical analysis, reasoned argument, and analytic thinking. In acquiring such education within the philosophy curriculum, students develop their ability to solve problems and to think, read, and write critically — skills that are in high demand in a number of different professions. Philosophy majors go on to successful careers in law, consulting, finance, and medicine. Many have also embarked on academic careers. </P><P>But philosophy is about more than reflection and finding answers. As the love of wisdom, it is also a practice and a way of life, one characterized by openness to viewpoints other than one's own, a willingness to question both received opinions and one's own opinions, and a passionate concern to integrate thought and practice into a meaningful life. </P><P>The department offers a number of courses that serve as gateways to the practice of philosophy. These gateway courses are PHIL 101 - Introduction to Philosophical Problems; PHIL 111 - Ethics; and PHIL 121 -Political Philosophy. Prospective philosophy majors are especially encouraged to take PHIL 101 early in their course of study. Other courses at the 200 and 300 level are either courses in the history of philosophy or courses that focus on problems in specific areas of philosophy. Many of these courses do not have specific prerequisites and are open to all interested students. </P><P>There are two distinct major programs: philosophy and the joint major in philosophy and religion. The department does not offer a minor in philosophy and religion. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>Course classifications: </P><P>Major Figures (MF) Metaphysics and Epistemology (M&amp;E) Value Theory (VT) </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Balmuth Award for Philosophical Engagement — established as an award in honor of Jerome Balmuth for the student who, in the judgment of the department, best exemplifies Jerry's love of philosophy and cultivation of philosophical community at Colgate. </P><P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Awards for Excellence — established as an award for students who, in the judgment of the department, have performed exceptional work in philosophy. </P><P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Award for Postgraduate Study in Philosophy or Religion — established as an award for a graduating senior, for achievement in the study of philosophy and to assist the recipient with postgraduate study in philosophy or religion at a recognized graduate or divinity school. </P><P>The Marion Hoeflich Prize for the best Philosophy Paper in a Foreign Language – established in memory of the grandmother of Richard Klein '78. Awarded to the best philosophy paper in a language other than English, usually written as part of a recognized study abroad program.  </P><P>The Robinson Essay Prize —awarded on the basis of an essay written for a 200- or 300-level course in the department during the previous spring or fall semesters. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>Advanced Placement credit is not offered. Placement into more advanced philosophy courses may be granted to incoming first-year students who have achieved a score of 6 or 7 on the higher-level International Baccalaureate (IB) Philosophy Exam.  </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer credit for graduation requirements may be awarded by the registrar on the basis of course syllabi and requirements and advice from the department. To assess transfer credit for major requirements, however, the same documents plus the student's written work in the course (i.e., exams, papers) must be submitted to the faculty adviser for evaluation. The department chair receives a recommendation and is responsible for deciding whether to award major credit. Normally no more than two transfer credits may count toward major or minor requirements. Students may not receive transfer credit towards 400-level courses. </P><P>Honors </P><P>Philosophy </P><P>A student who wishes to become a candidate for honors in philosophy or who wishes to become a candidate for honors in philosophy and religion by writing on a philosophical theme must seek the approval of a faculty adviser by presenting him or her with a substantial essay that could serve as the basis for an honors project. Normally this will be an essay written for a 300- or 400-level philosophy course, together with a plan for developing the original essay into an honors thesis. If the faculty member and the department's honors supervisor agree that the submitted essay shows promise of becoming a high-quality thesis, the student may register for PHIL 490 with a view to qualifying for honors. </P><P>The independent study should result in a senior thesis. Students writing a senior thesis will give an informal presentation of their work to students and faculty of the department. Students seeking honors must submit their theses to their advisers by the deadline set by the department. If a student's adviser judges the thesis to be of sufficient quality, the student will be invited to stand for honors. (Independent study students who are not invited to stand for honors will still be able to complete their senior theses.) Honors candidates will undergo an oral exam (the honors defense) conducted by the adviser and two additional faculty members during exam week. Ideally the honors defense becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. In addition, an honors candidate must have a GPA of at least 3.40 in the major. </P><P>Philosophy and Religion </P><P>Candidates for honors in Philosophy and Religion normally take an independent study (PHIL 490 or RELG </P><P>490) with their honors adviser during the spring term of their senior year. The honors thesis – a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique – is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser and two other faculty readers decide that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets with their adviser and the two other faculty readers – a committee consisting of Philosophy and Religion faculty – and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in the Philosophy and Religion major. </P><P>Study Group </P><P>During the spring semester, the Department of Philosophy, in conjunction with the Department of Religion, offers a study group at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland's first university, founded in 1410. Other than the director's course, which is offered by a department member, students take courses of their choice from among those offered by the University of St. Andrews, at which they are enrolled for the semester. St. Andrews has a very fine philosophy department and it is a great advantage for majors in both philosophy and philosophy and religion to study there for a semester. The study group is also open to majors from other departments. See Off-Campus Study and Extended Study. </P><P>Philosophy Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>A major in philosophy requires nine courses in philosophy, or ten if the philosophy major is a candidate for honors. </P><P>Though students may take as many 100- and 200-level courses as they wish, no more than three such courses will count towards the completion of the major. The lone exception is PHIL 225 Logic I, which can count towards the major in addition to three other 100- or 200-level courses. Though not strictly required of all majors, PHIL 225, is nevertheless strongly recommended for all majors — especially for students contemplating graduate work in philosophy. Only one of the total number of courses may be an independent study. </P><P>Among the courses for the major, students must complete the following: </P><P>Value Theory (VT) Elective </P><P>At least one upper-level course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 312 - Contemporary Political Philosophy (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 313 - International Ethics (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 329 - Philosophy of Law (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 330 - Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art (VT) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 343 - Topics in Moral Theory (VT) </LBody></LI></L><P>Metaphysics and Epistemology (M&amp;E) Elective </P><P>At least one upper-level course from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 320 - 20th-Century Analytic Philosophy (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 335 - Contemporary Epistemology (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 340 - Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 341 - Philosophy of Mind (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 342 - Philosophy of Language (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 380 - Issues in Epistemology and Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 381 - Issues in Epistemology and Metaphysics (M&amp;E) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>A similar course approved by the chair </LBody></LI></L><P>Major Figures (MF) Elective </P><P>At least one course from the following, should be completed by the end of the junior year: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 301 - Ancient Philosophy (MF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 302 - Modern Philosophy (MF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 303 - Medieval Philosophy (MF) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHIL 304 - Kant and German Idealism (MF) </LBody></LI></L><P>Note: Students planning on pursuing honors should take two courses from Major Figures (MF). </P><P>Philosophy Seminar </P><P>At least one seminar at the 400-level seminar courses, though students are strongly encouraged to take more than one seminar. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>To qualify for graduation, a minimum grade of C is required in all courses taken toward the major/minor. </P><P>Honors </P><P>Students interested in pursuing honors can find the additional requirements on the Philosophy department page. </P><P>Philosophy Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Philosophy department catalog page. </P><P>Philosophy Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>A minor in philosophy consists of five courses in philosophy. The structure of the minor can be specially designed in consultation with a student's adviser in philosophy, or it can have a basic structure of an introductory course (PHIL 101 is strongly recommended), a course in the Major Figures (MF): PHIL 301, PHIL 302, PHIL 303, PHIL 304, a 400-level seminar, and two electives. </P><P>Philosophy Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Philosophy department catalog page. </P><P>Philosophy: Philosophy and Religion Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>A major in philosophy and religion consists of ten courses, eleven for students seeking honors.

Levine, Metzler Assistant Professors Adhikari, Ilie, Tseng </TH></TR></Table><P>Visiting Assistant Professor Isakovic, Shivashankara Instructor Jones </P><P>A student should select a major in the Department of Physics and Astronomy if he or she is interested in fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the nature of the universe, or in practical questions of engineering, applied physics, or space science. To be successful, a student should also enjoy mathematics and quantitative reasoning. More than half of the graduating seniors in this department go to graduate school in various disciplines, and many earn PhDs in physics, astronomy, and engineering. Approximately 25 percent enter technical careers directly after graduation. The others pursue careers in teaching, business (often technology-based), management, medicine, and other areas. </P><P>The department offers several courses of general interest, not intended for majors. These courses are ASTR 101 - Solar System Astronomy; ASTR 102 - Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe; ASTR 230 - Astronomy in Culture ; PHYS 105 - Mechanical Physics I; and PHYS 111 -Fundamental Physics I, PHYS 112 - Fundamental Physics II. </P><P>To be Eligible to Graduate </P><P>To be eligible to graduate with a major in any of the programs of this department, a student is expected to achieve a grade of C– or better in each of the courses offered in the department that are required for the major. There are no exceptions to this policy. Additionally, a student's cumulative GPA for all courses counted toward the major must be at least 2.00. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Edwin Foster Kingsbury Prizes — established as an annual award to those students whose performance and promise is judged by the department to be the most outstanding during the year of the award. </P><P>The Joseph C. Amato &amp; Anthony F. Aveni Award for Student Research — Awarded to those students showing excellence in scientific research. </P><P>The Physics and Astronomy Alumni Awards — awarded by the department to those students majoring in physics and astronomy, who, in the opinion of the department, have made the most significant progress in the study of their major subject and the relations of this science to other fields of learning. </P><P>The Physics and Astronomy Department Founders Award — awarded periodically by the department to a senior who has demonstrated four years of outstanding progress and development of his or her understanding of physics or astronomy. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>Credit for PHYS 111 will be granted to students who score 4 or 5 on the AP Physics 1 exam or the AP Physics C-Mechanics exam. Credit for PHYS 112 will be granted to students who score 4 or 5 on the AP Physics 2 exam or the AP Physics C-E&amp;M exam. Placement into PHYS 232 without completion of PHYS 131 can sometimes be allowed following discussion with the department chair and the PHYS 232 instructor. Department majors who do not complete PHYS 131 will be required to complete an additional upper-level course to meet the major requirements. Placement out of PHYS 232 or PHYS 233 based on high school courses (including AP) is not normally possible. </P><P>Honors </P><P>To qualify for graduation with honors, physics and astronomy-physics students must be invited by the department chair, in consultation with department faculty, to do an honors thesis. Normally, this invitation is extended only after exceptional performance in the capstone course PHYS 410.  </P><P>The following are also required: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>The completion (with a grade of C- or better) of at least two additional 300- or 400-level physics or astronomy courses beyond the minimum needed for the major. PHYS 334, PHYS 336, PHYS 392, PHYS 492, ASTR 312, ASTR 392, and ASTR 492 do not count towards this requirement. With the permission of the chair, a 300- or 400-level course in another NASC department may substitute for one of these courses. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>A cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 in all 300- and 400-level classes taken to satisfy the upper-level course requirements for the major and for honors. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>The completion, defense, and public presentation of an honors thesis. This thesis, to be evaluated by department faculty and an external reviewer, is normally a significant extension of the work completed in PHYS 410. Students normally enroll in PHYS 492 or ASTR 492 during the spring semester of their senior year to complete the work. </LBody></LI></L><P>The department faculty will subsequently determine whether to award honors or high honors. Neither is guaranteed. High honors will be given only for truly extraordinary work. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer of credit for physics and astronomy courses from other colleges or universities requires approval by the department. In particular, summer courses taken with the expectation of transfer credit must be preapproved by the department well in advance of enrollment. Students should be aware that few institutions offer summer equivalents for major-sequence courses other than PHYS 232 and PHYS 233, and also that a grade of C or higher is required to transfer coursework for Colgate credit. After matriculation, no more than 2 transferred course credits may count towards the physics or astronomy-physics major. </P><P>Pre-requisites and Minimum Grade Requirements </P><P>Prerequisite and minimum grade requirements will be strictly enforced for both majors and non-majors. Students who have not taken PHYS 131, and students who have received less than a C- in the lecture portion of PHYS 131, may take PHYS 232 with the PHYS 232 instructor's permission. Otherwise, students will not be permitted to take any department course that has prerequisites before achieving a grade of C- or better in the lecture portion of each prerequisite.  Exceptions will be made to this policy only in extraordinary circumstances. </P><P>International Exam Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., A-Levels, International Baccalaureate) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. </P><P>Related Majors </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Astrogeophysics Major  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Physical Science Major </LBody></LI></L><P>Pre-Engineering Studies </P><P>The department offers two ways to prepare for engineering: major in physics at Colgate and after graduation go to graduate school in engineering, or use one of the combined plans available in the department. To allow a student to combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University. A student may spend three years at Colgate and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan) to earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions. The student may be eligible to continue study for a Master of Science (MS) degree, which can sometimes be completed in as little as one additional year after earning the bachelor's degree in engineering. Eligibility for the MS program is determined by the engineering school. </P><P>It is imperative for students interested in the 3-2 plan to begin the physics and math curriculum in the fall term of the first year. To be eligible for the 3-2 plan, a student must complete all physics major courses through PHYS 336 and PHYS 431 (or PHYS 451), plus one other upper-level physics course to be chosen in consultation with the pre-engineering adviser. </P><P>Prerequisites for admission to engineering schools vary among schools and fields of study; therefore, it is necessary to indicate an interest in pre-engineering to the physics faculty as soon as possible. </P><P>Preparation for Graduate School </P><P>Students intending to pursue graduate studies in physics, astronomy, or engineering should discuss their plans with their major advisers as early as possible. Students who wish to prepare for graduate studies in physics or astronomy should complete PHYS 431, PHYS 432, PHYS 433 and PHYS 434. To enrich the program, a student should choose additional physics and astronomy electives at the 300 and 400 levels. Advanced courses in other science departments, especially mathematics, are also encouraged. </P><P>Teacher Certification </P><P>The Department of Educational Studies offers a teacher education program for majors in physics who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching. Please refer to Educational Studies. </P><P>Astrogeophysics Major </P><P>Director Levine </P><P>The astrogeophysics major is a multidisciplinary program for students interested in the study of the solar system and planetary matter. Drawing on astronomical observations, physical models, chemical constraints, and geological interpretations, students consider the Earth in its planetary context, the processes that have shaped Earth and other planets through time, and our place in the Universe. Students learn to appreciate or participate in the ongoing discovery of planets throughout the galaxy, and to reflect critically on their similarities with and differences from our own world. Astrogeophysics majors develop intellectual tools from across the physical sciences to reason qualitatively and quantitatively about global issues, such as the accelerating pace of global change and planetary habitability. Interested students should consult the program director as early as possible to plan an appropriate sequence of courses, since many of the required courses have prerequisites. </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The requirements for the major are as follows: </P><P>Physical Science </P><P>One introductory course with a grade of C– or higher, from the following list: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 101 - Solar System Astronomy </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 102 - Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CHEM 101 - General Chemistry I and CHEM 101L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CHEM 102 - General Chemistry II and CHEM 102L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>CHEM 111 - Chemical Principles and CHEM 111L  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 101 - Environmental Geology and GEOL 101L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 105 - Megageology </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 115 - Evolution: Dinosaurs to Darwin </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 120 - The Geology of America's Parks (Extended Study) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 135 - Oceanography and the Environment </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 190 - Evolution of Planet Earth and GEOL 190L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 131 - Atoms and Waves and PHYS 131L </LBody></LI></L><P>Two Courses </P><P>Two courses from the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 201 - Mineralogy and Geochemistry and GEOL 201L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 215 - Paleontology of Marine Life and GEOL 215L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 225 - Sedimentology and Surficial Processes and GEOL 225L </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 235 - Tectonics and Earth Structure and GEOL 235L </LBody></LI></L><P>All of the Following </P><P>All of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 161 - Calculus I </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 163 - Calculus III </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 232 - Introduction to Mechanics and PHYS 232L  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 233 - Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism and PHYS 233L  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>MATH 162 - Calculus II or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 205 - Mathematical Methods of Physics </LBody></LI></L><P>Astrophysics </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 210 - Intermediate Astronomy and Astrophysics or </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ASTR 414 - Astrophysics </LBody></LI></L><P>Senior Research </P><P>One of the following courses: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>PHYS 410 - Advanced Topics and Experiments </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>GEOL 441 - Senior Research Seminar </LBody></LI></L><P>Advanced Courses </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One additional advanced astronomy course (300 or higher) </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Three additional advanced courses chosen from the following:  </LBody></LI><L><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>physics or astronomy (300 or higher) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>o </Lbl><LBody>at least one course from geology (250 or higher) </LBody></LI></L></L></L><P>o chemistry (300 or higher) Students should select these courses in consultation with the academic adviser and/or the astrogeophysics program director.

The curriculum includes courses in the principal fields of the discipline, including American and comparative government and politics, international relations, and political theory. Through coursework and independent study projects, students confront some of the enduring questions of politics while studying political institutions, processes, behavior, and theory. Internships in Washington on the D.C. study group combine rigorous analysis of politics and government with direct exposure to Congress, the national executive, political parties, interest groups, think tanks, and media. Similarly, study and internships in Geneva, Switzerland, on the department's other study group, provide students with the opportunity to travel widely in Europe and to become immersed in the world of international organizations. The honors colloquium, in addition, offers students the opportunity to conduct significant research under the supervision of a faculty member. Students who major in political science are likely to be well prepared for future careers or graduate study in such fields as law, public service, international affairs, business management, teaching, journalism, and many others. </P><P>Course Information </P><P>Course classifications: </P><P>American politics (AM) Comparative politics (CO) International relations (IR) Political theory (TH) </P><P>Awards </P><P>Colgate's chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha is a national honorary society that recognizes the accomplishments of undergraduate political science students. </P><P>The Dr. William L.

Storing Memorial Award — established as an annual award to a senior political science major for superior academic achievement. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>Advanced placement credits are not accepted for credit in the political science major or minor programs. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Colgate students planning to study off-campus or abroad: The department will accept for major credit a maximum of two political science courses taken at other institutions. Only one transfer credit will be accepted toward the minor. These courses must have been approved for transfer credit by the Colgate registrar and by the member of the Department of Political Science designated to evaluate them. In all instances, courses accepted for major or minor credit must be comparable in quality, quantity of reading and writing, and scope of coverage to courses offered in the department. Transfer credits will not ordinarily be offered for POSC-100 level courses or POSC 232. 400-level courses will not be accepted under any circumstances. Students who anticipate applying for major or minor credit for a course or courses to be taken at another institution should consult with the department's transfer credit representative before enrolling elsewhere. </P><P>Students transferring to Colgate from other universities: The department will accept for major credit up to four political science courses at the 100-, 200- or 300-level taken at a student's prior academic institution. Up to two courses may be accepted toward the minor. In all instances, courses accepted for major or minor credit must be comparable in quality, quantity of reading and writing, and scope of coverage to courses offered in the department. 400-level courses will not be accepted under any circumstances. Transfer students who anticipate applying for major or minor credit for a course or courses they have already taken at another institution should consult with the department's transfer credit representative before declaring political science as their major or minor.  </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Students with outstanding records in political science may pursue honors. To qualify, a student must have, at graduation, an overall GPA of 3.40 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 in the eleven or more courses taken to satisfy the major requirement for honors. A student must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium (POSC 498 and POSC 499). Major credit and grades used in determining departmental GPA will be awarded for both courses. Each student in the fall while enrolled in POSC 498 will complete an in-depth written literature review of his or her subject of interest; then, in the spring while enrolled in POSC 499, students will write a lengthy thesis. Each course is graded separately, but enrollment in POSC 499 is contingent on the successful completion of POSC 498, and the recommendation of the seminar director and the student's primary adviser. Although these courses are designed for and required of those hoping to stand for honors or high honors at graduation, neither is restricted to them; rising seniors with a strong interest in some area of political science and a proven academic record of accomplishment who would like to explore further a chosen area of research in a collaborative environment should also consider enrolling. It is critically important that juniors interested in doing an honors thesis in their senior year, speak both with their advisers and members of the faculty conducting research in an area of common interest while searching for a primary adviser to guide their independent research during their senior year. </P><P>All students who have successfully completed the honors sequence will be eligible for honors or high honors. Whether a student receives honors or high honors ultimately depends upon the outcome of their thesis research. To be awarded honors, a thesis must be judged superior both by the faculty member guiding the student's research and the seminar director of POSC 499. A thesis judged by these readers to be potentially worthy of high honors will, with the agreement of the student, be submitted to a third reader. An oral defense will then be scheduled at which time the student is examined both on the content of the thesis and his or her knowledge of the general field of inquiry. The three readers then make the final decision as to whether the student will receive high honors at graduation. </P><P>Related Majors </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Asian Studies Students may select a topical major in Asian studies with a focus on India, China, or Japan, including related departmental courses in political science. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>International Relations Students with a singular focus on the international political realm take, in conjunction with those in political science, courses in the languages, economics, history, and allied fields. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Peace and Conflict Studies Students interested in this major may enroll in the interdisciplinary Peace and Conflict Studies Program. </LBody></LI></L><P>Study Groups </P><P>Washington </P><P>The Washington Study Group, conducted in the spring term each year, provides a unique opportunity for a select group of Colgate students to study the working processes of the American national government at close range. See &quot;Undergraduate Program&quot;. Study group members take four courses during their term in Washington, one of which is an internship. Students receive three course credits toward completing the political science major (POSC 410, POSC 412, and POSC 414) and one university credit toward graduation (POSC 413). Prerequisites: POSC 150, POSC 210, or POSC 211. </P><P>Geneva, Switzerland </P><P>The Geneva Study Group, conducted in the fall and/or spring terms of each year, provides a rewarding opportunity for a highly select group of Colgate students to study the workings of international organizations, the politics of the European Union and of Western European nations, and other related matters while living and traveling in the heart of Western Europe. Intensive language and cultural immersion in a French homestay, and internship opportunities working in international and non-governmental organizations are important parts of the program. </P><P>At least one college-level French course is a prerequisite. Study group directors may specify other prerequisites, but as a general rule students are required to take POSC 232 prior to the start of the program. Students are also strongly encouraged to take at least one other political science or history course in the politics, culture, history, international relations, or economies of Europe. </P><P>For further information, please see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>Political Science Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>Normally, no more than two independent study courses or political science courses taken on an off-campus study group are accepted for major credit. For the two study groups sponsored by the Department of Political Science, in Geneva, Switzerland, and in Washington, D.C., up to three course credits may automatically be applied toward fulfilling departmental major credit. For more information about transfer credit, refer to the Political Science Department page. </P><P>For students electing a double major in political science and international relations, no more than two courses may be counted for completion of both majors. For students seeking a major in political science and a minor in international relations, no courses may be double-counted. </P><P>No course with a grade below C will count for major credit. </P><P>The requirements for a major in political science are as follows: </P><P>Political Science Courses (ten) </P><P>American Politics </P><P>One of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 150 - America as a Democracy (AM) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 210 - Congress (AM) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 211 - The Presidency and Executive Leadership (AM) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 212 - The Politics of Race and Ethnicity (AM) </LBody></LI></L><P>Comparative Politics </P><P>One of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 153 - Introduction to Comparative Politics (CO) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 208 - Comparative Democracies (CO) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 214 - Comparative Politics: East and Southeast Asia (CO) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 215 - Comparative Politics: Middle East (CO) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 216 - Comparative Politics: Latin America (CO) </LBody></LI></L><P>International Relations </P><P>One of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 152 - Global Peace and War (IR) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 232 - Fundamentals of International Relations (IR) </LBody></LI></L><P>Political Theory </P><P>One of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 151 - Politics and Moral Vision (TH) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>POSC 260 - Foundations of Political Thought (TH) </LBody></LI></L><P>Electives </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>One additional political science course at any level </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Four additional 300- or 400-level political science courses </LBody></LI></L><P>400-level Seminar </P><P>One 400-level seminar course.

In consultation with their faculty advisers, students should plan course sequences that fulfill major requirements while allowing them, if so desired, to develop particular interests in some depth while still gaining a well-rounded grounding in the discipline. All majors are encouraged, as well, to take electives in other closely allied social sciences. </P><P>The 100-level courses are designed for students likely to major in other fields of study as well as those considering a major or minor in political science. The 200-level courses are intended to serve as gateway courses to the major as well as to particular subfields. Both the 100- and 200-level courses, then, serve as general introductions providing a broad foundation in the discipline and are particularly suitable for first - and second -year students. The 300- and 400-level courses are, in most instances, somewhat more demanding and less general than lower-level courses and allow students to explore a specific topic in greater depth. These courses are generally directed, but not limited, to the needs of juniors and seniors. Majors and others interested in one particular area of the discipline, for example in international relations, can take up to seven courses, seminars, or independent studies in that area of interest, especially in classes at the 300 and 400 level. </P><P>Political Science Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Political Science department catalog page. </P><P>Political Science Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Normally, no more than one independent study course, transfer credit, or political science course taken while participating in a Colgate off-campus study group (except those study groups sponsored by the Department of Political Science) is accepted for credit toward a minor. Requests for exceptions must be approved in advance by the faculty member designated to authorize transfer credits. </P><P>No course with a grade below C will count as credit for the minor. </P><P>A student may not count courses toward a political science minor, which are being counted toward a major in international relations. </P><P>The requirements for a minor in political science are as follows: </P><P>The minor consists of five political science courses. Of these five courses, two must be at the 100 or 200 level and three must be at the 300 or 400 level. The two 100- or 200-level courses cannot be from the same subfield of the curriculum. They must be from two of the following: American politics (AM), comparative politics (CO), international relations (IR), and political theory (TH). </P><P>Political Science Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Political Science department catalog page. </P><P>Psychological and Brain Sciences </P><Table><TR><TH>Faculty </TH></TR><TR><TH>Professors Braaten, B.

As a discipline, it is dedicated to identifying and understanding basic and complex processes including sensation and perception, learning and memory, thought and language, motivation and emotion, development, personality, psychopathology, and social interaction. These processes are examined from a variety of levels of analysis; from the genetic and neuronal, to physiological and cognitive systems, and to whole organism responses and group interactions. By its very nature, psychological science has relevance to a wide range of practical, human problems. </P><P>The Department of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences is the home of Colgate's interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program. For more information about the Neuroscience program, please visit the Neuroscience program page.  </P><P>Psychological Science </P><P>Psychological science offers two introductory courses: PSYC 109, a topics course designed for non-majors, and PSYC 150 - Introduction to Psychological Science.

In consultation with their departmental advisers, majors are encouraged to select a variety of 200- and 300-level courses in order to acquire breadth of exposure to the broad content and methodologies comprising psychological science. All majors, especially those planning graduate study in psychology, are urged to take more courses in the department than minimally required for the major. </P><P>Awards </P><P>Kevin Carlsmith Prize — in recognition of an outstanding senior interested in social, personality, or clinical psychology. </P><P>The Sarah Kulkofsky Award — established in memory of Sarah Kulkofsky '02, to be awarded each year to an outstanding senior interested in cognitive or developmental psychology. </P><P>The Phil R.

Religion courses offer training in a unique combination of skills, including close textual analysis, direct observation, critical thinking, and cross-cultural understanding. </P><P>The department offers a variety of courses regarding diverse African, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish, and Native American traditions and scriptures. In addition to courses focused on particular traditions, the department also offers courses on the relationship between religion and issues of historic and contemporary importance, such as the environment, terrorism, medicine, gender, and the law. </P><P>The study of religion is necessarily interdisciplinary, making reflective use of the full variety of liberal arts methods. In addition, it engages related issues in philosophy, ethics, society, spirituality, science, gender, sexuality, arts, and politics. Thus, a major or minor in religion may serve as a natural complement to other majors. Students in the arts and humanities, for instance, will find that the study of religious texts and worlds affords them greater insight into literature and visual art. Some students may seek to make stronger interdisciplinary connections. In consultation with an adviser, students may elect to create a track through the religion major or minor that brings their work in religion into dialogue with their work in other departments or programs. Possible tracks include: </P><P>Religion, Politics, and Law </P><P>The department offers courses that examine the intersection of religion and politics, past and present, explore the legal frameworks of a variety of religious traditions, and ask students to think about the role of ethics and morality in public life. Students interested in history, international relations, peace and conflict studies, or political science will find that a minor or second major in religion allows them a better understanding of many of the longstanding ideological conflicts that have shaped the contemporary world. </P><P>Religion and Health </P><P>Students interested in the natural sciences who intend to enter the fields of medicine and health sciences will find that courses in religion equip them to evaluate the moral complexity of current scientific advances. A host of religion courses probe questions that are central to medicine and health: questions of body and soul, psychic states and mindfulness, sex and sexuality, life and death. These are treated in a variety of religious traditions, offering the pre-med student a comparative approach to health and healing. </P><P>The success of our graduates indicates that a major in religion provides excellent preparation for a number of careers, including education, government, journalism, finance, law, social work, and professional service in non-profit organizations and religious institutions. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Awards for Excellence — established as an award for students who, in the judgment of the department, have performed exceptional work in philosophy and/or religion. </P><P>The M. Holmes Hartshorne Memorial Award for Postgraduate Study in Philosophy and/or Religion — established as an award for a graduating senior, for achievement in the study of philosophy and/or religion and, depending on financial need, to assist the recipient with postgraduate study in philosophy, religion, or philosophy and religion at a recognized graduate or divinity school. </P><P>The Robinson Essay Prize — established in honor of Joseph Robinson and awarded on the basis of an essay written for a 200- or 300-level course in the department during the previous spring or fall semesters. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>Advanced Placement cannot be presumed since examinations in this area are not given </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Transfer credit for graduation requirements may be awarded by the registrar. Transfer of credit toward major or minor requirements requires prior written permission from both the registrar and the department. Normally no more than two transfer credits may count toward major or minor requirements. Seminar credit is not transferable. </P><P>Honors </P><P>Religion </P><P>All candidates for honors in religion who wish to write on a religious theme are required to take an advanced course in religion in the fall of the senior year. At the end of the course, the faculty member may recommend that a student's paper be reworked into an honors thesis. </P><P>In the spring of the senior year, candidates for honors normally take an independent study (RELG 490) with their honors adviser. The honors thesis — a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique — is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser decides that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets during exam week with his or her adviser and two other faculty readers and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in his or her major. </P><P>Philosophy and Religion </P><P>Candidates for honors in Philosophy and Religion normally take an independent study (PHIL 490 or RELG </P><P>490) with their honors adviser during the spring term of their senior year. The honors thesis - a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique - is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser and two other faculty readers decide that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets during exam week with his or her adviser and the two other faculty readers - a committee consisting of Philosophy and Religion faculty - and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of </P><P>3.40 in the Philosophy and Religion major. </P><P>Study Groups </P><P>During the spring semester the Department of Religion, in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy, offers a study group at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland's first university, founded in 1413. Other than the director's course, which is taught by a Colgate faculty member, students take courses of their choice from among those offered by the University of St. Andrews, at which they are enrolled for the semester. For more information see Off-Campus Study and Extended Study. </P><P>Religion Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>A major in religion consists of ten courses, a minimum of eight of which must be departmental courses.

Language courses work to improve students' abilities in speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing in French, Italian, or Spanish, while providing an introduction to culture. Structured in levels of increasing complexity, literature, film or theater courses foster the improvement of analytical and critical skills, an enhanced aesthetic appreciation of works of literary, cinematic or theaterical works, and a broader understanding of linguistic and cultural diversity. Many of the courses offered in the department may be taken by students who do not plan to major in French or Spanish but who would like to maintain or develop their knowledge of these languages and cultures. Given the multicultural nature of the United States today, familiarity with a second language and culture will enhance a student's preparation for a career in any profession. Advanced study of Spanish (300 level and higher) makes the student eligible for the intimate contact with a foreign culture available through the department's study group abroad. A major in French or Spanish can be particularly useful in the fields of law, business, international trade, journalism, education, and public administration. </P><P>The department offers majors and minors in both French and Spanish, but not in Italian. Courses counting toward these majors are conducted entirely in the appropriate language. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence in French Studies — awarded in recognition of consistently outstanding performance in French. </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Italian Studies — awarded in recognition of consistently outstanding performance in Italian. </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Spanish Studies — awarded in recognition of exceptional contributions to the life of the Spanish program within the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. </P><P>The Charles A. Choquette Memorial Prize — established in honor of Charles Choquette, professor of French and Spanish from 1927 to 1967 and chair from 1953 to 1962. This prize is awarded to one or more students for excellence in French language and literature. </P><P>David B. Jutten Prize for Romance Languages — established in 1914 for a prize for excellence in Romance languages. </P><P>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </P><P>University credit is automatically granted to entering students who achieve a score of 4 or higher on AP examinations in French language and Spanish language or literature. Major credit is granted for a score of 5. </P><P>The following course equivalents are established: In French, language grade of 4 = 202; language grade of 5 = 361. In Spanish, language grade of 4 = 202; language grade of 5 = 361; literature grade of 4 = 202; literature grade of 5 = 202, and exemption from a major credit at the 350 level. </P><P>Students with an AP language grade of 3 may take FREN 202 or SPAN 202 or higher. Students with an AP language or literature grade of 4 or higher must register at the 300 level to continue their study of French or Spanish. No more than two AP or transfer credits, or combination of the two, may be counted for a French or Spanish major or minor. </P><P>No more than one major or minor credit may be transferred from an approved program. To be accepted, such courses must be comparable in quality and scope to courses offered at Colgate. Students who hope to transfer a credit from an approved program must provide the department chair with documentation about the course for approval prior to enrolling in that program, and may be asked to present their work to the chair for evaluation upon return. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>French </P><P>Departmental honors requires a cumulative GPA of 3.00 and an average in all major courses of 3.30. After selecting a topic and adviser, the student registers for FREN 490 during one of the semesters of the senior year and writes a paper of significant length and depth. The quality of the paper determines whether the student receives honors (A– or higher required). </P><P>Departmental high honors requires a cumulative GPA of 3.00 and an average in all major courses of 3.70. After selecting a topic and adviser, the student registers for FREN 491 in the seventh term in order to compile a bibliography, gather materials, and begin the preparation of a thesis. The student then registers for FREN 490 in the eighth term in order to complete the thesis. The final version serves as the basis for an oral examination by three or more members of the faculty. The quality of the thesis and of the oral defense determines whether the student receives high honors (A or higher) or honors (A–). </P><P>A 490-course registration must be in addition to the minimum major requirement. The expected length of an honors paper or high honors thesis is established by the adviser in consultation with the department chair. </P><P>Spanish </P><P>Departmental honors requires a cumulative GPA of 3.00 and an average in all major courses of 3.30. After selecting a topic and adviser, the student registers for SPAN 490 during one of the semesters of the senior year and writes a paper of significant length and depth.

In order to be eligible, a student must satisfactorily complete at least one 350-level survey and SPAN 361. </P><P>The study group experience is an integral part of the Spanish program, and all qualified majors are expected to participate. Preference is given to majors and minors, but qualified non-majors are encouraged to apply. </P><P>The department has established the following policies for its study group in Madrid: two credits toward the Spanish major or minor may be earned; students must register for a full load of courses; students may not take a fifth course; all courses must be taken for a standard letter grade. Only in unusual circumstances will the department chair grant exceptions to these rules. </P><P>Italy </P><P>Several university departments, including the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, collaborate in organizing the Venice Study Group. Basic Italian language knowledge required for application. Eligibility may also be gained in other ways. </P><P>For more information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>La Casa Pan-Latina Americana </P><P>Students have an additional opportunity for language and cultural study through residence in La Casa Pan-Latina Americana. The house provides a focal point for Latino students and a way for other students to share cultural knowledge and language skills. </P><P>Language Placement Regulations </P><P>Students wishing to continue a Romance language studied in secondary school should register for the appropriate courses indicated by the prerequisites. For help determining placement see Language Placement or Course Descriptions. Credit will not be granted to a student taking a course at a lower level than a course for which the prerequisites have been completed. Written permission from the department chair is required for an exception to this regulation. In all matters of language placement, the department makes the final determination. </P><P>French Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>A major in French is a program of study of French language and literature.

Nakhimovsky Associate Professor Erley Lecturer Domashenko Visiting Assistant Professor Shpylova-Saeed </TH></TR></Table><P>Russian and Eurasian Studies (REST) is a multi- and interdisciplinary program that aims to give students an understanding of the history, politics, environment, and culture of Russian, East European and Eurasian places, along with proficiency in the Russian language. Students in this program benefit from the expertise of instructors in diverse fields, including literary and cultural studies, art history, anthropology, history, geography, Jewish studies, environmental studies, and political science. Prospective majors, and those with an interest in Russian language, should begin REST 121 as soon as possible. The major requires a minimum of two years of language. Students who continue into advanced Russian are encouraged to spend a semester in Russia on one of Colgate's approved programs. Courses throughout the curriculum are interdisciplinary and culminate in a senior seminar in which majors pursue advanced research in a collaborative environment. Many of our students choose to combine Russian and Eurasian studies with a second major or minor in history, political science, international relations and other fields. Recent graduates have found work in government, journalism, law, NGOs, education, finance, and many other fields; some have gone to the Peace Corps, and a significant number have pursued graduate study. </P><P>Language Placement and GPA Requirements </P><P>Students with two or more years of high school Russian, and students who have taken an introductory level summer session course at another university, will normally matriculate into REST 122 or REST 201. Students with such previous Russian study, transfer students with coursework in Russian, and students from Russian-speaking families (heritage speakers) should consult with faculty for advice on placement. </P><P>An average of C (2.00) is required for graduation in the major or minor. All REST courses taken at Colgate are counted toward the cumulative grade. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Robert L. Murray Award in Russian and Eurasian Studies — awarded by the program for excellence and originality in Russian and Eurasian studies at Colgate. </P><P>The Albert Parry Prize — awarded by the program for contributions to the Russian and Eurasian studies community. </P><P>The Richard Sylvester Award for First-Year Students — awarded by the department to a first-year student who has demonstrated superior progress and promise in Russian and Eurasian studies. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>A minimum overall GPA in the major of 3.30 for honors and 3.70 for high honors is required, plus a written thesis of 40 to 60 pages. Students who write an honors thesis are required to complete an honors independent study (REST 490) in the semester following the senior seminar. </P><P>Study Abroad </P><P>The Russian and Eurasian studies faculty and Off-Campus Study/International Programs have collaborated to identify a small number of approved programs for students with at least two years of college Russian who wish to spend a semester in Russia.

These disciplines are concerned with analyzing and understanding the social structures and values that shape our lives, as well as the institutions and social forces of our own and other societies. The major in sociology or anthropology provides an excellent preparation for graduate study and a variety of careers, including law, education, business, public policy, communication, journalism, health, counseling, and social work. Sociology and anthropology graduates also pursue careers in local, national, and international nonprofit organizations. The department offers two majors, an Anthropology Major and a Sociology Major. </P><P>In keeping with the University's policy, no declarations of major or minor will be accepted after the fall full-term withdrawal period of a student's senior year. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>See the Anthropology Major and the Sociology Major pages for honors and high honors information. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Award for Excellence in Sociology and Anthropology — awarded by the department to a student on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework within the department. </P><P>The Ramshaw Service Award — established by Warren C. and Molly Ramshaw. Warren Ramshaw taught in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology from 1961 to 1992. The award is presented to an undergraduate student in recognition of outstanding community service and academic achievement. </P><P>Off-Campus Study </P><P>Students are strongly encouraged to expand the scope of their academic experiences by studying off campus. SOAN faculty help guide each student toward the off-campus study experiences that complement and build on his or her overall course plan; we encourage students not to think of off-campus study as a semester-long break from Colgate but rather as a way to enhance on-campus course work. Students often use off-campus study as a way to collect data for use in senior seminars and honors projects. Since Anthropology majors are encouraged to complete fieldwork, off-campus study can often be rewarding and useful in this way. More information on off-campus study can be found on the Sociology and Anthropology web page. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Sociology maintains a list of summer and study abroad programs offering courses that are equivalent to departmental standards. These are the only programs that the department accepts transfer credits from. Sociology majors may use two transfer credits to satisfy their elective requirements; sociology minors may use one. The following courses cannot be transferred for major credit: SOCI 101, SOCI 201, SOCI 250, SOCI 453, SOCI 494, and SOCI 495. Exceptions for students transferring to Colgate from another college or university are made on a case-by-case basis. </P><P>Anthropology will accept for major credit no more than two courses taken at another institution and no more than one independent study course in the department, except in special circumstances as approved by the department. </P><P>The Longyear Museum of Anthropology </P><P>The Longyear Museum of Anthropology enhances the teaching and research facilities of the department. The museum, founded in 1965 and named after Dr. John M. Longyear III, professor of anthropology, emeritus, contains archaeological, ethnographic, and contemporary art collections from a wide range of cultures around the world. The collections of African art, Canadian First Nations art, Haudenosaunee archaeological materials from central New York, and the central Mexican (Guerrero) stone sculptures are extensive. </P><P>Students may take advantage of the resources of the museum in a variety of ways. ANTH 253 - Field Methods and Interpretation in Archaeology (RI) and ANTH 300 - Museum Studies in Native American Cultures  offer students the opportunity to become acquainted with the museum holdings and to carry out research projects on selected collections of artifacts. Students may also arrange independent studies working with the museum collections and receive credit in either the Department of Sociology and Anthropology or in the Native American Studies Program, which is sponsored by the Division of University Studies. Students are encouraged to inquire at the office of the curator of the Longyear Museum of Anthropology concerning independent studies projects in cultural anthropology or archaeology, as well as for information concerning museum internship programs and opportunities in museum studies and summer programs in archaeological or ethnographic fieldwork. </P><P>Related Majors </P><P>The sociology and anthropology department, along with departments in the social sciences, arts and humanities, and natural sciences, offers an interdisciplinary major in Native American Studies with a study group in Santa Fe. </P><P>Anthropology Major </P><P>Anthropology is the study of human beings in all their complexity. The scope of anthropology is truly global, as it aims to describe and analyze the full diversity of the human experience and cultural creativity across time and space. Anthropology recognizes that human beings are, simultaneously, social actors who create cultures and the products of those cultures. Using a broad array of research methods, including participant-observation and archaeological excavation, anthropologists investigate the historical composition of societies, their transformations, and their contemporary forms. We seek to understand the commonalities and differences in the identities, experiences, and beliefs of people around the world. We connect the details of people's everyday lives to large-scale social systems and cultural forces and reveal that seemingly innate or natural differences among human groups are the result of historical, social, and political-economic processes.  </P><P>The curriculum integrates classroom and out-of-classroom learning, encouraging students to pursue off-campus study and independent fieldwork or research with collections. Students are encouraged to engage in hands-on learning activities: anthropological and/or archaeological research, and/or community-engaged learning. </P><P>Students in the Class of 2021 can find the previous major requirements in the 2018-2019 University Catalog. </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The anthropology major consists of 9 courses.

For example, cultural anthropologists take seriously the idea of fieldwork and participant observation over an extended period of time, and often in places where one engages significant cultural differences. Therefore, students are encouraged to seek anthropology-approved off-campus study opportunities that feature: home stays, coursework in a second language, independent research projects, and/or different community service learning opportunities. Students are also encouraged to seek off-campus opportunities that involve ethnographic or archaeological fieldwork, or work in museum exhibits. All research intensive activities form part of students' cumulative curricular experience that will prepare them for the senior thesis seminar. </P><P>To meet the Research Intensive component outside of courses, students may seek approval from their anthropology adviser to satisfy this area with one of the following activities: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Interning in Colgate's Longyear Museum of Anthropology during the academic year or summer. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Working with faculty on funded summer research projects (subject to department approval) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Participating in other off-campus anthropology approved programs that involve opportunities for substantial experiential learning and/or independent research (subject to department approval).

We encourage students to work closely with faculty to explore multiple ways of fulfilling this requirement. </LBody></LI></L><P>Thesis </P><P>To complete the thesis requirement, students must enroll in ANTH 452 in the fall semester of the senior year and must have completed the following requirements: ANTH 102, ANTH 103, ANTH 211 or ANTH 253, and the additional Research Intensive component. Students are expected to design substantive research projects grounded in recent anthropological theory and relevant literature on their topics and collect and analyze appropriate ethnographic or cultural data. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>To qualify for graduation, a minimum GPA of 2.0 is required in all courses counting toward the major. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Majors may qualify for honors in anthropology by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.50 in all departmental courses and an overall GPA of 3.30, or for high honors by achieving at graduation a GPA of 3.70 in all departmental courses and an overall GPA of 3.30, and submitting a thesis judged by department faculty to be worthy of honors or high honors. </P><P>Any student in the junior year who believes he or she will reach the qualifying GPA is strongly encouraged to discuss potential honors or high honors projects with departmental faculty. All seniors will normally enroll in ANTH 452 - Senior Seminar in Anthropology in the fall of their senior year and begin work on a thesis of their own design. To continue to pursue honors or high honors, students must receive at least an A- on the final thesis of the senior seminar. Those students pursuing honors or high honors will significantly revise and expand their seminar theses by enrolling in ANTH 495 - Independent Study for Honors and High Honors, in the spring semester (if a substantial number of students are pursuing honors and high honors in a given year, the group may be organized into a formal honors seminar). They will work with a primary advisor and a secondary reader to complete the project. </P><P>Certification of honors and high honors is primarily based on the quality of the written thesis and participation in a public presentation. To receive honors, a three-person faculty committee must determine that it is strong </P><P>in each of the following areas: asking and answering a clear anthropological research question, engaging deeply with social theory, collecting and analyzing empirical materials, and writing in a well-organized and professional style. To receive high honors, the committee must determine that the thesis is excellent in each area. Note: ANTH 495 is an additional requirement for students pursuing honors and high honors and cannot be counted as one of the electives required for the major. </P><P>Sociology and Anthropology Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Sociology and Anthropology department catalog page. </P><P>Anthropology Minor </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>Required Courses </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ANTH 102 - Culture, Diversity, and Inequality (completed by the end of the sophomore year with a grade of C or better) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>ANTH 103 - Introduction to Archaeology (completed by the end of the sophomore year with a grade of C or better) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>Three additional ANTH electives, at least 2 must be at the 300 level </LBody></LI></L><P>The department will accept for minor credit no more than one course taken at another institution and no more than one independent studies course in the department, except in special circumstances as approved by the department. </P><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>A minimum GPA of 2.00 is required in all courses counting toward the minor. </P><P>Sociology and Anthropology Department </P><P>For more information about the department, including Faculty, transfer credit, awards, etc., please visit the Sociology and Anthropology department catalog page. </P><P>Sociology Major </P><P>Sociology is the scientific study of the organization and functioning of societies, their major institutions, groups, and values. Sociologists are particularly interested in understanding and explaining social issues and problems, and the sources of stress and change in contemporary and historical societies. Our courses provide students with critical perspectives on a wide range of major social issues, including social inequality, race/ethnicity, gender/sexuality, the media, immigration, social movements, globalization, crime/deviance, education, war, and environmental issues. In addition, students take courses on classical and contemporary sociological theory, research design, and qualitative and quantitative research methods. The culmination of our curriculum is the required senior seminar. This course provides an opportunity for students to draw on their substantive and methodological training to complete an independent research project on a topic of their choice. Students majoring or minoring in sociology go on to careers in fields such as communications, marketing, business, management, education, law, medicine/public health, and the nonprofit sector. </P><P>Students in the Class of 2021 can find the previous major requirements in the 2018-2019 University Catalog. </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The sociology major consists of nine courses, only one of which may be outside of sociology.

Ammerman Associate Professors Benson, Rood (Chair), Stull Assistant Professors Tober </P></Caption></Figure><P>The Department of the Classics offers a multifaceted approach to the ancient Greek and Roman world, with courses not only in language and literature but also history, art, archaeology, religion, politics, philosophy, and anthropology. Students may pursue a major in Latin, Greek, the classics, or classical studies. Majors in Latin, Greek, or the classics make language and literature their main focus; majors in classical studies give less emphasis to the languages but acquire a broad understanding of different aspects of ancient civilization. Recent graduates from the Department of the Classics are pursuing diverse careers in fields such as law, medicine, advertising, computer science, and education. Many, too, have gone on to do graduate work in classics or related disciplines. </P><P>CLAS 221, CLAS 222, CLAS 230, CLAS 234, CLAS 235, CLAS 236, and CLAS 237 require no knowledge of Greek or Latin language. These courses are open to all students, but are subject to limitations in enrollment set by the instructor. </P><P>Major Programs in the Classics </P><P>There are four possible majors in the classics: Greek, Latin, the classics, and classical studies. All majors require a minimum of eight courses within the department but vary in the amount and level of language study required. In addition, all majors require the senior seminar (CLAS 401), taken in the fall of senior year. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Newton Lloyd Andrews Prize — established in memory of Newton Lloyd Andrews, a member of the class of 1862, to support the study of the art and monuments of ancient Greece and Italy, Gothic architecture, or Renaissance painting. </P><P>The J. Curtiss Austin Latin Prize — established as a memorial to Dr. J. Curtiss Austin in honor of his 40 years on the Colgate faculty, and awarded by the Department of the Classics to the student whose performance in Latin has been the most outstanding. </P><P>The Award for Excellence — awarded annually to that first-year or sophomore student who shows the best promise in a course in Latin or Greek and who achieves the best record among his/her peers in Latin or Greek. </P><P>The Baldwin Greek Prize — established for the sophomore class for the examination in writing upon some author, or work of an author, read by the class. No student may compete unless his/her standing in all departments averages at least B (3.00). The award is made by a committee not associated with the university. </P><P>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit </P><P>To evaluate a student's qualifications for advanced placement, the department requires the submission of an Advanced Placement Examination in Latin. Students who submit a grade of 4 or 5 and complete LATN 201 or a higher-level course in Latin will receive one credit for LATN 122 for the AP examination that may count toward a major in the department. </P><P>Transfer credit for a major is granted for courses comparable to those required for the classics major at Colgate on an individual basis. Evidence of course content may be required. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>The minimum departmental GPA required for honors in the classics, classical studies, Greek, or Latin is 3.50; for high honors 3.80. In addition, successful completion of an honors thesis and an oral examination is required. Honors candidates usually take CLAS 490, GREK 490 or LATN 490 in the fall of their senior year while writing their theses. Proposals for theses should be prepared in the spring of the junior year in consultation with the thesis adviser. Theses are then revised during the first half of the spring semester of the senior year and defended in April. </P><P>Extended Studies </P><P>Greece </P><P>The department offers students who are enrolled in GREK 121 or who have completed GREK 122 (or higher), an opportunity to explore the material culture of Greece through a course that culminates in a three-week trip to Greece in May. For further information, see the course descriptions of CLAS 251 and CLAS 251E and consult with a faculty member in the department. </P><P>Rome and Pompeii </P><P>The department offers students who are enrolled in LATN 122, or have completed LATN 122 (or higher), an opportunity to explore the material culture of Rome and Pompeii through a course that culminates in a three-week trip to Italy in May. For further information, see the course descriptions of CLAS 250 and CLAS 250E and consult with a faculty member in the department. </P><P>Sicily and Southern Italy </P><P>The department offers students who are enrolled in, or have completed, GREK 121 or LATN 122 (or higher), an opportunity to explore the material culture of Sicily and Southern Italy through a course that culminates in a three-week trip to Italy in which students participate in excavations at the Graeco-Roman site of Paestum in May. For further information, see the course descriptions of CLAS 253 and CLAS 253E and consult with a faculty member in the department.  </P><P>The Venice Study Group </P><P>The Venice Study Group offers majors who have had one or more years of Latin or Greek at Colgate the opportunity to explore sites and monuments of the classical world. The archaeology of Italy forms a major component of this interdisciplinary study group. For further information, see Off-Campus Study. </P><P>Classical Studies in Rome </P><P>The department is a member institution of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, which offers a full schedule of classics- and archaeology-related courses each fall and spring.

The Department of Theater educates students in the interdisciplinary practice of theater through required courses in acting, directing, stagecraft, and stage design, as well as elective courses in playwriting, screenwriting, and dance. Students also study theater as a social and cultural institution through courses in theater history and dramatic literature. Each semester, the department mounts a major production in the University Theater, directed either by a member of the theater faculty or a distinguished guest artist. Theater courses and University Theater productions are open not only to theater majors and minors but to all students on campus. </P><P>Theater students at Colgate learn by doing in the intellectually and physically rigorous environment of studio courses, rehearsals, and public performances. The curriculum transcends the artificial split of mind and body, encouraging students to develop skills in both logic and intuition that apply to any field of endeavor. A major or minor in theater fosters students' ability to read closely, think critically, and communicate clearly --not only through speech and writing, but also through embodied presence. Students of theater are trained to integrate analytical, physical, emotional, and interpersonal intelligence in a way that few other courses of study demand. </P><P>By making and studying theater, Colgate students act out a variety of perspectives on the world, learning to problem solve and self-start through immersion in the challenges of the creative process. Students have opportunities both to lead and to collaborate. Graduates regularly pursue successful careers not only in theater but also in communications, media, business, law, and technology. Students interested in majoring or minoring in theater should discuss their plans with an adviser, and consider courses in music, art and art history, film and media studies, English, foreign languages and cultures to complement their theater education. </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Howard W. and Anne T. Pike Memorial Prize—awarded annually to a graduating senior for outstanding achievement and contribution to the University Theater program. </P><P>Advanced Placement </P><P>The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. </P><P>Transfer Credit </P><P>Because transferred courses must conform in content and rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in theater at another institution must meet with the department chair before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for a theater course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The department chair grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>Seniors with an average GPA of 3.5 or above in courses counted toward the Theater major may apply to pursue an honors project. The application process for honors will be discussed in THEA 495 - Senior Seminar in Theater. Proposals for honors projects should build on the student's previous work in the Theater major. Proposals are normally due in October and must be approved by the Theater faculty. </P><P>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in THEA 496 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates in Theater, during the spring term of their senior year. This course will ordinarily take the form of an independent study with the supervisor of the student's honors project. THEA 496 must be taken in addition to THEA 495 and to the minimum number of courses required for the Theater major. Students must complete their honors projects by a date specified by the Department of Theater. If the Theater faculty approves a completed project for honors, the student receives a grade in THEA 496. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the final project is not approved for honors, THEA 496 is converted to THEA 491 - Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the student's faculty supervisor. Students are awarded high honors on the basis of the quality of their chosen artistic project, thesis, and the oral presentation. </P><P>Students with further questions should contact the chair of the Department of Theater. </P><P>Preparation for Graduate Study </P><P>Students interested in graduate study should consult with their advisers and the department chair early in their programs to be advised about preparation for advanced work. The department also designates special advisers to meet with students interested in graduate work, and informational meetings are held to help juniors and seniors plan their applications for fellowships and graduate admission. </P><P>Theater Major </P><P>Major Requirements </P><P>The minimum of nine courses must include the following: </P><P>Acting and Directing </P><P>All of the following: </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 254 - Acting I (should be completed by the end of the sophomore year.) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 354 - Directing I </LBody></LI></L><P>Theater History and Dramatic Literature </P><P>Two courses (one of these courses should be completed by the end of sophomore year): </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 266/ENGL 266 - Introduction to Drama </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl></Lbl><LBody> THEA 267/ENGL 267 - Modern Drama </LBody></LI></L><P>Stagecraft and Design </P><P>Two courses (one of these courses should be completed by the end of sophomore year): </P><L><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 250 - Stagecraft </LBody></LI><LI>Choose one of the following: </LI></L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 252 - Scenic Design </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 253 - Costume Design </LBody></LI></L><P>Electives </P><P>Two additional full-credit courses (or the equivalent of two full credits): </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 246/FMST 246 - Introduction to Performance Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 252 - Scenic Design </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 253 - Costume Design </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 257 - Theater for Young Audiences Workshop </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 259 - Performance I </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 270 - Introduction to Dance Studies </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 273/ALST 273 - Contemporary African American Drama  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 276 - Playwriting I </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 321/ENGL 321 - Shakespeare </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 322/ENGL 322 - Shakespeare </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 332 - Theater and Performance: London and the International Stage (Study Group) </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 349/ENGL 349 - Global Theater   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 350 - Theater Practicum </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 351 /ENGL 351 - American Theater   </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 353 - Theater, Play, and Improvisation </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 355 - Acting II </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 358 - Narrative Screenwriting </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 359 - Performance II: Performance Creation Studio </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 363 - Narrative Improvisation and Storytelling </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 376/ENGL 376 - Playwriting II  </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 454 - Directing II </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 458 /ENGL 326 - Shakespeare's Contemporaries </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 491 - Independent Study </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>THEA 496 - Special Studies for Honors Candidates in Theater </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>With the permission of the director of the department chair, drama courses in other languages, selected courses in art and art history (such as ARTS 221, ARTS 287, and ARTS 322), and selected courses in music may also count towards the theater major. </LBody></LI></L><P>Senior Seminar </P><P> THEA 495 - Senior Seminar in Theater </P><P>Backstage or Technical Work </P><P>A total of 40 hours of backstage or technical work beyond what is required in any theater courses.

Women's studies understands the complexity of human lives as gender interconnects with sexuality, race, class, ability, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and age in the constitution of experience and identities. Centering underrepresented voices and knowledge, our students analyze how social power and cultural norms shape the ways in which class, gender, race, and sexuality assign value to bodies, and why this matters. </P><P>The program is interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from different disciplines to encourage critical engagement with all forms of experience from feminist perspectives. Interdisciplinarity leads students to question existing frameworks, concepts, and methods, enabling them to understand better both the past and the contemporary world while also envisioning a future beyond traditional roles and inequities. In other words, Women's Studies classes teach students to unlearn what they have been taught about institutions, people and places, a valuable lifelong skill.  </P><P>Women's Studies courses are anchored in five pillars: praxis, self-reflexivity, intersectionality, gender lens, and context. In emphasizing interdisciplinarity, the program helps students acquire the intellectual and praxis-based tools to allow them to critically analyze the societal, cultural, global, and personal issues that shape their lives, and challenge them to look at these issues from multiple perspectives and with a gendered lens, across time and space. </P><P>Program courses are intersectional, meaning we encourage students to reflect on the ways in which knowledge is produced within different, intersecting, and oftentimes unrecognized systems of oppression and to examine categories that are presented as natural and permanent in their cultural and historical context. In this way, the  program prioritizes self-reflexivity. Lastly, the program aims to help students acquire the skills of critical analysis and imagine alternatives that challenge the naturalizing of inequalities, by reading deeply and writing well as the basis of praxis. Our senior capstone experience invites majors and minors to move from theory to practice, and translate their values into a final praxis project that can generate dialogue and action in their communities. </P><P>Honors and High Honors </P><P>To be considered for Honors, concentrators must have a cumulative GPA of 3.30 in Women's Studies. Students who choose to pursue honors must announce their intention to do so by submitting proposals preceding their final term of study at Colgate. Additionally, these honors projects must be completed and approved by faculty sponsors and by the Women's Studies director. High honors in women's studies may be awarded to successful honors candidates who have been invited to present the results of their written projects in oral form to the women's studies faculty.

With roots in ancient Greece and branches in the most recent media technologies, rhetoric is simultaneously one of the oldest and newest academic disciplines, fundamentally engaging with language, power, and public culture. </P><P>As a discipline, rhetoric demonstrates how discourse generates knowledge, mediates power, and enacts social change; as an art, rhetoric enables the speaker/writer to invent arguments by making logical, ethical, and emotional appeals to an audience. The department offers courses in writing, public address, and the history and theory of rhetoric and language. </P><P>Courses in writing and rhetoric position students to become critical language users, preparing them to be effective communicators both in their future careers and in civic society, in the US and abroad. </P><P>The Writing Requirement </P><P>If notified at the time of admission, students may be required to complete one of the department's eligible 100-level writing courses with a grade of C or better before the end of their fourth semester. Other students may be assigned first priority in registering for introductory writing courses based on need and interest </P><P>Awards </P><P>The Joseph '63 and Carol Trimmer Awards for Excellence in Expository Writing — established as prizes to be awarded by the Department of Writing and Rhetoric. </P><P>The Trimmer Senior Scholar Award for Outstanding Achievement in Writing and Rhetoric — established as a prize to be awarded by the Writing and Rhetoric department to a senior for being an exceptional scholar and citizen in the discipline of Writing and Rhetoric. </P><P>Courses </P><P>The courses listed below are offered by the WRIT program. Select courses from other departments/programs may also count toward the WRIT minor requirements. Use the minor link below to find other courses that count toward these requirements.  </P><P>Writing and Rhetoric Minor </P><P>The minor is designed to enhance students' ability to think and write critically as they explore the connections between the theory and practice of rhetoric. Students in the minor demonstrate proficiency at crafting a suitable message as they deepen their understanding of rhetoric as an art and as a disciplinary subject of study. A minor in Writing and Rhetoric provides valuable intellectual resources and practical skills for students across the curriculum who are considering careers that call for excellence in speaking and writing. The minor is also ideally suited for students with interest in public life and civic responsibility in the evolving context of a global culture. </P><P>For more information about the department, transfer credit, etc., visit the Writing and Rhetoric department page. </P><P>Minor Requirements </P><P>With a variety of course options available, students are encouraged to tailor their minor to fit their individual interests, career goals, and majors. Students should seek advice from a member of the department when planning their course selections. The minor requires a minimum of five courses selected from the list below. No more than one course may be at the 100 level, and at least one course must be at the 300 or 400 level. A course taken in fulfillment of the writing requirement may be counted toward the minor. </P><P>Where appropriate, one semester of independent study in writing at the junior or senior level (WRIT 391 or WRIT 491) may substitute for another 300-level course. </P><P>Normally, no more than one course from another department or program may count toward the minor. This course must focus on either language theory or the specialized expository writing of a particular discipline, and will require the approval of the departmental adviser. Examples of possible courses from outside the Department of Writing and Rhetoric include ENGL 374 - Creative Nonfiction Workshop, HIST 199 - History Workshop, and PSYC 355 - Language and Thought. Other courses may be counted toward the minor depending on their curriculum and focus during a particular semester. </P><L><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 102 - Introduction to Rhetoric in the Liberal Arts Tradition </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 103 - Rhetoric and Writing </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 110 - Academic Persuasions: An Introduction to Rhetoric, Research, and the Academic Essay </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 203 - Argumentation </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 210 - The Rhetoric of Style </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 215 - Public Speaking </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 225 - Visual Rhetorics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 231 - Ethos and the Personal Essay </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 232 - Digital Narrative Craft </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 242 - Stand and Speak: Feminist Rhetorics and Social Change </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 248 - Discourses of Race and Racism </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 250 - Kairos: The Art of Rhetoric from Ancient to Modern Times </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 260 - Biblical Rhetoric </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 280 - Rhetorical &quot;Borderlands&quot;: Introduction to Comparative Intercultural Rhetoric </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 303 - The Rhetoric of Data Visualization &amp; Infographics </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 325 - The Narrative in New Media </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 342 - Rhetoric in Black and White: Communication and Culture in Conflict </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 345 - Crafting Bodies: Movement, Gender, and Performance </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 346 - Hip Hop: Race, Sex, and the Struggle in Urban America </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 348 - Discourses of Whiteness </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 350 - Rhetoric &amp; Citizenship </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl> </Lbl><LBody>WRIT 354 - Dialogue and Deliberation in Democratic Life </LBody></LI></L><P>GPA Requirement </P><P>A minimum GPA of 2.00 is required in all courses counted for the minor. </P></Div></Sect></Sect></Sect></Sect></Part></TaggedPDF-doc>
