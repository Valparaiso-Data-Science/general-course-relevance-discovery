Information regarding general and overall guidelines for advanced degrees are <Link>also listed on the Office of the Registrar (http://www.brown.edu/about/ </Link><Link>administration/registrar/degree-guidelines-0/graduate-school/</Link>) website. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><H3>Enrollment and course registration </H3><P>Instructions about enrollment will be sent via Today@Brown prior to the opening of each semester to all students. To complete enrollment, all requirements of the pertinent administrative offices of the University must be met, including registration for courses, payment of accounts, and arrangements for housing as appropriate. Fees will be charged for failure to meet established deadlines. All students must complete enrollment in order to be eligible to remain at the University. </P><P>Students are urged to note carefully the instructions provided at registration in order to assure eligibility for enrollment, proper registration in courses, and to avoid unnecessary payment of Change of Course fees. All registration materials and/or processes are considered official university documents. Any falsification of signatures or other tampering with such forms/processes constitutes a violation of the Academic Code. </P><P>All registration-related deadlines for each semester are listed in the 'Academic Calendar' section of the Bulletin and also on the Office of the Registrar website as well as answers to common registration-related questions. </P><P>For the full text on the Academic Regulations and Instructions for Registration, see the Registrar’s Office web site at: </P><P><Link>http://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/course-enrollment/ </Link><Link>registration (http://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/course</Link><Link>enrollment/registration/</Link>) </P><P>For tutorials on registration, see: </P><P><Link>https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/courses-brown-for-students (https:// </Link><Link>ithelp.brown.edu/kb/courses-brown-for-students/</Link>) </P><P>To access the most up-to-date course information including credit bearing summer session offerings (*The course information in the PDF versions of the University Bulletin and Course Announcement Bulletin is only updated just prior to registration events), see: </P><P><Link> 'Courses@Brown (https://cab.brown.edu/)’ (https://cab.brown.edu/) </Link></P><Sect><H4>Course Credit </H4><P>The semester course is the unit of credit. This is defined as a course taken for the duration of one semester and, for purposes of evaluation, may be considered the approximate equivalent of four semester hours. </P><P>Brown follows the Federal standard that defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than: (1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for each semester, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time (i.e. Summer/Winter Sessions); or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Additionally, transfer credit must equate to the four semester hour standard except for three credit courses taken at the Rhode Island School of Design. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Course Numbering </H4><P>Courses numbered 0001-0999 are strictly for Undergraduate credit (Graduate students may enroll in such courses with the permission of the instructor and the Graduate School.) </P><P>Courses numbered between 1000-1999 are for both Undergraduate and Graduate credit depending on the level of the student's degree program. </P><P>Courses numbered between 2000-2999 are for Graduate credit (Undergraduate students may in enroll in such courses and may be applied towards their Undergraduate degree requirements by permission of the instructor.) </P><P>Courses numbered above 3000 are strictly for credit in the Alpert Medical School. Certain MD level courses may be taken for credit for Undergraduate students enrolled in the PLME program, but such courses do not count towards quantity, concentration, or Latin honors requirements for the Baccalaurate degree. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Maximum Course Load and Auditing </H4><P>No student enrolled in The College or the Graduate School may enroll for more than five Brown credits in a semester. A degree candidate paying full tuition (4 or more enrollment units per semester) and is enrolled in less than five academic credits may be permitted to audit (see below section on auditing) additional course(s). At no time may a student be registered for more than 5 credits/courses including audits. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Enrollment Without Academic Credit </H4><P>Auditing. An auditor is a student who is registered in a course without earning academic credit upon successful completion under the following conditions: (1) the student must be properly registered for it; (2) the student must pay the usual course fee except as indicated in the next paragraph; (3) the student is entitled to all instruction in the course, including conferences, the criticism of papers, tests, and examinations. </P><P>Any student registered on a full-time basis may be permitted to audit additional courses in any semester without charge. The total number of course registrations, including audits, may not exceed five credits. Non-degree or student paying less than four enrollment units of tuition may choose to audit if they so choose, but the student does so with the understanding that they will pay the equivalent rate as if registered for academic credit. </P><P>With the concurrence of the instructor, the fact that a course has been audited shall be entered on the permanent record of any student electing this privilege. The status of a course in which a student has registered may not be changed from audit to credit after the fourth week of classes or from credit to audit after midsemester. </P><P>Vagabonding. A “vagabond” is a student who, with the permission of the instructor involved, visits a given course occasionally or regularly without payment of fee. It is understood that such a student shall be entitled to participate in classes and activities, including discussions, conferences, and papers, only at the pleasure of the instructor. </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H3>Attendance, Grading, Examinations Attendance </H3><P>It is in the interest of every student to attend all sessions of the classes in which registered, and each student has an obligation to contribute to the academic performance of all by full participation in the work of each class; however, within such limits as are necessary for the general welfare, a student benefits also from exercising discretion and assuming responsibility for his or her educational progress. </P><P>Accordingly, unless the instructor imposes attendance requirements, students are not limited with respect to the number of absences from a course. When, in the instructor’s opinion, a student is abusing the privilege of voluntary attendance, the appropriate dean’s office should be notified so that appropriate action may be taken. </P></Sect><Sect><P>A student is always fully responsible for any course work missed because of absences and will be assigned failing grades in final examinations missed without excuse from the dean’s office. </P><P>No student organization shall make any appointment for undergraduates which conflicts with college exercises unless permission has been obtained from the dean. </P></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4>Grading System </H4><P>At the end of each semester final grades are given in semester courses. In all courses, except those designated by the instructor as Mandatory Satisfactory/No Credit, a student may, in consultation with the advisor, elect to be graded on a basis of either Satisfactory/No Credit or A, B, C/ No Credit. A student must for every course taken indicate by the end of the fourth week of the semester which basis for grading is elected. </P><P>Any student regularly enrolled in a course, no matter whether for A, B, C/No Credit or for Satisfactory/No Credit, may request from the instructor a more detailed written evaluation of his or her work. (See Course Performance Report below.) Such supplemental evaluations are intended primarily for the information of the student and do not replace departmental evaluations. </P><P>No Credit. This grade is given when courses are not satisfactorily completed. The notation No Credit, and the description of the course in which it is given, are not entered on the official academic transcript. </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Courses may be designated to be graded on a Mandatory Satisfactory/No Credit basis for all students enrolled on the initiative of the instructor. The designation of a course by an instructor to be graded S/NC only must be announced no later than the first day of classes and entails the responsibility for providing Course Performance Report forms to all students who request them. An asterisk shall accompany the listing on the transcript of any course that has been designated by the instructor to be graded on the basis of S/NC only, with an appropriate explanation of the symbol provided. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>In exceptional circumstances, a course may be left incomplete (except for a regularly scheduled final examination—see paragraph 3 below), with the instructor’s consent. In such cases, a grade of INC will be assigned provided that the student has filed a request for extension of time to complete the work of the course and the instructor has consented to such a request. Unless an earlier date is specified by the instructor, grades of INC must be made up as follows: for Semester I, by midsemester of Semester II; for Semester II or the for-credit 7 week Summer Session, by the first day of Fall semester. Extensions beyond semester in which the course left incomplete was taken may be granted by the instructor who will indicate this in writing to the registrar. A course not completed by the designated time will be assigned a grade of NC unless the instructor indicates that sufficient work has been completed to justify course credit by submitting, as appropriate, a grade change from INC to A, B, C, or S. A grade of NC assigned in accordance with these procedures may be changed subsequently, but no later than one calendar year after the end of the semester in which the course was taken. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>If a student is absent from a regularly scheduled final examination for a course, the instructor should submit either an INC or an NC . If the absence from the examination is excused by the dean, the student will be permitted to take a Special Examination and the original grade will be made into an ABS temporarily. The Special Examination will be administered by the Office of the Registrar in accordance with the provisions in the Faculty Rules for such examinations, unless other arrangements are agreed to by the instructor and the student, and communicated to the registrar. If the absence from the final examination is not excused by the dean, the student will receive no credit for the course. </LBody></LI></L><P>Year Courses: A year course is one in which both halves must be passed in order to get credit for the entire year. The grade at the end of the first semester is normally a temporary one. Neither semester may be elected independently without special permission. The final grade submitted at the end of the course covers the work of the entire year and is recorded as the final grade for both semesters. It is normally expected that the second half of a year course will be completed in the second semester of the same academic year in which the first half was taken. If the second half of the year course is not completed at the end of that academic year, the grade for the first semester will become a No Credit. If the student completes the second part of the year course during a later academic year, he or she may need to notify the Registrar's Office, in order to reactivate the first part of the course. </P><P>In registering for the second half of a year course, students must register for credit if the first half was taken for credit. Similarly, if registered for audit in the first half, the second half of the course registration must also be as an audit. Exceptions must be approved by both the academic department and the Committee on Academic Standing. </P><P>Repeating Courses: Unless a course is explicitly approved by either the College Curriculum Council or Graduate Council as being able to be repeated for credit, Once course credit has been earned with an initial passing grade A,B,C, or Satisfactory (S) or through Transfer Credit it cannot be officially registered for again for in an effort to improve one's initial grade. </P><P>Grade Requirements for Advanced Degrees: A minimum grade of either Satisfactory or C in a 1000 or 2000 level course carries credit toward all advanced degrees. Individual departments may, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council, set higher grade requirements. </P><P>Advanced degree candidates may be required to register in courses primarily for undergraduates (numbered 1–999); these courses do not carry advanced degree credit. On occasion, however, and with approval of the student’s department and the dean, a student may register for such a course with extra work for advanced degree credit. This course then has the same standing as a 1000-level course and an EX is noted on the transcript. This provision for extra work does not apply to courses of the level of 1–999 taken for graduate credit by students in MD program. </P><P>Course Performance Reports: Any undergraduate student regularly enrolled in a course, no matter whether for A,B,C/No Credit or for Satisfactory/No Credit, may request from the instructor a more detailed written evaluation of the student's work by way of a Course Performance Report (Note: This form is available online for currently enrolled undergraduates via Advising SideKick (ASK)). Course performance reports provide valuable information to students about their success in meeting course learning objectives, especially for courses graded S/NC. The instructor may decline to submit such a form if they fell they have inadequate information to do so. The deadline for requesting a Course Performance Report is the day before the final exam period begins in the semester of enrollment in the course (Refer to Academic Calendar for relevant deadlines). Late Course Performance Reports may be requested after the deadline and before a student graduates, but the instructor is not obligated to complete a late report. Students may not request a Course Performance Report after completing their degree requirements (although they may contact an instructor directly for a letter of recommendation or a reference at any time). Copies of Course Performance Reports are made available to: (1) the student, (2) the dean's office, and (3) the student's concentration advisor. While not part of the official record, Course Performance Reports may be sent out from the University at the student's request as part of an official transcript request as long as the student provides such copies to the Office of the Registrar when making the initial transcript request. </P><P>Transcripts: Requests for transcripts must be made electronically. For <Link>further information please visit the Office of the Registrar’s website (http:// </Link><Link>www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-transcript</Link><Link>requests/</Link>). Transcripts will be issued only if all financial obligations to the University have been met. </P><P>An official transcript consists of a copy of the permanent record listing courses passed and grades received. A statement is added to all transcripts explaining the grading system and indicating that the student may elect to include other material with the official transcript. The student should choose this material in consultation with his or her advisor. The University will mail this material in one envelope along with the official transcript. </P></Sect><Sect/></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4>Examinations </H4><P>A final, written examination (at the end of each semester) shall be given in each course numbered under 2000 unless the instructor of a particular course decides to use some other mode of final evaluation. If the written examination is not to be used, the mode of final examination which is to be used shall be made known to the students in the course no later than midterm and, in addition, the department and the registrar shall be informed. </P><P>Final Examination Schedule: A pre-defined period at the close of each semester is provided for final examinations for those courses for which such an examination is scheduled. Two examination periods are scheduled for each day. The examination group is determined by, in most cases, the offering time associated with the course (indicated by the figure in parentheses) and also as displayed on Banner Web. The schedule for 2022-2023 is as follows: </P><Table><TR><TH>Semester I, 2022-2023 </TH></TR><TR><TH>Date </TH><TH>9 am Group </TH><TH>2 pm Group </TH></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 13 T </TH><TD>10 </TD><TD>9 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 14 W </TH><TD>4 </TD><TD>13 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 15 Th </TH><TD>14 </TD><TD>11 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 16 F </TH><TD>16 </TD><TD>18 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 17 Sat </TH><TD>2 </TD><TD>1 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 18 Su </TH><TD>17 </TD><TD>7 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 19 M </TH><TD>15 </TD><TD>12 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 20 T </TH><TD>5 </TD><TD>3 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Dec. 21 W </TH><TD>6 </TD><TD>8 </TD></TR><TR><TH>Semester II, 2022-2023 </TH><TD/><TD/></TR><TR><TH>Date </TH><TD>9 am Group </TD><TD>2 pm Group </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 10 W </TH><TD>7 </TD><TD>11 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 11 Th </TH><TD>10 </TD><TD>13 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 12 F </TH><TD>6 </TD><TD>17 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 13 Sat </TH><TD>8 </TD><TD>14 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 15 M </TH><TD>3 </TD><TD>16 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 16 T </TH><TD>15 </TD><TD>2 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 17 W </TH><TD>12 </TD><TD>9 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 18 Th </TH><TD>4 </TD><TD>5 </TD></TR><TR><TH>May 19 F </TH><TD>1 </TD><TD>18 </TD></TR></Table><P>Exam Excuses: The Office of the Dean of the College is solely responsible for determining whether a student’s absence from a final examination is excused. To ensure equitable treatment of all students, students are excused from exams only for family or medical emergencies. Please note that students’ travel plans are never an excuse for missing a final exam. Faculty wishing to grant a student an exam excuse may contact the appropriate academic deans authorized to grant exam excuses. In emergency situations, students who are unable to contact their professors must contact the Office of the Dean of the College, which will determine whether or not an exam excuse is warranted. Course instructors are notified of exam excuses granted by the Dean of the College Office. </P><P>Consistent with Brown’s policy on nondiscrimination, students who are unable to take a final examination due to religious observance may arrange to take their final at an alternate time. Students who cannot take a final exam on the scheduled date due to a religious observance must inform the instructors of any conflicts within the first four weeks of the term. In such cases, instructors are expected to offer a final exam on an alternate date within the same semester, noting the policy in the Faculty Rules that final examinations may be given only during the final examinations period.

The Registrar's Office informs students by email of the date, time, and location of make-up exams. </P><P>Placement and Achievement Tests in Foreign Languages. Placement tests in the foreign languages are given during Orientation Program in the fall and during the first week of classes in each semester. </P><P>All students, before taking college courses in a foreign language in which they have presented entrance credit, must take either a placement test at Brown University or, preferably, a College Board Language Achievement Test in secondary school. Students with outstanding performance on these tests, or on the Advanced Placement Tests of the College Entrance Examination Board, may be admitted to advanced courses without the usual course prerequisites. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Student Code of Conduct Academic Code Violations </H4><P>All cases of academic dishonesty among undergraduates, graduate, or medical students, as defined in the Academic Code at Brown University, shall be referred to the dean of the College, Graduate School, or Medical School, or his or her designated representative. A student accused of such an offense shall be notified in writing as soon as possible of the specific charge or charges against him or her before his or her case is considered. The student shall be given the opportunity of a hearing before the designated representative of the dean of the College, Graduate School, or Medical School, and two members of the faculty, at which all relevant facts may be presented. A student shall have the right to appeal any decision to the dean of the College, Graduate School, or Medical School within five business days after receipt of the official letter outlining the case and the decision reached. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Code of Student Conduct </H4><P>Brown strives to sustain a learning environment that supports individual exploration. Central to this effort are the four primary Principles of the Brown University Community: individual integrity, respect for others, respect for University resources, and respect for the values of teaching, learning and scholarship. Our community believes that adherence to these principles supports the overall academic mission of the University. Violations of these principles will be handled through the procedures governing the Academic Code and the Code of Student Conduct. These procedures are designed to address behaviors that impede the educational activity of the University or that infringe upon the rights of others. </P><P>Student Conduct cases are administered by the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards. </P><P><Link>Specific hearing procedures can be found online at www.brown.edu/randr </Link>(<Link>http://www.brown.edu/randr/</Link>). </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H2>Curricular Programs </H2></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4 id="LinkTarget_124768">Collaborative Research and Scholarly Experiences </H4><P>Collaborative Research and Scholarly Experiences (COEX) engage groups of students in addressing a research question or knowledge gap of interest to scholarly communities. Typically, a COEX course would engage students in: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>Research practices authentic to the discipline (e.g., by asking questions, using the tools of the discipline for gathering and analyzing data, developing and critiquing interpretations and arguments). </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>Discovery, or exploration of ill-structured questions where the outcome is not known to the students nor the instructor, and there is the potential for generating new knowledge or insights. </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>Creating work that has potential impact beyond the classroom (e.g., through reports for an outside organization, authorship or acknowledgement in a potential publication, blogs or podcasts distributed beyond the classroom). </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>4. </Lbl><LBody>Collaboration, such as group work, giving and receiving peer feedback, pooling data, and sharing interpretations. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><P>5. Iteration, or processes of revision, learning from failure, and acknowledging and building on other students’ work. </P><P>A complete list of each semester’s COEX courses may be viewed in Courses@Brown by choosing “Collaborative Research and Scholarly Experiences” in the Curricular Programs field. </P></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H4>Community-Based Learning and Research </H4><P>Community-Based Learning and Research (CBLR) courses connect academic inquiry with real-world learning experiences, enabling students to integrate and transfer their learning to contexts beyond the classroom.</P><P> CBLR-designated courses: (i) Involve collaboration with one or more community partners to investigate an important social challenge or problem; (ii) Incorporate in-depth community-based experiences (typically undertaken outside of the classroom) into the learning and/or research objectives of the course; (iii) Provide structured opportunities for reflecting on the relationship between classroom learning and real-world experience, with the goals of deepening the understanding of course content and exploring questions of identity, agency, and social responsibility; and (iv) Create products or outcomes that are shared with the community partner and/or broader public. </P><P>A complete list of each semester’s CBLR courses may be viewed in Courses@Brown by choosing “Community-Based Learning and Research” in the Curricular Programs field. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>First Year Seminars </H4><P>First-year seminars ensure close contact between first-year students and faculty members while simultaneously offering a rigorous introduction to the concepts and methods of a particular subject area or department. Seminars have few if any prerequisites and are offered in all areas of the curriculum, from anthropology to physics to literary arts. Students receive regular feedback on the work they produce for the seminars, and seminar faculty often serve as informal mentors for their students long after the class has ended. </P><P>A complete list of each semester’s seminars may be viewed in Courses@Brown by choosing “First-Year Seminar” in the Curricular Programs field. Registration for first-year seminars takes place during the summer prior to students’ matriculation to Brown. Depending on availability, first-year students may also add seminars to their course schedules during pre-registration and shopping periods. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Race, Power, and Privilege Courses </H4><P>In their content and their objectives, Race, Power, and Privilege (RPP) courses examine issues of structural inequality, racial formations and/or disparities, and systems of power within a complex, pluralistic world. </P><P>RPP courses may investigate: </P><L><LI><Lbl>1. </Lbl><LBody>The ways different forms of power and privilege construct racial and identity formations in the U.S. and/or globally; the cultural, political, and intellectual responses to this racialization; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>2. </Lbl><LBody>How categories of race and ethnicity are produced intersectionally in relation to other hierarchical structures of difference including gender, sexual orientation, class, religion, ability, citizenship status, and geography; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>3. </Lbl><LBody>The structures, institutions, practices, and attitudes that enable, maintain, or mitigate domestic and/or global disparities in health, income, education outcomes, media representations, etc.; </LBody></LI><LI><Lbl>4. </Lbl><LBody>The ways in which disciplinary structures of knowledge have been embedded in such historical formations as racism and colonialism. </LBody></LI></L></Sect><Sect><H4>Sophomore Seminars </H4><P>Sophomore seminars bring together ideas, perspectives, and approaches that are not normally seen side by side in a given course or program. Embracing a range of intellectual perspectives, many of the seminars focus specifically on issues of social justice, identity, and difference. Limited to twenty students each, the seminars help students develop the skills, knowledge, and values they need to progress toward more advanced learning in a discipline or field. </P><P>A complete list of each semester’s SOPH seminars may be viewed in Courses@Brown by choosing “Sophomore Seminar” in the Curricular Programs field. </P></Sect><Sect><H4>Writing-Designated Courses </H4><P>Brown students are expected to work on writing in their general studies and in the concentration. Students may begin to fulfill this expectation by taking at least one course that carries the WRIT designation. WRIT courses are offered across the curriculum and help students develop the ability to write well in styles appropriate to different academic disciplines. </P><P>A complete list of each semester’s WRIT courses may be viewed in Courses@Brown by choosing “Writing-Designated Courses” in the Curricular Programs field. </P></Sect></Sect></Sect><Sect><Sect><H3>Collaborative Research and Scholarly </H3><P>Experiences Fall 2022 Biology </P><P>BIOL 0190R S01 16546 Phage Hunters, Part I Sarah E.

This course introduces students to the vibrant and contested field of Africana Studies by critically exploring and analyzing the links and disjunctures in the cultural, political, and intellectual practices and experiences of people of African descent throughout the African diaspora. Beginning with a critical overview of the history, theoretical orientations, and multiple methodological strategies of the discipline, the course is divided into three thematic units that examine intellectuals, politics, and movements; identity construction and formation; and literary, cultural, and aesthetic theories and practices in the African diaspora. </P><P>Fall AFRI0090 S01 16829 TTh 2:30-3:50(12) (A.

Because of this, the histories we tell are often explanatory. They delineate how we arrived at this moment and tell us which people and what events were most consequential. But what happens when the people who look like you are not part of the story? Or if their inclusion amounts to cameos in support of a larger narrative that ultimately minimizes or ignores their contributions? This course reimagines American history by placing in the foreground the people and events often marginalized or forgotten in traditional appraisals of the past. Through a review of historical sources, literature, oral histories, and evidence found in popular culture, this class offers a more inclusive retelling of the American saga. </P><P>Spr AFRI0130 S01 27362 M 3:00-5:30(13) ’To Be Arranged' </P><P>AFRI 0610. Black Student Protest from Jim Crow to the Present. This is a history-driven class about black student protest. It puts this history in direct dialogue with other kinds of student protests over the long twentieth century. The point of the class is to ground conversations about contemporary protest culture in an historical context that extends well beyond Brown, that moves into the deep history of higher education and education more generally, and that reveals the intersection of protest with other global, national, and local plotlines. It is, as well, meant to think about how all of these histories have been represented popularly and politically in the very recent past. </P><P>Spr AFRI0610 S01 26081 TTh 9:00-10:20(05) (M.

The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions. </P><P>Fall AFRI0670 S01 17750 Th 4:00-6:30(04) (B. Meeks) </P><P>AFRI 0840. Monuments, History, and Memory in the United States. In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, monuments tied to the violent histories of slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy have received renewed interest and debate. Protestors and individuals have defaced, toppled, and petitioned for the removal of Confederate monuments and statues to the white male power elite. This symbolic retributive violence and sometimes ritual care signals a challenge to the long-lived monument. This reading course explores public monuments and the ways in which artists and communities have negotiated history and the politics of memory and remembrance in the United States. We will evaluate the meaning and purpose of monuments that define American public spaces, investigating the problematic narratives and historic controversies surrounding such objects. The removal of monuments asks us to question whose histories have been forgotten, ignored, or suppressed, and what monumental justice might look like. </P><P>Fall AFRI0840 S01 18255 Th 4:00-6:30(04) (R.

The Black Vote: A Critical Interrogation of a Concept. “The black vote” as a concept, simultaneously captures a truth and obscures reality. It reflects the truth that no other racial group comes close to the uniformity of Black Americans’ voting behavior within American electoral politics. Yet, it also obscures the diversity of political opinions and ideological dispositions that animate a dynamic black American public. If voting is an essential means to give citizens voice and their share in self-rule within a democracy, this course explores what it means for the stability of American democracy that the black vote does not reflect the political diversity of the black community.

After a short theoretical introduction, the course will analyze the enslavement of Indigenous peoples and Africans and their descendants as a fundamental instrument of European colonialism and the expansion of capitalism. The following section will describe the role of slavery in the making of constitutional regimes and criminal justice systems across the continent during the Age of Revolutions. Finally, the last classes will focus on the legacies of slavery after emancipation by analyzing phenomena such as lynching, capital punishment, police brutality, and incarceration.

A preoccupation of Africana Studies involves the central, highly contested role of the notion of what constitutes black culture in the modern world. To what degree can we claim aesthetic and other distinctions between black cultures in the Diaspora and other western cultural practices and expressive forms? What role did enslavement, forced migration and segregation play in shaping Africana culture in the modern west? These cultural debates play a central role in literary, musical, philosophical, aesthetic, historical and sociological analyses of the culture of people of African descent frame this graduate course.

From 18th Century slave revolts to the iconic Haitian Revolution, the Grenadian Revolution of 1979 and the 2019 popular uprisings in the Sudan, revolts and revolutions have undoubtedly occupied a hallowed place in the political imaginaries of the Black World. Reading narratives from a select group of instances, we will explore, against the broader theoretical work on global revolutions, the more specific meaning of revolution in Africana history and literature. The overriding question is, in the face of disappointing outcomes, tragedy and collapse, can the history of Black revolt and revolution still provide a framework for thinking about radical change in the 21st Century, or should we move beyond it?

We will discuss readings and documentary films about musical subcultures, media circulation, and how young people make music meaningful in their lives. The course requires critical engagement with a variety of popular music genres and cultures, as well as reflection on our own musical production and consumption practices. Major topics include punk, hip-hop, metal, rock, and club music; popular music and intersectional identity (including race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and disability); fan communities; activist musical collectives; music-sharing technologies; the politics of style; and ethnographic theory and method. </P><P>Fall </P><P><Figure><ImageData src="images/Brown_2022-23-cabXML_img_5.jpg"/>AMST0170DS01 </Figure>16483 TTh 10:30-11:50(13) (K.

This junior seminar will explore public debates shaped by interactions between the everyday worlds of popular culture and the formal spheres of intellectual debate and ideas. Organized around case studies from several periods of U.S. history, the course will examine how key themes in American culture and politics—democracy and capitalism, equality and exclusion, freedom and domination, war and peace, modernity and tradition, empire and internationalism—have been shaped by ideas originating from both popular entertainments and movements as well as the treatises of philosophers, essayists, or reformers. Learning to understand the cultural history of U.S. democracy from above and below will suggest how ideas emerge from both spheres, and will suggest how public conflicts and debates are always about how the “public” was itself constituted across time. </P><P>Fall </P><P><Figure><ImageData src="images/Brown_2022-23-cabXML_img_16.jpg"/>AMST1700RS01</Figure>18104 Th 4:00-6:30(04) (S.

Immigration and the Borders of US Empire. Since the founding of the United States, we have debated and struggled over the contours of American nationhood, who may claim the rights and protections provided by the state, and where the boundaries of inclusion/ exclusion are drawn. This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US’s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the legal production of immigrant “illegality.” Fall </P><P><Figure><ImageData src="images/Brown_2022-23-cabXML_img_30.jpg"/>AMST2221BS01 </Figure>18119 Th 4:00-6:30(04) (R.

In addition to more conventional concerns like racism or immigration, these works also address such issues as empire, war, mixed-race identity, environmentalism, adoption, and sexuality. </P><P>Fall ETHN1750SS01 18105 TTh 10:30-11:50(13) (D.

This undergraduate seminar explores U.S. urban and suburban histories during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, through the concerns of race and ethnicity. We seek to understand how dilemmas over and struggles for belonging and equality in the United States have played out in and over urban and suburban spaces. We will pay particular attention to the histories of segregation, housing discrimination, urban unrest, suburban integration, the rise of “ethnoburbs,” and gentrification. Readings represent foundational texts and new directions in scholarship and provide in-depth examinations of particular urban and suburban communities. Topics include the simultaneous erasure and appropriation of Indigenous peoples in the development of Pacific Northwest cities; the Asian American “model minority” and integration of all-white suburbs; minority grassroots activism and resistance against redevelopment; racism and neoliberal urban governance in the 21st century.

Examining the indiscriminate uses of the concept of culture across disciplines we will endeavor to concentrate on its multiple meanings exclusive to and beyond anthropological discourse. In our effort to analyze how the idea and meaning of culture have been appropriated by other disciplines, we will probe issues of gender and identity, philosophy, literature, politics, race, and ethnicity as well as politics and representation. These are a few of the suggested themes / topics that we will attempt to cover during the semester.

This course is both a study of the evidence used by anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians for reconstructing patterns of war and violence in the past and also the implications for that research on contemporary peoples. Scholars continue to be pre-occupied with the question of whether war and violence has escalated or declined in modern times, often embedding their interpretations in notions of progress and the supposed success of western nation-states in curtailing violence. Less well-acknowledged is both the shakiness of the data on which such claims are made and the stereotyped perceptions they reinforce regarding the peoples subjugated by the colonial powers from which modern nation-states descend.

Rather than seeing the State as a fixed, absolute entity that exists on a separate plane of existence, this course analyzes the state as an effect-producing abstraction that arises in contested circulations of meaningful signs. Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).

As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of &quot;geroscience&quot; – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800. </P><P>Spr BIOL2350 S01 25408 Th 2:00-5:00(11) (J.
