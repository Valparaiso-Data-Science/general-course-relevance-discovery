Among theearliest colleges to be established in the original &quot;Northwest Territory&quot;beyond the Allegheny Mountains and north of the Ohio River, it held itsﬁrst classes during the presidency of Andrew Jackson. The institutionwas ﬁrst called the Granville Literary and Theological Institution, thenGranville College.  In the mid-1850s, in honor of a key benefactor, it tookthe name Denison University.</P><P>Well before it reached its ﬁrst centennial, Denison had gained a reputationfor attracting outstanding professors and college leaders, sending anumber on to advance higher education across the country. The growingacademic reputation of Denison briefly encouraged the faculty andTrustees to offer graduate degrees, but by the early twentieth centuryit was clear that the strength of the institution was in high-qualityundergraduate instruction, and the title &quot;university&quot; was retained primarilyfor historical reasons.</P><P>Focus upon leadership in undergraduate education and commitmentto the residential principle led the college to develop concrete plans forthe physical expansion of the campus and measured growth, with thecollege reaching its present size of about 2,200 students by 1970. In1916, the famed landscape architectural ﬁrm of Frederick Law OlmstedSons produced an innovative design for Denison. The &quot;Olmsted Plan&quot; hasremained the touchstone for the continuing development of the Denisoncampus. Residentiality is a key component of a Denison education,creating a four-year, on-campus living and learning experience forstudents.</P><P>Today's Denison, a recognized leader among 21st century Americanliberal arts colleges, builds upon all of these founding traditions. A non-sectarian institution independent of any denominational afﬁliationsince the 1960s, Denison actively seeks outstanding students fromacross the country and around the world. Denison offers a rich and deepeducation in the natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, ﬁne arts,and interdisciplinary studies, as well as extraordinary campus leadershipopportunities aimed at preparing graduates who will make a difference intheir communities, their country, and the world.</P><P><Link Alt="">Learn more about Denison's history</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/campus/about/our-history/</Link>).</P></Div><P/><H1>Our Mission</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_863">Mission Statement</H2><P>Our purpose is to inspire and educate our students to becomeautonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and active citizens ofa democratic society. Through an emphasis on active learning, weengage students in the liberal arts, which fosters self-determination anddemonstrates the transformative power of education. We envision ourstudents' lives as based upon rational choice, a ﬁrm belief in humandignity and compassion unlimited by cultural, racial, sexual, religious oreconomic barriers, and directed toward an engagement with the centralissues of our time.</P><H2>Guiding Principles</H2><P>Denison's mission statement is supported by the following guidingprinciples:</P><P>Our curriculum balances breadth with depth, building academic specializationupon a liberal arts foundation in the arts, the sciences, the social sciencesand the humanities. Responsive to new ways of learning, we continue todevelop interdisciplinary integration of the many forms of knowledge. Whileour students pursue specialized learning in their chosen majors, they alsodevelop the framework for an integrated intellectual life, spiritually andmorally informed.</P><P>Our faculty is committed to undergraduate education. As teacher-scholar-advisers, their principal responsibility is effective teaching informed by thebest scholarship. Faculty members place a priority on close interaction withstudents, interactive learning, and partnerships with students in originalresearch. Our low student/faculty ratio allows for close supervision ofindependent research and collaborative work in small groups and classes.</P><P>We seek to ensure an ever-broader range of racial, ethnic, international andsocioeconomic backgrounds in a student body of about 2,200 students.We offer different kinds of ﬁnancial aid to meet the different needs of ourstudents.</P><P>The focus of student life at Denison is a concern for the whole person. TheUniversity provides a living-learning environment sensitive to individual needsyet grounded in a concern for community, in which the principles of humandignity and ethical integrity are paramount. Students engage in a wide rangeof co-curricular activities that address the multidimensional character of theirintellectual and personal journey.</P><P>Denison is a community in which individuals respect one another and theirenvironment. Each member of the community possesses a full range of rightsand responsibilities. Foremost among these is a commitment to treat eachother and the environment with mutual respect, tolerance, and civility.</P></Div><P/><H1>Freedom of Expression and AcademicFreedom</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_873">Denison University actively promotes the free expression and exchangeof ideas. Academic freedom is essential to the aims of higher educationand to the University’s goals of fostering critical thinking, moraldiscernment, and active citizenship among its members. It is theresponsibility of the faculty and the administration to protect academicfreedom. Furthermore, because Denison is a residential, liberal artscollege, academic freedom must be extended to all members of theuniversity community in the broadest of contexts. Indeed, academicfreedom is a core value of liberal education and is essential to thetransformative power of that education promised in our missionstatement.</P><P>Academic freedom is the right of all members of the University toexercise the broadest possible latitude in speaking, writing, listening,challenging, and learning. It applies to opinions and inquiry regardingpolitical, cultural, religious, scientiﬁc, and social matters, as well as tothose regarding the University itself and its policies. Academic freedom isespecially critical in the classroom, in research and publication, and in alleducational activities.</P><P>Academic freedom applies to views and ideas that most members ofthe University may consider mistaken, dangerous, and even despicable.The ideas of different members of the University community will oftenconflict, but it is not the proper role of the University to shield individualsfrom ideas and opinions they ﬁnd unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive.Although the University values civility, and although all members ofthe University community share the responsibility for maintaining aclimate of mutual respect, concerns about civility and mutual respect cannever be used as a justiﬁcation for limiting discussion of ideas, howeveroffensive or disagreeable those ideas may be to some members of thecommunity.</P><P>Academic freedom does not, of course, mean that individuals may saywhatever they wish, whenever they wish. The University may prohibitexpression that violates the law, defames speciﬁc individuals, constitutesa genuine threat or harassment, or unjustiﬁably invades substantialprivacy or conﬁdentiality interests. These limitations, however, are narrowexceptions; it is vitally important that these exceptions never be used ina manner that is inconsistent with the University’s commitment to a freeexpression of ideas.</P><P>Members of the University community must act in conformity with theprinciple of academic freedom. Although members of the Universitycommunity are free to criticize and contest the views of others, theymay not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the freedom of othersto express views they reject. To this end, the University has a solemnresponsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debateand deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attemptto restrict it. Such an open exchange of ideas is essential to liberaleducation. (Portions of this statement are from the University of ChicagoReport of the Committee on Freedom of Expression.)</P></Div><P/><H1>The Value of Diversity to a DenisonEducation</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_890">Denison is committed to the idea that our community should includepeople from a wide variety of religious, cultural, ethnic, racial, gender,sexual orientation and socio-economic backgrounds in order to realizethe goals of a liberal arts education. Denison University's commitmentto foster a diverse community is central to our mission as a liberal artscollege to educate critical thinkers, discerning moral agents and activecitizens of a democratic, global society. Through our pedagogies weset out to realize the transformative power of education. Engagementwith, and challenge from, multiple, differing perspectives are incubatorsof critical thinking and social responsibility. Students must learn toquestion the truth of all assertions, no matter how apparently obviousor widely held. The lesson that even one's own most cherished beliefscannot be immune to questioning is crucial. A classroom marked byhomogeneity of experience is one where such a lesson cannot be easilygrasped. While we are committed to multiple forms of diversity, wealso recognize that the dynamics of race play a central role in shapingindividual and collective experience in the United States. It is importantto the realization of our educational goals not only that students haveopportunities to speak about racial, ethnic, and other differences, butthat they also get a chance to speak across these differences. This canonly happen if there is diversity in the classroom and, more generally, inthe college. Diversity in all facets of the university has educational valuefor all students and beneﬁts all members of the campus community.Diversity plays a particularly important role at Denison. In this college,where classes are small and highly participatory, where a fully residentialcampus places students constantly together in living as well as learning,and where a multiplicity of campus-based opportunities in studentorganizational life, athletics and recreation, and social service allowstudents to share personal growth experiences, diversity of backgroundand experience is shared ﬁrst-hand.</P><P>(Adopted by the Faculty Oct. 5, 2006.)</P></Div><P/><H1>Statement on Campus Sustainability</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_893">Denison is a community committed to being environmentally, socially,and economically sustainable. The college is a signatory to both theAmerican College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitmentsand the International Talloires Declaration for a Sustainable Future.

HLC is located at 230 North LaSalle St., Chicago,Ill. 60602 (Ph. 312-263-0456).

Denison's curriculum provides the means by which thesecharacteristics are deliberately nurtured in our students. Our commitmentto a liberal arts education is expressed in the form of General, Major, andElective requirements. Students should anticipate that their curricularexperience will be divided nearly equally among these three spheres.Students work closely with their advisors to fulﬁll these requirementsin ways that meet students' objectives, enable purposeful choices ofprograms and courses, and facilitate a coherent preparation for becominga creative and engaged citizen in the twenty-ﬁrst century.</P><H3>General Education</H3><P>The General Education Program is designed to provide intellectualbreadth, through experience with a variety of disciplines and appreciationfor the diversity of human culture. This program requires broad exposureto various ﬁelds and development of essential abilities: listening,reading, and observing; reasoning critically and quantitatively; andexpressing ideas convincingly in oral discourse as well as the writtenword. Approximately one-third of the curriculum is reserved for GeneralEducation.</P><H3>Academic Major</H3><P>The Academic Major promotes discipline of thought and depth ofunderstanding as it is articulated within a speciﬁc ﬁeld. Within theMajor, students are held accountable for discovering the evolvingquestions within the ﬁeld and the prevailing methods that lead to greaterunderstanding. Practice within a chosen discipline will constitute abouta third of students' coursework as they develop an appreciation for theculture and content of their academic home.</P><H3>Electives</H3><P>Electives require further breadth of inquiry and provide additionalopportunities for students to individually design their curricular choices.In consultation with their academic advisors, students choose aboutone-third of their courses as electives. These choices may be a mix ofstructured options, such as a concentration or a semester of off-campusstudy, or they may be more flexible reflections of personal interest.</P><P>With careful planning, General Education, the Academic Major, andElectives blend into a coherent and meaningful educational experience.These three spheres provide breadth, depth, and flexibility in a liberal artseducation nurturing independent thought, rationality, and a capacity forhumane self-determination.</P></Div><P/><H1>Degrees Offered and GraduationRequirements</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_920">Denison University offers Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BS),and Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degrees.

Exceptions to these requirementsmay be made via petition to the Academic Standing Board. A coursetaken &quot;in residence&quot; is deﬁned as any course scheduled by the DenisonRegistrar and taught on the Denison campus, by a Denison facultymember. This policy prescribes a university-wide minimum residencerequirement; individual departments may have stricter requirements.</P><P>Denison reserves the right to not award a student a degree if seriousviolations of the Code of Student Conduct have been alleged againstthat student or if charges exist against that student that cannot beadjudicated prior to commencement exercises. For the present purpose,&quot;serious violations&quot; are those that normally could result in suspension orexpulsion. At the discretion of the Vice President for Student Life or theProvost, a student facing allegations or charges of academic dishonestymay be permitted to participate in commencement exercises, however,the student would not receive a diploma or be considered a graduateof Denison. A valid diploma would be sent when all serious conductmatters have been resolved, and the student is deemed eligible to receivea degree from Denison.</P><P>Please note that qualiﬁcations and further clariﬁcation of theserequirements appear in other sections of this catalog.</P></Div><P/><H1>Academic Credit Policy</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_937">The guidelines below establish the minimum standards for academiccredit at Denison.</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>1.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Minimum standard for one credit: A one-credit course requiresthree hours of work per week (one hour of classroom or directfaculty instruction and two hours of out-of-class student work)over a period of 14 weeks of instruction plus one week ofexams.  Direct faculty instruction is deﬁned in the “Forms ofInstruction” section below. </P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>2.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Minimum standard for courses over one credit. Courses offeredfor other than one credit are simply multiples of the one-creditstandard.  Therefore, a four-credit course requires four hours ofclassroom or direct faculty instruction AND eight hours of out ofclass student work (for a total of twelve hours of weekly work)over 14 weeks of instruction plus one week of exams.  </P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>3.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Intensive Capstone/Practicum/Research/Creativecourses. Capstone, practicum, directed/independent studies,research and creative courses may require students to invest agreater amount of time in work outside of class.  These coursesmay shift the distribution of the minimum standards describedabove.

thought and depth ofunderstanding as they are articulated within a speciﬁc ﬁeld. The standardoffering of Denison majors is carefully selected; each major is rigorouslyreviewed, and must meet a myriad of nationally accepted academicstandards, and often follows a long tradition of academically soundpedagogy. Because the major is a distinctive hallmark of a Denisondegree, the institution guards its majors with utmost care. The IDMoption allows students to design their own majors that are not offeredin Denison's standard curricula. However, the Academic Affairs Councilapplies the very highest standards in accepting IDMs. Students musthave a compelling and coherent case for pursuing an IDM.</P><P>Individually Designed Majors approved in the last few years include thefollowing titles:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>&quot;Language Functionality in Society&quot;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>&quot;Integrated Science and Design&quot;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>&quot;Cultural Studies and Liberation&quot;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>&quot;Commerce, Media and the Arts&quot;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>&quot;Comparative Literature&quot; </P></LBody></LI></L><P>Students who wish to design their majors should consult with theiradvisors and the Registrar early in their Denison careers. Students mustsubmit their IDM proposal to the Registrar by March 1 of the sophomoreyear. Approval of the proposal by the Academic Affairs Council must becompleted by May 1 of the student's sophomore year.</P></Div><P/><H1>Academic Minors, Concentrations,and Electives</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_1352">Academic Minor</H2><P>A minor provides a guided plan of study within a discipline but withfewer requirements than a major. Typically, minors require core courses,beginning and advanced coursework in the ﬁeld, and electives.

that crosses disciplinary boundaries. Denisonoffers concentrations in the following ﬁelds: Computational Science,Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Middle East and North AfricanStudies, Neuroscience, and Queer Studies. In addition, there are afew concentrations available only to majors in certain disciplines(Financial Economics in Economics, as well as several concentrations/domains within Environmental Studies and Data Analytics). Twoopportunities similar to a concentration are the <Link Alt="">Lugar Program</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://catalog.denison.edu/catalog/courses-of-study/lugar-program/</Link>) and<Link Alt="">Organizational Studies</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://catalog.denison.edu/catalog/courses-of-study/organizational-studies/</Link>). Students interested in these ﬁelds shouldtalk with appropriate faculty soon after they have begun their Denisoncareers.</P><H2>Electives</H2><P>Electives may be chosen as a flexible mix to explore a variety of ﬁeldsthroughout Denison's curriculum or off-campus study. Denison maintainsa <Link Alt="">list of accepted off-campus programs</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/study-abroad/how-it-works/</Link>), both in the U.S. and abroad. It is stronglyrecommended that students interested in off-campus study make anappointment with the Ofﬁce of Global Programs and <Link Alt="">Off-Campus Study</Link>(<Link Alt="">p. <Quote>176</Quote></Link>) early in their Denison career to begin planning for off-campusstudy.</P><P>Students who want more structure in their choices of elective coursesmay pursue a minor, a concentration, or a second major.</P></Div><P/><H1>Academic Advising</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_1636">The Director of Advising coordinates Denison's academic advisingprogram, including <Link Alt="">AC 101</Link> - Advising Circles. The advising relationshipis an important place for conversations that connect the dots betweenacademic work and the learning that occurs beyond the classroomwalls. <Link Alt="">AC 101</Link> - Advising Circles: Engaging the Mission is a structured,weekly opportunity for a small group of ﬁrst-year students to cometogether to talk about their experiences, to learn more about theuniversity and the community, to explore how our community is shapedby the diversity of perspectives, and to think productively about how toplan for four years of a meaningful, educational experience.</P><H3>Statement on Advising</H3><P>Advising is a form of teaching that is purposeful, ongoing and regular.Advising is integral to teaching at Denison. The Academic Advisor playsa key role in helping students learn to become autonomous thinkers,capable of self-determination through their exploration of the liberal arts.</P><P>The chief role of a faculty advisor is to assist students in thinking throughtheir undergraduate liberal arts experience and their educational goals sothat they may take full advantage of the resources available at DenisonUniversity. The advising relationship develops and changes over thecourse of four years, as student needs and concerns evolve. Advisorsencourage students to think critically about the beneﬁts of a liberaleducation. They also assist students in understanding Denison's currentacademic regulations as well as the educational resources available atthe university. Advisors have an essential role in directing students toadditional advising and mentorship resources from across campus.</P><P>Faculty advisors also offer guidance beyond these matters:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>assisting students in identifying their interests;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>helping students make links between immediate and long-rangegoals;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>discussing career paths and graduate school options;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>referring students to institutional resources for academic or personalsupport; and</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>giving advice, when appropriate, on decisions relating to personal orquality-of-life choices.</P></LBody></LI></L><P>During the ﬁrst year of residence, Denison urges students to beginplanning their programs of study. This program should be suited to thestudent's particular needs, interests, life aspirations, and career plans.The various academic departments and the faculty advisor, as well as theofﬁces of Student Life, the Knowlton Center for Career Exploration, andAcademic Support, will assist students with the planning process. Goodeducational planning, based on Denison's tradition of liberal education,should include consideration of educational objectives relating to careerplans and personal developmental goals, analysis of high school andﬁrst semester Denison experiences and discoveries, course work and off-campus programs being considered, and a tentative choice of major. Thestudent should discuss these issues with their faculty advisor.</P><P>Because education is an evolutionary process, Denison encouragesstudents to explore the breadth of opportunity at Denison in their earlyyears on campus. Modiﬁcation of academic goals, vocational plans,and prospective majors is common, and students should not precludeconsideration of any particular range of educational alternative.</P><P>The Director of Advising assigns each incoming student a faculty advisor.Frequently, this person will be an instructor in one of the courses (forexample, AC 101 - Advising Circles) taken by the student during theﬁrst semester. Otherwise, the Director will work to make an assignmentbased on a student’s initial academic interests. As a student's major andvocational goals become more clearly deﬁned, it is likely that the studentwill choose to change to an advisor more familiar with those developinginterests. Students may, with the consent of the new faculty advisor,ofﬁcially switch to a new advisor. All changes must be reported to theRegistrar's Ofﬁce.</P><P>It is ultimately the responsibility of students to monitor their ownacademic progress and to ensure that all of their General Education andmajor/minor requirements are completed by their intended graduationdate. Academic advising provides useful support toward this goal.</P></Div><P/><H1>Special Academic Projects</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_1666">Students have the opportunity to undertake Directed Studies,Independent Studies, and Senior Research. These are explained below.</P><H2>Directed Study</H2><P>A student in good standing may work intensively in areas of specialinterest under the Directed Study plan. A Directed Study is appropriatewhen, under the guidance of a faculty member, a student wants to explorea subject more fully than is possible in a regular course, or to study asubject not covered in the regular curriculum. A Directed Study shouldnot normally duplicate a course that is regularly offered. A studentelecting a Directed Study must submit to the Registrar a proposal withappropriate departmental approval no later than the ﬁrst Friday of thesemester. Directed Studies are normally taken for 3 or 4 credits. A one-semester Directed Study is limited to a maximum of 4 credit hours.The form required for Directed Studies is available in the Ofﬁce of theRegistrar.  Note: Directed Studies may not be used to fulﬁll GeneralEducation requirements.</P><H2>Independent Study</H2><P>Independent Study engages a student in the pursuit of clearly deﬁnedgoals. In this effort a student may employ skills and informationdeveloped in previous course experiences or may develop some masteryof new knowledge or skills.</P><P>A proposal for an Independent Study project must be approved inadvance by the faculty member who agrees to serve as the projectadvisor. The approval must be submitted on the appropriate form to theRegistrar no later than the ﬁrst Friday of the semester.</P><P>The chief distinction between this and other options for individualstudy is that an individual faculty member works with the student toframe the project at its initiation, and to advise and assess the projectas it evolves, but the expectation is that the student take independentinitiative for moving the project forward and exploring the ideas raisedby the project.  A student may propose an extensive independentproject up to the equivalent of a full semester's work. An IndependentStudy project that constitutes a student's total academic load in agiven semester may be done either on or off the campus. Any proposalor combination of proposals to do independent work, carrying morethan four credit hours, must be submitted to the Academic AffairsCouncil. Such proposals would be subject to careful review and only withextenuating circumstances would be considered for approval. Examplesof Independent Studies approved recently include: &quot;An Existential Searchfor Religion,&quot; &quot;Genetics of Sarracenia,&quot; &quot;Creativity and the New YorkMusician,&quot; and &quot;Behavioral Studies of the Primates of the PeruvianAmazon.&quot;  Note: Independent Studies may not be used to fulﬁll GeneralEducation requirements.</P><H2>Senior Research</H2><P>Students may enroll in Senior Research in their ﬁnal year at Denison.Normally, Senior Research requires a major thesis, report or project in thestudent's ﬁeld of concentration and carries eight semester-hours of creditfor the year. Typically, a ﬁnal grade for a year-long Senior Research willnot be assigned until the completion of the year-long Senior Research atthe end of the second semester. In which case, the ﬁrst semester SeniorResearch grade will remain &quot;in progress&quot; (PR) until the completion of thesecond semester Senior Research. Instructors who choose to assign agrade at the completion of the ﬁrst semester Senior Research shouldnotify the Registrar at the beginning of December. Semester hours ofcredit for Senior Research shall not be counted toward the maximumhours allowed in the student's major. Each semester of Senior Researchis limited to a maximum of 4 credit hours. The form required for SeniorResearch is available in the Ofﬁce of the Registrar.  Note: Senior Researchmay not be used to fulﬁll General Education requirements.</P></Div><P/><H1>Special Academic Honors</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_1676">The Dean's List</H2><P>A student earning a superior academic average is placed on the Dean'sList.

There arethree levels of Honors.</P><H3>Highest Honors - Summa Cum Laude</H3><P>This highest distinction is accorded to students who earn a cumulativegrade-point average of 3.9 or higher.</P><H3>High Honors - Magna Cum Laude</H3><P>This second highest distinction is accorded to students who earn acumulative grade-point average of 3.75 or higher.</P><H3>Honors - Cum Laude</H3><P>This third distinction is accorded to students who earn a cumulativegrade-point average of 3.60 or higher.</P><P>Please note: The calculation of a student's GPA for &quot;Latin Honors&quot; isbased on all semesters of academic work at Denison, with a minimum of64 graded hours completed at Denison. Students with X-grade notationsare not eligible to receive Latin Honors, either contemporaneously orretroactively.</P><H2>Phi Beta Kappa</H2><P>The Denison University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established in1910. Election to Phi Beta Kappa takes place during the second semesterof the senior year and is based primarily on a record of outstandingacademic achievement. Election is also possible during the secondsemester of the junior year for a student whose academic record is trulyexceptional.</P><H2>President's Medals</H2><P>Each spring at the Academic Awards Convocation, the President awardsmedals to outstanding graduating seniors who have made especiallygood use of their undergraduate education and have contributedsubstantially to the community. The range of accomplishments thePresident seeks to acknowledge and honor are comparable to thoseassociated with the winners of a major national scholarship such as theRhodes or Marshall. The preeminent criterion for receipt of a President'sMedal, Denison's most prestigious award, is academic achievement. Inaddition, candidates must embody some combination of the following:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>service to the community,</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>contribution to the arts,</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>enlargement of the community's global perspective,</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>athletic ﬁtness and achievement,</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>leadership ability and contribution to community discourse.</P></LBody></LI></L></Div><P/><H1>Registration</H1><Div><P id="LinkTarget_1753">Registration is the formal enrollment in the College. In registering, thestudent subscribes to all the regulations, terms, and conditions, academicand ﬁnancial, as set forth in this Catalog. A student must, therefore,conﬁrm registration during the scheduled registration period eachsemester.</P><H2>Normal Registration </H2><P>A normal load is set at 16 semester hours of credit per semester.The normal academic load enables a student to meet the graduationrequirements within eight semesters.</P><H2>Auditing</H2><P>A student who pays regular tuition charges is permitted to audit, withthe approval of the faculty instructor and without additional cost, onecourse a semester for which no credit may be claimed. Audits may notbe allowed by the various departments until after credit seeking studentshave been accommodated.</P><H2>Reduced Registration</H2><P>This classiﬁcation is recommended for a student who, for any reason,cannot a normal credit-load of 16 hours.  A student may carry a reducedcredit-load of 12 to 15 credit hours and retain full-time status.  Withoutspecial permission from the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs,12 hours shall be the minimum registration for any regular student.With special permission a regular student may register for 9 to 11 credithours. The reduced registration option could have ramiﬁcations forﬁnancial aid eligibility.  In all cases, it is the student's responsibility totrack their completed academic credits, recognizing that a minimumof 126 completed credit hours is required for completion of a Denisondegree.</P><H2>Excess Registration</H2><P>The payment of tuition for fall or spring semesters of any given academicyear entitles a full-time regular Denison student to 18 credit hours in thatsemester. See the Annual Cost section of Catalog for the fee, billing, andpayment arrangements if taking more than 18 hours in any semester.With extenuating circumstances and evidence of careful planning, astudent may request twice during their Denison career to take up to20 hours and waive the excess hours fee. Any such request should besubmitted to the Registrar's Ofﬁce in writing prior to the beginning of thesemester in question.</P><H2>Partial Registration</H2><P>With the permission of the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs, aregular student may take a part-time schedule of 8 or fewer academicsemester hours of credit. A part-time regular student may pay by thecredit hour and must carry 8 hours or fewer. Regular students carryingmore than 8 hours are counted by the University as full-time studentsand must pay full tuition. For students on ﬁnancial aid or scholarship, aminimum registration of 12 hours is required.</P><H2>Special Registration</H2><P>Special registration is open to persons living within commuting distanceof the campus, certain students who want to take for credit, or to audit,certain courses of special interest but who are not degree candidates,and certain graduates who want to take post-graduate work. A specialstudent may not register for more than 8 credit-hours of academic workexcept by permission from the Academic Standing Board. A specialstudent desiring credit must submit appropriate credentials to the Ofﬁceof Admission. If, after one semester, a special student has failed tomaintain a 2.0 average, the special standing can be terminated.</P><H2>Additional Credit</H2><P>With the consent of the instructor, a student may request to take a coursefor an additional hour of credit. The nature of the additional work that thestudent must do in order to receive the additional credit, and how thatwork will be evaluated, must be clearly outlined in the petition. Usuallyinstructors award one grade, but may choose to assign different gradesto the regular course and the additional project.</P><P>A student whose petition for additional credit is granted may not dropthat credit after the deadline for dropping courses has passed.</P><P><Link Alt="">Special academic projects</Link> (<Link Alt="">p. <Quote>9</Quote></Link>) including Directed Study andSenior Research are not eligible for additional credit over 4 credit-hours;additional credit over 4-credit hours for Independent Study requires aproposal to be considered by the Academic Affairs Council.</P><H2>Changes in Registration: Adding ofCourses</H2><P>Students may add courses or credits to their registration during the ﬁrsttwo weeks (10 class days) of a semester. The student should consult withthe advisor and must have the consent of the instructor and academicadvisor. The appropriate documentation must be ﬁled promptly.</P><H2>Changes in Registration: Dropping ofCourses</H2><P>A drop of a course or credit may be permitted through the end of the ninthweek of classes by submitting to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar a properlycompleted change of registration form. This excludes Denison Seminarsand Private Music Lessons/Ensembles, which have an add/drop dateat the end of the second week of classes. Please note that excess hourfees and applied music lesson or other course fees are not refunded afterthe fourth week in the case of a student withdrawing for any reason froma course or from the University. Change of registration after the stateddeadlines requires action of the Academic Standing Board. Normally,approved petitions requesting a withdrawal from a course or coursesafter week nine will result in a &quot;W&quot; [withdraw] grade transcript notation. Inextenuating circumstances the Academic Standing Board may approveto have the &quot;W&quot; grade removed. The decision of the Academic StandingBoard is ﬁnal.</P><P>Student need not justify or seek approval for the drop through weeknine of the semester. The instructor’s signature is required in order tomake sure the instructor is notiﬁed of the student’s intentions.  Theadvisor’s signature is required to conﬁrm that the student contacted theadvisor to discuss the decision to drop the class and to hear the advisor’sopinion about the impact this may have on the student’s progress towardgraduation before the class is dropped.</P><H2>Late Registration</H2><P>Students failing to register by the deadline date prescribed in Universitypublications and/or failing to respond properly to University ofﬁcial'snotices regarding the problem shall be withdrawn from all preregisteredcourses. Such withdrawal carries with it ﬁnancial forfeitures of 50 percentof all fees due. Appeal of this action shall be to the Academic StandingBoard and, with a resulting decision of reinstatement, normally carriesa minimum penalty of $50 and other disciplinary sanctions as deemedappropriate.</P></Div><P/><H1>Academic Policies</H1><Div><P/><H2 id="LinkTarget_1787">Statement of Petition Policy</H2><P>On the advice of the Registrar, students may petition the AcademicStanding Board for exceptions to rules concerning academic policiesand procedures. However, the Board will consider only those petitionssubmitted sufﬁciently far in advance so that, if denied, the petitioner willstill have time to remedy the deﬁciency by suitable re-scheduling or otherappropriate action.</P><H2>Attendance Policy</H2><P>A hallmark of a Denison education is the small,interactive, and participatory classroom, situated within aresidential community. Therefore, it is essential that students be presenton campus and attend the classes in which they are enrolled. Attendancepolicies are designed to promote the success and well-being of theindividual students as well as the community of learners in each classand co-curricular undertaking. For oneself and one’s peers, attendanceand presence on campus are vital to the Denison education.</P><P>The speciﬁc attendance policy for an individual course is set by theinstructor. It is the responsibility of the instructor to establish</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>1.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>a policy on class attendance,</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>2.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>a policy for makeup of missed work, and,</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>3.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>any criteria for excused absences whenattendance is required (note that some faculty may notmake a distinction between excused and unexcusedabsences). </P></LBody></LI></L><P>Class absence is a loss of opportunity for learning. It is vitally importantthat each faculty member review these points in class early inthe semester. </P><P>Responsibility for missed classes rests with the student. Studentswho miss class at any point during the semester should notify thecourse instructor as soon as possible. It is the student’s responsibilityto ﬁnd out what course work and content were missed and to catchup in a timely manner.  In cases of signiﬁcant medical circumstances,the Hoaglin Wellness Center may issue a dated documentationof a visit at the request of a  student.  The Wellness Center willonly provide documentation in the case of a signiﬁcant issuethat requires class absence. </P><H3>First Class Meeting, Exams, and Orientation</H3><H5>First class meeting</H5><P>Each semester, students must be on campus and attend theﬁrst meeting of their registered classes. If circumstances prevent astudent from arriving on campus for the ﬁrst day of classes, the studentmust receive advanced approval from their designated Class Dean.</P><H5>Final exams</H5><P>Final exam week is part of the regular schedule of classes.  Students arerequired to be present on campus for all scheduled ﬁnals as indicatedin the ﬁnal exam schedule issued by the Registrar’s Ofﬁce at the time ofcourse registration. Failure to attend a ﬁnal exam may result in a failingcourse grade.</P><H5>First-year orientation</H5><P>Denison's orientation programs are designed to welcome and introducenew students to our campus resources, community, and culture. Allstudents attending Denison for their ﬁrst semester (new First-YearStudents and Transfer Students) are required to attend Denison'smandatory orientation programs.</P><H3>Extended or Repeated Absences</H3><P>Notwithstanding individual faculty attendance policies, any studentwho will be missing class for an extended period of time during asemester for any reason (including medical, a family emergency,or other reasons) must notify their Class Dean. The Class Dean willdiscuss with the student the impact a longer absence may haveon the student’s coursework and academic progress. Without priornotiﬁcation to the Class Dean for extended and/or repeated absencesfrom classes, the student may be subject to involuntary withdrawal fromDenison.</P><H2>Absence Policy</H2><P>Students at Denison University are expected to give the highest priority totheir academic commitments. However, sometimes conflicts arise amongvarious academic pursuits. At these times, students, faculty, staff, andadministrators all share the responsibility of recognizing, minimizing, andresolving these conflicts.</P><P>Legitimate Conflicts: Courses and activities that earn academic credit atDenison may place legitimate demands on a student’s time outside ofthe regularly scheduled meeting times for that course or activity. Thismay give rise to potential conflicts to regularly scheduled classroom/lab hours. Such activities might include, but not be limited to, course-related ﬁeld trips, ﬁne arts performances (but not rehearsals), and varsitysports contests (both regular season and all post-season contests, butnot scrimmages or practices).</P><P>When the demands of one course or credit-bearing activity impinge uponanother, the student and the faculty or staff members are encouragedto work together to achieve a reasonable accommodation that resolvesthe conflict without sacriﬁcing the academic integrity and rigor of thecourse or activity. Moreover, all parties (students, faculty, staff, andadministrators) have the following speciﬁc responsibilities when dealingwith legitimate conflicts.</P><P>Scheduling responsibilities of all faculty, staff, and students:</P><P>a) to conﬁne course instruction and examinations to the time slots forthe course, following the course grid and ﬁnal examination assignedtimes, unless speciﬁc exception has been granted for the course by theProvost’s Ofﬁce;</P><P>b) to indicate clearly on the course syllabus the policies and expectationsfor class attendance, assignments, and examinations, and, if attendanceat a supplemental event (such as a lecture, ﬁeld trip, or performance)is expected and that event occurs at a time outside of the regularlyscheduled meeting times, to inform students of the event as soon aspossible;</P><P>c) to provide students alternative means of meeting the requirements ofthe course when attendance at a supplemental event for that course isscheduled for a time outside of the course’s regularly scheduled meetingtimes;</P><P>d) to avoid scheduling any supplemental events in the Monday-Friday4:30- 6:30 p.m. time period;</P><P>e) if a scheduling conflict arises (that is, if a student is asked to attenda supplemental event, an athletic competition, or a similar universityactivity at a time in which they are required to attend another class).</P><P>i. the student should inform both faculty or staff membersimmediately and seek a mutually agreed upon resolution;</P><P>ii. the faculty members should work with the student to resolvelegitimate conflicts without sacriﬁcing the academic integrity andrigor of the course;</P><P>iii. faculty and staff members should provide an alternative wayfor students to meet course requirements or the expectations ofcreditbearing activities;</P><P>iv. in situations when the student, faculty, and/or staff membercannot reach an acceptable resolution to the conflict, the AssociateProvost for Academic Affairs will be asked to provide consultationto all parties.</P><H2>Academic Integrity</H2><P>Every Denison student is expected to know and uphold Universitystandards in matters of academic honesty. Students who practiceacademic dishonesty assault their own integrity as well as that of theUniversity. Behavior that is in direct violation of these standards isdiscussed in the student handbook. Each Denison student is expectedto be familiar with this policy. Please note that violations may resultin suspension or expulsion from the University.  Denison's <Link Alt="">Code ofAcademic Integrity</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/curriculum/integrity/</Link>) is the foundation of the university's commitment to andpolicies regarding Academic Integrity.</P><H2>Student Classiﬁcation</H2><P>For the purposes of ﬁnancial aid, classiﬁcation of students is determinedby the amount of academic credit earned.</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>First-Year Standing - A student is classiﬁed as a ﬁrst-year student ifhours earned are fewer than 26 semester-hours of credit.</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Sophomore Standing - A student must have earned 26 semesterhours of credit.</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Junior Standing - A student must have earned 60 semester hours ofcredit.</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Senior Standing - A student must have earned 90 semester hours ofcredit.</P></LBody></LI></L><H2>Eligibility Rule</H2><P>A regularly enrolled student registered on a full-time basis (normally 12semester-hours or more) and in good academic standing shall be eligibleto participate in all college and intercollegiate activities. The studentwhose scholastic record falls below a 2.0 average will not be permitted toparticipate in intercollegiate athletics. First-year students are eligible toparticipate in intercollegiate athletics during their ﬁrst semester.</P><H2>Credit Earned by Advanced PlacementTesting</H2><P>First-Year Students and Transfer Students who score a 4 or 5 on a CollegeEntrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Placement Examination(AP) will usually receive academic credit for their scores. Should resultsbe presented in academic disciplines or areas that are not part of theDenison curriculum, credit will be subject to departmental review andcredit hours may or may not be assigned. Two other kinds of advancedplacement testing can be considered for credit. A student presenting &quot;A&quot;marks on the British System &quot;A&quot; Level Examination or a score of 6 or 7 onan International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level Subject Exam may askthe appropriate Denison department for advanced placement credits. Ina few instances positive results from advanced placement examinationscan be applied toward general education or major/minor credits butdepartments reserve the right of review and the ﬁnal determination ofhow such credits count.</P><H2>Recognition of Credit Earned Elsewhere /Transfer Credit</H2><P>Denison accepts transfer credit for courses that are either equivalentto a course in the Denison catalog or at a level deemed appropriateby the department or program (hereafter called &quot;the Department&quot;) inwhich credit is being sought. Requests to have transfer credit fulﬁll amajor, minor, or concentration requirement are subject to approval bythe Department. The determination of the satisfaction of a competencyrequirement via transfer credit will be made by the General EducationCompetency Committee (GECC) for the Power &amp; Justice (P), OralCommunication (R), and Quantitative Reasoning (Q) competencies,and by the Writing Committee for the Writing competency.   In thereview of transfer credit for incoming transfer students, GECC and theWriting Committee may delegate the determination of fulﬁllment of acompetency requirement to the ofﬁces of the Provost and Registrar inconsultation with the academic department closest to the disciplinein which the transferred course was taught.  Denison will not normallyaccept credits earned in disciplines other than those in the Denisoncurriculum. Transfer credit will be honored only if taken at an accreditedcollege or university and only if the student submits an ofﬁcial transcriptof credit within 180 days of the course completion. Students consideringoff-campus work for Denison credit (especially summer schoolwork) must confer with the Registrar, their academic advisor, andthe chairperson of the Department (or a designate) prior to enrollingelsewhere. The University has no obligation to award transfer creditfor course work that was not approved in advance. The courses mustbe completed with grades of &quot;C&quot; or better in order to be consideredfor transfer credit. Course work completed in non-traditional fashions,such as distance learning formats, web-based formats, Post SecondaryEnrollment Option, including college courses for which high school creditwas also granted, CLEP and other college credit bearing instruments, maybe subject to review by the Registrar and the Department.</P><H2>Grades Earned Elsewhere / TransferGrades</H2><P>Grades received at another institution shall not be computed into theDenison quality-point average, or be used to remove Denison quality-pointdeﬁciencies. Denison will not award credit for work below &quot;C&quot; on transferfrom another institution. Students who have received prior approval ofthe Denison Off-Campus Study Ofﬁce will have their grades earned atthe program site appear on their Denison record. The grades will not beincluded in GPA calculations.</P><H2>Matriculation Requirement</H2><P>To be a candidate for a Denison degree, a student who enters Denison asa ﬁrst-year student must complete at least 64 credit hours of the required127 at Denison, and a transfer student must complete a minimum of 64semester hours of the required 127 at Denison. Generally, all students,except those enrolled in recognized preprofessional 3-2 programs, mustcomplete the last two semesters in residence at Denison. A course taken&quot;in residence&quot; is deﬁned as any course scheduled by the Denison registrarand taught on the Denison campus, or any course scheduled by theDenison registrar and taught off-campus by a full-time Denison facultymember. This policy prescribes a university-wide minimum residencerequirement; individual departments may have stricter requirements.Exceptions may be made by the Academic Standing Board.</P><H2>Commencement Exercises</H2><P>Commencement Exercises are held annually at the conclusion ofthe spring term. In order to participate in Commencement Exercises,the student must have completed successfully all requirements forgraduation. No exceptions are granted to this regulation. Studentscompleting graduation requirements in August or December are eligibleand invited to participate in the next May Commencement Exercise.</P><H2>Time Away </H2><P>Time away from Denison can help students align their personal andacademic paths, pursue volunteer or other work opportunities, or takecare of medical or health needs for themselves or loved ones.  Denisonprovides a pathway for students to take a personal leave of absencefor a limited period of time or initiate a medical or voluntary withdrawal.Students considering a leave of absence or a withdrawal should contacttheir Class Dean.  A request to the Registrar for a transcript or failureto participate in room lottery is not considered withdrawal from theUniversity.</P><P>Students who withdraw prior to the end of week 9 of the semester donot receive academic credit for the term. Students withdrawing afterweek 9 receive a “W” for all enrolled courses for that term. In cases withextenuating circumstances, the Academic Standing Board may approvepetitions to have the “w” removed.</P><P>A student who withdraws from school without ofﬁcial permission willreceive a grade of F (failure) on their permanent record. Petitions forexception must document unusual circumstances, and such petitions aresubmitted to the Academic Standing Board.</P><P>The college may, when in its judgment, such action is in the best interesteither of the student or of the student body, dismiss or refuse to enroll orre-enroll any student.</P><P>For further information, please consult <Link Alt="">Refund or Forfeiture of Tuition,Activity Fee, Student Health Fee and Room and Board</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://catalog.denison.edu/catalog/admission-costs-ﬁnancial-aid/</Link>).</P><Div>Privacy Policy</Div><P>Denison University is committed to protecting the privacy of students'personal information. Denison respects students' right to privacy andrecognizes its obligation to keep information secure and conﬁdential.For more information, see the <Link Alt="">University Privacy Policy</Link> (<Link Alt="">http://www.denison.edu/forms/university-privacy-policy/</Link>).</P><H2>Academic Grievance Policy</H2><P>The assessment of student academic performance, including theassignment of particular grades, is a faculty responsibility. The facultymember offering the course is responsible for the evaluation of studentcourse work and, under normal circumstances, is the sole judge of thegrades received by students in that course.</P><P>If a student feels that a course grade was the result of prejudiced,capricious, or in some other way unjust evaluation on the part of theinstructor, that student may ﬁle a grievance petition with the AcademicStanding Board. The petition must be ﬁled within the semester followingthe awarding of the disputed evaluation, even if the student or facultymember is off-campus and unable to appear until a later date. Petitionsshould include evidence of prejudiced or capricious academic evaluationand evidence of attempts to deal with the problem at the departmentallevel, including discussions with the faculty member involved and therelevant department chair. Only after these steps have been taken will thematter become part of the formal academic grievance process. Simpledisagreement with the instructor's philosophy in assigning grades, or withthe instructor's professional judgment about the quality of the work does notconstitute cause for petitioning.</P><P>The Academic Standing Board will transmit evidence of the chargesto the faculty member. After evaluating the charges and hearing theinstructor's explanation, and possibly discussing the situation with othermembers of the class and/or members of the involved department, theelected teaching faculty of the committee will recommend a solution.Both the student and the faculty member will have the right to appearpersonally before the committee and to present their views.</P><P>If the Academic Standing Board decides there is no basis to alter thegrade, the process will terminate at that point. If the Academic StandingBoard recommends that the grade should be changed, it will requestthat the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with awritten explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor decline, theinstructor should provide an explanation in writing. The entire matter willthen be referred to the six elected faculty members of the President'sAdvisory Board, who will be the ﬁnal arbiters of the case. This facultycommittee will examine all available information on the dispute, meetwith the student and the instructor, members of the instructor's academicdepartment if appropriate, and others as it sees ﬁt.</P><P>The faculty committee, after considering all the evidence and uponconcluding that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand,may then recommend to the Provost that the grade be changed. TheProvost will provide the instructor with a copy of the recommendationand will ask the instructor to implement it. If the instructor continues todecline, the Provost will then change the grade, notifying the instructorand the student of this action. The Provost, following written instructionsof the faculty committee, will effect a change in grade over the objectionof the instructor who assigned the original grade. If the student remainsdissatisﬁed with the result of the petitioning process, the studentmay request that the Registrar insert a letter in the academic record,describing the process and the outcome.</P></Div><P/><H1>Grading System and Evaluation</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_1947">Grading System</H2><P>Grades carry the following weights in the computation of grade-pointaverages.</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Letter Grade</Div></TH><TH><Div>GPA</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>A+</Div></TD><TD><Div>4.0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>A</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Excellent) 4.0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>A-</Div></TD><TD><Div>3.7 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>B+</Div></TD><TD><Div>3.3 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>B</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Good) 3.0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>B-</Div></TD><TD><Div>2.7 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>C+</Div></TD><TD><Div>2.3 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>C</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Fair) 2.0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>C-</Div></TD><TD><Div>1.7 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>D+</Div></TD><TD><Div>1.3 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>D</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Passing) 1.0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>D-</Div></TD><TD><Div>.7 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>F</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Failure) 0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>I</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Incomplete)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>P</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Pass) 0 for each credit hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>S</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Satisfactory) 0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>U</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Unsatisfactory) 0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>W</Div></TD><TD><Div>(2018- forward: Withdrawn)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>WD</Div></TD><TD><Div>(pre-2018: Withdrawn)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>WF</Div></TD><TD><Div>(pre-2018: Withdrawn Failing)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>WP</Div></TD><TD><Div>(pre-2018: Withdrawn Passing)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>CR</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Credit) 0 for each credit-hour</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>NG</Div></TD><TD><Div>(No Grade Reported)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>WV</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Waiver of Course or Requirement)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PR</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Progress) Course in progress(usually the ﬁnal mark isdetermined at conclusion of thecourse sequence)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>AU</Div></TD><TD><Div>(Audit)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>X</Div></TD><TD><Div>Precedes a grade that was affectedby academic misconduct penalties</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><H2>Incomplete Grade</H2><P>An incomplete grade in a course may be granted only with permissionfrom the Academic Standing Board.

The statement mustbe signed by the instructor of the course and the student's advisor.  Agrade of Incomplete will be awarded only under exceptional conditions,including cases of illness, death in the family, or other extraordinarycircumstances.  A student will not be granted an incomplete simplybecause additional time is needed to complete the assigned work. Incomplete petitions normally should be submitted prior to the last day ofthe semester’s scheduled classes, though in exceptional circumstancespetitions may be reviewed through the last day of ﬁnals. Should a requestfor an incomplete grade be granted, completion of the work must beaccomplished by the end of the sixth week of the following semester, orany time previous, as prescribed by the instructor.</P><H2>Satisfactory (S/Grade) Evaluation</H2><P>Courses graded on an S/Grade basis result in an S on the transcript if thegrade reported is C or above, and the grade earned if it is C- or below. Thegrade of Satisfactory (S) does not affect the student’s GPA.  Letter gradesof C- or lower in an S/Grade graded course are included in the student’sgrade point average. Sophomores, juniors and seniors may elect to takeone course per semester on the S/Grade basis.  There is a limit of onecourse per semester which may be taken on the S/Grade basis. Thisoption may not be exercised for courses within a student's major, minor,or concentration ﬁelds, including required cognate courses, and it is notan option for any General Education requirement. Via the appropriateform at the Registrar's ofﬁce, students must request S/Grade grading,or request to switch back from S/Grade grading to a letter grade, by theend of week nine. Neither the instructor’s approval nor the instructor'ssignature is required for a student to opt to take a class S/Grade, nor areinstructors notiﬁed that a student has elected this option.  A few coursesare offered to everyone utilizing a &quot;satisfactory&quot; grading format, and suchcourses are not included in the option described above.</P><P>Note regarding Spring 2020 Temporary S/U Policy: In spring semester2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mid-term shift to remotelearning, the Denison faculty voted to suspend the Satisfactory/GradePolicy and issued a temporary replacement Satisfactory/UnsatisfactoryPolicy. The terms of the spring 2020 S/U policy included: (a) students inall class years could opt to take any course in which they were enrolledon the S/U basis; (b) no limit to the number of courses a student couldtake on the S/U basis during spring 2020; (c) courses taken on theS/U basis in spring 2020 are eligible to fulﬁll GE requirements andrequirements in the major, minor, or concentration; (d) courses gradedon the S/U basis in spring 2020 resulted in a Satisfactory/S mark onthe transcript if the grade reported was D- or above, and a mark ofUnsatisfactory/U if the grade reported was below a D- (i.e., equivalent ofan F); (e) spring 2020 S/U grades were not computed into the student’sgrade point average; a spring 2020 grade of U resulted in no credits beingawarded for the course; (f) all spring 2020 courses from all academicprograms were eligible for S/U grading.</P><H2>Repeating Courses</H2><P>Students may repeat courses in order to develop greater mastery of thesubject matter. However, second efforts do not erase original efforts,including failed ﬁrst attempts, and both grades will be included in the GPAcalculations. Should students take and successfully complete a coursetwice, they must be aware that both grades will be included in the GPAcalculations but the credit hours cannot be included twice. You may wishto discuss all potential ramiﬁcations with the Registrar if this scenariois a factor for you. Students who want to re-enroll for a course for whichthey have already received a passing mark must receive permission fromthe chairperson of that department and the instructor of the course inquestion. Repeating a previously passed course may present FinancialAid implications.</P></Div><P/><H1>Academic Standing</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_2024">Academic Standing, Warning, Suspension,and Reinstatement</H2><P>Students' academic performance can be negatively impacted by avariety of factors. In order to alert students, their advisors, and otherrelevant parties when academic performance falls below expectationsand students do not hold Academic Good Standing, the university relieson the following designations: Academic Warning, Continued AcademicWarning, Academic Suspension and Reinstatement.</P><P>Academic Good Standing applies to all students who meet or exceeda cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.00.  Any student with acumulative GPA below 2.00 at any time will be enrolled in the AcademicResource Center’s programming for academic success.</P><P>Academic Warning occurs when a student's cumulative GPA is below2.00.  Students placed on Academic Warning are expected to raise theircumulative GPA to a 2.00 or better within two semesters; if a studentearns a semester GPA at or below 2.00 while on Academic Warning, thestudent will be placed on Academic Suspension. Any semester GPAbelow 1.00 will automatically result in Academic Suspension, unlessthis occurs in the student’s ﬁnal semester prior to graduation.  Thus,a student may bypass Academic Warning and be placed on AcademicSuspension if the semester GPA is below a 1.00.</P><P>Continued Academic Warning is designated when a student who is onAcademic Warning is successful in achieving a semester GPA abovea 2.00, but did not raise the cumulative GPA to a 2.00. Students onContinued Academic Warning are expected to achieve or exceed a 2.00cumulative GPA at the conclusion of their next semester.</P><P>Academic Suspension occurs when a student earns a semester GPAat or below 2.00 while on Academic Warning. A student may also besuspended when the student does not attain a 2.00 cumulative GPA afterbeing on Continued Academic Warning.  Performance of less than 1.00GPA for any semester will result in suspension regardless of the student'scumulative GPA, unless this occurs in the student's ﬁnal semester prior tograduation.</P><P>Reinstatement occurs when an academically suspended student onceagain becomes eligible for enrollment. Students on Reinstatement willbe given conditions by the Academic Standing Board that must be fullymet during the subsequent semester(s) in order to remain eligible forenrollment. The procedures for seeking Reinstatement are found below in“Eligibility for Reinstatement.”</P><Div><H2>Eligibility for Reinstatement</H2><P>A student on academic suspension who has shown marked improvementover his or her Denison record in work taken at some other accreditedcollege or university, or can present evidence of a maturing nonacademicexperience, may petition the Academic Standing Board for reinstatement.In nearly all cases, a student is expected to demonstrate some degreeof academic improvement by taking course work elsewhere. Thispetition must be submitted to the Ofﬁce of the Registrar by July 1 forfall reinstatement and by November 1 for spring reinstatement. Shouldthe student be reinstated, he or she must meet all the conditions of theAcademic Standing Board or again face suspension.</P><P>A former student who was in good academic and social standing whenhe or she left the College may be re-admitted to Denison by writing to theOfﬁce of Student Life and by repayment of the enrollment deposit.</P><P>Students seeking reinstatement should review more detailed <Link Alt="">situation-speciﬁc information regarding reinstatement and re-enrollment</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/registrar/reinstatement-re-enrollment/</Link>).</P></Div></Div><P/><H1>The Lisska Center for IntellectualEngagement</H1><Div><P>The mission of the Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement is tosupport research and scholarship, to foster intellectual communityand academic enrichment among all Denisonians, and to provide aninterdisciplinary space for the open exchange of ideas, perspectives, andarguments.</P><H2>1. Fellowships Advising</H2><P>The Lisska Center staff assists students and recent alumni in applyingfor nationally and internationally competitive fellowships at both theundergraduate and graduate levels. Fellowships fund summer programs,study abroad programs, service projects, and postgraduate study andresearch both in the U.S. and abroad.</P><P>Examples of prestigious fellowships include the Rhodes Scholarship, theMarshall Scholarship, Fulbright awards, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship,the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship in Science and Mathematics, theMorris K.

The Lisska Center alsocoaches fellowship competition ﬁnalists preparing for interviews.</P><H2>2. Summer Scholars Program</H2><P>The Lisska Center coordinates Denison’s Summer Scholars Program.Each year, more than 120 students across all disciplines receive fundingto support independent research under the close supervision of a facultymember, or full-time collaborative work with faculty members, duringthe summer. It gives students in all disciplines a unique undergraduatevenue in which to experiment with ideas and artistic expression, pursuean intellectual passion, and focus intently on the resolution of a questionover a sustained period of time. Summer Scholars projects do not confercredit hours and are not graded. All students must produce a scholarlyproject (e.g., ﬁnal poster, paper, performance, or equivalent) and presenttheir summer’s work in a public forum.</P><P>Summer Scholars receive a stipend ($4,300 for 10 weeks in 2022),housing allowance, and supplemental research funds (up to $500 perstudent). Faculty advisors also receive a stipend per student supervised(three students maximum).</P><P>The Lisska Center holds information sessions and works closely withthe Student Research Grants Committee (SRGC), which selects therecipients of Young Scholars, Early Experience, and Off-Campus SummerScholars awards. The Lisska Center also works with the coordinators ofthe Anderson Summer Science Program, the Woodyard Scholars awardsin the Department of Religion, the Ashbrook Summer Scholars awards,and the Battelle Summer Scholars awards. Guidelines can be found onthe <Link Alt="">Lisska Center’s MyDenison page</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://my.denison.edu/node/44/</Link>).</P><P>The Lisska Center approves and coordinates the logistics of all SummerScholars stipend payments, housing, and supplemental research grants.These activities include hosting a kick-off event as well as variousresearch events where Summer Scholars and faculty members shareinformal updates on their projects.

Interdisciplinary projects may be proposed as well. Any studentwho does not fall into one of the above categories is not eligible.</P><P>Applications for Summer Scholars awards are typically due at the endof January. Students are expected to identify their proposal, secureagreement from their faculty mentor well in advance, and work with theirmentor in developing their application materials. See below for details.</P><P>Decisions on faculty eligibility to supervise, or share in the supervision,of student summer research, are made on a case-by-case basis by theProvost. In most cases, tenure track and non-tenure-track faculty whoteach at least 75% of a full-time load, and who have a contract to teach atDenison in the fall semester following the summer research, are eligibleto supervise summer research.</P><P>Young Scholars awards support students pursuing projects in the socialsciences, humanities, ﬁne arts, and interdisciplinary projects. YoungScholars work under the close guidance of a Denison faculty memberfor projects that typically last 10 weeks between mid-May and the end ofJuly. In 2022 students received a stipend of $4,300 for 10 weeks, plus aroom allowance for campus housing. Students may not hold jobs duringthe term of their research. Awards will not be made for projects requiringa substantial portion of time away from campus, although short researchtrips may be permitted on a case-by-case basis. (For projects requiringmore than 1 to 2 weeks away from campus, see the Off-Campus SummerScholars guidelines below.) Applications for Young Scholars awardsare evaluated by the Student Research Grants Committee (SRGC), anelected committee of four faculty members (one from each division of thecollege), overseen by the Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement.</P><P>Faculty members are expected to work closely with students as theydevelop their project proposals and must submit a detailed endorsementsupporting each student’s application for a Young Scholars award.Applications are typically due in late January, with faculty endorsementsdue in early February. Faculty advisors are expected to be on campus(except for short absences) and should meet at least twice weekly witheach student during the project’s 10 weeks. Faculty members may notsupervise more than three individual or joint projects.

Projectstypically last 10 weeks between mid-May and the end of July. (Some timemay be spent on campus before and/or after the off-campus portionof the project.) A Denison faculty member must be the primary mentor,but a non-Denison mentor may help supervise the project on-site, asappropriate. Proposals must specify the role and time commitment ofthe Denison and non-Denison mentors; faculty stipends will be awardedaccordingly.

Intellectual Programming</H2><P>The Lisska Center sponsors an array of programs and events designed topromote a culture of intellectual life on campus.</P><H3>Research Tables</H3><P>The purpose of Denison’s Research Tables is threefold: (1) to bringtogether faculty members from across the college and other institutionsto explore various aspects of the liberal arts, using practices that sustaina strong academic community; (2) to create a forum for faculty membersfrom different disciplines to learn from one another; and (3) to deepenthe intellectual tone on campus by increasing opportunities for differentdisciplinary perspectives to intersect and new pathways among facultyand students to form.</P><P>Research Tables should focus on multidisciplinary issues of interest toparticipants who are committed to sustained intellectual explorationwithin the liberal arts. Research Tables may vary in scope, rangingfrom limited undertakings similar to reading groups (e.g., locally-basedmembers, one-year time frame) to more ambitious projects (e.g., one ormore outside faculty members, travel component, up to a three-year timeframe). All Research Tables must culminate in a focused symposiumthat brings other scholars and practitioners to Denison. Research Tablemembers must complete a ﬁnal report summarizing the Research Table’sfocus, activities, and outcomes in terms of student learning and facultyresearch.</P><P>Students in good academic standing may be invited by faculty sponsorsto participate in a Research Table.

Our task is to provide students with themost rigorous and comprehensive approaches to knowledge and analysisappropriate within a fully merged undergraduate program in Sociologyand Anthropology.</P><P>Our commitment to teaching also deﬁnes for us the importance ofactive scholarship through which we may practice our disciplines andencourage similar pursuits among our students. Since our graduatesenter into a wide range of professional, administrative, policy-orientedand other occupations, our goal is to transmit, foster, and produceknowledge and practice that involve students in their own learningexperience. In this respect we want to encourage students to take theireducation into their own hands, by helping them to engage personally inresearch, analysis, and writing about diverse human societies.</P><P>We have therefore sought to create a learning environment within whichstudents may critically examine social life, its organization, and itsmeaning. We believe that the development of a perspective that examinesthe human condition in empirical, analytical, comparative, historical,and holistic terms makes a signiﬁcant contribution to intellectualdevelopment. In pursuing such a goal, we assist students to develop,integrate, and utilize knowledge. To this end our mission is to produceknowledgeable learners and social agents who have a self-reflectivesense of their potential contributions to the enhancement of the humancondition.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor John Davis, Department Chair</P><P>Associate Professors Fareeda Grifﬁth, Veerendra Lele; AssistantProfessors Shiri Noy, Jane Safﬁtz, Karen Powell Sears, HosnaSheikholeslami; Visiting Assistant Professors John Soderberg, StoryEdison</P><H6>Academic Administrative Assistant</H6><P>Nancy Welu</P><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/anthropology-sociology/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Anthropology and Sociology Major</H2><P>A major in Anthropology and Sociology must complete ten courseswithin the department.

In particular, it explores a number of settings that may include:the family, the work place, the political arena, religious activity, violenceagainst women, and face-to-face interactional contexts. Special attentionis given to the ways in which race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientationshape gender experiences. Although its primary focus is Americansociety, the course compares problems of sexual inequality in Americansociety with other, quite different, societies in order to gain a comparativeunderstanding of how discrimination, prejudice, and structural inequality,wherever they are found, create special problems for women. Throughout,the focus is on learning to use structural, historical, and theoreticalinformation as guides to understanding social change and the choicesfacing women and men.</P><P>Crosslisting: WGST 210.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 212 - Race and Ethnicity (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Contrary to the expectations of many modern social theorists, race andethnicity continue to be important elements in the lives of contemporarypeople, serving as frameworks through which individual identities,community actions, and cultural meanings are interpreted. This coursewill introduce students to the sociocultural analysis of racial and ethnicidentities. How did ethnic and racial identities and communities developover time? Why does race, though now understood to be a social ratherthan a biological category, continue to be (mis)understood as a biologicalcategory? How do aspects of political, class, gender, and sexual identitiesinfluence racial and ethnic identities? We will use a global perspectiveto understand the conception of race and ethnicity. We will explorethese topics among others including cultural and historical variability ofethnic and racial categories, the dialectical formation of identity, and thepersistence of certain forms of racial and ethnic prejudice. Students willbe expected to examine critically their own common assumptions andpresuppositions about race and ethnicity, and to begin developing thetheoretical tools for interpreting life in an ethnically diverse world.</P><P>Crosslisting: BLST 212.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 218 - Sociology of International Development (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>International development is the study of how countries and peopleacross the world move towards an increased standard of living andquality of life. In this course we will take a sociological approach tothe study of development, turning to the task of deﬁning internationaldevelopment, questioning fundamental assumptions about what itmeans to live “a good life” on the individual level and what it meansto be a “developed country” at the national level. We will draw frommultiple theories and perspectives to interrogate what internationaldevelopment means and how it has proceeded. This course is a DenisonWriting Intensive Seminar, that is, it has a W-overlay. As such all of thegoals of the course will be served by developing your research skills andsubstantive, conceptual, and methodological understandings via writing.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 220 - Medical Anthropology (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course offers an introduction to contemporary topics in medicalanthropology, the most prominent subﬁeld in anthropology today.Our approach will be to critically examine assumptions about whatconstitutes health, medicine, and the body. To this end, we willtreat science as a cultural practice and western medicine—whatanthropologists refer to as biomedicine—as one system of healingalongside others. Additional topics will include the role of belief,meaning, and placebo in healing; structural inequality and politicaleconomy; rationality and “ways of knowing” illness; global mentalhealth; suffering and embodiment; disability worlds; constructions ofnormality and pathology; medical humanitarianism; medicalization andpharmaceuticals; and the role of ethnography in tending to cross- culturalinstantiations of health, medicine, and the body.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 221 - Contemporary Japan (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Japan often conjures images steeped in tradition such as samuraiwarriors, sumo wrestlers, and geisha clad in kimono. At the sametime, however, contemporary Japan is just as easily associated withbusinessmen, anime, automobiles, and high technology. How have&quot;tradition&quot; and &quot;change&quot; fueled competing visions of Japan what itmeans to be &quot;Japanese&quot;? How does one go about reconciling theseconflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How havevariously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shiftingcircumstances? These questions will be at the heart of this seminar aswe consider case studies from different segments of Japanese society.A range of material will be treated as &quot;texts&quot; for analysis and discussionincluding anime, manga, literary works, and ﬁlms as well as ethnographicscholarship on Japanese society.</P><P>Crosslisting: EAST 221.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 224 - Human Origins and Prehistory (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course begins with a review of biological anthropology’s view ofhumanity. How do humans appear when studied with the tools biologistshave developed to understand other species? We then explore what weknow about the lives of our earliest ancestors and the clusters of newhuman-like species emerging over the next few million years, includingour own about 200,000 years ago. The last part of the class turns toarchaeological views of humanity. We survey the diversity of humanexperiences as our ancestors spread around the globe, creating art,starting farms, and building cities. Throughout, our emphasis will be onhow researchers know what they know and what assumptions are builtinto different narratives of human origins.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 225 - Introduction to Archaeology (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Most human experiences have gone unrecorded: because they occurredbeyond the reach of written records, because those making records didnot include them, or because the records have been lost. This coursesurveys the distinctive combination of scientiﬁc and humanistic methodsthat archaeologists use for unearthing these lost realms of humanexperience. The course is divided into three segments: the discipline’sdevelopment, techniques, and contemporary questions. Where possible,students will gain hands-on experience with archaeological techniques.We will also consider how archaeology and narratives about the past areembroiled in contemporary social conflicts.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 245 - Studies in Anthropology and Sociology (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Special topics in Anthropology and Sociology.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 290 - The Development of Social Thought (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An investigation of the classical foundations of social thought andsociocultural theory in sociology/anthropology.

The ﬁrst part considers historicaland theoretical debates about whether an anthropology of Islam and/or Muslims is, indeed, possible, including debates that consider whethersuch a category such as “Islam” exists and how it has become an objectof study. The second part will focus on contemporary ethnographies ofIslam and Muslims. Of particular interest to us will be lived experiencesof Muslims around the globe through the following broad topics: therole of ritual in Islam, Islamic piety movements, the relationship ofIslam and modernity, the role of authority and difference in the livesof contemporary Muslims, and emerging “Islamic” economies. Keyquestions include: What does an anthropological approach have tooffer the study of Islam and Muslims, and what can the study of Islam/Muslims offer anthropology? No prior knowledge of or exposure to Islamis required, but prior familiarity with anthropology is necessary.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 324 - Archaeology and Skeletons (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course introduces the identiﬁcation and analysis of bonesfrom archaeological sites.

Why are religious practices socommon across the last 30 millennia of human history? What doesreligion tell us about human cognition and how human societies havechanged across those millennia? Do other species have aspects ofreligion? How is it possible to study religious beliefs and practicesthrough the material culture of long dead groups? Such questionshave troubled archaeologists for generations, but, in recent years,new perspectives have emerged.

Afragmented group of nations decidedly on the periphery of the globaleconomy, the Caribbean was once one of the richest areas of theworld. Its riches then depended on the labor of enslaved Africans; thefruits of the plantation economy were enjoyed mainly by Europeanplanters. What is the legacy of such a history? We review the variety ofCaribbean policies, from the strong democratic traditions of Jamaica tothe autocratic rulers of Haiti, and explore how the Caribbean's uniquecombination of cultural influences affect the political processes, waysof life, class divisions and ethnic stratiﬁcation evident in the Caribbeantoday.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ANSO 100.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 343 - Demography of Africa (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>In this course, we begin by reviewing current literature to clearly deﬁnethe term, Demography.

However, what kindnessmeans varies overt time, place, and across people. In this course wewill examine social science research about kindness, thinking abouthow we can deﬁne, measure, and understand kindness. We will engagewith scholars to ask what kindness is, but also whether and why itis important for trust, well-being, and development. We will take asociological approach, looking at kindness in context: for example, howdo different situations, cultural scripts, inequalities, and identities shapeunderstandings of kindness? We will focus on how uncertainty is relatedto kindness, and how kindness may manifest differently during&quot;unsettled&quot;times of social change.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 399 - Adv topics Anthropology/Soc (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>A general category used only in the evaluation of transfer credit.</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 451 - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 452 - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)</P></Div><Div><P>ANSO 460 - Senior Research Seminar (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An integrative course designed to be a culmination of students' workin the major.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P></Div><P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The department emphasizes the useof the target language in most of its courses because students can bestappreciate another culture from within its own mode of expression.</P><P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, politics and public affairs, global commerce, globalhealth, and English. Courses in cultural studies and literature, aside fromtheir intrinsic worth, also present multiple perspectives on other culturesand areas of intellectual experience.</P></Div><P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of thedepartment and the Center for Global Programs (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve command of thelanguage are provided by language tables, international ﬁlms, clubmeetings, and similar activities sponsored by the department.

Working closely with faculty,students learn to translate visual observation and evaluation into writtenlanguage; articulate questions for research; communicate the results oftheir research discoveries in writing; and develop an informed, critical,and independent written voice. Our courses emphasize the sequential,graduated development of writing skills. These culminate in our requiredsenior thesis and symposium.</P><P>Art History and Visual Culture seniors also make a formal presentationof their research to an invited audience at the AHVC Junior-SeniorSymposium. All juniors in Art History and Visual Culture also arerequired to make a formal presentation of current work or research. Thepresentation is made to the faculty and to the student's peers as part ofthe AHVC Symposium annually.</P><P>Denison University works to make study abroad possible for all students.In Art History and Visual Culture, we encourage students to study abroadduring their junior year. Most students who major in Art History andVisual Culture and study off-campus transfer up to two classes for themajor, satisfy GE requirements, and/or gain general credits towardsgraduation. Quite a few students also do independent research orinternships as part of their study abroad experience.

We offertwo degree programs in Studio Art, a bachelor of arts (BA) and a bachelorof ﬁne arts (BFA). Both degree programs emphasize technical skills andcritical thinking, interdisciplinary work, collaboration and community. Weencourage the fluidity of learning and see art as a bridge to all areas ofstudy and research. The BA and the BFA prepare students in differentways for a variety of post-graduate pursuits, be it graduate school orprofessional endeavors in art and related ﬁelds. Students who plan tomajor in Studio Art are strongly advised to seek an advisor in Studio Artat the time of their decision to major. Studio Art majors are required totake a series of core courses and students need to work closely withadvisors to complete these core courses by end of the ﬁrst semesterin their junior year.

Thisis achieved in part through an introductory core of three courses thatprepare students for a deep exploration of sub-disciplines and researchmethods through subsequent advanced courses. The core covers themajor concepts of biology, encompassing an exploration of the naturalhistory of life on Earth, coupled with the basic skills of acquiring andprocessing information, solving problems, and analyzing data. Ourprogram then allows students the flexibility to explore speciﬁc areas ofbiology in depth through a suite of advanced courses in which they canexpand and apply their knowledge and skills.</P><P>The major prepares students for careers in science and related ﬁelds,as well as graduate and professional schools (including pre-medical,pre-dental and pre-veterinary studies), while allowing students theflexibility to design the program that best suits their speciﬁc interestsand career goals. In addition, biology majors are offered the opportunityto collaborate with faculty in research and laboratory instruction, topresent exceptional work at professional meetings, and to assist in themaintenance of the 350-acre Biological Reserve and other departmentalfacilities. Information on studies in Pre-Health is provided in the &quot;SpecialPrograms and Opportunities&quot; section of the catalog.</P><P>Writing is an integral component of science, and as such, the BiologyDepartment understands that the development of writing skills isessential for all students who pursue the study of biology. The goal forour students is that they emerge as strong writers, able to constructcohesive bodies of written work in which they express clear, concise andlogical arguments, supported by empirical evidence and/or informationfrom appropriate sources. A developmental model of writing skillsis tightly woven into the biology curriculum to achieve this goal. Ourmajor core curriculum establishes the foundation of good writingpractices. Basic grammatical expression is addressed in <Link Alt="">BIOL 210</Link> -Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, while <Link Alt="">BIOL 220</Link> - MulticellularLife focuses on understanding the format of biological literature,culminating in <Link Alt="">BIOL 230</Link> - Ecology and Evolution, where students writemultiple full-length papers. Taken sequentially, <Link Alt="">BIOL 220</Link> - MulticellularLife and <Link Alt="">BIOL 230</Link> - Ecology and Evolution serve as one of the Wrequirements for general education. In our advanced curriculum, studentscontinue to explore more sophisticated levels of writing, includingemploying distinct disciplinary conventions and engaging with differentgenres applicable to biological writing. Students who undertake a seniorresearch project write a comprehensive thesis of their work (counting asan additional W requirement), putting into practice the many writing skillsthat they have developed throughout the curriculum.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>The Department of Biology at Denison seeks to develop students asinformed, discerning lifelong learners of the natural world. We providestudents with both a breadth and a depth of knowledge while providing afoundation of skills required of professional biologists and scientiﬁcallyliterate citizens in general. Our core curriculum emphasizes key concepts,at a variety of levels of biological organization, ranging from moleculesto the Biosphere, in the context of evolution. We expand upon these keyconcepts in advanced courses where we challenge students to applytheir knowledge to address real-world, scientiﬁc problems.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor Lina I.

For either degree, studentsshould aim to complete the three Biology core courses by the end of theirsecond year: BIOL 210 - Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life, BIOL 220- Multicellular Life, and BIOL 230 - Ecology and Evolution. Students whohave completed comparable course work at other accredited institutionsmay petition to have such courses transferred to Denison and creditedtoward the major, at the discretion of the department. In contrast,students with credit-earning scores on Advanced Placement (4 or 5)or International Baccalaureate (6 or 7) tests in Biology will be grantedacademic credit for BIOL 100 - Modern Topics in Biology, but typically willbe required to complete all three major core courses.</P><P>Majors must achieve a grade point average of 2.0 or higher across thethree core courses (BIOL 210 - Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life,BIOL 220 - Multicellular Life, BIOL 230 - Ecology and Evolution) uponcompletion of the core sequence before proceeding to 300-level electivecourses. Students who do not meet the GPA requirement must repeat oneor more core courses to achieve the standard; the highest grade awardedfor any repeated core course will be exclusively used in calculating the“biology core GPA”, but all biology grades will be used to calculate theoverall major GPA for graduation, as per university policy. This policyapplies only to students pursuing a biology major; it does not apply tostudents pursuing the biology minor or other non-biology degrees.</P><P>The major additionally requires two semesters of introductory levelchemistry (CHEM 131 - Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamicsand CHEM 132 - Organic Structure and Reactivity; grades of C orbetter are strongly recommended). CHEM 131 - Atoms and Molecules:Structure and Dynamics must be completed before undertaking 300-levelelectives, but CHEM 132 - Organic Structure and Reactivity can be takenconcurrently.</P><P>Biology majors subsequently complete ﬁve 300-level advanced courses.Any combination of advanced courses may be taken, but one of theseelectives must be designated a “biological diversity” course (seedescription below). BIOL 452 - Advanced Senior Research is credited asa 300-level course, but BIOL 361 - Directed Study, BIOL 362 - DirectedStudy), BIOL 363 - Independent Study, BIOL 364 - Independent Study),and BIOL 451 - Senior Research are not counted as 300-level advancedcourses toward the requirements for the major. Students are encouragedto consult with an advisor in the Biology Department in order to select themost appropriate suite of advanced courses.</P><P>Biology majors preparing for medical school or most graduate programsare additionally advised to take CHEM 251 - Intermediate OrganicChemistry, and CHEM 258 - Intermediate Biochemistry, PHYS 121 -General Physics I and  PHYS 122 - General Physics II), and two semestersof college-level math (e.g., MATH 130 - Essentials of Calculus, MATH 135- Single Variable Calculus, or MATH 145 - Multi-variable Calculus) orMATH 120 - Elements of Statistics).

Developmentalbiology is the study of the progression from this single cell to a complex,multicellular organism. Recently the powerful tools of molecular biologyhave linked the ﬁelds of embryology and genetics to reveal how cells,tissues, organs, and organisms develop. Especially striking is theconservation of molecules and mechanisms that underlie developmentalprocesses in different organisms. This course provides an overview ofthe major features of early embryonic development in animals, and themechanisms (molecular mechanism when known) that underlie them.We focus on two major aspects of developmental biology: (1) How is thebasic body plan established? How does the basic organization of theembryo arise from the fertilized egg? What are the cellular mechanismsunderlying morphogenesis and the appearance of pattered structures inthe embryo? (2) How do parts become different in the embryo?</P><P>Prerequisite(s): Biology core or consent, and CHEM 131 or CHEM majors -BIOL 210, BIOL 220, and CHEM 300 (or concurrently).</P></Div><Div><P>BIOL 325 - Genetics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course provides a detailed and up-to-date understanding of genetics,an appreciation of how genetics affects our lives every day from thesupermarket to the doctor's ofﬁce, and a realization of the applications ofgenetics to virtually every discipline of biology.

At thesame time, it is designed to meet the specialized interests of studentsthrough an interdisciplinary major and minor. Therefore, many appropriatecourses are found under the rubric of other departments. Black Studiesmajors and minors are encouraged to complete some portion of theirundergraduate education abroad; many off-campus study opportunitiesavailable through Denison are relevant to Black Studies and help majorsand minors gain global perspectives and experiences.<P/> <P/>Through our courses, we teach students to write using variousdisciplinary frameworks to place Black life, experiences, and cultureat the center of their analyses or to interrogate societal dynamics thatshape, and are shaped, by Black life and culture. To do this, our students'writing might include personal narratives, formal essays, or theoreticaldiscourses. Our aim is to support students in selecting the mode ofwritten expression and developing the tools to utilize those modes ofexpression in ways that reveal, articulate, and analyze Black life andculture and the relevant dynamics of society.<P/> <P/>The Black Studies curriculum is administered by a faculty committee andthe director of the Center for Black Studies.

First, we seek to promotea level of scientiﬁc literacy and chemical understanding among allstudents taking courses in the department that will contribute to theUniversity’s fundamental mission “to inspire and educate our studentsto become autonomous thinkers, discerning moral agents and activecitizens of a democratic society.” Secondly, we will provide a rigorousand comprehensive program in chemistry and biochemistry suitablefor those students pursuing careers in science and technology. In itscourses the department seeks to progressively develop skills in buildingqualitative and quantitative interpretation of chemical phenomena, inexperimental analysis and design, and in written and oral communicationof scientiﬁc ideas. Graduates of this program, grounded in a well-developed molecular worldview, are expected to explain the behaviorof chemical and biological systems based on physical models. Thedepartment is also deeply committed to sustaining a vigorous anddiverse range of collaborative student-faculty research. A community ofmutual support among students, faculty, and staff is a vital element inachieving our goals.</P><P>The Chemistry and Biochemistry curriculum provides courses that aredesigned to enable students, as contributing professionals and engagedcitizens, to deal effectively with a world increasingly dominated by theideas and methods of modern science. Majors are qualiﬁed for immediateemployment in industry. However, many elect to attend graduateschool in chemistry, biochemistry, and related areas, or enter schools ofmedicine, dentistry, or engineering. The department is approved by theCommittee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society tooffer a Certiﬁcate of Professional Training in Chemistry to students whosatisfy certain requirements.</P><P><Span/></P><P>Associate Professor Annabel M.

Earning a B.A.degree does not preclude a professional scientiﬁc career, although anadditional year of undergraduate study may be required for admissionto some graduate programs. The department also offers a minor inChemistry.</P><P>Our program requires courses at the introductory (100), intermediate(200 and 300), and advanced (400) levels. We expect that majors willcomplete the required 300-level courses by the end of their junior year.The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry recommends stronglythat students earn a C or better in each of the core courses, CHEM 131- Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics, CHEM 132 - OrganicStructure and Reactivity, CHEM 251 - Intermediate Organic Chemistry andCHEM 258 - Intermediate Biochemistry, before proceeding to 300-levelcourses. 400-level courses, to be counted toward the major, need to betaken after the prerequisites. Any request to waive this requirement mustcome prior to taking the course. We strongly encourage all majors to havean advisor in the department.</P><P>Students pursuing any of the three majors are required to complete thefollowing nine common courses plus the additional courses listed foreach program:</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>Two introductory courses in the principles of chemistry:</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>CHEM 131</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Atoms and Molecules: Structureand Dynamics</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>CHEM 132</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Organic Structure and Reactivity</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>Three required intermediate courses:</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>CHEM 251</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Intermediate Organic Chemistry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>CHEM 258</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Intermediate Biochemistry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>CHEM 343</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Intermediate Physical Chemistry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>The following four additional science courses:</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>BIOL 210</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Molecular Biology and UnicellularLife</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>MATH 135</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Single Variable Calculus</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>MATH 145</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>Multi-variable Calculus</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>PHYS 121</Div></Div></TD><TD><Div>General Physics I</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P>All Chemistry and Biochemistry majors must also satisfactorily completetwo zero-credit courses used for program assessment CHEM 300 -Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Assessment I and CHEM 400 - Chemistry &amp;Biochemestry Assessment II.</P><H2>BA in Chemistry</H2><P>A student may graduate with a B.A. degree in Chemistry on fulﬁllmentof G.E. requirements and the successful completion of the following 12courses:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>The nine common courses listed above</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>One additional 300-level intermediate course</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>One additional four-credit 400-level CHEM course1</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>One additional four-credit 300 or 400 level CHEM course1</P></LBody></LI></L><P>note: 1) CHEM 451 or 452 will not satisfy this requirement</P><H2>BS in Chemistry</H2><P>A student may graduate with a B.S. degree in Chemistry on fulﬁllmentof G.E. requirements and the successful completion of the following 16courses:</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>The nine common courses listed above</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>CHEM 317</Div></TD><TD><Div>Intermediate Inorganic Chemistry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>CHEM 331</Div></TD><TD><Div>Intermediate Analytical Chemistry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>One additional four-credit 300 or 400-level CHEM course</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>Three additional four-credit 400-level CHEM courses</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PHYS 122</Div></TD><TD><Div>General Physics II</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P>Note: In order to complete the required courses for a B.S. in Chemistry,students must start CHEM 131 in the ﬁrst semester of their ﬁrst year.</P><H2>BS in Biochemistry</H2><P>A student may graduate with a B.S. degree in Biochemistry on fulﬁllmentof G.E. requirements and the successful completion of the following 17courses:</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>The nine common courses listed above</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>CHEM 331</Div></TD><TD><Div>Intermediate Analytical Chemistry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>Five additional 300 and 400-level CHEM or BIOL courses: one of thesemust be a 300 or 400-level biology class, and one of these must be a 400-level chemistry/biochemistry class taken in the senior year (CHEM 451or 452 will not satisfy this requirement) 1</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>BIOL 220</Div></TD><TD><Div>Multicellular Life</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PHYS 122</Div></TD><TD><Div>General Physics II</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P><L><LI><Lbl><P>1</P></Lbl><LBody><P><P>(All advanced courses in Biology have prerequisite courses that astudent majoring in Biochemistry may not have completed.

Faculty and staff in the Department ofEducation assist students in creating individually designed plans forobtaining licensure through a range of programs after graduation.Students interested in pursuing a B.A. degree in Chemistry beforepursuing a teaching career are strongly encouraged to take all three 300-level Chemistry course options (as described below).</P><P>The Chemistry courses listed above must be taken at Denison with thefollowing exception: the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistryrecognizes the valuable contribution that off-campus study can provideto a broad liberal arts education, so one course in the major at the 300-level or higher may be taken at another institution, providing that priorapproval is received from the department. Students considering studyoff-campus are encouraged to discuss these plans with their academicadvisor early in their Denison careers. The department understands thattransfer students, students who adopt a chemistry or biochemistry majorafter the ﬁrst year, and students who study off-campus may have uniqueneeds; we encourage them to contact us so that we can work together tohelp them achieve their academic objectives.</P><P>Approved eye protection is required in all laboratory courses.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Courses</H2><Div><Div><P>CHEM 131 - Atoms and Molecules: Structure and Dynamics (4 CreditHours)</P><P>This course is an introduction to the study of chemical phenomena usingan &quot;atoms-ﬁrst&quot; approach -- starting with atoms and building up to morecomplex molecules.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P><P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P><P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, politics and public affairs, global commerce, globalhealth, and English.

Cinema majors and minors arestrongly encouraged to complete at least CINE 104 - Film Aestheticsand Analysis and CINE 221 - Elementary Cinema Production during theﬁrst year, and CINE 225 - History of Cinema and CINE 230 - IntermediateCinema Production by the end of their sophomore year. Cinema majorsare also urged to select a faculty member in the Department of Cinema astheir advisor.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>The Department of Cinema is devoted to teaching the practice andthe scholarly study of the art of cinema in all its forms (e.g. narrative,documentary, avant-garde/experimental, animation). Our curriculumincorporates ﬁlm/digital production and the study of ﬁlm aesthetics,history, and theory, with majors required to take production and cinemastudies courses in equal measure. This reflects our belief that ﬁlmmakingand ﬁlm studies are mutually sustaining: the experience of researchingand analyzing cinema at a high intellectual level provides the developingﬁlmmaker with a sense of their place in ﬁlm-historical tradition as well asan aesthetic and conceptual sophistication that leads to more compellingartwork; and the experience of making ﬁlms allows students to seecinema in new ways, enriching their analytical, historical, and theoreticalwriting and thinking.</P><P>As a department in Denison’s Division of Fine Arts, we approach cinemaﬁrst and foremost as an art form. Making and studying art mergestechnical skill and experience, aesthetic sensibility, historical knowledge,and a wide range of ideas and types of thinking. Our goal is to help ourstudents become more critical, discerning, and worldly producers andconsumers of cinematic art.</P><P>As a department at a liberal arts university, we teach cinema in a way thatencourages students to connect it with the other arts, and to forge linksbetween the study of ﬁlm and their academic work in other courses atDenison. In ﬁlm studies courses, students examine cinema from multipleperspectives: historical, scientiﬁc and technological, philosophical,psychological, economic, political, and cultural. They engage in ﬁlmanalysis, historical research, and theoretical inquiry. The ﬁlm/digitalproduction courses provide an immersive education in ﬁlmmakingtechnology and craft, while also challenging students to think artistically,critically, and ethically as they work to produce compelling works of ﬁlmart.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Jonathan Walley, Chair</P><P>Associate Professors Jonathan Walley, Marc Wiskemann, JesseSchlotterbeck; Assistant Professors Jane M.

Culturally, we consider Rome's legacyto the western world in terms of its social and political institutions, aswell as its intellectual and artistic achievements.</P></Div><Div><P>CLAS 208 - Pain, Healing, and the Body in Early Christianity andContemporary Worlds (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>As experiences, pain and healing would seem to be straightforward:something is broken or hurting, and is in need of ﬁxing. But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis. Lastly, we willengage in self-reflective writing about our own experiences with health,illness, and healing.</P><P>Crosslisting: QS 208, REL 208, WGST 208.</P></Div><Div><P>CLAS 211 - Ancient Greek Literature and Society (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is an introduction to Ancient Greek literature from theHomeric world to the Hellenistic era.

Is&quot;public address”—the art of understanding, composing, and executingethical oral communication—still relevant in an era of social media,political polarization, and contentious discourse? This course will teachstudents, through the framework of rhetorical history and theory, theconcepts and skills needed to reﬁne their efﬁcacy as oral communicatorsin a variety of settings. Communication as a liberal art steeped in thetraditions of rhetoric will be emphasized. This course largely covers thesame material as THTR 195 Speaking as a Fine Art.

In order to become better audiences and practitionersof argument, students will consider the nature of argument, the buildingblocks of argument and the practice of argument in public debate.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 125 - Relating Through Narrating (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Social interactions saturate our everyday lives—from talking with closefriends, family members and acquaintances to engaging in broaderpublics. Narrative threads tie these interactions together, shaping howindividuals negotiate their identities, relational boundaries, expectations,and power differences. This course examines narrative’s relationalqualities, prompting questions such as: How is narrative embodied,conceived and enacted in our everyday interactions and relationships?Furthermore, how do the meanings constructed through narrativecreate conditions for cultivating meaningful connections with others?Course readings will explore theoretical understandings and practicalimplications of narrative across an assortment of relational settings.Assignments, involving both creative and critical practices, will entailintrospective inquiry, relational analyses, and storied presentations.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 126 - Media Structures (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is designed to initiate students into critical and intelligentdebates surrounding the issue of communication and its pertinence tomass, modern and postmodern societies. We consider speciﬁcally howmass communication has been deﬁned from the 19th through to thebeginning of the 21st Century and how this history is relevant to issuesof mass society today. Given that almost every person in America isaffected by mass culture and media, we will discuss through the lectures,discussions and exercises a number of controversial suggestions,critical paradigms and mainstream assumptions. Throughout the course,students will be expected to understand these approaches and be able toboth criticize and recognize the legitimacy of these models.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 130 - Freedom of Speech (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Freedom of Speech introduces students to the dimensions of oraldiscourse both as practiced in a community of citizens and theoreticallyviewed through various legal interpretations. We will examine howthe ﬁrst amendment rights have been defended and impinged withinacademic settings, throughout historical periods of political unrest andwar, and in daily exchanges marked by hate, defamation and obscenity.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 140 - The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentiousstruggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one’s cultural“taste” was a signiﬁcant factor in determining one’s standing in thesocial hierarchy. Debates about “high” vs “low” culture and about whatcultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a communityhave involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us witha lens through which to understand historical social changes. It alsoallows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instanceabout the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historicalprecedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeksto trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe totheir culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In sodoing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competingideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading someof the prominent theorists of “high” culture and then problematize theirarguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posedby the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historicaldebate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popularculture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways toanalyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we oftenunthinkingly consume.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 147 - Introduction to Media Literacy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>While most of us are proﬁcient consumers of visual electronic media -we have the speed of symbol-recognition and comprehension skills tobe adept &quot;readers&quot; - few of us have learned to bring to that reading thecritical skills we learn in the study of literature, music or art.

While the term &quot;globalization&quot; has been bandiedabout among the popular press, academic and the business community,this course will attempt to contextualize and ground the concept bydeveloping a multiperspectival approach to some of the political,economic and social processes that have been associated with thedevelopment of a world communication system. Throughout thecourse, we will examine the growing centrality that the mass media andinformation technologies play in our daily lives and the ways in whichthey contribute to or hinder our daily practices of identity, community andculture in a global context.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 211 - Thinking with Ethics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course will help students discover how to better recognize ethicalquestions when they stumble across them and to explore how, whenwe do, we lean into them rather than turn away. What makes it possiblefor us to think, listen and speak with ethics? We will explore a range ofpublic and private ethical questions that arise in the everyday lives ofcollege students such as, for example: privacy &amp; free speech, conformity&amp; dissent, accountability &amp; care, trust &amp; truthfulness, propaganda &amp;censorship, power &amp; privilege, whistleblowing &amp; secrecy, and alterity &amp;responsibility.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 215 - Special Topics in Communication (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Special Topics in Communication provides a venue in which to explore indepth an aspect or issue related to communication study.

This course willbegin with an in-depth exploration of the philosophy that communicationis the means through which we construct, participate, and convey thecultures we are a part of and therefore, is central to the creation of thekind of world we want to live in. We will then turn our attention to ananalysis of current social, organizational and political discourses on theenvironment and our responsibility, or not, in its protection.”.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 221 - Theories of Group Communication (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course studies the communication process in the task orienteddiscussion group.

We will pay particular attentionto the political, economic, and cultural roles of the media in twentiethcentury U.S. history, drawing connections to radio and television's quicklychanging present. We will also examine how history itself is researchedand written, introducing you to theories and methods in historiography.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 227 - New Literacy Lab (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Digital technology is merging traditional communication modalitiesof voice, text, and image into ever new forms of representation andinteraction, changing many aspects of our lives profoundly, not onlyin terms of personal and business relationships, consumer habits,work environments, and civic engagement, but even in the ways weunderstand ourselves, relate to each other, and form identities. Studentswill explore the creative potential of these communication forms in a labpracticum closely tied to the exploration of their existential impact intheory readings and class discussions.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 229 - Mediating Gender and Sexuality (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>In this class we will examine and evaluate the cultural construction andrepresentation of gender and sexuality in contemporary American massmedia, and trace their development throughout the 20th century. We willfocus on a variety of mass-produced commercial media texts, surveyingtelevision, magazines, advertising, and popular music. Although genderis the primary identity construction examined in this course, we will alsopay close attention to other aspects of identity that deﬁne Americanwomen, such as ethnicity, class, and sexuality. We will investigaterepresentational issues in relation to their political repercussions, anddraw from a broad range of academic literature, including feministtelevision criticism, ﬁlm theory, cultural studies, communication theory,and popular music criticism.</P><P>Crosslisting: QS 229 and WGST 229.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 232 - Theories of Public and Private Performance (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>How do we perform our identities in everyday life? What role doeseveryday performativity play in constituting us as raced, gendered, andclassed subjects? How do cultural performances (musical concerts,sporting events, or dance) help us better understand ourselves and oursociety? In this class we examine a range of theories that see privatebehaviors and public performances as rehearsed, audience-oriented, andcreative acts. Theorists such as Erving Goffman, Judith Butler, PierreBourdieu, and Victor Turner will guide our examination of both &quot;everyday&quot;performativity (in regard to bodily stigma and identities of class, race,gender, and sexuality) and cultural performances (such as musicalconcerts, sporting events, and dance). Students will learn how to analyzetheir own behavior as a cultural text and to discern the textual, acoustic,and embodied dimensions of cultural performances. They will practiceilluminating how performances can reinforce or disrupt the social order,while creating the self in community.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 234 - Media Theory (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>In this course, we think critically about the political, economic, andcultural dimensions of media forms (e.g. television programs, viralvideos) and practices (e.g. sending text messages, participating in socialmedia networks). In readings, screenings, written assignments, anddiscussions you develop a working knowledge of different intellectualtraditions used to study media. From the very start, the course pushespast simplistic, binary assessments of media consumption as beingeither “good” or “bad.” Instead, we survey the complicated routes throughwhich media forms and practices inform people’s understandings ofthemselves and the world around them. Organized into three units, thecourse aims to provide you with conceptual frames for 1) understandingthe relationship between media and culture, 2) identifying how mediamake claims to represent truth and authenticity, and 3) comprehendingthe role of media in ideological conflict. Throughout the term, you areasked to question many ideas and beliefs that people take for granted:that media are “bad” for children, that some television programmingis “realistic,” or that we could ever exist outside the web of mediatedcommunication that informs our day-to-day lives, even if we wanted todo just that. The overarching aim of the course is nuance – a deeperunderstanding of media, and a reﬁned critical lens of assessing its role incontemporary life.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 239 - Racialized Perspectives of Media (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course critically examines the forms that racial and ethnicrepresentations have taken in American media. The course will attempt tochart changes in public perception of racial and ethnic difference in thecontext of cultural and social transformations, as well as adjustments inthe U.S. media industry. We will ﬁrst establish a foundational knowledgeof media criticism and explore theories and perspectives on how ethnicityis experienced in American culture. We will then focus on the topic of therepresentation of ethnicity in American media, surveying it historically, inrelation to speciﬁc ethnic groups, at particular moments, and in a varietyof genres.</P><P>Crosslisting: BLST 239.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 244 - Theories of Intercultural Communication (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course examines the processes and politics of interculturalcommunication in both domestic and international contexts.Students will enhance their cross-cultural awareness by exploringdifferences in value orientations, thought patterns and (non)verbalbehaviors, challenges of transition and adaptation across cultures,identity management in intercultural settings, intergroup relationshipdevelopment and conflict resolution, and intercultural communicationcompetence and ethics.

It will seek to understand the consequences ofthe process whereby texts, ideas and images that for long remainedconﬁned to their locations of origin are today increasingly mobile andde-territorialized. Objects of popular culture such as television, cinemaand music, are circulating and being consumed around the world andare helping challenge the traditional markers of human identity suchas nation, culture and language. While they are allowing individuals toimagine alternatives to existing realities they are also engendering abacklash against a perceived imposition of new ideas, values and culture.This course will seek to familiarize students with these ongoing changesand the conflicts over cultural and national identity that it has given riseto. We will begin with arguments that present a totalizing view of thisprocess (the Cultural Imperialism thesis) and then over the course of thesemester complicate and nuance those arguments by introducing agencyand empowerment for the consumers of global culture. We will do thisby closely studying actual case studies (from reality TV in Saudi Arabiaor McDonalds in Japan) in order to understand the stakes involved inthe struggle to deﬁne and &quot;protect&quot; national and cultural identity. At theend of this semester long course students should have gained a deepunderstanding of why the process of global flow of culture is a deeplycontentious and political phenomenon.

Adouble mathematics and computer science major is not eligible for thisconcentration.</P><H2>Additional Points of Interest</H2><P>Students who intend to continue with graduate study in ComputerScience should pursue the Bachelor of Science degree.</P><P>Computer Science students should be adept at not only solvingproblems through the implementation of computer programs, but also incommunicating those solutions to a wide variety of audiences. Studentsshould learn the proper use of documentation to share their programswith users and other computer scientists, be prepared to compose proofsand analyses of their algorithms, and have opportunities to write formalpapers.</P><H3>Research at Denison</H3><P>Denison offers a number of research opportunities, including fundingfor summer research projects.  The Anderson Foundation and theDenison University Research Foundation (DURF) support qualiﬁedstudents conducting summer research. For off-campus researchopportunities in Computer Science, see the Oak Ridge Science Semester(on hiatus fall 2019) described at <Link Alt="">http://denison.edu/academics/oak-ridge</Link> (<Link Alt="">http://denison.edu/academics/oak-ridge/</Link>) or various <Link Alt="">NationalScience Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5049</Link>) experiences.Interested students should consult a faculty member as early as possiblein the fall semester.</P><H3>Off-Campus Study</H3><P>The Department of Computer Science strongly encourages studentsto globalize their education by completing some portion of theirundergraduate education abroad. A majority of Denison students spend asemester abroad during their junior year and many more spend a summer(or two) abroad. Denison offers a wide range of opportunities to study off-campus that are highly relevant to your Denison experience.</P><P>Going abroad allows students to enhance their knowledge whileexperiencing another culture and way of life. Students gain valuableexperience that will beneﬁt future career goals and/or graduate schoolopportunities. Computer Science majors who are fluent in anotherlanguage will have special advantages in the job market.</P><P>Students may take up to two classes outside the department to transfertowards the major at Denison.  Additional courses taken outside Denisonmay accrue credit hours towards graduation, but will not contribute torequirements in the major.  Courses taken outside the university mustbe pre-approved for acceptance towards major requirements.  Studentsshould provide the department chair syllabi for the intended courses fordepartment approval.  Students may petition the department chair forexceptions to this policy.  In particular, transfer students may be eligibleto transfer additional courses towards major requirements.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Courses</H2><Div><Div><P>CS 109 - Discovering Computer Science (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is an introduction to computational problem solving.

Students may simultaneously be exposed to poststructuralistepistemology, feminist theory, and power &amp; justice ideologies whilethey are meeting a survey of historical works from a selected culturalcontext. In this way, the course is less about coming to know a canon of&quot;masterworks&quot; and more about learning how to interrogate dance in manycultures from multiple perspectives. Students will be expected to engagein movement activities as a method toward an embodied understandingof theory, but will not be evaluated on their movement performance orability. No dance experience necessary. This course may be crosslisteddepending on the speciﬁc course content.</P></Div><Div><P>DANC 284 - Choreographic Investigations (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course focuses on the creation and presentation of assigned shortmovement studies that focus on principles of dance composition for theconcert stage. Past focus has been on the relationship of movement tosound, interrogating the use of music in modern dance history. Throughsolo, duet and group forms students learn about the compositionalelements of space, time, dynamics, flow and shape, discover their ownunique movement style, become familiar with how the body worksand how it can be expressive, and expand their own deﬁnitions ofdance. Three fundamental aspects of creative work in movement will beemphasized: movement invention, compositional structure, and creatingmeaning. A desire to take risks and be transformed, a willingness to usethe body as an expressive tool, an eagerness to learn, and willingnessto question personal choices are essential for success in this class. Aninterest, ability and a desire to be physically challenged to work towardexpressive clarity in movement, is assumed.

Weneed systematic observation of unbiased data to accurately diagnose,understand, and treat them. The DPR minor aims to foster a problem-centric, quantitative approach to understanding the interactions ofpeople, society, and their governing institutions. Students in the minorwill receive training in how to design research for social impact, how toanalyze data for more certain conclusions, and how to visualize data andresults for clarity and persuasion in service of understanding politics inits many contexts. Together, design, analysis, and visualization enableresearchers to contribute their own answers to pressing social andpolitical questions with opportunities for oral and written translationof that expertise to public audiences. In this way, DPR students areencouraged to consider how they can use quantitative social sciencetools of design, analysis, and visualization to serve and inform the publicconsistent with the Denison mission.</P><H2>Departmental Guidelines</H2><P>DPR students are interested in why and how people and policies actin the way they do.

While reading research on a wide rangeof interesting questions about our political world, we will continuallydiscuss problems of causal inference – the degree to which we haveconﬁdence that x causes y. We’ll learn about various approaches tocausal research, covering a range of research designs in the socialsciences. And, third, we’ll practice analyzing data from these researchdesigns using modeling techniques appropriate for each. You will leavethis course with the training needed to critique research but also toconduct your own research, offering appropriate caveats about howmuch we can conﬁdently know.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 250 - Writing with Data in the Public Interest (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course addresses a critical goal that is often neglected in thesciences – the translation of scientiﬁc results for the public. Even if thegoal of science is to make progress in the public interest, a key way thatthe public knows about scientiﬁc results as well as maintains support forscientiﬁc projects is through communication. Thus, the primary goal isto develop skills of written communication with scientiﬁc content that isappropriate for general public consumption. The course covers a concernfor narrative, translating scientiﬁc jargon without loss of meaning,providing detail to convey appropriate levels of certainty, addressingaudience needs, and packing considerable material into short passages,while respecting the ethics of reporting to the public. Integration with theonetwentyseven.blog is emphasized.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 290 - Intermediate Special Topics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Intermediate topics in Data for Political Research.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 299 - Intermediate Topics in Data for Political Research (1-4 CreditHours)</P><P>A general category used only in the evaluation of transfer credit.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 310 - Doing Democracy Differently (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Democracy is often assumed to mean ‘electoral democracy’ such asthat practiced in the United States. However, there are many democraticdeﬁcits of electoral democracy and alternate models are available.We will spend the semester exploring these alternate models thatemphasize citizen deliberation. Special emphasis is placed on empiricalassessments of the many dimensions of process and outcome, as wellas application to the many organizational environments in which we areenmeshed. The course is meant to be paired with the innovative StudentAdvisory Board program implemented by DCGA to inject direct citizendeliberative input in their legislative process.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): DPR 201 or POSC 201 or consent of instructor.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 311 - Political Organizations in the U.S (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>&quot;Democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the parties.&quot; Yet, some,including the Founding Fathers, have been less sure of Schattschneider'struism, warning of the mischiefs of faction. Political organization,however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure ofAmerican democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interestgroups, and social movements have formed and acted to create andinsure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In thecourse, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death ofpolitical organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature ofpolitical organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations,as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism,media, technology and money. Organizations considered may include: theRepublican, Democratic, and third parties; major interest groups such asthe Sierra Club, AARP, NRA, Christian Coalition, Chamber of Commerce,and unions; and social movements such as the women's, civil rights, andChristian conservative movements.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 312 - Religion and Politics in U.S. (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course offers an intensive analysis of the many connectionsbetween the American religious and political systems. Questionsconsidered include whether religion is fulﬁlling its democraticresponsibilities, the constitutional bounds of the relationship betweenchurch and state, the religious dimensions of American political behavior,religious influences on political institutions and decision makers, andreligious interest group activity.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 313 - American Political Behavior (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course focuses on the involvement of the public in Americanpolitical processes. We will address such questions as: Why do citizensvote? For whom do they vote? How else do citizens involve themselves inthe political process and why? What does the public think about politicalissues? What forces can change the nature, concerns, and behaviorof the electorate? What are the prospects for a workable participatorydemocracy in America? The course is geared toward the conduct ofstatistically-based research on substantive problems in Americanpolitical behavior.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 314 - Power and Gender (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Despite considerable progress, gender remains an essential dividing linein politics. Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of publicofﬁcials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances inrole models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychologyall shape what amounts to the political “gender system.” In this course,we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through agendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developedsocieties. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role inachieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual,social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate thatbias. Students will conduct a range of original empirical research tocontribute to these important debates.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 361 - Directed Study (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Directed Studies are undertaken at the initiative of the student and mayinvolve any topic acceptable to the student and an instructor.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 362 - Directed Study (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Directed studies are undertaken at the initiative of the student and mayinvolve any topic acceptable to the student and an instructor.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 363 - Independent Study (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Independent Study in Data for Political Research.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 364 - Independent Study (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Independent Study in Data for Political Research.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 390 - Advanced Special Topics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Advanced topics in Data for Political Research.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 399 - Advanced Topics in Data for Political Research (1-4 CreditHours)</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 451 - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Senior Research in Data for Political Research.</P></Div><Div><P>DPR 452 - Senior Research (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Senior Research in Data for Political Research.</P></Div></Div></Div><P/><H1>Denison Seminars</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_6128">Program Guidelines</H2><P>Denison Seminars are innovative, specially designed courses offeredeach semester focusing on topics that integrate and transcend traditionaldepartmental, programmatic, and/or divisional boundaries.

We seek to understand how they have evolved and continueto evolve, how Earth systems—including human agents—interact toproduce the environment in which we live, and how present and futurechanges may impact the habitability of Earth. The central goal of thedepartment is to educate students about the nature and history ofthe Earth, the processes that shape the Earth, and the impacts thoseprocesses have on humans, other organisms, and the environment. </P><P>An understanding of the Earth is an essential component of globalcitizenship. Humanity faces many critical environmental issues,including global climate change, water shortages, loss of arable land,natural hazards such as earthquakes and flooding, and the dwindlingaccess to energy resources; furthermore, vulnerability to these issuesis disproportionate across humanity. Citizens and professionals withtraining in the Earth and Environmental Sciences will contribute toaddressing these and other problems, while increasing opportunities forhumans to live sustainably and equitably on the Earth.</P><P>The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences strives to foster anenvironment of inclusion and equity. Innovative, effective, and equitablestewardship of Earth’s resources requires a diversity of perspectivesand influences; we strive to empower a future generation of sociallyresponsible scientiﬁc leaders who represent a cross-section of humansociety. We are committed to excellence in teaching and learning andafﬁrm the value of our community members regardless of race, ethnicity,gender, social class, or sexual identity.</P><P>Broadly speaking, the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciencesprovides the tools to be suc-cessful in any ﬁeld. Whether their goal isemployment in the ﬁeld or graduate school, EESC majors and minorsdevelop a strong background in the Earth and Environmental Sciences.The department provides non-majors with a broad and deep knowledge ofthe Earth and its environment that will serve their needs as citizens andfuture community leaders.</P><P>Learning Goals</P><P>The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences is committedto helping students become productive, informed, and influentialcitizens. To that end, we have developed a clear set of learning goals thatreside within three broad categories:</P><P>Content Knowledge.—Mastery of modern disciplinary content isparamount in the EESC pro-gram. EESC faculty are committedto staying apprised of the most recent developments and bestpractices within our individual specialties. Therefore, EESC studentswill encounter up-to-date concepts and methods. EESC Facultyare also keenly aware of the importance of the allied foundationalsciences (i.e., Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, ComputerScience, Data Analytics, and Physics).  Accordingly, students areencouraged to learn deeply in the allied disciplines. Ultimately,we recognize that modern earth and environmental science isrooted in a broad un-derstanding of foundational skills and coredisciplinary knowledge. By the end of their EESC major, studentswill master the disciplinary knowledge needed to comprehend,apply, analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and integrate new informationinto their ever-developing understanding of the earth and itsenvironment.</P><P>Quantitative Literacy.—The ability to reason using numbers is anessential skill for any informed member of the citizenry. We believestudents should be empowered, not intimidated, by data. That said,we recognize that interpreting data is not always a straightforwardexercise. Accordingly, quantitative exercises are integrated into alllevels of the EESC curriculum. These learning opportunities in EESCare designed to promote operational proﬁciency with data beyondcollege, even when confronted with incomplete and/or contradictoryinformation. EESC graduates should be able to evaluate, analyze,and interpret quantitative information, not simply to ﬁnd an answerbut rather, to help interpret the earth and environment around them.</P><P>Communication.—The ability to communicate effectively is a corelearning outcome of any undergraduate education. The Departmentof Earth and Environmental Sciences recognizes the importanceof both oral communication skills (public speaking) and writtencommunication (expository writing). Both skill sets are emphasizedat all levels of the EESC curriculum. Upon the completion of anEESC major, students should be able to construct, apply, andevaluate effective oral and written communication strategies forboth specialized and general audiences.</P><P>The Department of Earth and Environmental Science employs acomprehensive exam to evaluate student learning. This multi-dayexam uses oral and written components to evaluate individual studentmastery of core EESC knowledge. Special emphasis is placed on studentperformance with novel data sets. The comprehensive exam serves twoimportant functions. First, it provides valuable feedback to the EESCfaculty on teaching effectiveness across multiple dimensions of thecurriculum. Second, in providing students with an experience similarto what they might expect on the job, or in graduate school, it providesa unique opportunity for self-evaluation. The comprehensive exam isadministered early in the spring semester of a student’s senior year.Successful completion of the EESC Comprehensive Exam is requiredfrom all EESC majors.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Professor David H.

How have&quot;tradition&quot; and &quot;change&quot; fueled competing visions of Japan what itmeans to be &quot;Japanese&quot;? How does one go about reconciling theseconflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How havevariously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shiftingcircumstances?

We are an economicsdepartment that values diverse theoretical and methodologicalperspectives on economic analysis and its application. We are cognizantof the importance of the other social and natural sciences, the arts, andthe humanities to a more complete understanding of human society. Ourcurriculum introduces students to a core body of economic knowledgeand to research skills, integrating disciplinary education with the liberalarts mission of the university. Economics majors develop the ability tothink analytically and creatively about complex economic issues andpolicy choices facing our global society.</P><P>The content of our curriculum is tiered. In introductory courses studentslearn the basic principles of economics. In intermediate courses studentsdevelop their understanding of microeconomic, macroeconomic, andeconometric theory. The 200-level electives give students an opportunityearly in their careers to use introductory theory to better understand theirworld. The 400-level electives give students an opportunity to study indepth, a particular ﬁeld of economics through application of the requisitebasic skills, and appropriate theoretical models and empirical methods.These courses primarily focus on national and international concerns,public policies, and controversies in economic theory and policy.</P><P>Good economic writing represents good economic thinking. TheEconomics Department encourages students to cultivate the habitsof good economic writing by requiring students to take one electivecourse that satisﬁes the department's writing requirement. Studentsare expected to use the vocabulary and theories of economics to makecogent evidence-based arguments.</P><P>The Department of Economics supports students who globalize theireducation by completing some portion of their undergraduate educationabroad. We encourage students to visit the Off-Campus Study Ofﬁceto explore their options. If a student studies abroad then: (1) Only oneeconomics course can transfer in to satisfy major requirements. (2)That course must have economics prerequisites. If Economics 101 andEconomics 102 are prerequisites, then the course transfers in as a 200-level elective. If the prerequisite is Economics 301 or Economics 302,then it transfers in as a 400-level elective. (3) The course must be aneconomics course, not a business or similar course. (4) Economics 301,302, and 307 may not be taken abroad.</P><P>Graduates of the Department of Economics seeking immediateemployment have been successful in securing interesting andchallenging positions in business, government, and non-proﬁtenterprises. The economics curriculum also provides students with theopportunity to prepare themselves for graduate or professional studies ineconomics, business, public administration, international affairs, law andothers.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>We are an economics department that values diverse theoretical andmethodological perspectives on economic analysis and its application.We also believe the purpose of the economics curriculum is to educatestudents in the nature and uses of economic reasoning.

Develops the basic theories of macroeconomics andapplies them to topics of current interest. Explores issues such as: thecauses of inflation, unemployment, recessions and depressions; the roleof government ﬁscal and monetary policy in stabilizing the economy;the determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and short-runeffects of taxes, budget deﬁcits, and other government policies on thenational economy; and the workings of exchange rates and internationaltrade.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 102 - Introductory Microeconomics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand thatdetermine prices and the allocation of resources in markets for goodsand services, markets for labor and markets for natural resources. Thefocus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, andthe policy implications of both their successes and failures. The coursefocuses on developing the basic tools of microeconomic analysis andthen applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest suchas minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy,international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy and the role ofgovernment in a market economy.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ECON 101.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 149 - Introduction to Financial Accounting (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>A survey designed speciﬁcally for liberal arts students interested inBusiness, Economics, Law and Government.

We will be concerned with questions like:What is economic freedom? Are individual property rights absolute? Whatare the differences, in terms of questions of justice, among slave labor,wage labor, and the work of an independent or cooperative partner? Whatis a fair distribution of economic resources? Is economic justice fulﬁlledby: any distribution of income and wealth produced by market processes;an equal distribution of income and wealth; or a partially adjusted marketdistribution? The deﬁnitions of economic justice and fairness are perhapsthe most controversial questions in political economy, and this course isdesigned for you to gain some insight into the contending perspectivesthat economists have advocated. We will examine natural rights theories,the contested meaning of equality of opportunity, and the potential trade-off between economic efﬁciency and the redistribution of income andwealth. We will examine perspectives ranging from libertarian to socialist.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ECON 101 and ECON 102.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 202 - Economic Growth and Environmental Sustainability (4 CreditHours)</P><P>Economic growth is traditionally perceived as the solution to thesocio-economic ills of poverty, unemployment and more generallyunderdevelopment. However, economic growth is also accompaniedby increased pressure on and, over time, deterioration of the naturalenvironment. The objective of this course is to explore the relationshipbetween economic growth and the natural environment. While theconcept of economic growth occupies a central place in economic policy-making, we will discuss whether economic growth is compatible with thesustainable-development worldview adopted by the UN and many otherglobal and local economic actors. Sustainable development emphasizesthe need to embark upon a development path that not only takes intoaccount the environmental, social and economic needs of the presentgeneration, but also those of future ones.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ECON 101 and ECON 102.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 204 - Income Inequality (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>The substantive goal of this course is to facilitate an understanding ofchanges in the distribution of income in the United States, from 1945to the present. The ﬁrst part of the course studies the measurementand context of American income inequality. We will end the ﬁrst sectionof the course with an analysis of economic mobility in the US. Thesecond section of the course will look at a variety of explanations forincreasing income inequality. We will examine how the key themes oftechnical change, de-industrialization, immigration and globalizationshaped the American economy over the last several decades. The primaryfocus of the ﬁrst two sections will be upon income inequalities arisingfrom changes in the ideological, demographic, macroeconomic andinstitutional context. In addition, we will investigate the impact of thesetrends on the middle class and different segments of the labor force.Finally, we will discuss why inequality might matter and how the trendsdiscussed in the course could shape America’s future and discusswhether and what policy changes might be needed.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ECON 101 and ECON 102.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 205 - Gender and Globalization (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>The rapid integration of global markets that has taken place sincethe 1980s is the outcome of a common set of economic policiesimplemented in both developed and developing countries. This courseexamines the contradictory impacts of these policies on genderrelations and asks: what challenges do global economic trends posefor gender equality and equity in both developed and developingcountries? To answer this question, we begin with an introductionto alternative approaches to economics, focusing on the differencesbetween neoclassical and feminist economics, and history and economicdimension of globalization. This will be followed by an exploration ofthe impacts of economic development policy on gender relations in thecontext of a globalizing world economy. Special topics will include thehousehold as a unit of analysis; women’s unpaid labor; the genderedimpacts of economic restructuring and ﬁnancial crisis; the feminizationof the labor force in the formal and informal sectors of the globaleconomy; care penalty and the gendered impacts of COVID-19.

(4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the ﬁrst successful multi-national, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Severalcountries in many regions of the world (such as South America, theMiddle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the stepsof the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in thenear future. However, the ﬁnancial crisis of the late 2000s followed bythe sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception ofthe Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we willseek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broaderevolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socio-economic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of theEurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomicmodels which underlie the concept of ‘optimal currency area’ and aninvestigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completedproject. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutionsto the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone)will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and todiscuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives thatmember-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. thepursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranationalﬁscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political andeconomic devolution towards smaller scale European projects.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ECON 301.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 418 - Personal Finance (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course focuses upon the application of economic theory to majorissues faced by consumers in our modern economy.

The Educational Studies major is designed for students who wishto prepare for a career in education in elementary or secondary schools,or in the broader community. The curriculum introduces students tolearning theory and the social foundations of education, and it allowsfor experiential learning in diverse settings through course placementsand a required summer internship. This study ﬁts well into a broaderliberal arts education and allows time for students to complete a majorin an additional ﬁeld of study, for example, in an area of interest or thediscipline one intends to teach. The Educational Studies major doesnot lead directly to licensure; however, faculty in the Department ofEducation assist students in creating individually designed plans forobtaining licensure after graduation through a range of graduate andother programs.</P><P>Educational Studies students will have multiple opportunities tocommunicate original thinking through writing, to explore various genres,to address diverse audiences through course assignments, and todesign lesson plans. Students will learn how to develop a focused,well-supported essay. Also, they will acquire the skills to blend writtenlanguage with other modes to communicate a message, and how tonavigate various formatting guidelines informing the ﬁeld of education.During their senior year, students will reflect upon their intellectual workproduced in previous courses in the major through a capstone, ePortfolioproject. The project invites them to assess the themes, areas of growthand quality, and to witness their engagement in writing as a process.</P><P>Educational Studies students are encouraged to consider taking asemester off-campus. This option allows for comparative study ofeducation and often, extended apprenticeships in schools. EducationalStudies students have studied, for instance, in Chile, England, Denmark,Northern Ireland, Spain, New Zealand, South Africa, and The PhiladelphiaCenter.  In addition, students can take advantage of applying for ourcollaborative learning initiative with Turku University, Finland.  Pleasecontact an Educational Studies faculty member for more details.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>The mission of the Denison University Department of Education is toprovide a foundation for:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>1.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Thinking critically about teaching and learning in the context ofcontemporary society;</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>2.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Critical analysis of important educational issues in our society.  Thedepartment is committed to developing in students an appreciationof the power of learning to transform people and society, in the sensethat individuals have the potential for constant growth and in thesense that education can be a force toward improvement in the life ofthe community and society at large.</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>3.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Careers or service in education, for teaching and other leadershipin schools or working in non-school settings such as social work,counseling, nonproﬁt organizations, educational publishing,leadership development, and business-related teaching.</P></LBody></LI></L><P>We see ourselves acting in concert with the Denison University missionstatement that emphasizes autonomous thought, moral agency, andactive citizenship for all Denison students. Each student in the college,and therefore also in the Department of Education, is to become informedbroadly by the liberal arts, grounded in one or more chosen disciplines,and capable of thinking across disciplines.  The department’s focuson active learning and engagement in the liberal arts grows out of aprofound belief in the transformative power of education.</P><P>The program emphasizes the development of habits associated withpraxis, a concept in which reflection grows out of experience and isprelude and catalyst to action, particularly action that shares powerand challenges injustice.  Toward this end, we explore the strengths ofhuman diversity as represented in the various facets of our identities:ethnicity, race, culture, language, religion, socio-economic location,ability, sexuality, and gender identity. Our purpose is that our graduatescontinue to develop powers of analysis concerning both the individuallearner and the many institutions within which education takes place.  Our commitment is to thinking and acting ethically concerning socialequality, educational equity, justice, freedom of thought, peacemaking,and fair distribution of resources and opportunities.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor Emily Nemeth, Chair</P><P>Associate Professor Emily Nemeth;  Assistant Professor Andrew Frankel;Visiting Assistant Professor Alyssa Chrisman; Instructor Suzanne Baker.</P><H6>Academic Administrative Assistant</H6><P>Brenda Franks</P><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/educational-studies/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Educational Studies Major</H2><P>The Educational Studies major consists of nine courses:</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>PSYC 100</Div></TD><TD><Div>Introduction to Psychology</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 213</Div></TD><TD><Div>The U.S. Education System</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 249</Div></TD><TD><Div>The Learner and the Teacher: Childhood</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or EDUC 250</Div></TD><TD><Div>The Learner and the Teacher: Adolescence</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PSYC 200</Div></TD><TD><Div>Research Methods and Statistics</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or EDUC 290</Div></TD><TD><Div>Qualitative Inquiry</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 312</Div></TD><TD><Div>Literacy and Learning: Theory and Practice</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 390</Div></TD><TD><Div>Critical Pedagogies: Gender, Race and Class in U.S.Education</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 421</Div></TD><TD><Div>Senior Seminar (or two semesters of SeniorResearch)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>And two Education electives, one of which must be cross-listed withBlack Studies, Queer Studies, or Women's and Gender Studies.</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P>Please note these prerequisites:</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>PSYC 200</Div></TD><TD><Div>Research Methods and Statistics(Prerequisite PSYC 100)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 300</Div></TD><TD><Div>Philosophy of Education(Prerequisite EDUC 213)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 390</Div></TD><TD><Div>Critical Pedagogies: Gender,Race and Class in U.S. Education(Prerequisite EDUC 213)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 330</Div></TD><TD><Div>Gay and Lesbian Issues inEducation (Prerequisite EDUC 213or QS 101)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 360</Div></TD><TD><Div>History of African AmericanEducation (Prerequisite EDUC 213or BLST 235)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 367</Div></TD><TD><Div>Black America's Legal Struggle forEducational Equality (PrerequisiteEDUC 213 or BLST 235)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 312</Div></TD><TD><Div>Literacy and Learning: Theory andPractice (Prerequisite EDUC 249 orEDUC 250)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>EDUC 421</Div></TD><TD><Div>Senior Seminar (Prerequisite SeniorStanding)</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><P>Students should complete a course trajectory plan and interview withdepartment faculty before declaring the major; optimally this shouldoccur by the end of the sophomore year.

In the last thirty years, Englishliterary studies have changed in response to new theoretical and culturalmodels as well as greater attention to Anglophone international and non-canonical literature and genres. In our courses and major we approachthe study of language and literature as a dynamic, living, and livelypursuit, one that integrates political, social, philosophical, cultural, andaesthetic values. We have designed a program that meets a varietyof needs and enables students to pursue a variety of personal andprofessional goals, whether deﬁned by individual or collaborative intent,subject breadth or depth, instructional model, source engagement,writing development, or other pedagogical features. The faculty inEnglish participate actively in the General Education Program, the WritingProgram, Women's and Gender Studies, Black Studies, Queer Studies,International Studies, Environmental Studies, and service-learningopportunities.</P><P>All students may enjoy readings and lectures made possible by theendowed Harriet Ewens Beck Fund, which has brought such writersas Susan Orlean, Ted Kooser, Alice Walker, Bill Bryson, Maxine HongKingston, Adrienne Rich, Louise Erdrich, and Antonya Nelson for visits orresidencies each year. In addition, the Dr. Nan Nowik Writer-in-ResidenceEndowed Fund enables the department to host one high-proﬁle writerfor an extended residency during an academic year. The curriculumin English is also enhanced by a variety of opportunities for studentsto pursue publishing their works locally in a variety of student-editedjournals. ARTICULĀTE (a forum for cultural and literary criticism)and EXILE (a journal of creative writing) are among the publicationsassociated with students in English.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>The faculty of the English Department seeks to help students improvetheir abilities to read, write, and think critically and creatively. Throughthe study of literature and the instruction of writing in various forms,we endeavor to promote in our majors and minors both a deepunderstanding of our discipline and an active use of its practices. Asa faculty, we recognize and encourage among ourselves a variety ofpedagogical and critical approaches to literature and writing. Moreover,we feel that our students should experience and comprehend thesedifferent schools of theory and application. Thus, in the course of theirstudies in our department, students are exposed to the traditional canonof British and American literature as well as to noncanonical texts in theAnglophone tradition; asked to apply a variety of critical approaches fromtraditional close reading to recent postmodern methods of investigation;required to write with style and acumen; and motivated to examine,question, and challenge their own moment and situation in literary andcultural history.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor James Weaver, Chair</P><P>Professors David Baker, Peter Grandbois, Linda Krumholz, Diana Mafe,Fred Porcheddu-Engel, Sandra Runzo, Jack Shuler, Margot Singer, andAnn Townsend; Associate Professors Sylvia Brown, Regina Martin, andJames Weaver; Assistant Professors Michael Croley, Melissa Faliveno,and Yen Loh; Visiting Assistant Professors Paul Barickman, Jen Leonard,Michael Mayne, and Doug Swift</P><H6>Academic Administrative Assistant</H6><P>Anneliese Deimel Davis</P><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/english/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>English Major</H2><P>Students who major in English must choose an advisor in the EnglishDepartment to assist them in selecting and sequencing classes to meettheir academic and professional goals.

Both a major and a minor areavailable to students with an interest in the rigorous study of theseissues. The major requires students to develop a speciﬁc environmentalfocus as a concentration in addition to the environmental core anddistribution courses. The minor in ENVS allows students to integrate anenvironmental perspective with their major ﬁeld of study.<P/> <P/>As a holistic interdisciplinary area, Environmental Studies draws onwork in the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. Itendeavors to bridge these many intellectual approaches and perspectivesin the hope that students will gain a deeper understanding both of theenvironmental concerns facing the world and of proactive opportunitiesfor change. Among issues of concern and investigation are resourceutilization, the impact of technology on ecosystems, relationshipsbetween the environment and sociocultural systems, ecosystemmanagement, geographic analysis, sustainable design, environmentaleconomics and policy, conservation of biological diversity, naturewriting, alternative dispute resolution, political ecology, environmentalphotography, sustainable agriculture and environmental ethics, amongmany others.</Div><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><Div>Professor Abram Kaplan, Director</Div><H4>Environmental Studies Faculty</H4><Div>Abram Kaplan, Lucy McAllister, Douglas Spieles, Tom Henshaw(visiting), Ahmed Soliman (visiting)</Div><H4>Afﬁliated Faculty</H4><Div>Quentin Duroy (Economics), Jonathan Maskit (Philosophy), Shiri Noy(Anthropology and Sociology), Sarah Supp (Data Analytics), JamesWeaver (English)</Div><H4>Resource faculty</H4><Div>Annabel Edwards (Chemistry), David Goodwin (Geosciences), DavidGreene (Geosciences), Amanda Gunn (Communication), Rebecca Homan(Biology), Matt Jungers (Geosciences), Jordan Katz (Chemistry), RebeccaKennedy (Classics), Erik Klemetti (Geosciences), Andrew McCall (Biology),Trey Proctor (History), Joe Reczek (Chemistry), Jessica Rettig (Biology),Karl Sandin (Art History and Visual Culture), Geoff Smith (Biology), KeithSpencer (Studio Art), Catherine Stuer (Art History and Visual Culture),Andrea Ziegert (Economics)</Div><H6>Academic Administrative Assistant</H6><Div>Brenda Franks</Div><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/environmental-studies/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Environmental Studies Major</H2><P>The Environmental Studies Major requires eight courses plus a thematicconcentration (typically ﬁve courses) as part of a three-pronged program.</P><P>1.  Four required core courses:</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>ENVS 100</Div></TD><TD><Div>Integrated Environmental Studies</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>ENVS 200</Div></TD><TD><Div>Environmental Analysis</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>ENVS 301</Div></TD><TD><Div>Environmental Practicum</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>ENVS 401</Div></TD><TD><Div>Environmental Senior Project (orapproved senior experience *)</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div><Div>*Generally speaking, majors enroll in ENVS 401 to complete the seniorexperience requirement.

ENVS majorswith this concentration will achieve a solid grounding both in the criticalassessment and interpretation of mediated environments and in thecreative, imaginative making of such mediations.

Questions of justice arise both within societies andacross nations and cultures. Environmental injustice can take manydifferent forms in different countries, cultures and ecosystems. As aresult, environmentalism as a form of social action can also take manydifferent forms. Looking at environmental justice in a global frameworkinvolves studying the reasons for and consequences of such differences.</P><P>Students of global environmental justice study movements andprocesses that range in scale from the local to the global. In someinstances, environmental justice involves protecting the environmentfrom human-caused harm. In other instances, it involves disadvantagedpeople gaining and maintaining access to natural resources.</P><P>This ﬁeld also involves asking such basic questions as “What is justice?”and whether it is a universal concept or rather one that has differentmeanings and is shaped in different ways according to culture andhistory. Important too, is the question of to whom environmental justiceis owed—to fellow-citizens of a nation or community, to all humans, tofuture generations, and for that matter to animals or living organisms orperhaps nature as a whole?</P><P>In sum, this concentration involves an interdisciplinary investigationthat looks at all three terms in its title as ones that require carefulanalysis, and are often contested by both activists and scholars: “global,”“environmental” and “justice.”</P><P>Due to the infrequency with which many of the courses in thisconcentration are offered at Denison, students who pursue thisconcentration are especially encouraged to do so through an off-campus study program, and in many cases may be able to pursue thisconcentration only by including two OCS courses.

How is a ﬁsh ‘cultural?’ Why doAmericans spend so much time and money on their lawns? Should webe saving people or endangered species? Why are ecosystem servicesso hard to privatize? Is obesity truly just a question of consuming toomany calories? These are all questions that political ecology can helpus to answer. Political ecology is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld that situatesenvironmental change within broader networks of political, economic, andsocial relations. It differs from other environmental approaches in thatit views power, material nature, everyday struggles and practices, socialjustice, and discourse to be critical components of human-environmentinteractions. In this course, we will: (a) study the theoretical foundationsof political ecology, (b) evaluate some of the theses it puts forward,and (c) apply political ecology insights to contemporary environmentalissues.

It combines the theories of policy, thetools of problem solving, and the practice of dealing with environmentalchallenges in the real world of American government. The premise ofthe course is this: if you want to improve the state of the planet, youhave to propose a solution. To make a solution happen, you shouldunderstand the process of getting an idea through the decision-makingsystem. Effecting change requires a background in the system(s) thatmake things happen, whether you ultimately want to work within thesystem or outside it. This course is divided into two main components:an overview and implementation of problem solving techniques, and anin-depth examination of the U.S. Congress' role in environmental policyformation.

Yet we in the U.S. know very little about the foodsystem that sustains us – it is a mysterious and often invisible set ofprocesses, organizations, and people. This remarkably complex web ofinputs, labor, machinery, laws, subsidies, mergers, and so many othercomponents is one that we take largely for granted. This class seeksto align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. Acritical part of our existence that we experience through all of our sensesis one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we havethis occasion to use sight in a formalized way – photography – to tellnew stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding offood, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curatorialprocess of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly uniqueopportunity. Our immersion in these critical issues can bring full circle theunderstanding we gain through many eyes to enhance awareness in otherpeople about the ways in which our food system connects us all together.Course fulﬁlls the ENVS Humanities/Arts requirement.</P></Div><Div><P>ENVS 260 - Environmental Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course investigates the question of our ethical relations andresponsibility to objects and systems in the natural world, includinganimals, other living beings, non-living entities, ecosystems, and &quot;nature&quot;as a whole.

You will be askedto pay special attention to how social and economic power structuresinflect these representations: to envision and decode spatial imageryas a site of imagination, control and resistance. Artists and patrons inChina, Japan, and Korea have for centuries produced elaborate maps andlandscape imagery, photographs and ﬁlm to imagine the world in a varietyof ways. This course invites you to approach modern and contemporaryrepresentations of space in East Asia both in theoretically and historicallyinformed ways. In the ﬁrst part of the course, students build a frame ofreference for their analysis of post-war case studies, by reading core textsin spatial theory, and exploring important visual representations of spacefrom pre-modern East Asia.

The central goal of the department is to educate students aboutthe nature and history of the Earth, the processes that shape the Earth,and the impacts those processes have on human populations.</P><P>An understanding of the Earth is an important component of globalcitizenship. Many critical environmental issues face humanity, includingglobal climate change, water shortages, loss of arable land, naturalhazards such as earthquakes and flooding, and the availability ofpetroleum and other energy resources. Citizens and professionals withtraining in the geosciences will contribute to addressing these and otherproblems, while increasing opportunities for humans to live sustainablyon the Earth.</P><P>The department provides non-majors with a basic knowledge of theEarth and Earth processes that will serve their needs as future citizensand community leaders. Geoscience majors and minors develop astrong background in the geosciences in preparation for employmentopportunities in ﬁelds such as environmental science, geotechnicalengineering, exploration for natural resources, geologic research,environmental law, and earth science teaching.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P><P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in subsequent courses dealing with the culture and society.The department emphasizes the use of the target language in most of itscourses because it believes that students can best appreciate a culturefrom within its own mode of expression.</P><P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, politics and public affairs, global commerce, globalhealth, and English. Courses in cultural studies and literature, aside fromtheir intrinsic worth, also present multiple perspectives on other culturesand various areas of intellectual experience.</P><P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of thedepartment and the Center for Global Programs (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve command of thelanguage are provided by language tables, international ﬁlms, clubmeetings, and similar activities sponsored by the department. There arealso subsidized ﬁeld trips to museums and pertinent activities in citiesacross the country, and in some cases international travel.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor Hanada Al-Masri, Chair</P><P>Associate Professor Jason Busic, Associate Chair</P><P>Professor Gary L.

The Departmentof Modern Languages strongly recommends that students complete theirlanguage requirement by the end of their sophomore year.</P><H3>The Language Lab</H3><P>An important asset of the department is the Language Lab with its 27Macs, zone-free Blu-ray player and document camera. It also has a VIAConnect PRO which is a wireless collaboration and presentation solutionthat makes sharing and presenting easier with all computers in the room.The lab provides support for learning activities outside and inside theclassroom, ranging from grammar drills to research and collaborativewriting projects, as well as discussions of authenticated materialspublished on the Internet. The area is designed not only for individualizedinstruction but also for group work and small seminars that use a varietyof digital materials for class discussion.</P><H3>Cultural Enrichment</H3><P>Each semester the department offers students exceptional opportunitiesfor cultural enrichment in language study. These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.</P><H3>The Foresman Lounge</H3><P>Located in the central hub of the department, the lounge provides theDenison community with a space for a wide range of activities such asreceptions, classes, and informal gatherings.

Additional language study is strongly encouraged,and any additional language courses can apply toward the Global Focus–including introductory level courses in a third language relevant to thestudent's global focus region. If students are already native speakersof a language other than English, they must still fulﬁll the languagerequirement of the Global Commerce major by studying at least twosemesters of a language other than English.</P><H3>Global Focus</H3><P>The Global Commerce major seeks to integrate the study of commercewith a deep understanding of the cultures and societies of a geographicalregion beyond North America. Courses in the Global Focus are drawnfrom the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Majors choose one of thefollowing geographic areas as a Global Focus:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Africa/Middle East</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Asia</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Europe</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Latin America/Caribbean</P></LBody></LI></L><P>The Global Focus consists of six courses (see list of qualifying coursesavailable from the Global Commerce ofﬁce each semester), at least fourof which must address the particular region of study. Two of the coursescan be cognates that relate to global commerce and/or internationalissues generally but do not necessarily focus on the student’s selectedregion. Up to three of the Global Focus courses may be taken off-campus.Any exceptions must be approved by the Global Commerce Director inconsultation with the Global Commerce committee. Students will developa cohesive curricular plan for their Global Focus in the sophomoreseminar class, GC 200 - Global Focus Proposal for Global Commerce.</P><H4>Transregional Option</H4><P>The Global Focus component of the major also can be fulﬁlled througha “transregional option.” In this option, students focus on the flow andexchange of a variety of elements—such as information, goods, services,or labor—between two or more geographic regions. The proposal mustmake a clear case for the pursuit of the transregional option and for thecoherence of their six proposed Global Focus courses.

Additionally, we anticipate that many students willcomplete this requirement in a non-US location with a global healthemphasis in the experiential learning (e.g., study abroad programwith an experiential learning component that involves meaningfulengagement with community health in the location of study).

Students learn tosee the multiple layers of causes and effects, changes and continuities,individual experiences and broader social dynamics that shape humansocieties and cultures across time and place. History questions not only,what happened, but even more importantly, why did something happenthe way it did? How were different people engaged and impacted? Whatdid this change mean to people in that time and place? What has it meantto people in other times and places? What does it mean to us now, in ourown time and place?</P><P>History students weave answers to these questions into compellingstories and persuasive arguments. These narratives, when wellconstructed, are moving and beautiful. They prompt thinking aboutthe diversity of human experience, both across the globe and closeto home, and about how peoples’ ideas and cultural practices vary byperiod, region, and social circumstance. With classes focused on theUnited States, Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East,history provides students the opportunity to explore the world broadlyand deeply. Moreover, history allows us to see the world through the eyesof others as we confront human achievement, struggle, and failure andthus provides the tools for empathy, objective thought, and engagedcitizenship.</P><P>History majors graduate prepared to negotiate a complex, uncertain, andoften changing world landscape, equipped with unique abilities to discernand integrate multiple perspectives as they engage in creative problemsolving.</P><P>History students can...</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>1.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Think Historically<L><LI><Lbl><Div>a.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Examine people, events, phenomena, and concepts within theirhistorical contexts</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>b.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Recognize the complexity of the historical record, valuingconflicting evidence and competing narratives</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>c.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Understand causality and the dynamics of change over time</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>d.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Construct informed, nuanced historical narratives</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>e.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Articulate the distinctions between history and “the past,” andbetween history and historiography</P></LBody></LI></L></P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>2.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Think Critically<L><LI><Lbl><Div>a.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Analyze complex problems and generate discussion based onevidence</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>b.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Identify, summarize, and respond to the points of view of others</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>c.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Embrace skepticism and ambiguity as part of the process ofdiscovery</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>d.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Practice empathy as a tool of inquiry</P></LBody></LI></L></P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>3.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Solve Problems<L><LI><Lbl><Div>a.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Generate open-ended questions</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>b.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Conduct research—gather, sift, analyze, order, and synthesizeevidence</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>c.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Think imaginatively about gaps in the evidentiary record</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>d.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Persevere through uncertainty</P></LBody></LI></L></P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>4.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Communicate Effectively<L><LI><Lbl><Div>a.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Write clearly, concisely, and persuasively, in multiple formats andfor various audiences</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>b.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Speak clearly and persuasively in different forums and for variousaudiences</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>c.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Listen to, absorb, appreciate, and respond to the ideas of others,both in written and oral form</P></LBody></LI></L></P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>5.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Think Globally and Locally<L><LI><Lbl><Div>a.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Understand the diversity of human experience across time andspace and draw connections between their studies of differentpeople, times, and places</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>b.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Consider historical problems from the perspectives of differentgroups and different social actors</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>c.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Think critically about how different groups and/or societies haveinteracted over time</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>d.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Critically examine the relationships of power and explorequestions of justice, equity, and identity</P></LBody></LI></L></P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>6.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Practice Engaged Citizenship<L><LI><Lbl><Div>a.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Value the study of the past for its contributions to lifelonglearning and for the critical habits of mind it fosters</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>b.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Engage the perspectives of people different from ourselves in civiland constructive ways</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>c.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Employ all of the above-listed skills to make well informed andthoughtfully articulated contributions to civic discourse</P></LBody></LI></L></P></LBody></LI></L><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor Joanna Tague, Chair</P><P>Professors Adam J.

We will pay particularattention to how struggles for racial and gender equality have influenceddebates over the amendment, and how the amendment has reshaped theparameters of U.S. citizenship.</P><P>Crosslisting: BLST 332.</P></Div><Div><P>HIST 393 - Race &amp; Sports in U.S. History (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Sport in the United States is far more than a source of leisure,entertainment, or ﬁtness. Rather, sport – particularly when played ona college or professional level – has become an institution that, inbecoming embedded in our culture, both reflects and shapes our society.Through readings, class discussions, and the writing of a 15-20 pageresearch paper based on the analysis of historical documents andscholarship, this course will explore the intersection of race and sportin U.S. history. While college and professional sports have often beenviewed as vehicles for obtaining equality and upward mobility, sportshave also reflected and perpetuated inequality in American society. Wewill interrogate the construction and signiﬁcance of race in Americansports, including its intersections with class, gender, sexuality, andethnicity. Paying special attention to the experiences of athletes ofcolor in a variety of sports, we will explore the ways that they navigatedthe world of sports and thought about and utilized their positions toadvocate for social change. We will also use sport as a space to thinkabout concepts of identity, community, and nationalism.</P></Div><Div><P>HIST 395 - Dancing in the Street: African-American Urban History (4Credit Hours)</P><P>This course covers largely the same material as HIST 295 (please seedescription above), but with time for students to complete a signiﬁcantresearch project.

International Studies majors are alsoasked to move beyond traditional Area Studies approaches, in that themajor problematizes seeing areas as bounded and distinctive historicaland cultural zones, and instead stresses the ways in which regionsare, and historically have been, tied together in complex patterns andprocesses.</P><P>International Studies is inherently interdisciplinary. While it borrowsfrom and employs theoretical tools and concepts from a wide range ofdisciplines in the humanities, social sciences and arts, it stresses theneed to use these tools and methods in ways that work together and thatproblematize the limitations of any single disciplinary approach. Thisinterdisciplinary emphasis encourages students to view the processesthat tie together and divide the world from multiple perspectives. In doingso, the majors in International Studies synthesize study of global forceswith real-world experience of how these forces shape, and are shapedby, the peoples living in their unique sociocultural and political-economicsituations.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Committee</H2><Div>Sangeet Kumar, Director</Div><Div><P>Hanada Al-Masri (Modern Languages), Gary Baker (International Studies,Modern Languages), Sharon Chuang (Communication), Chris Crews(International Studies), Katy Crossley-Frolick (Political Science, Off-Campus Study), John Davis (Anthropology and Sociology), QuentinDuroy (Economics), Fareeda Grifﬁth (Anthropology and Sociology),Alina Haliliuc (Communication), Leslie Hempson (History), ZarrinaJuraqulova (Economics), Fadhel Kaboub (Economics), Sangeet Kumar(Communication, International Studies), Veerendra Lele (Anthropologyand Sociology), Francisco Lopez-Martin (Modern Languages), DianaMafe (English), Isis Nusair (International Studies, Women’s and GenderStudies), Anne Sokolsky (English, East Asian Studies), Catherine Stuer(Art History and Visual Culture), Taku Suzuki (International Studies),Joanna Tague (History), Adrian Young (History), Hoda Yousef (History)</P><H6>Academic Administrative Assistant</H6><P>Meagan Tehua</P></Div><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/international-studies/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>International Studies Major</H2><P>Students who major in International Studies must take the followingcourses:</P><L><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>INTL 100 - Introduction to International Studies: The Making of theModern World (the introductory course to the major, taken by the endof sophomore year)</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>INTL 200 - Themes and Approaches in International Studies (requiredfor sophomore International Studies majors)</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>INTL 201 - Major Proposal for International Studies (1-credit proposalwriting course, taken Spring semester sophomore year)</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>INTL 400 - Senior Capstone Seminar (offered in the Fall semester forInternational Studies seniors),</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Two INTL 250 electives “Global and Local Flows andFrictions” (several elective courses offered each semester),</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Four courses organized into a thematic concentration (“concentrationcourses”),</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Two semesters of non-English language study beyond the DenisonGE requirement</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>•</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Relevant off-campus study (OCS) experience.</P></LBody></LI></L><L><LI><Lbl><Div>1.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>Majors must take INTL 100 - Introduction to International Studies:The Making of the Modern World, INTL 200 - Themes and Approachesin International Studies, and INTL 201 - Major Proposal forInternational Studies by the end of the sophomore year.</P></LBody></LI><LI><Lbl><Div>2.</Div></Lbl><LBody><P>In the INTL 201 - Major Proposal for International Studiescourse students will propose four courses they will use as their&quot;concentration courses&quot; to fulﬁll their speciﬁc concentration areawithin International Studies.

The course also provides opportunities forstudents to examine various world problems through an interdisciplinarylens, drawing on both political-economic and sociocultural analyticalframeworks in various disciplines. Finally, students learn the basics ofacademic research and writing processes, i.e., formulating a well-deﬁnedtopic, posing a relevant research question, ﬁnding and interrogatingappropriate sources, justifying the research’s intellectual contributionto a broader scholarly audience and, when applicable, to the efforts tosolve real-world problems, through writing and revising a carefully craftedprose. Among numerous debates and issues that International Studiesscholars grapple with, the course focuses on four broadly conceivedthemes: economic development, nationalism and national identity,transnational migration, and mediated and material culture. After learningmajor scholarly approaches to theorize each of these themes, studentseach develop an individual research project and write a scholarly paper,complete with abstract, introduction, literature review, case study, andconclusion. At the end of the course, students are expected to be ableto formulate, broaden, and contextualize their thematic and regionalfocus within the interdisciplinary scheme of International Studies, and beequipped with skills to conduct academic research.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): INTL 100.</P></Div><Div><P>INTL 201 - Major Proposal for International Studies (1 Credit Hour)</P><P>The required mid-level course is for all International Studies majors.The goals of this one-credit course are to create a vibrant intellectualcommunity of students, in which they collaboratively formulate individualinterests in the ﬁeld of International Studies through discussion andpeer-reviews in class, and consultation with the course coordinator(International Studies Program Director) and faculty advisor assignedby the coordinator. Through these processes, the students are expectedto not only develop strong camaraderie among them as the new INTLmajors, but also formulate comprehensive plans for how they will pursuetheir interests in International Studies during their ﬁnal two years atDenison. This involves charting out their courses in International Studiesfor the next two years-including coursework from off-campus studyprograms that they wish to count towards the International Studiesmajor. By the end of the course, students submit the major proposal, inwhich they synthesize coursework, off-campus study (or an internship),and language training in a way that allows them to develop a coherentarea of expertise within International Studies, and they will share theirgoals and plans with their cohort and a wider International Studiescommunity.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P><P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of this opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P><P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, politics and public affaire, global commerce, globalhealth, and English. Courses in cultural studies and literature, aside fromtheir intrinsic worth, also present multiple perspectives on other culturesand areas of intellectual experience.</P><P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of thedepartment and the Center for Global Programs (see Off-CampusPrograms).

Completion of all four Lugar Program courses is required beforebeginning the congressional internship. Students may intern in anycongressional ofﬁce during the summer following either their sophomoreor junior year. The Lugar Program will endeavor to place interns in theofﬁce of a member of the House or Senate. Alternatively, students mayopt to participate in an approved off-campus program and intern for anentire semester under the auspices of their Washington program.</P><P>The Lugar Program will only sponsor students for congressionalinternships who have a record unblemished by serious disciplinary oracademic infractions as reported by the Ofﬁce of Student Life and theProvost's Ofﬁce.</P><P>Track Two has been designed for students with an interest ininternational affairs and foreign policy, especially with an aptitude forthe study of foreign languages and a desire to pursue a career in suchﬁelds as national security, homeland defense, weapons proliferationand foreign affairs. In particular, Track Two provides a foundation forgraduate study at the Graduate School of International Policy Studiesat the Monterey Institute in California, or at similar graduate programsthat also require extensive language training. To complete the TrackTwo program at Denison, students must take two years (four semesters)of coursework in a foreign language. Although French, German, andSpanish are acceptable, students interested in the Monterey option areencouraged to study Arabic, Chinese or Japanese. Some courseworkin a language could be undertaken at Monterey or another institution,most likely during the summer. Students must take four courses selectedfrom the Political Science Department offerings in the subﬁelds ofComparative Politics or International Politics. The minimum grade in eachof these courses and in every semester of foreign language instruction isa C.

Thus, neuroscience is founded on the tenet thatan understanding of the brain and nervous system is only possible whenapproached from an interdisciplinary perspective.</P><P>The Neuroscience Concentration at Denison is designed to offer studentsan interdisciplinary perspective on the nervous system and behaviorvia courses in Biology, Computer Science or Data Analytics, Philosophy,and Psychology. This design is rooted in the liberal arts, providing astudy with breadth and depth of study as students build connectionsacross courses. The courses are intended to complement, and potentiallyoverlap with, the student’s major and general education requirements.Through these courses, many of which have labs, students will studentscultivate their understanding of the scientiﬁc method, as well as variousresearch designs and the corresponding data-analysis techniques.They will also be introduced to different ways of thinking about andconceptualizing problems through courses in philosophy and eithercomputer science or data analytics. As they continue through advancedcourse work in biology and psychology, students will develop depth inthe concentration by learning more detailed and advanced topics. Theywill also reﬁne their “hands on” laboratory skills, including experimentaldesign, data collection, analysis and scientiﬁc writing. Finally, thestudents participate in a senior seminar in neuroscience in which theydive deeply into recent neuroscience literature, applying knowledge fromother courses to current questions in the ﬁeld, and practicing their skillsin verbal and written communication.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Nestor Matthews (Psychology), Neuroscience Program Director</P><P>Faculty: Seth Chin-Parker (Psychology), Barbara Fultner (Philosophy),Jessen Havill (Computer Science), Susan Kennedy (Psychology), EricLiebl (Biology), Nestor Matthews (Psychology), Heather Rhodes (Biology)</P><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/neuroscience/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Neuroscience Concentration</H2><P>Neuroscience Concentration requires students to complete the ten 4-credit courses listed below, and the zero-credit NEUR 401 - NeuroscienceAssessment.</P><H3>Four Foundational Courses</H3><P>May be taken in any order, beginning as early as the ﬁrst semester atDenison. Foundational courses in Biology and Psychology serve asprerequisites for the 200 and 300-level Biology and Psychology coursesrequired of Neuroscience concentrators.</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>BIOL 210</Div></TD><TD><Div>Molecular Biology and Unicellular Life</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>CS 111</Div></TD><TD><Div>Discovering Computer Science: Scientiﬁc Data andDynamics</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or DA 101</Div></TD><TD><Div>Introduction to Data Analytics</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or CS 109</Div></TD><TD><Div>Discovering Computer Science</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or CS 110</Div></TD><TD><Div>Discovering Computer Science: Digital Media andGames</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or CS 112</Div></TD><TD><Div>Discovering Computer Science: Markets, Polls, andSocial Networks</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PHIL 210</Div></TD><TD><Div>Philosophy of Science</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or PHIL 280</Div></TD><TD><Div>Philosophy of Mind</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PSYC 100</Div></TD><TD><Div>Introduction to Psychology</Div></TD></TR></TBody></Table><H3>Two Intermediate Courses in Biology and Psychology</H3><P>These courses have prerequisites and are, in turn, prerequisites for theadvanced courses.</P><P>BIOL 220 - Multicellular Life (Prerequisite for BIOL 334 and BIOL 349)</P><P>PSYC 200 - Research Methods and Statistics (Prerequisite for PSYC 351and prerequisite for any of the following: PSYC 311, PSYC 331, PSYC 341)</P><H3>Three Advanced Courses in Biology and Psychology</H3><P>These courses may be taken in any order, except that PSYC 350 -and PSYC 351 - Research in Biological Psychology must be takenconcurrently.</P><Table><THead><TR><TH><Div>Code</Div></TH><TH><Div>Title</Div></TH></TR></THead><TBody><TR><TD><Div>Biology:</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>BIOL 349</Div></TD><TD><Div>Neurophysiology</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>or BIOL 334</Div></TD><TD><Div>Comparative Physiology: Human and non-humananimals</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>Psychology:</Div></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PSYC 350</Div></TD><TD><Div/></TD></TR><TR><TD><Div>PSYC 351</Div></TD><TD><Div>Research in Biological Psychology (In place ofPSYC 351, students may take one of the followingcourse pairings: PSYC 310 &amp; PSYC 311, PSYC330 &amp; PSYC 331, PSYC 340 &amp; PSYC 341.

Every effort is made to makeDenison Seminars, Denison Short-Term Seminars, and other faculty-ledtravel seminar opportunities affordable for every student.</P><P>Students can pursue many other opportunities for off-campus learning,in the U.

Failure to complete the academic aspects of the program willresult in a grade of “TF” for the course listed on the Denison academicrecord for the term abroad. There are no refunds if students fail coursesand/or fail to fulﬁll all academic aspects of the program.</P><P>Students are enrolled for a holding place registration of 12 credits foreach term of off-campus study in order to report full-time study to theFederal Clearinghouse to facilitate the portability of ﬁnancial aid and/or to use 529 college funds. Students are, therefore, required to enrollfor at least 12 transferable U.S. semester credits for each semester ofoff-campus study, but may choose to enroll for up to 18 U.S. semestercredits per semester. Additional charges may be assessed for eachregistered hour in excess of 18 hours [see above]. Students shouldconsider these costs at the time they apply to the program and consultthe Denison Catalog and the Ofﬁce of the Registrar for advice and furtherdetails. A student may request twice during their Denison career to takeup to 20 hours and request to waive the excess credit hours fee. Feesfor any hours that are not waived will remain on the student’s account.Students are limited to one course on an S/U grade base per semester.The arrangements for such a choice must be made with the programprovider at the time of ﬁnal registration. Students should notify theRegistrar's Ofﬁce of the arrangement as part of the pre-approval processfor courses.</P><P>To receive transfer credit for an off-campus study experience, studentsmust work with the Registrar’s Ofﬁce and academic advisors to obtainpre-approval for their courses. Students should submit course pre-approvals to the Registrar's Ofﬁce during the semester prior to theirprogram according to the instructions in Global Tools. The University isunder no obligation to transfer coursework or apply transferred courseworktoward speciﬁc degree requirements unless that coursework has beenapproved in advance.</P><P>Students wishing to apply a course toward a GE, major, minor, orconcentration requirements must receive approval directly from therelevant department/program.  Other coursework for transfer credit willbe evaluated through the combined efforts of the Registrar, the Center forGlobal Programs, and, as necessary, speciﬁc departments/programs.</P><P>All courses reported on the program provider’s transcript are postedto the Denison academic record with course titles, credits, and grades.This includes any course for which a student receives a failing grade,even though credit will not be awarded. While the grades for off-campusstudy coursework are not factored into the Denison cumulative gradepoint average, it is important to note that they could be factored intoa composite grade point average should a student pursue graduate orprofessional school after graduating from Denison.</P><H2>Review of Disciplinary Records</H2><P>Recognizing the role of students as ambassadors of Denison, thespecial privilege of participating in off-campus programs, and the levelof maturity required for students to be successful negotiating thechallenges and potential risks associated with study away, the Center forGlobal Programs [CfGP] routinely consults with the Ofﬁce of CommunityValues and Student Conduct [OCVSC] to assess students’ disciplinaryhistory as part of the approval process for off-campus study. Frequency,severity, community impact of violations, and student’s disciplinarystatus (e.g., Disciplinary Probation) are the variables that may impacteligibility. </P><P>Students on disciplinary probation or suspension are not eligible toparticipate in off-campus study during the semester of probation orsuspension. Students with incomplete sanctions prior to departure ontheir off-campus study program should consult with OCVSC and CfGPabout the incomplete sanctions and possible impact[s] on eligibility foroff-campus study.</P><P>Violations that occur after a student has been approved for study abroad,but before their departure for off-campus study may also influence astudent’s eligibility to participate. Denison reserves the right to withholdor rescind approval for any student based on their disciplinary historyor violations, regardless of the number of incidents on the student’srecord. If a student’s disciplinary status changes after approval, it is theirresponsibility to notify the CfGP as well as the program provider.  </P><P>The program provider may request information from the student abouttheir disciplinary record as part of the admission process. Any studentconcerns about how disciplinary history may affect eligibility for studyaway should be conveyed as soon as possible to staff in the Center forGlobal Programs.  </P><Div>While participating in off-campus study, students are under thejurisdiction of the local laws, the policies of their program, and Denison’sCode of Student Conduct. If an incident should arise during a program,that information may be shared with the Division of Student Life andOCVSC and result in a response under the Code of Student Conduct,including possible disciplinary sanctions and the revocation of youreligibility to participate in the program with the requirement to depart.</Div><Div><H2>Housing for Off-Campus Study</H2><P>Denison carefully selects approved programs that offer student housingthat balances the needs for student safety, immersion, and convenience.Because of the importance of residential living to the off-campus studyprogram, Denison may further designate speciﬁc housing options withinan approved program which our students may/may not select. Studentsare not allowed to opt out of program-provided housing, even when theprogram provider would otherwise allow students to live independently.</P></Div><H2>Health Advisories, Travel Advisories, andTravel Warnings</H2><P>All students studying off-campus are required to download theAlertTraveler app in Global Tools. The Center for Global Programsstaff will instruct students in downloading and use of the app. All U.S.passport holders are further required to register with the Departmentof State's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) at <Link Alt="">https://step.state.gov/</Link></P><P>Denison strongly recommends that all students avail themselves ofthe travel information available at the U.S. State Department (DoS)(<Link Alt="">http://travel.state.gov/</Link>), Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (<Link Alt="">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/</Link>), and World Health Organization (WHO) (<Link Alt="">http://www.who.int/en/</Link>) web sites.  In particular, students should carefullyconsider the safety information included in State Department traveladvisories for the country(ies) in which they are pursuing off-campusstudy and/or for any other country to which they are planning to travelduring their time abroad.</P><P>The Center for Global Programs routinely reviews CDC, DoS, and WHOtravel advisories, as well as safety and risk updates from our programpartners around the world. Denison generally does not permit studyabroad in countries with elevated travel advisories. Denison reservesthe right to withdraw its approval for study on an off-campus programat any point due to elevated travel advisories from any/all of theaforementioned agencies, and/or advice from our program partners,and/or general risk concerns.  Withdrawal of approval for an off-campusstudy program bars a student from receiving Denison credit for theprogram and from applying ﬁnancial aid to the program costs. Pleasesee the Global Tools website for the most up-to-date policies regardinginternational travel.</P><P>In the case of an elevated U.S. State Department travel warning, or aCDC or WHO travel advisory issued before or after a program has started,Denison will work closely with the educational partner/program providerand other informed parties to determine an appropriate course of action.In the case of requiring that a student return home, Denison will pursuereasonable steps with the program provider to mitigate the ﬁnancial andacademic impact of such an action.</P><P>It is not possible for Denison to predict world events or assure that astudy abroad experience is entirely risk-free. Rarely, but occasionally inthe past, emergencies (dangerous conflicts, natural disasters, COVID-19pandemic etc.) have resulted in alteration or cancellation of an off-campus study program for which a student has been approved. It is thestudent’s responsibility to be aware of all program policies regardingsuspension/cancellation and implications for their academic program.</P></Div><P><Span/></P><H2>Center for Global Programs Staff</H2><P>Katy A.

This multi-week, immersive summer sessionfocuses on the application of those skills and deepens their knowledgeabout how organizations are structured and function and how individualsinteract in those settings. The session includes workshops and seminarsfocused on developing practical understanding of organizationalbehavior, culture, and management as well as providing students withinsights and opportunities to hone their personal communication skillsand workplace leadership style. During the session, students travel tomajor U.S. cities (e.g., Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Columbus)to learn ﬁrst-hand the nature of these operations in a wide range oforganizations across various industries (e.g., sales &amp; marketing, humanresources, ﬁnance, nonproﬁt, technology, sports, retail, healthcare, andmanufacturing). Working primarily with Denison alumni, students areintroduced to the language and fundamental principles of organizationaldevelopment, company culture, decision-making, project management,design thinking, marketing, entrepreneurship, and more. Equipped withthis knowledge, students serve as consultants for local companies,taking on the tasks of researching and analyzing problems, formulatingsolutions, and presenting ﬁndings to clients. These applied experiences,together with the program’s coursework, are designed to help studentsbuild a foundation for understanding the value of a liberal arts educationfor organizations and their leadership.</P><H3>Internship and Integrative Paper</H3><P>All students seeking certiﬁcation in Organizational Studies mustcomplete an appropriate internship.  The internship should take placefollowing the summer session. The internship will become the venuewhere coursework and  lessons from the summer session are broughtinto play to master practical skills and build knowledge beyond theregular curriculum.</P><P>In the senior year, OS students will prepare a major, integrative paperincorporating the knowledge base and skills developed through thesigniﬁcant OS certiﬁcation experiences (i.e., coursework, summersession, and internship) and reflecting on the value of a liberal artseducation to understanding organizations.</P></Div><P/><H1>Philosophy</H1><Div><H2 id="LinkTarget_12569">Departmental Guidelines &amp; MissionStatement</H2><P>Philosophy asks some of the most fundamental questions abouthuman existence. Philosophical inquiry leads students to recognize thepotentially unnoticed assumptions that underpin even our most ordinaryways of interacting with other persons and engaging in human projects.Such assumptions concern, for example, the nature of human knowledge,action, and value. Philosophy challenges students to move beyonduncritical patterns of thought, to recognize problems, and to exchange amore naive worldview for a more considered and justiﬁable one. In doingso, students learn to think in ways that are simultaneously disciplinedand imaginative. Philosophy Department faculty members cooperativelyapproach these concerns from diverse perspectives, both in studying theworks of major philosophers and in their own creative activity. Studentsare encouraged to join with the faculty in this inquiry and to philosophizecreatively on their own. The courses and seminars in the Department areintended to develop the abilities necessary for these activities.</P><P>Students without previous experience with philosophy will usuallyenroll in <Link Alt="">PHIL 101</Link> - Introduction to Philosophy, <Link Alt="">PHIL 121</Link> - Ethics:Philosophical Considerations of Morality or <Link Alt="">PHIL 126</Link> - Social andPolitical Philosophy. Students who wish to continue in Philosophy andperhaps to major or minor in it will often take <Link Alt="">PHIL 231</Link> - Greek andMedieval Philosophy or <Link Alt="">PHIL 232</Link> - Modern Philosophy as their secondcourse. These are required courses for the major and prerequisites forsome of our upper-level courses. However, there are many ways to movethrough our curriculum depending on a student's particular interests anddepartmental offerings in any given semester.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>The Philosophy Department at Denison University sees our goals forstudent learning as three-fold. First, and perhaps most crucially in termsof the mission of the college, we understand ourselves as attemptingto help students develop the sort of critical/self-critical perspectivedescribed earlier, teaching them to take nothing for granted and to raisequestions about all claims to obviousness, truth, and authority – not,it’s important to say, because we don’t think truth exists, but becausewe think if it does exist the search for it must be undertaken rigorouslyand in a way that refuses to be short-circuited by premature claims ofsuccess. Second, we want to teach them to do philosophy: to think aboutsome of the central (and arguably perennial) questions that philosophersexamine, questions that should be live and signiﬁcant ones for anyreflective person, and to develop the skills of philosophical argumentation(and the meta-skills of thinking about the value of those skills, and ofthat argumentation, themselves) that seem crucial to understandingand answering those questions. And thirdly, we want our students —especially our majors and minors, but even introductory students as well– to have the opportunity to learn about some of the key thinkers andtexts in the history of philosophy, precisely because the questions thosethinkers and texts consider are indeed live and signiﬁcant ones for allreflective people, but also because what’s said about those questions bythose thinkers and texts deserve our careful scrutiny, and because ourown situation today – both intellectually and also concretely – is in manyways the product of those questions and those answers.</P><P>We have other goals, too, which cannot be easily separated from themain ones listed above. In order to develop the skills of critical andphilosophical thinking and the understanding of great philosophicalideas, our students must be able to read important but also often difﬁculttexts, many written in a style (and in a context) that’s unfamiliar to them,and we see teaching students to read, carefully and critically, againwithout accepting what’s written as true but rather in a questioning spirit,as a very important part of our task. And to be a critical thinker – and apractitioner of philosophy as well – without being able to write, correctlyand thoughtfully and persuasively, is impossible; all of our coursesinvolve writing and we take instruction about writing – in particular thesort of persuasive writing in which arguments for a thesis are presentedand counter-arguments against it are considered and answered — to becentral to what we do in the department, both at the lower- and the upper-levels.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><Div>Associate Professor Sam Cowling, Chair</Div><Div>Professor Barbara Fultner; Associate Professors Jonathan Maskit, JohnMcHugh, Mark Moller (Dean of Transfer Students); Assistant ProfessorsZachary Joachim, Lindsey Schwartz; Visiting Assistant Professors SeanDriscoll, Justin Mooney</Div><H6>Academic Administrative Assistant</H6><Div>Chris Lyons</Div><P><Link Alt="">View faculty proﬁles and contact information</Link> (<Link Alt="">https://denison.edu/academics/philosophy/contacts/</Link>)</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Philosophy Major</H2><P>A major in Philosophy requires ten courses selected in consultation withthe major advisor.

For thisreason we attempt to tailor a student's minor program in Philosophyaround the speciﬁc course of studies being pursued in the selected majorsubject. This means that our minor program places a premium upondepartmental advising.</P><P>Each Philosophy minor is required to choose a department memberas a Philosophy advisor. The Philosophy advisor will not replace thestudent's primary academic advisor. However, the Philosophy advisorwill have responsibility for guiding the student in designing the minorprogram in Philosophy. A minor in Philosophy requires ﬁve courses inthe department.

Students develop skills inrigorous thinking and engage in the process of philosophizing.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 121 - Ethics: Philosophical Considerations of Morality (4 CreditHours)</P><P>This course explores the fundamental questions of ethical theory, askinghow ethical judgments can be made, what justiﬁcations they may receive,whether terms like &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; have ﬁxed meanings, whethermoral assertions can claim universal validity or whether morality israther relative to a culture or to an individual's beliefs. Depending on thesemester, issues of applied ethics - having to do with abortion, medicalethics, business and professional ethics, ethics and the environment, warand peace, etc. - will be raised as well.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 126 - Social and Political Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is about justice, power, and freedom, as ideals and asrealities, and about whether objective or rational justiﬁcations of politicaland social views and actions are practical or even possible. The courseincludes an exploration of some fundamental philosophical questionsregarding the nature of the community, the state, the individual, and therelationships among them.

We will beginby considering the nature and signiﬁcance of arguments in everyday lifeas well as the cognitive psychology of human reasoning. We will thenexamine the fundamental features of arguments with a particular focuson the techniques of formal epistemology, decision theory, and deductivelogic. Throughout this course, students will acquire a facility with logicalmethods, investigate the foundations of quantitative reasoning, applygeneral logical principles to speciﬁc cases, and examine the limitationsand advantages of logical and formal methods by exploring theoreticalpuzzles and paradoxes.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 210 - Philosophy of Science (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course considers a range of conceptual issues connected withthe understanding and practice of science. Issues to be consideredinclude explanation, theoretical reduction, rationality, methodology andthe possibility of scientiﬁc progress, etc. Although these questions areraised from the perspective of philosophy, they are intended to provideinsight into the actual practice of the sciences - from both contemporaryand historical perspectives. This course should prove especially helpfulto science majors seeking to achieve a different perspective on thescientiﬁc enterprise; however, non-science majors are equally welcome.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, or Science Major withJunior or Senior standing, or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 231 - Greek and Medieval Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An examination of some fundamental problems in Metaphysics (whatthere is) and Epistemology (how we come to know), in the context ofthe origin and development of Greek thinking from the pre-Socratics,Sophists and Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, through selected writers inthe Medieval period including Plotinus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, DunsScotus, William of Ockham, and Nicholas Cusanus.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, or one Classicscourse, or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 232 - Modern Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Thinkers such as Rene Descartes, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant arecurrently referred to so often, in so many different contexts, that theirnames have been transformed into immediately recognizable adjectives(Cartesian, Humean, Kantian). But what did these philosophers actuallybelieve? And why did they believe it? This course is an intermediate-levelsurvey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the “EarlyModern” or “Modern” era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). Whilethese and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley)in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostlyon their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophyof mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) toappreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical;b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation formuch of the modern—western, anyway—worldview; and c) to determine ifwhat they say is either true or false.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 250 - Philosophy of Law (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Does law have an intrinsic connection with the moral order, or is itwhatever a legislature or judge says it is? This course will analyze theconcept of law, with particular attention given to the conflict betweenthe natural law tradition and legal positivism. The justiﬁcation of legalauthority and the nature of legal reasoning will be considered. Normativeissues, including the relation between law and concepts of justice,equality, liberty, responsibility, and punishment will also be addressed.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 260 - Environmental Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course investigates the question of our ethical relations andresponsibility to objects and systems in the natural world, includinganimals, other living beings, non-living entities, ecosystems, and &quot;nature&quot;as a whole. It also asks about nature as such: what nature is, what theplace in it is of humans, the role of human action in transforming nature,etc. The question of the relation of the natural to the social will receivespecial attention.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, EnvironmentalStudies major/minor, or consent.</P><P>Crosslisting: ENVS 260.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 269 - Philosophy of the Arts: Aesthetics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course addresses issues in philosophical aesthetics both inrelationship to the arts as well as to other domains of human life (e.g.,nature, food, and design). We will ask what makes something an artwork;how to differentiate between artworks and non-artworks; how to evaluateartworks; what it means to judge something aesthetically; how aestheticjudgment differs for different kinds of objects; and other central issuesfrom the ﬁeld.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, ART, AHVC, DANC,CINE, MUS or THTR Major, or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 272 - Ethics of Data and Information (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is a problem-driven, technically informed engagement withthe ethics of data and information as well as an investigation of the moraldimensions of collecting, analyzing, and protecting data. It aims to equipstudents with the ethical frameworks and philosophical tools necessaryto effectively engage with the urgent questions posed by data-driventechnology in its various forms. Students will hone their understandingof the ethics of surveillance, scientiﬁc research, algorithmic bias, andpolicy decision-making. We will also investigate how familiar moralnotions like privacy, property, fairness, and equality are challenged orilluminated by computational tools and the advent of novel possibilitiesfor data collection and analysis. Projects in the course will seek to putinto practice the ethical principles and moral theories in hopes of tacklingdata-driven decisions prudently and permissibly.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 275 - Philosophy of Feminism (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Feminism and philosophy both make the invisible visible, the implicitexplicit. Both make us aware of assumptions we make in our everydaylives and challenge us to justify them. This course examines ways inwhich feminist theory enriches philosophy and vice versa. Feministcriticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophicalassumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the worldand other people. How does feminism destabilize philosophy and affectphilosophical conceptions of knowledge, reality, metaphysics, agency,or morality? How does philosophy enrich feminist understandings ofoppression, privilege, or equality? We will consider a range of formsof oppression and privilege, particularly as they affect women, andconceptions of sex, gender, and race in the context of debates aboutgender violence, work and family, as well as feminist discussions ofepistemology, ethics, and science.

Philosophicalthought about technology suggests that the situation may well benot only far more complex, but radically different. Life without thetechnologies we use daily can seem unimaginable. Yet those verysame technologies raise profound political, social, and ecologicalconcerns. Some authors have argued that technological advances inﬁelds such as computing, medicine, robotics, and artiﬁcial intelligence arefundamentally changing (or have already fundamentally changed) whoand what we are by making us post- or transhuman. This course posesquestions such as: Does technology affect us in merely superﬁcial ormore fundamental ways? Has our technology made us fundamentallydifferent from our ancestors? Are there essential differences betweentypes of technology (hand tools, “simple” machines, cybernetic devices,so-called “smart” technologies, etc.)? How is technology related topolitics? Is technology value-neutral? Can technology be sexist or racist?.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in PHIL or consent of instructor.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 280 - Philosophy of Mind (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course addresses fundamental questions regarding the nature ofthe human mind and thought.

They will become acquainted with the works of philosopherssuch as Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Daniel Dennett, PatriciaChurchland, Fred Dretske, Ruth Millikan, Hillary Putnam, and others. Wewill address questions such as whether we can know there are otherminds, whether mental states are reducible to brain states, how ourthoughts can be about anything at all, whether there is a &quot;language ofthought&quot;, what it means to view the mind as embodied or as extendinginto the world.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy, Neuroscienceconcentrator, or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 291 - Intermediate Topics Seminar in Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An inquiry into issues and problems that are now at the center ofphilosophical attention.

Many existentialists embrace a viewcharacterized with the slogan “existence precedes essence.” This sloganmeans that any attempt to ﬁgure out what one is must begin with thefact that one is. In addition, if existence precedes essence, then theremay well be a multiplicity of ways that one can be, making choosingbetween these ways a difﬁcult task. That one’s existence may well beexperienced as constrained by social forces seemingly beyond one’scontrol complicates matters. We will read from a variety of sources,including philosophical sources such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre,de Beauvoir, or Judith Butler as well as literary or biographical sources,e.g., Beckett, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, and others.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 299 - Intermediate Topics in Philosophy (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>A general category used only in the evaluation of transfer credit.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 305 - Metaphysics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is an introduction to the methodology of and various issueswithin metaphysics. Typically, these questions address certain generalfeatures about the nature of reality. Many of these are ontological,concerning whether certain kinds of entities exist—e.g., numbers, holes,ﬁctional characters, gods, and possibilities. Other metaphysical questionsconcern the nature and interrelations among entities and various featuresof the world. Among the familiar metaphysical issues are debatesregarding the nature of human beings, the reality of space and time,the limits of thought and possibility, and the connection between truthand existence. Readings will be drawn from a mix of contemporary andclassical sources. Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy orconsent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 306 - Theories of Knowledge (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An inquiry into the meaning, possibility, conditions, criteria, and typesof truth and/or knowledge, and a discussion of representative theoriesof knowledge.

What should we value? and What type of person shouldwe be? Yet, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to thesequestions and decide among them only if we correctly answer anotherset of questions ﬁrst. For instance, how can we know what we shouldvalue unless we understand what values are, whether they exist andwhether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we oughtto act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally goodor why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the ﬁrstplace? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. Itinquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments andattitudes. As such, it draws on many other areas of philosophy, includingepistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 326 - Theories of Justice (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course focuses on contemporary work in political philosophyconcerned with justice, including that of philosophers such as Rawls,Dworkin, Nozick, Young, MacIntyre, Sandel, Nussbaum, and Habermas.We will examine questions such as: What is justice? Can it be deﬁnedindependently of consideration of what the &quot;good&quot; is for human beings?Is justice possible in a society marked by signiﬁcant religious, ethnic,cultural or other sorts of pluralisms? What is the relation betweenjustice and nationhood, and what can be said about justice betweennations? How is justice connected to social equality, and to liberty?What is meant by economic justice? What is the relation between justiceand democracy? The course will examine contemporary philosophicaldebates about these questions, in order to help students think criticallyabout the issue of justice in the context of the pressing real world issuesin which such questions play a crucial role.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): PHIL 126 or PHIL 250, and one other philosophy course,or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 330 - Nineteenth-Century Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course examines some of the most important developments inEuropean philosophy during the nineteenth century.

This tradition can be distinguished in a number ofways. Methodologically, it tends to employ careful argumentationand formal tools like logic and mathematics to provide analyses ofscientiﬁc, psychological, and linguistic data. Historically, it is usuallytraced back to a group of Anglo-European philosophers—Frege, Russell,Moore, and Wittgenstein—writing around the beginning of the twentiethcentury. Thematically, it is primarily driven by the ambition of providinga systematic account of the relationship between language, thought,and the world. This course explores early and recent contributions of theanalytic tradition to epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language,philosophy of science, and ethics. Prerequisite(s): Two previous coursesin Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 334 - History of Continental Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course traces the development of Continental Philosophy from 1900to the present, including the phenomenological movement of Husserl,Heidegger, Sartre, and others; the neo-Marxism of the Frankfurt Schooland Habermas; the hermeneutics of Gadamer and Ricoeur; and the post-structuralism of Foucault, Derrida, and others.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): PHIL 232 and one other course in Philosophy, or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 360 - Philosophy of Language (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course examines the nature of language, meaning andcommunication. It considers questions such as: What is a language?What is it for a word to have meaning? How is communication possible?Are meanings &quot;in the head&quot;? What is the relation between languageand thought? It addresses topics such as reference, the role of speakerintentions, and the indeterminacy of translation as well as someapplications and political implications of philosophy of language.Students will be introduced to several strands of philosophy of languagesuch as formal semantics, ordinary language philosophy, and speech acttheory and will become familiar with the writings of philosophers rangingfrom Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein to Quine, Austin, Putnam, Chomsky,Davidson, Langton, and others.

Political organization,however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure ofAmerican democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interestgroups, and social movements have formed and acted to create andinsure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In thecourse, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death ofpolitical organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature ofpolitical organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations,as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism,media, technology and money. Organizations considered may include: theRepublican, Democratic, and third parties; major interest groups such asthe Sierra Club, AARP, NRA, Christian Coalition, Chamber of Commerce,and unions; and social movements such as the women's, civil rights, andChristian conservative movements.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): POSC 110.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 312 - Religion and Politics in U.S. (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course offers an intensive analysis of the many connectionsbetween the American religious and political systems.

Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of publicofﬁcials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances inrole models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychologyall shape what amounts to the political “gender system.” In this course,we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through agendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developedsocieties. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role inachieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual,social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate thatbias. Students will conduct a range of original empirical research tocontribute to these important debates.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 319 - Topics in the Study of American Politics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course provides a venue in which to explore topics in AmericanPolitics at the advanced level.

After a period of post-war stability,European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led toseveral new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation;a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; andthe emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This coursefocuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in WesternEurope during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on whatmany scholars label the &quot;far&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; right. These parties tend to beorganized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizingnationalism, exclusion of &quot;foreigners,&quot; a strong state, welfare chauvinismand, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semesterstudents will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties andtheir politics across Europe and discern the differences between whatscholars describe as &quot;populist radical&quot; or &quot;populist far&quot; right parties fromother parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis partieswhich are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 328 - Politics of the Environment (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is about the theoretical, political, and practical problemsassociated with environmental action. Course materials analyze varioustheoretical perspectives on the relationship between humans andnature, and they illustrate how different ethics lead to widely differentprescriptions for personal and political action. Course materialsalso offer examples of how environmental problems have in factbeen addressed or not by governmental, non-governmental, andinternational institutions. This is not a course on the physical processesof environmental problems, but rather it emphasizes the political,economic, and theoretical contexts within which efforts are made toact on environmental threats. No prior knowledge of environmentalor political science is required. However, students should be preparedto read and interpret detailed social science texts, to formulate andarticulate cogent arguments, and to conduct independent research.Course fulﬁlls the ENVS Social Science requirement.</P><P>Crosslisting: ENVS 328.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 332 - Politics in Latin America, Africa, and Asia (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course explores the politics of developing countries of Asia, Africaand Latin America in their historical socioeconomic contexts.

Internationalorganizations are formal institutions established by states to addressglobal problems. They include not only the United Nations, but alsomany other public or private, international, national or local, formal orinformal institutions. Collectively, these institutions engage in globalgovernance. Our goals in this course are to understand the theoreticaland practical approaches to international organizations and globalgovernance, the limitations under which global governance operates, andthe future prospects for a system of global governance. This course hasa substantial oral component and oral skills work and so satisﬁes theUniversity's oral general education requirement.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 345 - Human Rights in Global Perspective (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course analyzes the emergence, expansion and enforcement ofinternational human rights norms.

We will also examine theories of European integration tounderstand competing explanations for the integration process. Fourth,various policy areas will be studied to show how the power of the EUis distributed unevenly across areas. During the ﬁnal two weeks of thecourse we will simulate a gathering of the European Council. This coursehas a substantial oral component and oral skills work and so satisﬁes theUniversity's oral general education requirement.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 347 - The Middle East in World Affairs (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the politicalhistory, international signiﬁcance, and the dimensions of political lifein the Middle East. Owing to the ever-present potential for conflict, theseeming intractability of disputes, and the oil factor, what happens in theMiddle East is of vital importance to international politics. We examinethe role that politics in the Middle East has played in world affairs as wellas the region's importance in the future.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 348 - Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 CreditHours)</P><P>This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviorsduring crisis situations concerning the three &quot;big&quot; states in WesternEurope: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to asthe EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is itthat we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries whichhave been the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years?Are these countries &quot;middle powers&quot; or &quot;big powers&quot;? What role do theyplay in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the &quot;three big&quot; can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 349 - Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since thebeginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorismdates only from the French Revolution (1789-1799). In this course, wewill explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analystsargue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorismdiffers from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, andso on. We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholarsthink that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorismas planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We willcompare the various deﬁnitions and perspectives to determine whichmight work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, wewill focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science andhow they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, andthe media.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 353 - Russian Foreign and Military Policy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>In this course we will seek to understand the motives and objectivesof Russian foreign and military policies.

After a period of post-war stability,European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led toseveral new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation;a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; andthe emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This coursefocuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in WesternEurope during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on whatmany scholars label the &quot;far&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; right. These parties tend to beorganized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizingnationalism, exclusion of &quot;foreigners,&quot; a strong state, welfare chauvinismand, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semesterstudents will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties andtheir politics across Europe and discern the differences between whatscholars describe as &quot;populist radical&quot; or &quot;populist far&quot; right parties fromother parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis partieswhich are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist.</P></Div><Div><P>PPA 328 - Politics of the Global Environment (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is about the theoretical, political, and practical problemsassociated with environmental action.

Why is it that weknow so little about the foreign policies of three countries which havebeen the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years? Arethese countries &quot;middle powers&quot; or &quot;big powers&quot;? What role do they playin the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the &quot;three big&quot; can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): PPA 201 or consent of instructor.</P></Div><Div><P>PPA 349 - Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since thebeginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorismdates only from the French Revolution (1789-1799). In this course, wewill explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analystsargue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorismdiffers from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, andso on. We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholarsthink that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorismas planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the discovery that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding of what it meansto be human in today's world.</P><P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P><P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, politics and public affairs, global commerce andglobal health, and English.

Students of psychology should aim for bothbreadth and depth of knowledge in the discipline. The requirements forDenison's psychology major are relatively flexible so that students canselect courses and experiences that best complement their personalgoals. At the same time, the flexibility of these requirements necessitatesthat psychology majors work closely with their academic advisors todevelop an appropriate plan of study.</P><P>Writing Program Statement: Psychology students will demonstratecompetence in reviewing, developing, conducting, and analyzingpsychological research, and crucially, in communicating scientiﬁcresearch to diverse audiences. Writing manuscripts describing theirempirical psychological research will be one core-learning goal. Studentswill write formal research reports that are modeled on the majorcomponents of the American Psychological Association’s PublicationManual. The development of these essential scientiﬁc writing skills willbe coordinated across the department’s research courses; those aredevelopmentally and systematically linked throughout the curriculum.Writing critical analyses or literature reviews of research will be a secondcore-learning goal. Students will write formal papers that include a criticalanalysis, or review, of a body of research and that draws conclusionsfrom existing literature on a topic of interest. Students will have multipleopportunities to develop critical analysis writing skills in lecture anddiscussion-based courses at the 200 and 300-levels and in History andSystems of Psychology, which is the curriculum’s capstone course.</P><H2>Mission Statement</H2><P>Psychology, broadly deﬁned, is the science that involves the studyof physiological, behavioral, and mental processes in humans andanimals. Psychology has several interrelated facets, being a scholarlydiscipline, a scientiﬁc ﬁeld of study, and an applied profession. As ascholarly discipline, psychology represents a major ﬁeld of study inacademic settings. As a scientiﬁc ﬁeld of study, psychology entails theinvestigation of human and animal phenomena, principally by examiningthe factors that affect psychological processes. As an applied profession,psychology involves the application of knowledge, skills, and techniquesto the prevention and solution of individual and social problems.</P><P>The Department endeavors to introduce students to theories, researchand special topics in the ﬁeld of psychology, enable students’understanding and development of scientiﬁc inquiry skills, and increasestudents’ awareness of the application of psychology to social issues.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Seth Chin-Parker, Department Chair</P><P>Professors: Nida Bikmen, Nestor Matthews, Robert Weis</P><P>Associate Professors: Cody Brooks, Seth Chin-Parker, Gina A.

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis. Lastly, we willengage in self-reflective writing about our own experiences with health,illness, and healing.</P><P>Crosslisting: CLAS 208, REL 208, WGST 208.</P></Div><Div><P>QS 213 - Queer Graphix (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Through a series of drawing and printmaking projects, this studio artcourse seeks to explore and creatively express queer culture, aestheticsand GLBT art history, as well as notions of identity, gender, orientationand sexuality.

It critically examines the role of religion as an activeforce that has social, ethical, and ideological consequences. Studentslearn to assess how religion has shaped their cultures, their family lives,their suppositions of what matters and what is ethical, and their sense ofwho they are. By studying religion, students gain the analytical, relational,and expressive skills essential to a liberal arts education.</P><P>One does not need to be religious to study religion. The academic studyis a lens through which the persistence of religion in the social spherebecomes evident, and the personal sphere is enriched. This academicexercise conﬁrms and contests the prevailing understanding of reality.In the process the study of religion enhances skill-sets with transfervalue in the vocational sphere as well as deepened awareness of whatdeﬁnes us as individuals, communities, societies, and nations. Criticalconsciousness on moral issues, global relationships, and the existence ofcommunity is a result of this academic exercise. Therefore, the questionswe pose concerning various social relations may be more important thanthe answers constructed.

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis.

It treats the Bibleas a collection of texts arising out of and used to make sense of thesocial worlds in which they were written. But a course about the Bible isnever just about the Bible. As a foundational object and document forso many public social projects – including ones we might describe as“secular” – the Bible is much more than a religious book. It is an emblemof authority and power more generally, and the ways certain kinds ofauthorities (religious or otherwise), are often engaged less for theircontent than for what we imagine them to contain. So this course willregularly ask students to assess the fantasies and feelings that circulatearound the Bible.

One kind of intellectual freedom requires usto break away from the notion that our native language is the mostnatural and apt means of expressing the full range of human experience.An education can start with the realization that all words are purelyconventional devices. They are nonetheless tools that stir emotions,articulate ideas, and establish relationships with others. Learning anotherlanguage contributes to our education by intimately exploring culturaland linguistic concepts that broaden our understanding</P><P>Our basic courses offer the opportunity to begin acquiring the skills andknowledge necessary for the eventual mastery of a language. Whenstudents take full advantage of that opportunity, they can use the targetlanguage in all subsequent courses. The department emphasizes theuse of the target language in most of its courses because it believes thatstudents can best appreciate another culture from within its own mode ofexpression.</P><P>With a view toward career opportunities, the department encouragesintegrating language study with a variety of other academic areas, suchas history, philosophy, international studies, environmental studies,biology, economics, politics and public affairs, global commerce, globalhealth, and English. Courses in cultural studies and literature, aside fromtheir intrinsic worth, also present multiple perspectives on other culturesand areas of intellectual experience.</P><P>A student who wants to spend a summer, a semester, or a year abroadwith programs approved by Denison should consult members of thedepartment and the Center for Global Programs (see Off-CampusPrograms). On-campus opportunities to improve command of thelanguage are provided by language tables, international ﬁlms, clubmeetings, and similar activities sponsored by the department. There areas well subsidized ﬁeld trips to museums and pertinent activities in citiesacross the country, and in some cases international travel.</P><H3>Spanish Program Mission</H3><P>Our mission is to foster the development of cross-culturalcommunication skills through rigorous intellectual inquiry into a varietyof archives from Spanish-speaking societies.  By working closely withprofessors and peers, in and beyond the classroom, students acquireproﬁciency in critically analyzing the complex issues of today's world.</P><H3>Spanish Program Vision</H3><P>Our students become co-learners with each other and us, and competentin intercultural communication and the study of cultural discourses. Theyengage with a wide range of texts and develop analytic and evaluativeskills to be active participants in an evolving world. They connect withthe world in multiple signiﬁcant ways: study abroad, student conferences,guest speakers, extracurricular activities, and community outreach. Ourprogram is a rigorous, intellectually stimulating and fulﬁlling endeavor,responding to an ever-changing world. It integrates culture, language, andliterature through, and across, multiple perspectives and methodologies.It also forges ties with many other departments throughout the universityso that our discipline can facilitate research and the acquisition ofknowledge across the curriculum.</P><H3>Goals for the Major</H3><P>In our courses students acquire functional language abilities and developknowledge of the cultures and literature of Spanish-speaking peoples.Through historical breadth and depth of inquiry, students analyze issuespertaining to different Hispanophone regions and examine them througha variety of disciplinary approaches. Students develop critical languageawareness, interpretative and translation skills, historical and politicalawareness, social sensibility, and aesthetic perception.</P><P>At the linguistic level the Spanish program subscribes to the Standardsfor Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century articulated by theAmerican Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.  They includeﬁve areas of development in second language education.</P><P>Communication</P><P>·       Interpersonal<P/>Students engage in conversations, provide and obtain information,express feelings and emotions, and exchange opinions.</P><P>·       Interpretive<P/>Students understand and interpret written and spoken language on avariety of topics from diverse media.</P><P>·       Presentational<P/>Students present information, concepts, and ideas to an audience oflisteners or readers on a variety of topics.</P><P>Cultures</P><P>·       Practices and perspectives<P/>Students demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between thepractices and perspectives of the culture studied.</P><P>·       Products and Perspectives<P/>Students demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between theproducts and perspectives of the culture studied.</P><P>Connections</P><P>·       Students reinforce and further their knowledge of other disciplinesthrough the language.</P><P>·       Students acquire information and recognize the distinctiveviewpoints that are only available through the language and its cultures.</P><P>Comparisons</P><P>·       Students demonstrate understanding of the nature of languagethrough comparisons of the language studied and their own.</P><P>·       Students demonstrate understanding of the concept of culturethrough comparisons of the cultures studied and their own, including therelationship between accepted practices, products and perspectives.</P><P>Communities</P><P>·       Students use the language both within and beyond the schoolsetting.</P><P>·       Students show evidence of becoming life-long learners by using thelanguage for personal enjoyment and enrichment.</P><P><Span/></P><H2>Faculty</H2><P>Associate Professor Hanada Al-Masri, Chair</P><P>Associate Professor Jason Busic, Associate Chair</P><P>Associate Professors Dosinda Alvite, Mónica Ayala-Martínez, JasonBusic, Melissa Huerta, Francisco J.

These opportunitiesinclude, for example, off-campus trips to target-culture plays, moviesand performances, as well as campus visits by native scholars andperformers. In that way, experiences in target cultures become morereadily available to our students. These opportunities are made possiblethrough a most generous endowment bestowed on the Departmentof Modern Languages by the Patty Foresman Fund. The departmentmaintains a Modern Languages Facebook page where Denisoncommunity members can view upcoming events.</P><H3>The Foresman Lounge</H3><P>Located in the central hub of the department, the lounge provides theDenison community with a space for a wide range of activities such asreceptions, classes, and informal gatherings.

Both the Emphasis and the Senior Project are subject toapproval by the faculty of the Department of Theatre.</P><P>In their emphasis, a student could elect to follow a traditional sub-disciplinary path (Acting or Playwriting, for instance), a more speciﬁc butstill traditional path (Music Theatre or Costume Design, for instance), atheoretical or theme-oriented concentration (&quot;Theatre and Social Change&quot;or &quot;Gender and Performance,&quot; for instance), or a generalist path (providedthe student could offer a meaningful justiﬁcation for that plan). Thiscoursework will take advantage of the advanced courses offered in theDepartment of Theatre and also, potentially, the offerings of the restof the college. As in the college's Individually Designed Major, it willbe the responsibility of the student to complete prerequisite coursesnecessary and to have developed a group of alternate courses in theevent that they are unable to register for a proposed course.

Students explore how Women'sand Gender Studies treats gender issues from the perspectives ofdifferent disciplines, such as anthropology and sociology, art, biology,Black studies, communication, global health, international studies,music, philosophy, politics and public affairs, religion, etc. and howthese issues manifest differently in different national and transnationalcontexts. Students thus develop their understanding of these issues bytaking into account the intersections among this array of disciplines andsociocultural and geographic locations.</P><P>Third, we aim to show students the real-life and everyday implications oftheir academic engagement. That is, we challenge students to see therelationship between theory and practice: to see how the academic studyof race, class, and gender locally and globally is informed by and has thepower to transform real lives, both others' and our own.</P><H3>Curricular Goals</H3><P>Denison's Women's and Gender Studies faculty are dedicated to helpingstudents develop rigorous analyses of culture, politics, ideas and text, aswell as creative leadership skills. We hope to impart to our students thehistory, analysis and practice of feminist scholarship, means of creativeexpression for their intellectual interests and concerns, and politicalservice and activism.</P><P>Students are required to take an introductory course, WGST 101 - Issuesin Feminism, a feminist methods course, WGST 310 - Feminist ResearchMethods, and a feminist theory course, WGST 311 - Feminist Theory.Majors are also required to undertake a semester- or year-long seniorproject—a research, activist, and/or artistic inquiry and experience— WGST 451 - Senior Research and/or WGST 452 - Senior Research.Students select additional, usually cross-listed courses according toWomen's and Gender Studies Program guidelines and their own interests.</P><P>The required courses in the major and minor explore gender and justiceissues, provide the methods and information to conduct rigorousanalysis, engage our students in ways that challenge them to expandtheir thinking about the material they meet in the world, and give them theopportunity to embody feminist pedagogies. The elective courses will dothe same in the context of their ﬁelds of study.</P><P>Students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of off-campusstudy programs, internships, fellowships, and research projects thatacquaint them with women's and gender issues (information availablethrough the Center for Global Programs, Knowlton Center for CareerExploration, and Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement). Studentsare encouraged to develop leadership skills by taking an active partin campus life, including engaging in projects developed inside andoutside the academic program. Such projects have included a nationalgrant application, a campus-wide study on violence, and a beneﬁtconcert. Students have worked with the Ofﬁce of Gender &amp; Sexuality,Ofﬁce of Multicultural Student Affairs, Denisonians for PlannedParenthood, and It’s My Pleasure, as examples.</P><P>The Women's and Gender Studies Program sponsors regular symposiaon gender issues that include presentations by scholars, artists, andactivists from across the United States and abroad as well as our ownfaculty.

Harris Summer Scholars</H5><Div><P>Laura C. Harris Summer Scholarships are part of Denison’s SummerScholar program, and proposals are evaluated by the Student ResearchGrants Committee. Summer Scholars funded by this endowment willnormally have done some coursework in Women’s and Gender Studies.Their projects should align with the goals and objectives of the Women’sand Gender Studies Program, which are to foster a critical awarenessof and intellectual sensitivity to the content, methods, and real-lifeimplications of the ﬁeld. Thus Laura C. Harris Summer Scholars shoulddraw on feminist scholarship and methodologies and should be attunedto the interdisciplinary nature of the ﬁeld. While students may take upa particular disciplinary perspective in their summer research (e.g.,psychology, anthropology, economics, literary studies, history, philosophy,biology, dance, etc.), their project should reflect an engagement withwomen’s and gender studies. Projects may aim to develop students’understanding of gender and its socio-political meanings in our lives;the relationship between gender and other aspects of identity (such asrace, class, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, and sexuality); orthe central relationship between theory and practice. Topics may includebut are not limited to transnational feminist issues, sexual and genderviolence, equal rights, and the workings of power in social institutions,reproductive technologies, body image, and queer politics.</P><P>Laura C. Harris Summer Scholars must be advised by someone familiarwith the discipline of women’s and gender studies. Normally, this willbe a member of the Women’s and Gender Studies faculty (i.e. someoneeither appointed in Women’s and Gender Studies, teaching cross-listedcourses in the program, or serving on the Women's and Gender Studiescommittee). Four to eight Laura C. Harris Summer Scholarships aretypically awarded every year, depending on the number of qualifyingproposals.

It examines whether gender isbiologically or socially constructed and how notions of femininityand masculinity are (re)produced. Students will analyze the workingsof power and the social production of inequality in institutions suchas the family, the workplace, and the state, taking into account theintersections among gender, race, class, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality.Topics will include sexual and gender violence, equal rights, reproductivetechnologies, body image, and transnational feminist issues. A centralaim of the course is to develop critical reading and thinking about theplurality of women’s experiences and about the ways in which womenhave resisted inequalities and engaged in local/global politics for socialtransformation and change. This course fulﬁlls the Interdivisional (I),Power and Justice (P), and Oral Communication (R) GE requirements andis required for WGST majors/minors.</P><P>Crosslisting: QS 290.</P></Div><Div><P>WGST 108 - Bible, Gender, and Sexuality (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course introduces students to the many conflicted attitudes andimages around men, women, and sexuality found in the Bible, from thevery different creations of Adam and Eve to Revelation's representationof the Roman Empire as the &quot;whore&quot; of Babylon; from the assertiveand sexually suspicious female ﬁgures of Ruth and Rahab to Jesus'uncertain masculinity in accounts of his death.

The nation’s greatest healthissues include, but are not limited to, unmanaged chronic conditions(including cardiovascular health), environmental health risks and cancer,racial and ethnic health disparities, women's reproductive and sexualhealth, and the epidemic of obesity. Barriers in healthcare delivery, athealthcare system and provider levels, exist for women, trans people, andnon-binary people. Evaluating the complexities of these gendered healthissues involves both scientiﬁc literacy and sociocultural literacy. Thiscourse provides a fundamental understanding of how biological systemstructures and functions are related, speciﬁc to the female human body.The laboratory component of this course familiarizes students with thescientiﬁc method, feminist theory in science, and methods in women’shealth research. This course promotes proﬁciency in oral communicationthrough practice in a variety of formats that typically occur in biology andwomen's and gender studies.

This courseexamines the contradictory impacts of these policies on genderrelations and asks: what challenges do global economic trends posefor gender equality and equity in both developed and developingcountries? To answer this question, we begin with an introductionto alternative approaches to economics, focusing on the differencesbetween neoclassical and feminist economics, and history and economicdimension of globalization. This will be followed by an exploration ofthe impacts of economic development policy on gender relations in thecontext of a globalizing world economy. Special topics will include thehousehold as a unit of analysis; women’s unpaid labor; the genderedimpacts of economic restructuring and ﬁnancial crisis; the feminizationof the labor force in the formal and informal sectors of the globaleconomy; care penalty and the gendered impacts of COVID-19. Thecourse will conclude with an evaluation of tools and strategies forachieving gender equity within the context of a sustainable, human-centered approach to economic development.

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis. Lastly, wewill engage in self-reflective writing about our own experiences withhealth, illness, and healing.

In particular, it explores a number of settings that may include:the family, the work place, the political arena, religious activity, violenceagainst women, and face-to-face interactional contexts. Specialattention is given to the ways in which race, ethnicity, class and sexualorientation shape gender experiences. Although its primary focus isAmerican society, the course compares problems of sexual inequalityin American society with other, quite different, societies in order to gaina comparative understanding of how discrimination, prejudice, andstructural inequality, wherever they are found, create special problems forwomen. Throughout, the focus is on learning to use structural, historical,and theoretical information as guides to understanding social changeand the choices facing women and men.

In spite of cultural, racial and religious diversity among womenacross the globe, women often share the similar stories of physical andpsychological suffering caused by their institutionalized religions andsocieties. Many of these women also testify that their religions enabledthem to resist injustice and to build up solidarity with others includingmen.

Both make us aware of assumptions we make in our everydaylives and challenge us to justify them. This course examines ways inwhich feminist theory enriches philosophy and vice versa. How doesfeminism destabilize philosophy and affect philosophical conceptionsof knowledge, metaphysics, agency, or morality? How does philosophyenrich feminist understandings of oppression, privilege, or equality? Wewill consider a range of forms of oppression and privilege, particularlyas they affect women. We will consider philosophical conceptions ofsex, gender, and race. How do they shape people’s understanding ofthemselves and the world? What kinds of agency do they foster and whatkinds of agency do they inhibit? How does resistance to oppression andprivilege lead to social change?

Special attentionis given to the ways in which race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientationshape gender experiences. Although its primary focus is Americansociety, the course compares problems of sexual inequality in Americansociety with other, quite different, societies in order to gain a comparativeunderstanding of how discrimination, prejudice, and structural inequality,wherever they are found, create special problems for women.

This coursewill introduce students to the sociocultural analysis of racial and ethnicidentities. How did ethnic and racial identities and communities developover time? Why does race, though now understood to be a social ratherthan a biological category, continue to be (mis)understood as a biologicalcategory? How do aspects of political, class, gender, and sexual identitiesinfluence racial and ethnic identities? We will use a global perspectiveto understand the conception of race and ethnicity. We will explorethese topics among others including cultural and historical variability ofethnic and racial categories, the dialectical formation of identity, and thepersistence of certain forms of racial and ethnic prejudice.

How have&quot;tradition&quot; and &quot;change&quot; fueled competing visions of Japan what itmeans to be &quot;Japanese&quot;? How does one go about reconciling theseconflicting views? How have these debates evolved over time? How havevariously situated individuals and groups in society negotiated shiftingcircumstances?

We then explore what weknow about the lives of our earliest ancestors and the clusters of newhuman-like species emerging over the next few million years, includingour own about 200,000 years ago. The last part of the class turns toarchaeological views of humanity. We survey the diversity of humanexperiences as our ancestors spread around the globe, creating art,starting farms, and building cities.

Developmentalbiology is the study of the progression from this single cell to a complex,multicellular organism. Recently the powerful tools of molecular biologyhave linked the ﬁelds of embryology and genetics to reveal how cells,tissues, organs, and organisms develop. Especially striking is theconservation of molecules and mechanisms that underlie developmentalprocesses in different organisms. This course provides an overview ofthe major features of early embryonic development in animals, and themechanisms (molecular mechanism when known) that underlie them.We focus on two major aspects of developmental biology: (1) How is thebasic body plan established? How does the basic organization of theembryo arise from the fertilized egg? What are the cellular mechanismsunderlying morphogenesis and the appearance of pattered structures inthe embryo? (2) How do parts become different in the embryo?</P><P>Prerequisite(s): Biology core or consent, and CHEM 131 or CHEM majors -BIOL 210, BIOL 220, and CHEM 300 (or concurrently).</P></Div><Div><P>BIOL 325 - Genetics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course provides a detailed and up-to-date understanding of genetics,an appreciation of how genetics affects our lives every day from thesupermarket to the doctor's ofﬁce, and a realization of the applications ofgenetics to virtually every discipline of biology.

(2)Mendelian genetics: Thinking about genetics on the gene level-everythingfrom inheritance to recombinational mapping. (3) The application of bothmolecular and Mendelian genetics to study biological processes. We startby seeing how genetic techniques can be used to dissect almost anybiological process and end up answering questions such as: How doesgenetic disease screening work? How are genes cloned from complexorganisms such as mice or even humans? How does gene therapy work?In the laboratory we carry out both molecular experiments and classicalgenetic experiments.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): Biology core or consent, and CHEM 131, or CHEM Majors- BIOL 210, BIOL 220, and CHEM 300 (or concurrently).</P></Div><Div><P>BIOL 326 - Plant Evolution and Reproduction (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>In this course we will explore the evolutionary relationships and historiesamong the major groups of plants, both terrestrial and aquatic.

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis.

We consider speciﬁcally howmass communication has been deﬁned from the 19th through to thebeginning of the 21st Century and how this history is relevant to issuesof mass society today. Given that almost every person in America isaffected by mass culture and media, we will discuss through the lectures,discussions and exercises a number of controversial suggestions,critical paradigms and mainstream assumptions.

For long (as is the case even today) one’s cultural“taste” was a signiﬁcant factor in determining one’s standing in thesocial hierarchy. Debates about “high” vs “low” culture and about whatcultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a communityhave involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us witha lens through which to understand historical social changes. It alsoallows us to appreciate that several contemporary debates (for instanceabout the cultural meaning of Hip Hop or Reality TV) have historicalprecedents that inform and precede them. This introductory course seeksto trace those debates from their origins in middle century Europe totheir culmination into contemporary battles over popular culture. In sodoing it seeks to politicize popular culture and unravel the competingideologies and worldviews embedded within it. We begin by reading someof the prominent theorists of “high” culture and then problematize theirarguments by studying the challenges to them (most stridently posedby the Birmingham school of scholars). We will then use this historicaldebate to inform our understanding of the contemporary world of popularculture in America. In the process we will also learn various ways toanalyze and critique objects of popular culture around us that we oftenunthinkingly consume.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 147 - Introduction to Media Literacy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>While most of us are proﬁcient consumers of visual electronic media -we have the speed of symbol-recognition and comprehension skills tobe adept &quot;readers&quot; - few of us have learned to bring to that reading thecritical skills we learn in the study of literature, music or art.

This course willbegin with an in-depth exploration of the philosophy that communicationis the means through which we construct, participate, and convey thecultures we are a part of and therefore, is central to the creation of thekind of world we want to live in. We will then turn our attention to ananalysis of current social, organizational and political discourses on theenvironment and our responsibility, or not, in its protection.”.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 221 - Theories of Group Communication (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course studies the communication process in the task orienteddiscussion group.

What role doeseveryday performativity play in constituting us as raced, gendered, andclassed subjects? How do cultural performances (musical concerts,sporting events, or dance) help us better understand ourselves and oursociety? In this class we examine a range of theories that see privatebehaviors and public performances as rehearsed, audience-oriented, andcreative acts. Theorists such as Erving Goffman, Judith Butler, PierreBourdieu, and Victor Turner will guide our examination of both &quot;everyday&quot;performativity (in regard to bodily stigma and identities of class, race,gender, and sexuality) and cultural performances (such as musicalconcerts, sporting events, and dance). Students will learn how to analyzetheir own behavior as a cultural text and to discern the textual, acoustic,and embodied dimensions of cultural performances.

In readings, screenings, written assignments, anddiscussions you develop a working knowledge of different intellectualtraditions used to study media. From the very start, the course pushespast simplistic, binary assessments of media consumption as beingeither “good” or “bad.” Instead, we survey the complicated routes throughwhich media forms and practices inform people’s understandings ofthemselves and the world around them. Organized into three units, thecourse aims to provide you with conceptual frames for 1) understandingthe relationship between media and culture, 2) identifying how mediamake claims to represent truth and authenticity, and 3) comprehendingthe role of media in ideological conflict. Throughout the term, you areasked to question many ideas and beliefs that people take for granted:that media are “bad” for children, that some television programmingis “realistic,” or that we could ever exist outside the web of mediatedcommunication that informs our day-to-day lives, even if we wanted todo just that. The overarching aim of the course is nuance – a deeperunderstanding of media, and a reﬁned critical lens of assessing its role incontemporary life.</P></Div><Div><P>COMM 239 - Racialized Perspectives of Media (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course critically examines the forms that racial and ethnicrepresentations have taken in American media.

As such, fear is often framed as an obstacle toovercome in order to progress forward. But could these efforts to surpassfear be neglecting viable truths to persons’ underlying experiences?What if fear was regarded as an invitation to look inward in search ofsome deeply rooted signiﬁcance? From where does fear stem exactlyand how may we render meanings to articulate the ways it (mis)informsand impacts our communal lives? These questions drive the premise ofthis course, which regards fear as a phenomenological experience andsocial construction.

It will seek to understand the consequences ofthe process whereby texts, ideas and images that for long remainedconﬁned to their locations of origin are today increasingly mobile andde-territorialized. Objects of popular culture such as television, cinemaand music, are circulating and being consumed around the world andare helping challenge the traditional markers of human identity suchas nation, culture and language. While they are allowing individuals toimagine alternatives to existing realities they are also engendering abacklash against a perceived imposition of new ideas, values and culture.This course will seek to familiarize students with these ongoing changesand the conflicts over cultural and national identity that it has given riseto. We will begin with arguments that present a totalizing view of thisprocess (the Cultural Imperialism thesis) and then over the course of thesemester complicate and nuance those arguments by introducing agencyand empowerment for the consumers of global culture. We will do thisby closely studying actual case studies (from reality TV in Saudi Arabiaor McDonalds in Japan) in order to understand the stakes involved inthe struggle to deﬁne and &quot;protect&quot; national and cultural identity. At theend of this semester long course students should have gained a deepunderstanding of why the process of global flow of culture is a deeplycontentious and political phenomenon.

But is the conventional wisdom true? In orderto conﬁdently make progress solving social problems we need to knowhow people work and whether interventions have the intended impacts.The course has three goals. While reading research on a wide rangeof interesting questions about our political world, we will continuallydiscuss problems of causal inference – the degree to which we haveconﬁdence that x causes y. We’ll learn about various approaches tocausal research, covering a range of research designs in the socialsciences.

Political organization,however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure ofAmerican democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interestgroups, and social movements have formed and acted to create andinsure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In thecourse, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death ofpolitical organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature ofpolitical organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations,as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism,media, technology and money.

Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of publicofﬁcials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances inrole models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychologyall shape what amounts to the political “gender system.” In this course,we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through agendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developedsocieties. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role inachieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual,social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate thatbias.

The objective of this course is to explore the relationshipbetween economic growth and the natural environment. While theconcept of economic growth occupies a central place in economic policy-making, we will discuss whether economic growth is compatible with thesustainable-development worldview adopted by the UN and many otherglobal and local economic actors.

This courseexamines the contradictory impacts of these policies on genderrelations and asks: what challenges do global economic trends posefor gender equality and equity in both developed and developingcountries? To answer this question, we begin with an introductionto alternative approaches to economics, focusing on the differencesbetween neoclassical and feminist economics, and history and economicdimension of globalization. This will be followed by an exploration ofthe impacts of economic development policy on gender relations in thecontext of a globalizing world economy. Special topics will include thehousehold as a unit of analysis; women’s unpaid labor; the genderedimpacts of economic restructuring and ﬁnancial crisis; the feminizationof the labor force in the formal and informal sectors of the globaleconomy; care penalty and the gendered impacts of COVID-19.

(4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Before 2010, the Eurozone was hailed as the ﬁrst successful multi-national, large-scale model of monetary and currency union. Severalcountries in many regions of the world (such as South America, theMiddle East, West Africa) have been considering following in the stepsof the European Union (EU) by creating similar currency areas in thenear future. However, the ﬁnancial crisis of the late 2000s followed bythe sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s have challenged the perception ofthe Eurozone has a fully functioning currency area. In this class we willseek to place the creation of the Eurozone in the context of the broaderevolution of the EU as a cosmopolitan project. We will examine the socio-economic theories and political ideologies behind the creation of theEurozone. This will require an understanding of the macroeconomicmodels which underlie the concept of ‘optimal currency area’ and aninvestigation of the degree to which the Eurozone is a fully completedproject. In particular the solutions provided by EU leaders and institutionsto the economic crisis in Greece (and other countries in the Eurozone)will give us a chance to reflect upon the future of the Eurozone and todiscuss the intellectual and practical implications of two alternatives thatmember-states may face as they look towards the future of the EU: 1. thepursuit of further EU integration through the creation of a supranationalﬁscal and political union or 2. the beginning of a process of political andeconomic devolution towards smaller scale European projects.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): ECON 301.</P></Div><Div><P>ECON 418 - Personal Finance (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course focuses upon the application of economic theory to majorissues faced by consumers in our modern economy.

Political ecology is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld that situatesenvironmental change within broader networks of political, economic, andsocial relations. It differs from other environmental approaches in thatit views power, material nature, everyday struggles and practices, socialjustice, and discourse to be critical components of human-environmentinteractions. In this course, we will: (a) study the theoretical foundationsof political ecology, (b) evaluate some of the theses it puts forward,and (c) apply political ecology insights to contemporary environmentalissues.

The premise ofthe course is this: if you want to improve the state of the planet, youhave to propose a solution. To make a solution happen, you shouldunderstand the process of getting an idea through the decision-makingsystem. Effecting change requires a background in the system(s) thatmake things happen, whether you ultimately want to work within thesystem or outside it.

Yet we in the U.S. know very little about the foodsystem that sustains us – it is a mysterious and often invisible set ofprocesses, organizations, and people. This remarkably complex web ofinputs, labor, machinery, laws, subsidies, mergers, and so many othercomponents is one that we take largely for granted. This class seeksto align that reality with another: we are an intensely visual species. Acritical part of our existence that we experience through all of our sensesis one we fail to comprehend through our primary sense. And we havethis occasion to use sight in a formalized way – photography – to tellnew stories, and to bring an artistic sensibility to our understanding offood, and perhaps ourselves. Through imagery, writing, and the curatorialprocess of exhibiting our work in a public setting, we have a truly uniqueopportunity.

But what did these philosophers actuallybelieve? And why did they believe it? This course is an intermediate-levelsurvey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the “EarlyModern” or “Modern” era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). Whilethese and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley)in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostlyon their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophyof mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) toappreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical;b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation formuch of the modern—western, anyway—worldview; and c) to determine ifwhat they say is either true or false.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 250 - Philosophy of Law (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Does law have an intrinsic connection with the moral order, or is itwhatever a legislature or judge says it is?

It aims to equipstudents with the ethical frameworks and philosophical tools necessaryto effectively engage with the urgent questions posed by data-driventechnology in its various forms. Students will hone their understandingof the ethics of surveillance, scientiﬁc research, algorithmic bias, andpolicy decision-making. We will also investigate how familiar moralnotions like privacy, property, fairness, and equality are challenged orilluminated by computational tools and the advent of novel possibilitiesfor data collection and analysis.

Both make us aware of assumptions we make in our everydaylives and challenge us to justify them. This course examines ways inwhich feminist theory enriches philosophy and vice versa. Feministcriticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophicalassumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the worldand other people. How does feminism destabilize philosophy and affectphilosophical conceptions of knowledge, reality, metaphysics, agency,or morality? How does philosophy enrich feminist understandings ofoppression, privilege, or equality? We will consider a range of formsof oppression and privilege, particularly as they affect women, andconceptions of sex, gender, and race in the context of debates aboutgender violence, work and family, as well as feminist discussions ofepistemology, ethics, and science.

Philosophicalthought about technology suggests that the situation may well benot only far more complex, but radically different. Life without thetechnologies we use daily can seem unimaginable. Yet those verysame technologies raise profound political, social, and ecologicalconcerns. Some authors have argued that technological advances inﬁelds such as computing, medicine, robotics, and artiﬁcial intelligence arefundamentally changing (or have already fundamentally changed) whoand what we are by making us post- or transhuman. This course posesquestions such as: Does technology affect us in merely superﬁcial ormore fundamental ways? Has our technology made us fundamentallydifferent from our ancestors? Are there essential differences betweentypes of technology (hand tools, “simple” machines, cybernetic devices,so-called “smart” technologies, etc.)? How is technology related topolitics?

Many existentialists embrace a viewcharacterized with the slogan “existence precedes essence.” This sloganmeans that any attempt to ﬁgure out what one is must begin with thefact that one is. In addition, if existence precedes essence, then theremay well be a multiplicity of ways that one can be, making choosingbetween these ways a difﬁcult task. That one’s existence may well beexperienced as constrained by social forces seemingly beyond one’scontrol complicates matters. We will read from a variety of sources,including philosophical sources such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre,de Beauvoir, or Judith Butler as well as literary or biographical sources,e.g., Beckett, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, and others.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): One previous course in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 299 - Intermediate Topics in Philosophy (1-4 Credit Hours)</P><P>A general category used only in the evaluation of transfer credit.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 305 - Metaphysics (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is an introduction to the methodology of and various issueswithin metaphysics. Typically, these questions address certain generalfeatures about the nature of reality. Many of these are ontological,concerning whether certain kinds of entities exist—e.g., numbers, holes,ﬁctional characters, gods, and possibilities. Other metaphysical questionsconcern the nature and interrelations among entities and various featuresof the world. Among the familiar metaphysical issues are debatesregarding the nature of human beings, the reality of space and time,the limits of thought and possibility, and the connection between truthand existence. Readings will be drawn from a mix of contemporary andclassical sources. Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy orconsent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 306 - Theories of Knowledge (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>An inquiry into the meaning, possibility, conditions, criteria, and typesof truth and/or knowledge, and a discussion of representative theoriesof knowledge.

What should we value? and What type of person shouldwe be? Yet, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to thesequestions and decide among them only if we correctly answer anotherset of questions ﬁrst. For instance, how can we know what we shouldvalue unless we understand what values are, whether they exist andwhether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we oughtto act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally goodor why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the ﬁrstplace? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. Itinquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments andattitudes. As such, it draws on many other areas of philosophy, includingepistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): Two previous courses in Philosophy or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 326 - Theories of Justice (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course focuses on contemporary work in political philosophyconcerned with justice, including that of philosophers such as Rawls,Dworkin, Nozick, Young, MacIntyre, Sandel, Nussbaum, and Habermas.We will examine questions such as: What is justice? Can it be deﬁnedindependently of consideration of what the &quot;good&quot; is for human beings?Is justice possible in a society marked by signiﬁcant religious, ethnic,cultural or other sorts of pluralisms? What is the relation betweenjustice and nationhood, and what can be said about justice betweennations? How is justice connected to social equality, and to liberty?What is meant by economic justice? What is the relation between justiceand democracy? The course will examine contemporary philosophicaldebates about these questions, in order to help students think criticallyabout the issue of justice in the context of the pressing real world issuesin which such questions play a crucial role.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): PHIL 126 or PHIL 250, and one other philosophy course,or consent.</P></Div><Div><P>PHIL 330 - Nineteenth-Century Philosophy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course examines some of the most important developments inEuropean philosophy during the nineteenth century.

This tradition can be distinguished in a number ofways. Methodologically, it tends to employ careful argumentationand formal tools like logic and mathematics to provide analyses ofscientiﬁc, psychological, and linguistic data. Historically, it is usuallytraced back to a group of Anglo-European philosophers—Frege, Russell,Moore, and Wittgenstein—writing around the beginning of the twentiethcentury.

In thiscourse we will consider the politics that underlie the development andoperation of the contemporary Congress, detail the legislative processand its organization. We will consider how various institutions such asparties, committees, and procedures help legislators reach their goalsand help solve problems such as collective action, voting cycles, andambition. While we begin by looking at Congress at its inception andthe electoral goals of members, the course will quickly move to thedevelopment of these institutions and in the early Twentieth Century(pre-1974) and their use today. Over the course of the semester, we willapply our institutional study of Congress to current events and througha multi-week simulation of the legislative process.

Political organization,however, by most accounts has been the engine and structure ofAmerican democracy throughout its two centuries. Parties, interestgroups, and social movements have formed and acted to create andinsure that American democracy truly is of, by, and for the people. In thecourse, we will investigate the formation, maintenance, and death ofpolitical organizations, the effectiveness and representative nature ofpolitical organizations, the strategies and resources of organizations,as well as recent challenges by such factors as increased individualism,media, technology and money.

Gender gaps in opinion, the double-bound treatment of publicofﬁcials, the exercise of power, political opportunities, and imbalances inrole models, not to mention differences in socialization and psychologyall shape what amounts to the political “gender system.” In this course,we will dig into how political power is sought and utilized through agendered lens that lays bare essential questions of equality in developedsocieties. To gain an appreciation for equal representation and our role inachieving it, we need to understand the nature of bias and the individual,social, and institutional forces that contribute to and help alleviate thatbias.

After a period of post-war stability,European party systems began to break down in the 1960s. This led toseveral new developments, namely, a decline in democratic participation;a decline in the traditional parties of the center Left and center Right; andthe emergence of new parties on both the Left and the Right. This coursefocuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in WesternEurope during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on whatmany scholars label the &quot;far&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; right. These parties tend to beorganized around a particular set of ideological concepts emphasizingnationalism, exclusion of &quot;foreigners,&quot; a strong state, welfare chauvinismand, more recently, Islamophobia. Over the course of the semesterstudents will compare and contrast the emergence of these parties andtheir politics across Europe and discern the differences between whatscholars describe as &quot;populist radical&quot; or &quot;populist far&quot; right parties fromother parties on the extreme right, namely neofascist or neo-Nazis partieswhich are viewed as inherently undemocratic and often elitist.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 328 - Politics of the Environment (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>This course is about the theoretical, political, and practical problemsassociated with environmental action.

Internationalorganizations are formal institutions established by states to addressglobal problems. They include not only the United Nations, but alsomany other public or private, international, national or local, formal orinformal institutions. Collectively, these institutions engage in globalgovernance. Our goals in this course are to understand the theoreticaland practical approaches to international organizations and globalgovernance, the limitations under which global governance operates, andthe future prospects for a system of global governance.

Why is itthat we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries whichhave been the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years?Are these countries &quot;middle powers&quot; or &quot;big powers&quot;? What role do theyplay in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the &quot;three big&quot; can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 349 - Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since thebeginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorismdates only from the French Revolution (1789-1799). In this course, wewill explore what terrorism is, whether it is new (and why some analystsargue it is), who uses terrorist tactics, why they do so, and how terrorismdiffers from other forms of political violence such as war, insurgency, andso on. We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholarsthink that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorismas planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We willcompare the various deﬁnitions and perspectives to determine whichmight work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, wewill focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science andhow they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, andthe media.</P></Div><Div><P>POSC 353 - Russian Foreign and Military Policy (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>In this course we will seek to understand the motives and objectivesof Russian foreign and military policies.

This coursefocuses on the newer parties on the Right that emerged in WesternEurope during the 1980's and 1990's. Speciﬁcally we focus on whatmany scholars label the &quot;far&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; right.

Why is it that weknow so little about the foreign policies of three countries which havebeen the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years? Arethese countries &quot;middle powers&quot; or &quot;big powers&quot;? What role do they playin the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the &quot;three big&quot; can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system.</P><P>Prerequisite(s): PPA 201 or consent of instructor.</P></Div><Div><P>PPA 349 - Terrorism and Political Violence (4 Credit Hours)</P><P>Political violence, including terrorism, has been around since thebeginnings of organized political society, though the word terrorismdates only from the French Revolution (1789-1799).

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis.

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis.

As a foundational object and document forso many public social projects – including ones we might describe as“secular” – the Bible is much more than a religious book. It is an emblemof authority and power more generally, and the ways certain kinds ofauthorities (religious or otherwise), are often engaged less for theircontent than for what we imagine them to contain.

But what is seento be “broken” and how to “ﬁx” it are always culturally and historicallyspeciﬁc; and they change with time. What’s more, our diagnoses forsuffering or illnesses (what we might think of as interruptions) oftensay as much about the cultural context and historical moment in whichpeople live as they do about any strictly physiological or psychologicalexperience. This course explores a range of themes around bodilywholeness and bodily breakdown in contemporary worlds and in theancient world (including ancient Christian literature, ancient medicalliterature, and ancient practices around illness and healing). It askshow ancient people understood their symptoms and their illnesses inrelationship to the larger social body and divine beings, comparing thesenotions with contemporary assumptions and practices. It tracks the waybody, psyche and society are not always easily distinguished, and theway religion in the contemporary world ﬁgures, sometimes invisibly, indiagnosis and treatment. For example, we will explore depression as asymptom of socio-political life, tracking its history before the modern era,including its associations with “sin”; and we will observe how Christianreligious morality framed and exacerbated the AIDS crisis.
