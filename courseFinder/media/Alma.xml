<H4>Vision Statement </H4>

<P>An Alma College education seeks to instill a love of learning and celebrate the joy of discovery. Each Alma student will experience a deeply interdisciplinary education that provides opportunity for self-reflection, hands-on learning, and personal and professional development. It will embrace the principle of local, national and global learning communities, build upon strong mentoring relationships, and integrate rapidly changing technology essential for current and future career paths. </P>

<P>The Core Values </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Student-centered education in a residential setting </H4>

<Sect>
<P>All members of the community — faculty, staff and trustees — are committed to creating an institution of quality centered on the growth and development of undergraduate students. The purpose of the residential college experience is to better prepare students to enter seamlessly into lives in community, vocation, family and faith. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Disciplinary expertise within an interdisciplinary context of learning </H4>

<P>The Alma Experience expects students to apply intellectual rigor to the exploration of a range of disciplines, building a broad foundation in the sciences, humanities, fine and performing arts and social sciences. This liberal arts education also prepares students to pursue advanced work, independent research and creative performances with the depth of understanding to </P>

<Sect>
<P>excel in one’s discipline and to perceive the connections among disciplines. The practical </P>

<P>knowledge and skills of the liberal arts prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership </P>

<P>within a wide array of settings. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Engaged learning </H4>

<Sect>
<P>Because education takes place everywhere and all the time, it is important both to create an exciting residential learning environment and to extend opportunities for significant learning into the community and wider world. Active participation in learning, engaged citizenship, service-driven leadership and committed stewardship are fostered through research-based undergraduate scholarship as well as programs that support experiential, international and service-learning opportunities. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Ethical integrity, aesthetic appreciation, spiritual sensitivity </H4>

<P>With knowledge comes obligation. To live a complete life that withstands the scrutiny of self and others, individuals must exhibit personal integrity, respect for the value of all humanity and sensitivity to the spiritual and material beauty of one’s existence. We expect these principles to be modeled in the educational programs, work and daily interactions of all members of the college community. </P>

<H2>Alma College in Brief </H2>

<Sect>
<H4>A Liberal Arts Education </H4>

<P>More than 130 years ago, a group of devoted Presbyterian clergy and laymen had a dream: to establish a liberal arts college based upon the loftiest of ideals — unifying the human mind and spirit through knowledge. </P>

<P>The essence of a liberal arts education is learning how to learn. Once acquired, this skill can be applied </P>

<P>to any task, any profession. Career success is determined by our abilities to exercise such skill. The college’s </P>

<P>membership in Phi Beta Kappa is an indication of excellence in the liberal arts. Only 10 percent of colleges and universities share this distinction. </P>

<P>A liberal arts education holds up a mirror to the world around us, and in its reflection we see ourselves: as we were, as we are, as we might be. Through such self-discovery comes inspiration and, from inspiration, lifelong commitment. The highest moral and ethical character is built upon such foundations. Our best leaders are shaped by such beliefs. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Academic Programs and Degrees </H4>

<P>Alma is classified as a selective Baccalaureate College — Arts and Sciences by the Carnegie Foundation </P>

<P>for the Advancement of Teaching. The College confers bachelor’s degrees in five areas: arts, sciences, fine </P>

<P>arts, music and nursing. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Religious Affiliation </H4>

<P>Alma College, affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), affirms its Christian heritage in which all people are made in the image of God. We seek to foster a diverse community by welcoming people of all faiths, as well as those with no faith tradition, into the Alma College experience. Founded by Presbyterians in 1886, Alma is a highly regarded four-year liberal arts college. Though it is church affiliated, the college does not make religious affiliation or doctrinal uniformity a condition for admission or employment. Our heritage affirms that faith and critical thinking reinforce each other. We are committed to cultivating intellectual, spiritual, and vocational discovery in all aspects of campus life. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Scholarship and Assistance Opportunities </H4>

<P>To recognize students’ academic achievements in high school, Alma College administers a strong program of scholarships. Regardless of financial need, Alma students can receive scholarship support based on outstanding academic achievements. </P>

<P>Also available are State of Michigan scholarships, grants and loans; federal grants and loans; and federal and College work study program funding. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Undergraduate Research </H4>

<P>Alma students are often invited to team up with faculty on scholarly research or to collaborate on creative or performing arts projects. An annual Honors Day features student presentations, performances and exhibits. Many students also present such work at regional, national and international meetings. </P>

<H2>Academic Rules and Procedures </H2>

<Sect>
<H4>Academic Advising Program </H4>

<P>Upon admission to Alma College, each student is assigned a faculty advisor on the basis of academic and career interests. Working with this advisor, students plan their courses and evaluate their progress. For those students who are uncertain about their interests, advisors are specially selected who can assist them in exploring and establishing a career direction through a well-developed plan of coursework and co-curricular experiences. </P>

<P>Students’ academic goals may also change during the course of </P>

<P>their college careers. Accordingly, students may change advisors at any time, especially when an academic major is declared. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Conditions of Enrollment </H4>

<P>Registration. Returning students usually select courses during the registration period in the preceding term. Newly admitted students make course selections during Becoming A Scot Days. The selections are then reviewed with their faculty advisors during Orientation week, at which time the schedule may be adjusted. </P>

<P>Changes in Registration. Students must file changes through </P>

<P>the approval process with the Registrar’s Office. Courses may be </P>

<P>added during the first week of each term if approved by the advisor and during the second week if approved by both the advisor and the instructor. No courses, except for those scheduled for the last seven weeks of the term, may be added after the second week. </P>

<P>Withdrawal. Withdrawal from an individual class may occur through the ninth week of a 14-week course, the fifth week of a seven-week course, or the third week of a four-week course. </P>

<P>Neither the course nor the withdrawal will appear on the student’s </P>

<P>record. Please refer to the Alma College Academic Calendar for specific course add and drop dates. </P>

<P>Class Load. The class load for a 14-week term shall be no less than 13 and no more than 18 credits for full-time status. Students who wish to qualify for full benefits from the Veterans Administration, Social Security or other financial aid sources are advised to enroll for not less than 13 credits. Athletes should be aware that the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association requires a 13-credit load for eligibility. </P>

<P>Class Attendance Requirements. Class attendance requirements are set by each individual instructor. Among the options available is mandatory attendance, with absences resulting in a lower grade. Faculty members who do not implement a mandatory attendance policy will take measures to combat a common student misconception — that if attendance is not required (with penalties attached), it is not important. To this end, the syllabi for all classes will explicitly state the attendance policy. </P>

<P>Commencement Attendance. Seniors are required to participate in Commencement unless excused by the Provost or the Registrar. </P>

<P>Final Examination Schedule. The Final Examination Schedule is established by the Registrar and published at the beginning of each term. Instructors will announce testing plans in the course syllabus; the final test or activity (presentation, paper, etc.) must be at the officially-scheduled time. Make-up examinations are given only with the permission of the instructor and may be charged a fee. </P>

<P>Withdrawal from College. Students who wish to withdraw from Alma College must complete the withdrawal process by contacting the Center for Student Opportunity. If this process is not completed, students will forfeit their deposits and refunds. The College assumes that students beginning a term intend to complete it. Students who leave during a term without completing the withdrawal process may receive failing grades for course enrollments. </P>

<P>Service members who must withdraw during the term due tounanticipated deployments or mobilization, activation, and/or temporary duty assignments may have the option to complete the term offcampus, if feasible. The student would need to consult with facultymembers and the Registrar’s Office to review the options available. </P>

<P>If completion of the term is not an option, students withdrawing would be assigned non-punitive grades of “W” (for “withdraw”)for the term. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Grading Practices </H4>

<P>Grading System. The following letters and grade points are used to record evaluations of student work: “A” (4.0); “AB” (3.5); “B” (3.0); “BC” (2.5); “C” (2.0); “CD” (1.5); “D” (1.0); “DE” (0.5); and “E” (0.0 — failing). An “E” will be recorded for such reasons (other than failure to meet course requirements) as dishonesty, excessive absence or failure to comply with other conditions specified by the instructor. </P>

<P>Incomplete Grades. Incomplete (“IN”) grades must be replaced by letter grades within six weeks after the end of the term or they automatically convert to “E.” </P>

<P>Work in Progress. Work in Progress (“IP”) must be successfully completed and graded within one year of the date of enrollment, or the grade automatically converts to “E” unless the instructor initiates Withdrawal Pass (“WP”) or Withdrawal Fail (“WF”). Work in Progress grades may be used only for independent study or practicum courses. A grade of “Z” is assigned by the Registrar when a grade has not been received from an instructor. </P>

<P>Satisfactory Grade Option. Students may elect the Satisfactory Grade Option (“S” or “F”) by filing the approved form with the </P>

<P>instructor’s consent at the Registrar’s Office before the deadline </P>

<P>to drop the class. If the student elects this option, evaluation of the course work is recorded as “S” (equivalent to a “C” or better) or as “F” (failing, no credit). Neither grade is computed in the GPA. </P>

<P>Application of the “S/F” option is limited as described below: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>It is available only to students of sophomore, junior or senior standing. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>No more than 16 credits may apply to the 136-156 required for the degree. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>No more than six credits per term may be elected under this option. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>No course counting for a Teaching Major or Minor and no education course presented for teacher certification may be graded using this option. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>No more than four credits of the 36 required for the major (or six credits of the 56 required for an interdepartmental major or POE) may be graded under this option. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Some classes are graded only “S” or “F” and the student has no option. Credits earned for these courses are not subject to the limitations described above. </P>

<P>Grade Reports. Grade Reports are made available to all students on the student portal at the end of each term and to first-year students and sophomores at mid-term. </P>

<P>Appeal of Grades. Appeal of grades may be made when the student has evidence that the final grade is unfair, but the appeal must be made not later than six months after the recording of the initial grade. The appeal proceeds first to the instructor, then to thedepartment chair, and, if the disagreement still stands, it may go to the Provost. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Academic Progress </H4>

<P>Classification of Students. Students admitted to Alma College may earn degree credits. If enrolled in a full class load, students will be certified as regularly enrolled students and classification will be based on the number of credits earned: freshman (0-24); sophomore (25-55); junior (56-89); or senior (90 plus). Eligibility for some forms of financial aid may depend upon progress toward the degree as indicated by these classifications. </P>

<P>ACADEMIC RULES AND PROCEDURES </P>

<P>Probation and Dismissal. Students must achieve a 2.0 GPA to graduate. Students with less than a 2.0 GPA will be placed on probation and may be dismissed or barred from registration whenever such action is considered to be in the best interest of the student or the College. </P>

<P>Probation Guidelines. The Probation Guidelines in the chart below are based on an ascending scale of grade point deficiencies and the number of terms enrolled in college. Normal progress is defined as any condition above unsatisfactory progress (i.e., jeopardy). </P>

<P>Only students who are making unsatisfactory progress will be subject to restrictions on athletic eligibility, extracurricular activitiesand/or financial aid eligibility. Students will qualify for the recommended status when either the GPA equals or falls below, or the grade point deficiency equals or exceeds, the posted criteria. </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>Academic Dismissal. Academic dismissal constitutes involuntary separation of the student from the College for a minimum of one Fall or Winter term. Re-enrollment, on academic jeopardy, is contingent upon approval of the Academic Standards Committee. Approval typically will be granted upon evidence of improved performance in academic work as demonstrated by successful (cumulative 3.0 or higher) completion of the equivalent of 13 credits of coursework which meets the requirements for transfer credits. In no case will a student be readmitted for the regular term succeeding the term in which the student was dismissed. First-term freshmen and first-term transfer students are not subject to academic dismissal. </P>

<P>Academic Jeopardy. Academic Jeopardy represents “unsatisfactory progress toward the degree” for determining eligibility for such programs as intercollegiate athletics and financial aid. Unsatisfactory progress also results from failure to complete credits according to this schedule: first year — 25; second year — 56; third year </P>

<P>— 90; fourth year — 110; and fifth year — 136. Students who are subject to this level of probation may re-enroll at Alma College in a subsequent term according to the conditions as follows: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Arrangement with the academic advisor of a plan for improving academic performance to include repetition of classes, change of academic program, participation in the academic enrichment program, weekly meetings with the advisor to monitor progress and/or reduction of course load. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Agreement to the restriction of participation in extracurricular activities including varsity athletics, Greek societies, community government and/or hours of employment. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Completion of an interview with an administrator in the Center for Student Opportunity to verify understanding of and compliance with these conditions prior to re-enrollment. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>First-term transfer students will qualify for jeopardy status according to the criteria for first-term freshmen. After the first term of enrollment at Alma, however, the published guidelines will apply. </P>

<P>Academic Probation and Warning. Academic Probation and Warning are categories of probation which should warrant the </P>

<P>student’s concern, but are not subject to the extracurricular </P>

<P>restrictions cited above. Eligibility for some forms of financial aid, however, may be affected. </P>

<P>Right of Appeal. Individuals or groups affected directly by committee actions or decisions have the right to appeal such actions or decisions by submitting dissenting reports first to the committee, and second to the Faculty Organization and/or Student Congress (except in those cases where appeal procedures are delineated in the description of committee functions.) </P>

<P>Notification of these actions will be sent from the Office of the Provost to the student after review by the Academic Standards Committee of the faculty. </P>

<P>In accordance with Veterans Administration regulations,students who receive VA benefits and remain on probation for two consecutive terms will be deemed ineligible for further VA certification. To qualify again for VA benefits, such students must achieve a 2.0 GPA. </P>
</Sect>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Other Procedures </H4>

<P>Academic Minors. Students may obtain a minor in some fields of study. The minor must be a concentration of at least 24 credits including the requirements listed by the department. Every24-credit concentration does not constitute a minor; to qualify, it must be approved by the department on a minor declaration form </P>

<P>available at the Registrar’s Office. </P>

<P>The GPA in the area of the minor concentration must be at least 2.0 (“C”). </P>

<P>Repetition of Coursework. Repetition of coursework is permitted. In each case, the most recent effort is counted. Each effort is </P>

<P>recorded on the student’s permanent record. Students may repeat </P>

<P>a course that they passed previously to try to improve the original grade; however, no additional credits will be earned for the repeat. </P>

<P>Waiver Petitions. To secure waiver of College policies or requirements, students may petition the Academic Standards Committee. Comments from the advisor and other concerned parties are often required before the petition will be reviewed. There is no charge for the petition process. Petition forms are available in the </P>

<P>Registrar’s Office. </P>

<P>Academic Dishonesty. Appropriate disciplinary action, including possible separation from the College, will be taken when students engage in plagiarism; the exchange of information on examinations; assisting or receiving assistance in the completion of an examination, the writing of an essay or the preparation of a laboratory report; or any other attempt to obtain deceptively an unearned grade. </P>

<P>Disciplinary Procedures. Disciplinary action following academic dishonesty is handled initially by the faculty member in whose class the offense occurred, who may impose penalties up to and including failure in the course. (Note: A student may not drop a course in which he or she has been failed for cheating.) All infractions and actions are to be reported to, and recorded in, the Provost’s Office. These cases are then reviewed by the Provost, who, especially in the case of repeated offenses, may apply more severe penalties than those imposed by the instructor. Finally, the Provost may refer cases to the Campus Judicial Committee, which may impose penalties up to and including suspension or expulsion from the College. </P>

<P>Appeals Procedures. A student may appeal the instructor’s decision to the Provost. The student may appeal the Provost’s decision to the Campus Judicial Committee. </P>

</LI>
</L>

<P>Payment of tuition and fee charges can be made with cash, personal checks, bank drafts, or money orders.

<P>Payment must be received by the College prior to registration, or the student will have to make payment at the Financial Services Office during registration. Students are not permitted to attend class without making satisfactory financial arrangements. </P>

<P>COLLEGE EXPENSES </P>

<P>Account Holds. A student’s account is placed on a financial hold </P>

<P>for the following reasons: </P>

<P>1. The student has withdrawn or graduated and has not paid their account balance in full. Until the account balance is paid in full, </P>

<P>a student’s transcript and/or diploma cannot be released. </P>

<P>2. The student is an active, current student with an account balance of $1,000 or higher. An active, current student is not able to register or be placed in (or retain) a housing assignment for a future term until the account is under $1,000. Default </P>

<P>of the repayment plan may result in loss of the student’s </P>

<P>registration and housing assignment. Late Payment Fees. Tuition and fees are due before classes start </P>

<P>for each term. A late payment fee of $25 per month is assessed on student accounts with a past due balance. Failure to Meet Financial Obligations. In accordance with stan</P>

<P>dard practice at colleges and universities, students are required to make satisfactory arrangements with the Financial Services Office for the settlement of all financial obligations. These include student accounts, student loans, parking fines, library fines, music record rentals and other expenses. </P>

<P>When a student fails to meet financial obligations, Alma College reserves the right to withhold the issuance of grades, transcripts and diplomas, and to suspend a student until the obligations are met. Unpaid balances on inactive student accounts will be referred to a collection agency. The student has responsibility for all costs and fees associated with the collection of the debt. </P>

<P>Financial Aid. Any financial aid other than a work-study grant awarded by the College for the entire year will be prorated; 50% to be available Fall Term and 50% to be available Winter Term. A work-study grant may not be deducted from charges because this aid represents funds to be earned during the year. Scholarships and grants awarded by organizations other than Alma College will not be credited until actually received. The Director of Financial Aid must be notified of any scholarship or grant awarded by organizations and agencies other than Alma College. You may review all financial aid policies at https://www.alma.edu/admissions/financialaid/policies/ as it is your responsibility to be familiar with situations that may affect your financial aid. </P>

<P>Refund of Federal Title IV Financial Aid. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 mandates the formula for calculating the amount of financial aid a student and school may retain when a student withdraws from all classes before completing 60% of the term. Under Title IV financial aid regulations, the withdrawal date is defined as the earlier of: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>The date the student began the withdrawal process or officially notified the institution of the intent to withdraw, or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>The student’s last date of documented attendance at an </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>academically-related activity. If a student stops attending and </P>

<P>fails to officially withdraw from classes, the student is consid</P>

<P>ered to be unofficially withdrawn. </P>

<P>Unofficial withdrawal dates are determined by an end-of-term </P>

<P>report from the Registrar’s Office to identify students who have no </P>

<P>passing grades. Faculty are contacted to determine the last date of attendance or academic activity for a student and that date is used as the withdrawal date. </P>

<P>If there is no proof of attendance beyond 60% completion of the term, the student is considered unofficially withdrawn and a refund calculation is performed. </P>

<P>Section 484B (c) of the HEA states that it is the institution’s responsibility to determine a student’s withdrawal date. Therefore, the institution, not the student, must document a student’s attendance at an academically related activity. A student’s certification of attendance</P>

<P>that is not supported by documentation by the institution would not</P>

<P>be acceptable documentation of the student’s attendance. </P>

<P>The percentage of Title IV assistance earned is determined by dividing the total number of calendar days in the semester into the number of calendar days completed as of the withdrawal date. Any unearned aid must be returned to the Title IV program(s). Funds are returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Subsidized Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, Pell Grant, SEOG and other Title IV programs. The student must either repay the federal overpayment in full or make satisfactory arrangements with either the Alma College Financial Services Office or the federal Department of Education. The payment or arrangement for payment must be made within 45 days of the date of notification of the federal overpayment or the student will lose further eligibility of federal Title IV aid until the debt is paid in full. </P>

<P>Withdrawal from College Refund Policy. Tuition and the student activity fee are refunded according to the following table. </P>

<Sect>
<H6>Refunds for Fall and Winter Terms </H6>

<P>Withdrawal During Percentage of Calendar Week No. Tuition Refundable 1 90% 2 85% 3 80% 4 70% 5 65% 6 60% 7 50% 8 45% 9 40% 10 and after No Refund </P>

<P>College scholarships, grants and/or loans received by the student will be refunded on a comparable percentage basis. </P>

<P>Refunds for other non-College financial aid will be made in accordance with the rules and regulations applicable to those programs. </P>

<P>Withdrawal from College. Students who wish to withdraw from Alma College must complete the withdrawal process by contactingthe Center for Student Opportunity. If this process is not completed,students will forfeit their deposits and refunds. The College assumesthat students beginning a term intend to complete it. Students wholeave during a term without completing the withdrawal process mayreceive failing grades for course enrollments and will be responsible for any tuition, and room and board charges for the term. If astudent has registered for a future term and decides not to attendthat term, the student must contact the CSO to formally withdrawand be removed from those classes. Failure to do so will result in the student being responsible to pay for tuition, fees, and room andboard for the term, in its entirety. </P>

<P>Course Fees. Course fees are assessed for courses that incur unusual or extra expense. These expenditures are made on the basis of course registrations. Therefore, no refund is allowed for these fees. </P>

<P>Overload Charges. Full refunds will be made for overload charges up to the second Friday of the term. No refunds for overloads will be allowed after that time. </P>

<H4>Alma College Credit </H4>

<P>Alma College defines its credit hour in the context of the 4-4-1 calendar, just as institutions using semester systems link their credits to that calendar. The credit value of Alma courses is measured by “the Alma College 4-4-1 Credit Hour,” hereafter referred to as an “Alma credit.” </P>

<P>An Alma credit is equivalent to 120/136 – or, rounded to nearest tenth, .9 –  of a semester credit hour. It is likewise equivalent to 136/108 –or, rounded, 1.3 – of a quarter credit hour. These equivalences are used when calculating compliance with the federal definition of the credit hour (34CFR 600.2): </P>

<P>A credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended </P>

<P>learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achieve</P>

<P>ment that is an institutionally-established equivalency that </P>

<P>reasonably approximates not less than: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>(1) </Lbl>

<LBody>One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or 10–12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>(2) </Lbl>

<LBody>At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other activities as established by an institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading toward the award of credit hours. </LBody>
</LI>

</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Area of Concentration </H4>

<P>Each student must declare an area of concentration before the end of the sophomore year by filing the approved form with the Registrar’s Office. This area of concentration may be a Departmental Major (at least 36 credits as prescribed by the department), an Interdepartmental Major (56 credits in courses approved by two or more departments and the Educational Policy Committee), or a Program of Emphasis [POE] (56–68 credits in courses selected by the student to meet a specific educational goal as approved by the POE Committee no later than November 15 of the junior year). </P>

<P>The GPA in the area of concentration must be at least 2.0 (“C”)for the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees. For the Bachelor ofFine Arts degree, a 3.0 GPA in the major is required. For teachercertification purposes, a 2.75 GPA is required for all coursework.For additional certification requirements please see the EducationDepartment section of this catalog. Courses outside the area ofconcentration must total 68 credits. </P>

<Sect>
<H4>Comprehensive Evaluation </H4>

<P>Most departments require graduating seniors to complete a comprehensive evaluation. Departments will determine the form of the comprehensive evaluation and may require students to take a nationally normed test, such as the Graduate Record Examination. Regardless of the form of the evaluation, the department shall determine the minimum criteria for passing with distinction, passing and failing. </P>

<P>Departments have the discretion to require satisfactory performance on a comprehensive evaluation for completion of the major. Results of evaluations that are non-credit bearing will not be recorded on the student’s transcript. </P>

<P>Failure of the comprehensive evaluation will not affect degree status unless a department specifies that successful completion is necessary to satisfy major requirements. Students may retake the comprehensive evaluation only with the permission of the department (or in the case of a POE, the POE Subcommittee of the Educational Policy Committee of the faculty). Only the results of the most recent effort will be recorded. </P>

<H4>Composition </H4>

<P>Students are urged to complete the first year writing coursein their first year and are required to have done so by graduation.During orientation, they receive a recommendation about whether totake the transition course in writing, ENG 100, or the first year writing course, ENG 101, and discuss the recommendation with theiradvisors. This recommendation is based on the student’s responsesto a short questionnaire and their standardized writing test scores. </P>

<P>As a requirement for graduation, each student will successfully complete 16 credits of designated Quill writing courses. These credits will include ENG 101 (or its equivalent) during the first year of residency, as well as at least one upper level Quill course (2 or </P>

<P>4 credits) in the student’s major field of study. </P>

<P>By definition, a Quill course is designed to improve the quality of student writing. To qualify as a Quill course, at least 25 percent of the final course grade must be based on written work, and at least 15 percent of the final course grade must be based on written work that has been submitted, evaluated, revised and resubmitted for final evaluation.

<P>Program Considerations for Art History Minor </P>

<P> Students who have had little or no studio experience are strongly encouraged to complete at least one studio course from the 100-200 level series. </P>

<P> Because graduate programs in Art History typically require proficiency in at least two foreign languages, students who are considering advanced studies in this discipline should plan to include at least four terms of foreign language coursework in their curriculum. </P>

<P> A Program of Emphasis (P.O.E.) in Art History or in Arts or Gallery Management is also available in consultation with the Art History faculty. Art History courses are supplemented with other appropriate courses in coordinate disciplines (Business, Anthropology, History, Religious Studies, etc.). Each P.O.E. is tailored to the student's particular interests and goals. </P>

<P> Completion of a senior thesis is strongly encouraged if student is considering graduate school. </P>

<P>Transfer Credits in Studio Art </P>

<P>Up to three studio art courses may be included in the major by transfer from an accredited institution. Transfer of upper level studio work will require Departmental review. </P>

<P>3.  Successful completion of CHM-450 </P>

<P>Program Considerations  Potential majors are advised to schedule MTH-121 and 122 and PHY-121 and 122 (or PHY-112 and 113) in the freshman and sophomore years so they may enroll in CHM-331 and 332 in the junior year.  Completion of an independent research project normally culminating in a senior thesis is recommended. Students bound for graduate school should make careful course selections to support their particular area of emphasis; participation in research, completion of CHM-313, 314 and 411, MTH-210 and 211 should be considered.  Experience with calculus based physics (PHY- 121 and 122) is preferred over PHY-112 and 113.  Students bound for medical school should elect CHM-115 in the fall of the freshman year so that BCM-321 can be completed in advance of taking the MCAT at the end of the Junior year (CHM-115, 223, 224, 230 and BIO-121 are prerequisites to BCM-321).  To be a competitive medical school applicant, the Chemistry Department strongly recommends students completing a Chemistry major also take genetics and physiology, in addition to considering upper level electives from Biology, Biochemistry or Integrated Physiology and Health Science. </P>

SO 4 cr UL Perhaps the key intellectual movement to signal the dawn of the modern world, the European Enlightenment is known as an &quot;age of reason&quot; that  spanned the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and dismantled religion as the dominant force in  European societies. But by no means did the Enlightenment spell the end of belief or  superstition. Through sources from the period, we examine the ideas of several famous individuals,  each of whom contributed and reacted to the  European Enlightenment. While this course centers  on development taking place in Europe, we also  will devote some attention to the interaction  between Europe and the wider world.
