"

This course is designed to enhance students’ skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases.

1046,2011Cornell,ASRC 3508 African American Literature 1930s–Present (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. R. Richardson. In 1940, with the publication of his novel Native Son, Richard Wright helped to launch the protest era in African American literature. This course focuses on the development of key fiction and nonfiction genres that have shaped the development of African American literature from the mid-20th-century to the contemporary era. Genres that we will consider include poetry, fiction, the essay, the speech, autobiography, and the novel. We will explore the main periods in this literature’s development such as the Black Arts movement of the 1960s and the black women’s literary renaissance of the 1970s, and consider the rise of science fiction writing. Authors who will be considered include Richard Wright, Ann Petry, Ralph Ellison, Gwendolyn Brooks, James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry, Malcolm X, Amiri Baraka, Nikki Giovanni, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Ishmael Reed, and August Wilson.

Other major topics include class versus ethnicity in African politics; the one-party versus the multiparty state; sociocultural versus socioeconomic ideologies; the gender question in African politics; the soldier and the state; and the African political experience in a global context. "
1048,2011Cornell,"ASRC 3604 U.S. Education, Oppression, Resistance (SBA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. T. Gosa. Despite salient reductions in educational inequality over the past 30 years, the academic underachievement of Black, Latino/a, and Native American youth remains one of the most researched, yet stubborn social problems in American society. The goal of this course is to explore issues of race and ethnicity in American education. Students will be asked to consider the ways in which schools foster poor academic performance and devalue minority youth’s cultural and ethnic identities. Topics include school and residential segregation, academic tracking, language isolation, teacher quality, pedagogy and curriculum, and family/peer group influences. We will pay special attention to how students resist unfair schooling conditions and persist against the odds. The course will conclude with the limits and possibilities for school reform. "
1049,2011Cornell,HIST 4301) (HA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. R. Harris, Jr. From rebellions aboard slave ships through the quest for black self-determination, African Americans have sought to define freedom, justice, and equality for themselves and in the process have challenged the universality of the American Creed. This course will examine the dynamics of leadership, types of leaders, and the major movements that have emerged among African Americans from the early 17th century to the present. The relationship between leaders and followers, balance between ends and means, and measures of success and failure will be major concerns of the course. "
1050,2011Cornell,ASRC 4602 Women and Gender Issues in Africa @ (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. N. Assié-Lumumba. There are two contrasting views of the status and role of women in Africa. One view portrays African women as dominated and exploited by men. According to another view, women have a favorable social position in Africa: indigenous ideologies consider women to be the foundation of society, they are economically active and independent and they have an identity independent of men. In this seminar we discuss the status and role of women in Africa historically as well as in the contemporary period. Topics include women in nonwesternized/precolonial societies; the impact of colonial policies on the status of women; gender and access to schooling, participation in the economy and politics; women and the law; women and health issues; gender issues in southern Africa; womanism and feminism; the United Nations Decade of Women; and the four World Conferences on Women (Mexico 1975, Copenhagen 1986, Nairobi 1985, and Beijing 1995). "
1051,2011Cornell,ASRC 4605 Public Policy and the African-American Urban Community (SBA-AS) ,Spring. 4 credits. J. Turner. The socioeconomic conditions of the African-American urban community are the central focus of the course. Community development models are explored in relationship to the social needs of the African-American population. The changing configuration of internal organization of the African American community nationally is examined. 
1052,2011Cornell,ASRC 6301 African American Politics ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Turner. The central thesis of African American politics has been its movements for political change and democratic access and human rights. This development since the 17th century is a complex political legacy. This course conducts a close study of African American political practice and theoretical analysis of the American political system. Implications of the political systems for prospects and limitations to participation by Black people are analyzed. Critical historical stages in the process of Black politics are examined. The development of electoral offices in federal and statewide politics in critical industrial centers, as well as rural hamlets, center the course. Presidential politics—the Jesse Jackson campaigns—and new political formations including Black Republications/conservatives constitute the emphasis on contemporary events. The course reviews the development of the literature in African American politics. "
1053,2011Cornell,ASRC 6303 Nationalism and Decolonization in Africa ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Byfield. This course examines the rise of nationalism as well as the process and aims of decolonization in sub-Saharan Africa. It draws on films and a variety of primary and secondary materials in order to illuminate the complex and contested arenas from which African nationalisms emerged. Throughout the course we will examine the ways in which race, ethnicity, gender, and class shaped the discourse of nationalism as well as nationalist strategies and agendas. We will also explore the ways in which the conflicts and tensions of the nationalist period continue to shape post-colonial state and society. "
1054,2011Cornell,"ASRC 6305 Dress, Cloth, and Identity: Africa and the Diaspora ","Spring. 4 credits. J. Byfield. This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to examine the importance of textiles in African social and economic history. It combines art history, anthropology, social and economic history to explore the role of textiles in marking status, gender, political authority, and ethnicity. In addition, we examine the production and distribution of indigenous cloth and the consequences of colonial rule on African textile industries. Our analysis also considers the principles of African dress and clothing that shaped the African diaspora in the Americas as well as the more recent popularity and use of African fabrics and dress in the United States. "
1055,2011Cornell,ASRC 6306 Figures of Thought: Africana Intellectuals ,"Spring. 4 credits. G. Farred. The process by which intellectuals come to stand as such, as figures of thought, is the consequence of an often difficult, sometimes protracted process. In this course, we will focus on a small number of Africana intellectuals, including Saint Augustine, Frantz Fanon, Jacques Derrida, and Patrice Lumumba. We will read a range of primary and secondary texts in order to grapple with the question of how intellectuals are formed. To this end, we will read about the “failed” revolution aspired to by Lumumba, as well as taking a hard look at Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth as an anti-intellectual work. "
1056,2011Cornell,ASRC 6511 Middle Passage: Theorizing the African Diaspora ,"Spring. 4 credits. C. Boyce Davies. The Middle Passage is perhaps the most evocative and simultaneously the most painful of transitions any people have made. Whereas for many the passage to the Americas was loaded with expectation of freedom, for Africans the passage across the Atlantic was loaded with pain, loss, and separation. The Middle Passage (referred to as the Maafa) then becomes a journey of separation, dismemberment, and dislocation. But it was also on the Middle Passage, for those who survived, that the transformation into African Diaspora peoples began. This course examines a range of middle passage texts such as novels, poetry, film, drama, slave narratives, and historical texts in order to explore comparatively how artists from across the African Diaspora have approached this historically and emotionally loaded event. "
1057,2011Cornell,ASRC 6520 Thinking Heidegger ,"Fall. 4 credits. G. Farred. It is, of course, a truism to suggest that Martin Heidegger, more than any 20th-century philosopher, is preoccupied with thinking. It is, again, obviously, present in Was heist Denken? However, in a work such as The Principle of Reason there is a similar preoccupation with thinking. Not, as in Was heist Denken?, for its own sake, but as an integral part of Heidegger’s intellectual project. Using Heidegger as the central figure, this course will, additionally, think thinking the work of philosophers such as Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault. "
1058,2011Cornell,ASRC 6600 Education and Development in Africa ,"Spring. 4 credits. N. Assié-Lumumba. Human capital theory establishes a positive and linear relationship between formal education and individual productivity and socioeconomic attainment and economic growth and development of nations. While enjoying considerable popularity in industrial and developing countries, including African countries, education has also been perceived as a hindrance to development. The concept of human capital and paradigms of development including modernization, dependency, and Third World Forum are first introduced. Specific issues discussed include schooling and nonformal education; the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development; and language, access, output, and outcome based on social class, ethnicity, race, and gender. Employment, migration and international brain drain, the information and communication technologies, indigenous knowledge systems, and the role of higher education in regional and international cooperation are also examined. "
1059,2011Cornell,ASRC 6606 Politics of the Hip-Hop Generation ,"Spring. 4 credits. T. Gosa. This graduate seminar investigates the political dynamics of the hip-hop generation. The primary focus of this course will be the major political and economic forces that have shaped the worldview of Black and Latino/a youth born between 1965 and 1984. Students will critically address major topics surrounding hip-hop including race-ethnicity, gender and sexuality, social class, segregation/massincarceration, politics, and education. After reviewing the sociohistorical development of hip-hop, we will examine the role of hip-hop in modern black politics and activism, including its significance for mobilizing youth. Special attention will be given to the generational gap between the hip-hop generations and the Civil-Rights/Black Power parents. "
1060,2011Cornell,AMST 4311 Dissenting Patriots ,"Fall. 4 credits. N. Salvatore. This seminar examines the complex nature of dissent in America in the post-1945 decades. Our readings will look at dissenters, their ideas, and their movements across the political spectrum, with particular attention to how they legitimize their divergent political views. Requirements include weekly discussions, some short essays evaluating the common reading, and a term paper (about 25 pages) on a topic selected in consultation with me. There are no exams. (HI) "
1061,2011Cornell,AMST 1101 Introduction to American Studies # (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. B. Maxwell. This course is an introduction to interdisciplinary considerations of American culture. We will reflect on topics ranging from Native American relations to the land, to the European conquest of the Americas, to the development of American civic life and political culture and the ongoing African American struggle for freedom and equality. We will also study immigration as a (threatened) constant in national life and labor, the distinctions between mass culture and popular culture, the promise of American life, and violence as a persisting national woe. We’ll examine these themes through literature, historical writing, music, art, film, architecture, and political economy in the United States. The course will also give attention to the many methods through which scholars have, over time, developed the discipline of American Studies, and to ongoing debates over the intellectual and political stakes of those methods. (LT) "
1062,2011Cornell,AMST 1143 Space Cowboys: The ’60s Hero (HA-AS) ,"Summer only. 4 credits. J. Pickett. The close of World War II marks the beginning of America’s ascendancy to unrivaled prosperity and political power. But it also marks the beginning of an American self-examination whose fiercest discontent found expression in the 1960s, in part through the youth movement. We’ll look at novels by Kerouac, Kesey, and cover as well as films like Easy Rider and Fight Club to see how a certain kind of revolution continues to rewrite American ideas and ideals while maintain and developing connections with quintessentially American ideas and ideals found in Transcendentalism and the myth of the cowboy. "
1063,2011Cornell,"AMST 2010 Popular Culture in the United States, 1900 to 1945 (HA-AS) ","Fall. 4 credits. G. Altschuler. AMST 2010 deals with American popular culture in the period between 1900 and the end of World War II. As we examine bestsellers, films, sports and television, radio, ads, newspapers, magazines, and music, the goal is to better understand the ways in which popular culture as “contested terrain,” the place where social classes, racial and ethnic groups, women and men, the powerful and the less powerful, seek to “control” images and themes. Topics include the Western; Cultural Heroes and the Cult of Individualism in the 1920s; The Hays Code and the Black Sox scandal; Mae West and the “New Women”: Advertising in an Age of Consumption; Gangsters and G-Men; and Jackie Robinson and the American Dilemma. (HI) "
1064,2011Cornell,"AMST 2020 Popular Culture in the United States, 1950 to Present (HA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. G. Altschuler. AMST 2020 treats the period from 1950 to the present as we examine best-sellers, films, sports and television, radio, ads, newspapers, magazines, and music. We try to better understand the ways in which popular culture shapes and/or reflects American values. The course also depicts popular culture as “contested terrain,” the place where social classes, racial and ethnic groups, women and men, the powerful and less powerful seek to “control” images and themes. Topics include The Honeymooners and 1950s television, soap operas; “gross-out” movies; Elvis; the Beatles, and Guns ’n Roses; gothic romances; and People Magazine and USA Today. "
1065,2011Cornell,ANTHR 1400 The Comparison of Cultures @ (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 3 credits. D. Holmberg. An introduction to cultural anthropology through ethnographies, or the descriptive accounts of anthropologists. Through readings and lectures, students acquaint themselves with a number of cultures from several parts of the world. The cultures range in form from those of small-scale tribal societies to those of state societies. Throughout the course, we attempt to make sense of exotic cultures in their own terms. Attention is focused on variation in cultural patterns as they are expressed in social, economic, and ritual practices. In this encounter, the principles of anthropology, as a comparative enterprise that poses distinct cultural systems in relief, will be developed. Fiction, films, and exercises supplement the formal anthropological materials. "

1067,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2400 Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues @ (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 3 credits. B. Perley. This course will introduce students to the meaning and significance of forms of cultural diversity for the understanding of contemporary issues. Drawing from films, videos, and selected readings, students will be confronted with different representational forms that portray cultures in various parts of the world, and they will be asked to examine critically their own prejudices as they influence the perception and evaluation of cultural differences. We shall approach cultures holistically, assuming the inseparability of economies, kinship, religion, and politics, as well as interconnections and dependencies between world areas (e.g., Africa, Latin America, the West). Among the issues considered: “political correctness” and truth; nativism and ecological diversity; race, ethnicity, and sexuality; sin, religion, and war; global process and cultural integrity. "
1068,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2428 Slavery and Human Trafficking # (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Fiskesjo. In this course we will study slavery and trafficking in human slaves in the world today, as well as its roots and history in Asia, Africa, as well as in medieval Scandinavia, and in America and Europe today. We will make use of anthropological perspectives to look at influential historical and Classical definitions of slavery, such as Aristotle’s idea of the “natural slave,” and ask how ownership and domination over fellow humans have been justified in different societies. While introducing themes of gender, race, ethnicity, etc., and basic philosophical issues regarding autonomy and dependence, we also examine the economic forces of exploitation in the floating world of economic migration, people smuggling, and human trafficking. "
1069,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2450 The Anthropology of Food and Cuisine @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Fajans. You are what you eat! This course examines the way food is produced, prepared, exchanged, presented, and given meaning in cultures around the world. It examines the symbolism of specific foodstuffs. Who prepares food and how is it done? Who feeds whom and how these relations are expressed and valued? In addition to looking at these questions we analyze ideas about commensality; how food is used in public contexts for presentation or exchange, and how food is a marker of gender, class, status, ethnicity, and identity. In addition to looking specifically at food, we analyze cultural ideas about gender, the body, and identity in terms of how these cultural patterns are produced and expressed through concrete activities like eating, fasting, and special diets. In this class we stress critical and comparative thinking about subjects we tend to take for granted. "
1070,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2520 Indonesia Today ,"Spring. 3 credits. M. Welker. Comprised of over 10,000 islands, Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country and has the world’s largest Muslim population.

"
1071,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2546 South Asian Religions in Practice @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 3 credits. A. Willford. This course offers an anthropological approach to the study of religious traditions and practices in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal). The course begins with a short survey of the major religious traditions of South Asia: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Islam. We look to the development of these traditions through historical and cultural perspectives. The course then turns to the modern period, considering the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization upon religious ideologies and practices. The primary focus of the course will be the ethnographic study of contemporary religious practices in the region. We examine phenomena such as ritual, pilgrimage, possession, devotionalism, monasticism, asceticism, and revivalism through a series of ethnographic case studies. In so doing, we also seek to understand the impact of politics, modernity, diasporic movement, social inequality, changing gender roles, and mass mediation upon these traditions and practices. "
1072,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3000 Introduction to Anthropological Theory (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. P. Nadasdy. This seminar course is designed to give anthropology majors an introduction to classical and contemporary social and anthropological theory and to help prepare them for upper-level seminars in anthropology. The seminar format emphasizes close reading and active discussion of key texts and theorists. The reading list will vary from year to year but will include consideration of influential texts and debates in 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century anthropological theory especially as they have sought to offer conceptual and analytical tools for making sense of human social experience and cultural capacities. "
1073,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3130 Latin American Forms of Colonial Possession @ # (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. C. Garces. The persistence of colonial relationships in Latin America will be interrogated in this course using methods drawn from ethnography, psychoanalysis, historiography, political theory, and experimental literature. Key to this line of inquiry is the anthropological problematization of metaphors and practices of possession. Our course readings will explore the psychological internalization of colonial domination; the political ceremonies of territorial sovereignty; the everyday rituals of personal enchantment and disenchantment; the occult applications of magic, witchcraft, and sorcery; and the historical processes of de- and re-colonization that mark notions of “possession” with such longstanding and fraught cross-cultural implications. This class will demonstrate how commonplace understandings of race, class, ethnicity, labor, gender, sexuality, subjectivity, personhood, religion, and the state gain shape and meaning through discourses of possession. "
1074,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3425 Anthropology of the University (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Greenwood. Turning an anthropological gaze on the contemporary university as a social and cultural system, this seminar involves an examination of the convergences and divergences between the trajectories of the sciences and engineering, the humanities, and the social sciences in contemporary universities and some international comparisons with the trajectories of universities around the world. The overall aim is to link an ethnographic analysis of the microstructures of departmental differentiation, professional hegemonies, and local financing with the larger-scale processes of transformation of universities’ place in society under the pressures of corporativization, globalization, and competition from a host of alternative higher education institutions. "
1075,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3447 Sport @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Sangren. Long overlooked by anthropologists, sport and recreation are increasingly recognized as important windows into culture. Sport can be approached from a number of directions— interpreted as a ritual; viewed as a spectacle of ethnic, regional, or national identity; seen as a metaphor for life; understood as a major industry. This course will consider these and other approaches to sport, encouraging students to bring their own involvements in sport to reflect not only upon sport itself, but also upon how such reflection can illuminate cultural, psychological, and political dimensions of social life. Why, for example, do we take sport (and other forms of recreation) so seriously? Why do many of us apparently invest more passion in such pursuits than to life’s allegedly more serious activities? How is sport integrated into people’s identities? Readings will draw from popular literature and media as well as academic writing from a variety of disciplines (psychology, sociology, history) in addition to anthropology. "
1076,2011Cornell,"ANTHR 3734 Brazil: Many Cultures, One Nation @ (CA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. J. Fajans. From the streets of Rio to the shores of the Amazon, anthropology studies the lives, communities, beliefs, practices, and politics of the diverse region known as Brazil. This course will look at issues of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, ritual, environment, development, and human rights across Brazil. We will examine rural and urban cultures, discuss African and European Influences, and explore the relations between indigenous and national cultures. In this context, we will look at the roles that religion, food, dress, soccer, samba, and carnival all play in producing this vibrant culture. "
1077,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4165 Anthropology of Humanitarianism ,"Spring. 4 credits. C. Garces. It is commonplace to hear that we live in a humanitarian age, but to what extent is humanitarianism coextensive with global and cultural politics today? This seminar will explore how institutions and governments identify “states of emergency” in order to safeguard populations and political alliances. Our readings will problematize gift exchange and the logic of sacrifice across charitable, philanthropic, and peacekeeping efforts. Key topics include the gendered dynamics of aid distribution; the impact of philanthropy on private-public balances of power; the role of displaced populations as biopolitical communities; and the democratic applications of charity to mask imperial resemblances. We will together challenge the ethical knot of using “voluntary actions” as the basis of normative political systems, highlighting contingencies and exploring paradoxes in humanitarian endeavors. "
1078,2011Cornell,"ANTHR 4415 Creolization, Syncretism, and Hybridity ","Spring. 4 credits. V. Munasinghe. The concepts of Creolization, Syncretism, and Hybridity all convey a state of “mixture” that assumes a diasporic situation. This course explores theories and empirical case studies of processes of racial, cultural, and religious mixture from an interdisciplinary perspective. The course explores the interconnections among concepts denoting “mixture” that have diverse originary points. The overarching line of inquiry is to explore the geneaologies of the three concepts as a necessary precursor to understanding how these terminologies may, in concert, illuminate different aspects of the dynamics structuring processes of mixture in different historical and ethnographic settings. "
1079,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4455 Anthropology in the Real World (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. Staff. This course is designed to expose students to the range of ways and fields within which practitioners employ anthropological theory, methods, and perspectives. Class format will include both seminar discussions and workshop sessions with invited speakers. Both the invited speakers and the discussion topics will represent different broadly defined fields in which anthropologists practice. Through class discussion and writing, students will be expected to critically consider such issues as research ethics, professional responsibility, the academic versus activist role, methodological practices, and the relationship between individual practitioners and the national, international, and organization contexts within which they work. Students will produce a major research paper examining a particular field of “practical” anthropology of their interest. "
1080,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3305 Anthropology of Parenting @ (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. M. Small. Human children are packets of genes that represent individual reproductive success. Like all animals, humans are selected by evolution to care for their offspring, but human infants and children require more intense parental investment than the offspring of most other species. Why is this so? Human parents are also influenced by cultural belief systems and ideology that play out in parenting styles. How do various belief systems influence parent-offspring interaction? In this course we will examine the human infant as a biologically designed organism that has co-evolved with caretakers, and then look at the various parenting styles across cultures that also mold our young. "

1084,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6000 Proseminar: Culture and Symbol ,"Fall. 6 credits. H. Miyazaki. Focuses on an appreciation of symbolic, expressive, and representational forms and processes both as producers and products of social activities. Through the study of symbolic anthropology, structuralism, exchange, myth and ritual, religion, gender, personhood, linguistics, semiology, etc., the course investigates how identity and meaning are linked to the practical exigencies of social life. While emphasizing aspects of the discipline generally associated with cultural anthropology, the course endeavors to set the stage for a dialectical understanding of social, political, economic, and symbolic activities as interrelated phenomena. The works of de Saussure, Levi-Strauss, Dumont, Geertz, Victor Turner, Sahlins, among others, as well as contemporary theories are given careful attention. "
1085,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6010 Proseminar: Social Organization ,"Spring. 6 credits. M. Welker. Focuses on linkages between culture and social institutions, representations, and practices. The nature of these linkages is debated from strongly contesting points of view in social theory (structuralist, poststructuralist, utilitarian, hermeneutic, Marxist). Unlike debates in critical theory where the form of contestation has been mainly philosophical, in anthropology these issues have developed in ethnographic analyses. The course briefly surveys kinship theory and economic anthropology with a focus on implications for general issues in social theory. Discussion of attempts to develop dialectical syntheses around the motion of “practice” follows. The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which poststructuralist readings of history are counterposed to Marxist ones. Finally, Lacanian and Marxist visions of ideology as they relate to anthropological theory and ethnographic analysis are examined with particular emphasis on the cultural and social production of persons. "
1086,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6420 Ritual and Myth ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Holmberg. This seminar focuses on theories of ritual and myth, engaging first classic formulations as found in Durkheim, Weber, and Evans-Pritchard, then the contributions to what converged as symbolic anthropology and structuralism including Levi-Strauss, Geertz, and Victor Turner. In the second part of the semester we engage new directions in anthropology of ritual and myth considering psychoanalytic approaches, practice theory, and deconstruction. Everyone in the seminar is expected to write a term paper on a topic of their choice. "
1087,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6440 Research Design ,"Spring. 4 credits. Staff. This seminar focuses on preparing a full-scale proposal for anthropological fieldwork for a dissertation.

1088,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6460 Language Ideologies and Practices ,"Spring. 4 credits. V. Santiago-Irizarry. Cultural identity and citizenship in the United States have often been organized around linguistic difference and the issues this raises in an English-dominant society. Drawing from anthropological theories on language, this course will look at the place of language as a signifying practice in the United States by focusing on the experience of Latino communities. Topics to be explored include linguistic diversity and change, accommodation and resistance, language maintenance and shift, linguistic ideologies, the production of language hierarchies, and institutional applications of language.

1102,2011Cornell,ASIAN 2296 From Slow Boats to CEOs?: The Chinese of Southeast Asia @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. L. Paterson. From a Thai king’s pamphlet on the “Jews of the East,” to the 1998 anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia, the ethnic Chinese of Southeast Asia have long been positioned as a privileged and wealthy elite who wield disproportionate power and influence.

In this class we’ll explore the meeting ground of these two major art forms, considering both similarities and differences between printed poems and lyrics. Our main focus will be on the intricacies of language and verse form that make for a great lyric, whether by Bob Dylan, Dolly Parton, or Stephen Sondheim. We’ll also look at poems that aspire to the condition of song by such poets as William Blake, Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot, and Langston Hughes. Our examples will be drawn from many genres, including folk ballads, blues, Broadway, country, rock, and rap. "
1277,2011Cornell,ENGL 2901 Utopia: From Thomas More to Philip K. Dick (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Mann. A “utopia” is an imaginary world, a fantastical “no-place” that conveys important truths about the real world. This course surveys the literary genre of utopia from the Renaissance to today, focusing on writers who invent new worlds through fiction. In Thomas More’s Utopia, we explore utopia’s emergence in the 16th century in response to European political upheaval and New World exploration, then turn to how British and American writers transform utopian visions in the following centuries. Finally, we consider how utopia is reworked in science fiction’s paradoxical emphasis on both fantasy and realism. Topics include the politics of gender, technology in a perfect society, and the wildly inventive forms of utopian fiction by Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, Jonathan Swift, Aldous Huxley, Ursula LeGuin, and Philip K. Dick. "
1278,2011Cornell,ENGL 3390 Jane Austen # (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. H. Shaw. It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a student who has read Jane Austen must be in want of excuses to continue that delicious experience. This course explores Austen’s characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems that resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen’s alluring mystique, her importance in literary history, and her continuing attraction in the 21st century. By immersing ourselves in her fictional worlds, we will enrich our experience of her novels and sharpen our awareness of the pleasures of reading. "
1279,2011Cornell,ENGL 3500 The High Modernist Tradition (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Schwarz. Critical study of major works by Hardy, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, Yeats, Wilde, Pound, and others. While the emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism (mostly but not exclusively in England), and relate literary modernism in England to that in Europe and America as well as to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture; on occasion, we shall look at slides. Within the course material, students will be able to select the topics on which they write essays. "
1280,2011Cornell,ENGL 3571 The Modern Irish Writers (CA-AS) ,"Spring 4 credits. K. Attell. This is a course on Irish writing of the modern period. In our readings over the semester (which will include some of the 20th century’s greatest literary texts), we will cover the development of Irish writing from the Yeats-led Irish Revival of the century’s early years through Joyce’s high modernist virtuosity to the proto-postmodernisms of O’Brien and Beckett. Along the way we will also examine how Irish modernism raises fundamental questions about such things as the relation between language and national identity; the nature of modernism’s “newness”; colonial, postcolonial, and “semicolonial” culture; the political uses of literature; and the contending forces of cosmopolitanism and nationalism in the modern period. "
1281,2011Cornell,FGSS 3620) (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Pryse. What does it mean that some people still fly the Confederate flag while others vehemently protest it? How do Southern writers help us to understand sectional division and regional identity? Proposing that Southern history and culture embody fundamental social contradictions—about race, but also about gender and class—this course will consider black and white, male and female Southern writers from the Civil War to the pre-Civil Rights era and beyond. We will read first-person narratives and novels by Harriet Jacobs, Mark Twain, Charles Chesnutt, Kate Chopin, Lillian Smith, Flannery O’Connor, Richard Wright, William Faulkner, and Alice Walker. Students will write short papers to be shared and a longer final paper. "
1282,2011Cornell,ENGL 3700 The Victorian Novel # (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Faulkner. Jane Austen and zombies, A Christmas Carol in 3D, an orgy of PBS miniseries: why is the 19th century so un-dead? The plot of the British novel—sexual betrayal, pathological greed and revenge, the sadistic damage wrought on helpless children—reflects wrenching social and technological transformations whose global sweep rivals that of our own era’s conflicts. Intertwining domestic and imperial spaces, realistic fiction embodied the most innovative attempt to grasp and contain such seismic shifts in an entertaining idiom for a rising mass readership. These works refract the cultural anxieties of the age and suggest sources of redemption. We can take pleasure in them even as we critically analyze how the Victorians live now. Likely authors include Austen, Dickens, Brontë, Eliot, Hardy, Conrad. "
1283,2011Cornell,ENGL 3703 Reading Joyce’s Ulysses (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Schwarz. A thorough episode-by-episode study of the art and meaning of Joyce’s masterwork Ulysses. We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce’s canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism— especially painting and sculpture—and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel—specifically, Joyce’s response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce’s role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce’s response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture. No previous experience with Joyce is required. "
1284,2011Cornell,ENGL 3732 Reading for Writers (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. E. Quinonez. The bulk of this course will be reading novels, short stories, and poems. However, there will be many craft lessons discussing narrative techniques, especially those used in film. We will watch a clip and break the scene down to figure out how a director is manipulating the narrative to tell a story. Then we will see the same manipulation being pulled off, only this time within a different medium, on paper. Good storytelling is good storytelling, and the same narrative techniques or, better said, tricks that are used in film can be applied to our fiction. "
1285,2011Cornell,ENGL 3762 Law and Literature: The Jury as Audience ,"Fall. 4 credits. B. Meyler. The jury is purportedly “the bulwark of democracy,” but it has also been seen as the most potentially destabilizing component of the Anglo-American legal system. Literature, drama, and TV crime shows have helped to form these competing views of the jury. How and why have plays compared jurors with spectators? How were 19th-century trial reports like and unlike novels, and how did jurors read both? Has the alleged “CSI effect” really made contemporary American juries demand more forensic evidence? This course will explore these and related questions in historical and legal context. Works studied may include Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, Daniel Defoe’s Moll Flanders, Wilkie Collins’s The Law and the Lady, Susan Glaspell’s “A Jury of Her Peers,” Anna Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles, and CSI. "
1286,2011Cornell,AMST 3773) (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. M. Crawford. How do visual art, theater, music, poetry, and novels come together in particular cultural movements? How does the modernism of the 1920s and ’30s differ from the experimentations that shaped the 1960s and ’70s? How are artists influenced by social movements? How does art influence the very direction of social movements? This course will compare the 1920s and ’30s Harlem Renaissance and the 1960s and ’70s Black Arts movement. Both social movements produce a stunning interplay of words, images, music, dance, assimilation, and resistance. The selected artists may include Josephine Baker, Nella Larsen, Langston Hughes, Sun Ra, James Brown, Amiri Baraka, Gil Scott-Heron, Nikki Giovanni, Romare Bearden, and the AfriCobra collective. "
1287,2011Cornell,ENGL 4020 Literature as Moral Inquiry (KCM-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. S. Mohanty. What can literary works, especially novels, tell us about moral issues? Should they be seen as suggesting a form of moral inquiry similar to the kind of philosophical discussion we get in, say, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics? Can reading philosophical works in ethics together with novels that deal with similar themes help us understand these themes better? This course is an attempt to answer these questions. We will read selections from Aristotle, Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche, and use these works to help us understand the nature of moral inquiry in novels like Eliot’s Middlemarch, Coetzee’s Disgrace, Morrison’s Beloved, Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, and Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. Other writers we will most probably read include Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Kazuo Ishiguro. "
1288,2011Cornell,ENGL 4212 Literature and the Scientific Revolution in England # (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Mann. “I trust nothing but on the faith of my eyes”: Francis Bacon’s declaration became a central tenet of philosophical inquiry during the 17th century, as gentlemen and artisans began to collect specimens, dissect bodies, and survey the physical universe. This course explores how the new experimental “science” reverberated in imaginative productions in the age of Shakespeare and Milton. How did poetry and fiction find room for the growing domain of “fact”? Why did Englishmen focus this new scientific gaze on “curiosities” such as the human cadaver, the hermaphrodite, and the New World Indian? In surveying the major developments in English scientific thought before the Enlightenment, the interdisciplinary readings in this course will also introduce students to important literary and philosophical texts from the Renaissance. "
1289,2011Cornell,ENGL 4500 History of the Book # (HA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. K. Reagan. This course provides an overview of the book as a material and cultural artifact. Focusing on the era of the printed book (post-1450) in Europe and America, we examine the invention and spread of printing and publishing, and the evolution of book design, illustration, and binding. The course places an emphasis on practical tools for the identification and analysis of books and other printed artifacts, especially for literary students. Investigations and assignments are built around hands-on interaction with examples of Cornell Library’s rare books, manuscripts, and related materials. This course meets in the Carl A. Kroch Library. "
1290,2011Cornell,JWST 4580) (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Schwarz. What is the role of the literary imagination in keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive for our culture? We shall examine major and widely read Holocaust narratives that have shaped the way we understand and respond to the Holocaust. We shall begin with first person reminiscences—Wiesel’s Night, Levi’s Survival at Auschwitz, and The Diary of Anne Frank—before turning to realistic fictions such as Kineally’s Schindler’s List (and Spielberg’s film), Kertesz’s Fateless, Kosinski’s The Painted Bird, and Ozick’s “The Shawl.” We shall also read the mythopoeic vision of Schwarz-Bart’s The Last of the Just, the illuminating distortions of Epstein’s King of the Jews, the Kafkaesque parable of Appelfeld’s Badenheim 1939, and the fantastic cartoons of Spiegelman’s Maus books. "
1291,2011Cornell,ENGL 4660 James on Film (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Fried. Henry James’s psychologically probing tales of betrayal, delusion, and tragically misdirected freedom pose a powerful challenge for screen adaptation. Analysis of selected films based on James’s novels involves close reading of these extraordinary texts as well as examination of screenplay form, verbal and visual styles of narrative, and larger questions of the expectations of moviegoers and readers. Study of James’s aspirations as a dramatist, his writings on theater, photography, painting, and fiction, and controversies about the interpretation of the novels contribute to understanding how James’s stories have been retold by filmmakers. Novels/films may include Daisy Miller, Washington Square/The Heiress, The Bostonians, The Turn of the Screw/The Innocents, and The Portrait of a Lady or The Wings of the Dove. "

1305,2011Cornell,GOVT 3867 The Causes of War (SBA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. C. Way. This course surveys leading theories of the causes of interstate war—that is, large-scale organized violence between the armed forces of states. Why is war a recurring feature of international politics? Are democracies more peaceful than other types of states, and if so what explains this “democratic peace”? Why do democratic publics seem to reward threats to use force by “rallying around the flag” in support of their governments? Does the inexorable pattern of the rise and fall of nations lead to cycles of great power wars throughout history? These and other questions will be examined in our survey of theories of war at three levels of analysis: the individual and small groups, domestic politics, and the international system. Topics include (1) theoretical explanations for war; (2) evaluation of the evidence for the various explanations; "
1306,2011Cornell,GOVT 3898 International Law (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. Taught in Washington, D.C. Is international law a pious delusion, helpless in the face of real power?

1312,2011Cornell,GOVT 4303 Biotechnology and Development (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. R. Herring. Of all the technological solutions to agronomic problems that have been proposed in the last few decades, none has created the level of backlash and controversy as those involving genetic biotechnology. Social protest and activist movements arise from ethical, cultural, religious, economic, environmental, and political stances with regard to the use of transgenic technologies, particularly in agricultural development in poor countries. In this course, we will explore the roots of these controversies and follow the logics and economics of their development and deployment. We will try to identify the fundamental underpinnings of various arguments for and against the use of transgenic crops as a tool for agricultural development. Discussions on selected topics and associated directed readings will be led by the course coordinators and invited speakers.

1319,2011Cornell,GOVT 6075 Field Seminar in Political Thought: The Enlightenment ,"Fall. 4 credits. I. Kramnick. The topic for the field seminar in political thought this year will be the Enlightenment. We will read and discuss central texts of 18th-century Enlightenment thought, including texts by Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Condorcet, Hume, Smith, Burke, Paine, and Kant. We will explore the political dilemmas to which these Enlightenment texts responded—such as political theology, feudalism, and absolutist monarchy—and critically evaluate their attempts to establish a more secular, rational, and democratic form of politics. Was there a single Enlightenment? How do we characterize it? How do we assess its political, moral, and philosophical legacies? "
1320,2011Cornell,GOVT 6171 Politics of Public Policy ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Mettler. Much of the literature that comprises the field of policy analysis is characterized by antipathy to politics: scholars attempt to excise political battles and concerns from their studies in order to advance a “rational” portrayal of how policies do or should function. Yet, public policies are, themselves, inherently political. They are defined through political processes, designed and implemented in the context of political institutions, and they in turn shape the character of politics and public life. This course entails the examination and evaluation of a variety of approaches to policy analysis, all of which are united by their inclination to take politics seriously. Readings have been included that comprise variations of rational choice, institutionalist, historical, behavioral, and interpretivist analyses. The first part of the course examines different models of the policy process that may inform policy analysis. The second part of the course investigates policymaking processes and institutions and examines stages of the policy process, including public mobilization, policy definition, agenda setting, and policy design and implementation. Special attention is given to the American system, focusing on policymaking institutions, processes and outcomes in that context, but students who focus on other nations or international system may also find the course useful. The course concludes with an examination of how policies, once created, may in turn restructure political processes and shape policies adopted subsequently. "
1321,2011Cornell,GOVT 6222 Political Participation ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Jones-Correa. This course is concerned with understanding how and under what conditions citizens seek to influence political elites through use, expansion, circumvention or subversion of existing channels of political participation. Cases from a variety of institutional contexts over time will be used to examine how mediating institutions diminish and/or exacerbate social inequalities in the exercise of political voice. We will consider readings from both the United States and comparative contexts to examine and dominant conceptions in the political participation literature. "

1327,2011Cornell,"GOVT 6867 International Law, War, and Human Rights ","Fall. 4 credits. M. Evangelista. This course examines the role of international law in influencing states’ behavior regarding issues related to war and human rights. It draws on literature in the fields of international relations and law to study such questions as: why states comply with international law; under what conditions legal norms become customary and widely accepted; under what conditions long-standing legal norms become undermined; and what is the relative influence in shaping the law of state practice, the efforts of non-state actors and popular movements, and the opinions of legal professionals? Much of the substantive focus of the course will be on the development of international humanitarian law and human-rights law, and the impact of the “War on Terror.” "

1330,2011Cornell,LAW 7393) ,"Fall. 4 credits. A. M. Smith. A seminar for graduate students in the normative political theory field and law students. We will begin with Hart’s classic work, The Concept of Law, and then consider Dworkin’s criticisms. Then we will make a detour to the Rawls versus Sen debate to place “meta” questions pertaining to distributive justice, rights, and deliberation on the table. Returning to legal theory, we will consider Michelman’s work on Rawls, social rights, and the constitution, and Cover’s theory of plural nomian fields. Dworkin’s confidence in the judiciary raises serious questions about the role of judicial review in a liberal democratic society; we will consider the critical approaches of Waldron, Tushnet, and Siegal in this regard. Finally, we will read several works from the critical race theory field; in the fall 2010 version of this course, we will concentrate on the writings of Derrick Bell. "
1331,2011Cornell,HIST 1500 History of the Present (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Magaziner. The present is a confusing place. It is as big as the rise of China and India, as small as the phone in your pocket, as global as the worldwide movement for gay rights, as local as the immigrant family that just moved in next door. It is as abstract as devastating events a world away and as personal as evolving ethical norms about what is right and just and fair. History of the Present pauses time and asks “how did we get here?” Through fiction, film, and other media, we will explore how the past helps to explain the present. "
1332,2011Cornell,HIST 1510 Introduction to Western Civilization # (HA-AS) ,"Summer and fall. 4 credits. O. Falk. The West and its relations with the rest of the world are central topics today, but just what is the West and what is its history? This course surveys the history of the West from remote antiquity to the 16th century. We will consider developments in technology, economy, politics, religious institutions and faiths, cultural media and social ideals. Together, these themes add up to civilization in the west. We will acquaint ourselves with these dimensions of the past while seeking to acquire the basic skills professional historians use to learn about this past. (ER) (EM) "
1333,2011Cornell,HIST 1511 The Making of Europe (1500– present) # (HA-AS) ,"Summer and spring. 4 credits. C. Robcis. How do we make sense of the recent controversies around Islam and the “veil” in France, the reform of the Welfare State in Great Britain, the anti-globalization protests in Davos, the rise of demagogic anti-immigrant parties from the Netherlands to Italy, or the fact that Swedes get more than thirty paid days off per year? This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May ’68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestoes, films, and art), we will consider why “old Europe” is still relevant for us today. (EM) "

The political and ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union played a decisive role in shaping the nation’s political, cultural, and social life. This course considers the impact of the cold war on the nation, considering topics such as political anticommunism, spy scandals, McCarthyism, popular culture, suburbia, and the links between the Cold War and the American family. We will consider a varied array of sources from the era, including books, films, magazine articles, detective novels, television shows, and popular music. (AM) "
1335,2011Cornell,HIST 2021 America and the “Good War” ,"Fall. 4 credits. Staff. This course considers the impact of the Second World War on the politics, society, and culture of the United States. The focus is on the consequences of total war on the political economy, the social structure, and the cultural life of the nation. We will pay particular attention to how the most traumatic events of the war, including the Holocaust, the internment of Japanese-Americans, and the dropping of the atomic bombs, affected the American moral imagination. (AM) "
1336,2011Cornell,"HIST 2081 Deviants, Outcasts, and Others # (HA-AS) ","Fall. 4 credits. D. Corpis. This course will examine the practice of “microhistory” as a method for understanding early-modern European culture and society. Microhistory as a genre of history writing has been most strongly developed by early-modern European historians and has largely dealt with the everyday lives of marginal but otherwise ordinary people—criminals, heretics, witches, lovers, peasants, and artisans. Students in this seminar will read exemplary contributions to the genre in an attempt to analyze the successes and shortcomings of this approach to history writing. Written assignments will ask students to theorize the relationship between everyday life and macrohistorical phenomena, to analyze specific microhistories, and to write their own microhistories based on primary sources such as memoirs and court cases.

1338,2011Cornell,HIST 2274 Late Imperial and Early Soviet Culture (HA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. C. Verhoeven. There is no prerequisite for this seminar, but it does (more or less) pick up where “The Russian Revolutionary Intelligentsia” (HIST 2273) leaves off. The period covered will span half a century, approximately from the early 1880s to the late 1920s. This means the course treats both Imperial and Soviet Russia and will try to think these two together under the general heading of “Russian modernity.” What happened to the intelligentsia over the course of these turbulent years? How did modernization, revolution, war, and the construction of the world’s first socialist society affect the intelligentsia’s composition, political thought, literature, and art (including cinema)? Some of the topics to be covered include Marxist-Leninism, Anarchism, Terrorism, Symbolism, Futurism, and Constructivism. (EM) "
1339,2011Cornell,HIST 2431 Postcolonial Memories and Politics of History @ (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. K. Hirano. Postcolonial studies, which seek to uncover and (re-)articulate repressed voices, memories, and experiences of colonized peoples around the world, have altered the way we understand history. They have brought about the recognition that the historical profession and its mode of knowledge production have been deeply complicit with colonial strategies of domination and violence. This new recognition challenges the normative understanding of history as a discipline devoted to the objective reconstruction of the past enabled by scrupulous efforts to gather data and facts. If historical knowledge is not as “objective” as assumed, it follows that “date” and “facts” are not free from values and subjective judgment. Nor can history reveal the truth about the past. Rather, data/facts themselves constitute a certain type of narrative (that is, they are always already value-ridden) and authors of history select facts and data according to their judgments and criteria in order to explain the causes, effects, processes, and consequences of events they study. In this seminar, by paying attention to this epistemological predicament of history, we will examine the relationship between history and colonialism, and try to imagine a critical and self-reflective mode of historical inquiry based on the insights of Postcolonial Studies.

1340,2011Cornell,HIST 2470 The Age of Charlemagne # (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. P. Hyams. Charlemagne (Charles the Great, 775–814) is still revered as “the Father of Europe.” In his time as king of the Franks and then emperor of the West, we see for the first time with any clarity the shape of Europe as it would remain for a millennium and more, also of the structures and cultural mix that would characterize the West before there were a France, Germany, or United Kingdom. The “Carolingian Renaissance” promoted a brief but fruitful burst of writings and artifacts, including an intimate if slippery Life of Charlemagne and much better documentation of the public and to an extent even the everyday life of the age. By reading primary sources in translation, students can grasp a pivotal moment in Western Civilization, see how historians construct their categories, and learn the limitations of the historical craft. (ER) "
1341,2011Cornell,HIST 2620 Medieval Sampler # (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. P. Hyams. This course targets the intelligent student seeking an accelerated entrance to the formative period of Western Civilization during the Middle Ages. It therefore aims to convey what was significant in that area of the “West” that became Europe, between the end of the Roman Empire in the West and the Renaissance, say 395–1450. Students may expect to gain a basic knowledge of the events and institutions of Medieval Christendom. The real and more ambitious goal is, however, to introduce some of the choicer aspects of the medieval world, those judged most likely to intrigue, delight, and satisfy. This Medieval Sampler is like a classic French hors d’oeuvre, in that it presents for the discriminating palate some of the very best dishes known to the chef. Among these dishes figure Beliefs, Gender and Power Relations, Economics (Greed and Subsistence), Arts and Entertainments (Architecture, Literature, Music, Painting), even some Deviance and Protest. There are some interesting assignments, too. (ER) "

Specific topics explored in weekly lectures will include the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, political centralization, intellectual fragmentation, the institutionalization of science, the Enlightenment, and political rebellion and revolution. In addition to focusing on some of the key developments in European history during this period, the design of the course recognizes the necessity of locating European history within a broader geographic world, so we will also explore the question of European contacts with other cultures, colonial expansion, and Atlantic slavery.

1347,2011Cornell,HIST 3200 The Viking Age # (HA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. O. Falk. This course aims to familiarize students with the history of Scandinavia, ca. 800–1100 ad. Although well known as a dramatic chapter in medieval history, this period remains enigmatic and often misunderstood. Our goal will be to set Norse history within its European context, observing similarities with processes elsewhere in the medieval world, the better to perceive what makes the Norse unique. We will examine the social, economic and political activities of the Norsemen in continental Scandinavia, in Western and Eastern Europe, and in the North Atlantic. (ER) "

We will then follow the cause of freedom through the greatest slave rebellion in American history, and the attempts by formerly enslaved people to make freedom real in Reconstruction. And we will see how Reconstruction’s tragic ending left questions open that are still not answered in U.S. society and politics. (AM) "

This course explores the major intellectual, cultural, religious, and political developments in Italy from the political thought of Dante and Marsilius of Padua in the age of the communes, through the several stages of Italian Humanism’s revival of ancient learning from Petrarch to Bruni, Alberti, Valla, and Pico, down to the crisis of both Italian liberty and the cult of antiquity in the generation of Machiavelli, Guicciardini and Castiglione. The course seeks to problematize the notion of a “Renaissance” in the period’s ambivalent attitudes toward history, politics, learning, culture, gender, language, and the role of intellectuals in politics and society. Emphasis is placed on the close reading and interpretation of primary sources. (ER) "

1355,2011Cornell,"HIST 3730 Law, Crime, and Society in Early Modern Europe # (HA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. D. Corpis. This course will survey the development of law, legal institutions, definitions of crime, and practices of criminality from the 16th to 18th centuries. We often associate this period with extreme measures of law enforcement and repression, whether the persecution of converted Jews by the Inquisition or the witch burnings that raged through various parts of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Yet much of our common knowledge of law and crime in early modern European history consists of exaggerations, myths and misunderstandings. This course offers a corrective by exploring the historical contexts and meanings of law and crime in European society. Some of the themes covered in this course include the relationship between common law and Roman law, jurisdiction building and jurisdictional competition, the imposition of gender and sexual norms, heresy and witchcraft prosecutions, the sociology and anthropology of “criminal” subcultures, and the political process of “criminalization.” (EM) "
