The major visual impact of bridges on the built environment cannot be denied. And yet, during the past century, architects have virtually abandoned their historical role in the design of these structures. Engineers, on the other hand, have claimed bridge design as their responsibility and have hailed it as evidence of structural art. Are the basic principles of bridge design such that this situation makes sense for our society? Or is a rethinking of the manner in which bridges are designed called for? Students examine and experiment with the design of bridge structural forms, not only in terms of what is technically feasible but also, with equal emphasis, in the context of aesthetic, historical, and social considerations. Weekly meetings include lectures, discussion seminars, and studio-type design reviews. "

Focuses on networks of brain regions that are organized around the integration of processes related to emotion and motivation. The course first explores brain pathways for processing visual, auditory, body and face movements, and tactile stimuli that comprise the raw material used to judge the emotional significance of external events. Next, brain regions involved in the (1) emotional evaluation of that sensory input, and (2) emotional expression once a significant event is identified are described. Then, brain processes underlying the special nature of human emotional experience (subjective feelings) are explored. All of these basic emotional processes are extended by placing them within widespread brain networks that modulate emotional behavior. There is an emphasis on social contexts and the development of social emotions, including social bonding and social rejection. The manner in which emotional stress influences learning and memory, with implications for PTSD, concludes the course. "

While it will start with an overview of the investment management industry, it will move quickly toward a review of the more recent growth in hedge funds.

These changes will produce major dislocations and opportunities for asset managers, investment bankers, insurance companies, private equity firms, hedge funds, and a whole array of processing companies. Given the demographics of the aging baby-boomer population and the looming crisis in global retirement funding, this may prove to be a bellwether issue in finance and social policy for the next decade.

1994,2011Cornell,"ASRC 3604 U.S. Education, Oppression, Resistance (SBA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. T. Gosa. Despite salient reductions in educational inequality over the past 30 years, the academic underachievement of Black, Latino/a, and Native American youth remains one of the most researched, yet stubborn social problems in American society. The goal of this course is to explore issues of race and ethnicity in American education. Students will be asked to consider the ways in which schools foster poor academic performance and devalue minority youth’s cultural and ethnic identities. Topics include school and residential segregation, academic tracking, language isolation, teacher quality, pedagogy and curriculum, and family/peer group influences.

1996,2011Cornell,ASRC 4602 Women and Gender Issues in Africa @ (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. N. Assié-Lumumba. There are two contrasting views of the status and role of women in Africa. One view portrays African women as dominated and exploited by men. According to another view, women have a favorable social position in Africa: indigenous ideologies consider women to be the foundation of society, they are economically active and independent and they have an identity independent of men. In this seminar we discuss the status and role of women in Africa historically as well as in the contemporary period. Topics include women in nonwesternized/precolonial societies; the impact of colonial policies on the status of women; gender and access to schooling, participation in the economy and politics; women and the law; women and health issues; gender issues in southern Africa; womanism and feminism; the United Nations Decade of Women; and the four World Conferences on Women (Mexico 1975, Copenhagen 1986, Nairobi 1985, and Beijing 1995).

1999,2011Cornell,"ASRC 6207 Black Feminist Theories (also ENGL/FGSS 6207, COML 6465) ","Fall. 4 credits. C. Boyce Davies. This courses examines black feminist theories, placing particular emphasis on the cross-cultural experiences of women as expressed both theoretically and creatively. It follows the chronologies and variations of modern black feminisms, beginning with the U.S. articulations and moving toward how particular feminist positions are constructed and theorized in other locations across the African diaspora such as Black British feminism, Caribbean feminism, African feminism. Thus we will explore the various theories and texts within their sociopolitical and geographical frames and locations, analyzing these as appropriate against or in relation to a range of feminist activisms and movements. "
2000,2011Cornell,ASRC 6301 African American Politics ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Turner. The central thesis of African American politics has been its movements for political change and democratic access and human rights. This development since the 17th century is a complex political legacy. This course conducts a close study of African American political practice and theoretical analysis of the American political system. Implications of the political systems for prospects and limitations to participation by Black people are analyzed. Critical historical stages in the process of Black politics are examined. The development of electoral offices in federal and statewide politics in critical industrial centers, as well as rural hamlets, center the course. Presidential politics—the Jesse Jackson campaigns—and new political formations including Black Republications/conservatives constitute the emphasis on contemporary events. The course reviews the development of the literature in African American politics. "
2001,2011Cornell,ASRC 6303 Nationalism and Decolonization in Africa ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Byfield. This course examines the rise of nationalism as well as the process and aims of decolonization in sub-Saharan Africa. It draws on films and a variety of primary and secondary materials in order to illuminate the complex and contested arenas from which African nationalisms emerged. Throughout the course we will examine the ways in which race, ethnicity, gender, and class shaped the discourse of nationalism as well as nationalist strategies and agendas. We will also explore the ways in which the conflicts and tensions of the nationalist period continue to shape post-colonial state and society. "
2002,2011Cornell,"ASRC 6305 Dress, Cloth, and Identity: Africa and the Diaspora ","Spring. 4 credits. J. Byfield. This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to examine the importance of textiles in African social and economic history. It combines art history, anthropology, social and economic history to explore the role of textiles in marking status, gender, political authority, and ethnicity. In addition, we examine the production and distribution of indigenous cloth and the consequences of colonial rule on African textile industries. Our analysis also considers the principles of African dress and clothing that shaped the African diaspora in the Americas as well as the more recent popularity and use of African fabrics and dress in the United States. "
2003,2011Cornell,ASRC 6306 Figures of Thought: Africana Intellectuals ,"Spring. 4 credits. G. Farred. The process by which intellectuals come to stand as such, as figures of thought, is the consequence of an often difficult, sometimes protracted process. In this course, we will focus on a small number of Africana intellectuals, including Saint Augustine, Frantz Fanon, Jacques Derrida, and Patrice Lumumba. We will read a range of primary and secondary texts in order to grapple with the question of how intellectuals are formed. To this end, we will read about the “failed” revolution aspired to by Lumumba, as well as taking a hard look at Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth as an anti-intellectual work. "
2004,2011Cornell,ASRC 6400 Africana Thought (also ENGL 6401) ,"Fall. 4 credits. G. Farred. What kind of thinking is being and has been produced, historically by figures in Africana philosophy? Intention of course is not— though that may a collateral effect—to argue against those who naysay the existence of Africana philosophy nor is it to “define” the field, as if such a project were even possible. “Africana Thought” will, instead, seek to engage those thinkers who produce this philosophy. The readings will run from the “Confessions” of St. Augustine through Alexander Crummell’s musings to Valentin Mudimbe’s “The Invention of Africa,” from intense reflections on the condition of black subjugation that is Frantz Fanon’s writing to locating Jacques Derrida as a philosopher of the Maghreb. Course about Africana philosophy as a project that persistently questions itself. "
2005,2011Cornell,"ASRC 6401 The Politics of Theory (also ENGL 6402, FREN 6401) ","Spring. 4 credits. G. Farred. There is an old and hoary chestnut that pits theory against politics, presuming, arguing, that theory is not, has no, politics. This course is not designed to either rebut or ignore that antagonism. Instead, the intent here is simply to read a range of theorists, from John Stuart Mill (“On Liberty”) to Alain Badiou, to think how the politics of theory and the theory of politics. Badiou, Mill, Carl Schmitt and Jacques Ranciere, never shy away from their sense of the political. If anything, this course will delight in how unreflectively these thinkers take the matter of politics. In fact, and here Schmitt is crucial, at issue will be: how could we not think our politics theoretically? "
2006,2011Cornell,ASRC 6510 Pan-Africanism and Feminism (also COML 6460) ,"Fall. 4 credits. C. Boyce Davies. This course examines the particular theoretical intersections of Pan-Africanism and feminism through a study of works that address the lives of activist women and men who lived political lives that demanded an articulation of this intersection. It will examine representative texts in each of these broad fields, paying particular attention to those works that explicitly address the intersection. Students will select and study the work of one thinker in either category and examine the written life from a few angles. In particular, we will address the conflicts, disjunctures, and slippages between these positions; the possibilities and limitations as expressed by these thinkers; and the issues of collaboration, erasure articulated. Students will also have the opportunity to identify and discuss popular culture that addresses these themes. "
2007,2011Cornell,ASRC 6511 Middle Passage: Theorizing the African Diaspora ,"Spring. 4 credits. C. Boyce Davies. The Middle Passage is perhaps the most evocative and simultaneously the most painful of transitions any people have made. Whereas for many the passage to the Americas was loaded with expectation of freedom, for Africans the passage across the Atlantic was loaded with pain, loss, and separation. The Middle Passage (referred to as the Maafa) then becomes a journey of separation, dismemberment, and dislocation. But it was also on the Middle Passage, for those who survived, that the transformation into African Diaspora peoples began. This course examines a range of middle passage texts such as novels, poetry, film, drama, slave narratives, and historical texts in order to explore comparatively how artists from across the African Diaspora have approached this historically and emotionally loaded event. "
2008,2011Cornell,ASRC 6520 Thinking Heidegger ,"Fall. 4 credits. G. Farred. It is, of course, a truism to suggest that Martin Heidegger, more than any 20th-century philosopher, is preoccupied with thinking. It is, again, obviously, present in Was heist Denken? However, in a work such as The Principle of Reason there is a similar preoccupation with thinking. Not, as in Was heist Denken?, for its own sake, but as an integral part of Heidegger’s intellectual project. Using Heidegger as the central figure, this course will, additionally, think thinking the work of philosophers such as Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault. "
2009,2011Cornell,ASRC 6600 Education and Development in Africa ,"Spring. 4 credits. N. Assié-Lumumba. Human capital theory establishes a positive and linear relationship between formal education and individual productivity and socioeconomic attainment and economic growth and development of nations. While enjoying considerable popularity in industrial and developing countries, including African countries, education has also been perceived as a hindrance to development. The concept of human capital and paradigms of development including modernization, dependency, and Third World Forum are first introduced. Specific issues discussed include schooling and nonformal education; the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development; and language, access, output, and outcome based on social class, ethnicity, race, and gender. Employment, migration and international brain drain, the information and communication technologies, indigenous knowledge systems, and the role of higher education in regional and international cooperation are also examined. "
2010,2011Cornell,ASRC 6606 Politics of the Hip-Hop Generation ,"Spring. 4 credits. T. Gosa. This graduate seminar investigates the political dynamics of the hip-hop generation. The primary focus of this course will be the major political and economic forces that have shaped the worldview of Black and Latino/a youth born between 1965 and 1984. Students will critically address major topics surrounding hip-hop including race-ethnicity, gender and sexuality, social class, segregation/massincarceration, politics, and education. After reviewing the sociohistorical development of hip-hop, we will examine the role of hip-hop in modern black politics and activism, including its significance for mobilizing youth. Special attention will be given to the generational gap between the hip-hop generations and the Civil-Rights/Black Power parents. "
2011,2011Cornell,AMST 4311 Dissenting Patriots ,"Fall. 4 credits. N. Salvatore. This seminar examines the complex nature of dissent in America in the post-1945 decades. Our readings will look at dissenters, their ideas, and their movements across the political spectrum, with particular attention to how they legitimize their divergent political views. Requirements include weekly discussions, some short essays evaluating the common reading, and a term paper (about 25 pages) on a topic selected in consultation with me. There are no exams. (HI) "
2012,2011Cornell,AMST 1101 Introduction to American Studies # (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. B. Maxwell. This course is an introduction to interdisciplinary considerations of American culture. We will reflect on topics ranging from Native American relations to the land, to the European conquest of the Americas, to the development of American civic life and political culture and the ongoing African American struggle for freedom and equality. We will also study immigration as a (threatened) constant in national life and labor, the distinctions between mass culture and popular culture, the promise of American life, and violence as a persisting national woe. We’ll examine these themes through literature, historical writing, music, art, film, architecture, and political economy in the United States. The course will also give attention to the many methods through which scholars have, over time, developed the discipline of American Studies, and to ongoing debates over the intellectual and political stakes of those methods.

2013,2011Cornell,AMST 1143 Space Cowboys: The ’60s Hero (HA-AS) ,"Summer only. 4 credits. J. Pickett. The close of World War II marks the beginning of America’s ascendancy to unrivaled prosperity and political power. But it also marks the beginning of an American self-examination whose fiercest discontent found expression in the 1960s, in part through the youth movement. We’ll look at novels by Kerouac, Kesey, and cover as well as films like Easy Rider and Fight Club to see how a certain kind of revolution continues to rewrite American ideas and ideals while maintain and developing connections with quintessentially American ideas and ideals found in Transcendentalism and the myth of the cowboy. "
2014,2011Cornell,AMST 1240 Democracy and Its Discontents: Political Traditions in the United States (also HIST 1240) (HA-AS) ,"Summer. 3 credits. N. Salvatore. An examination of democracy and its critics. The course explores the evolution of democracy in America, focusing on some of the dramatic and important episodes in American history. It considers the struggles over the emancipation of slaves in the 19th century and expanded rights for women and working people in the 20th century, free-speech issues, the civil-rights movement, religious-based critiques of American culture, and conservative critiques of American liberalism. The course serves as an investigation of the ways in which political expression takes forms in modern American culture. In addition to lectures, the course features several afternoon programs that include guest lecturers and hands-on instruction in how to use the modern electronic research library. (HI) "
2015,2011Cornell,"AMST 2010 Popular Culture in the United States, 1900 to 1945 (HA-AS) ","Fall. 4 credits. G. Altschuler. AMST 2010 deals with American popular culture in the period between 1900 and the end of World War II. As we examine bestsellers, films, sports and television, radio, ads, newspapers, magazines, and music, the goal is to better understand the ways in which popular culture as “contested terrain,” the place where social classes, racial and ethnic groups, women and men, the powerful and the less powerful, seek to “control” images and themes. Topics include the Western; Cultural Heroes and the Cult of Individualism in the 1920s; The Hays Code and the Black Sox scandal; Mae West and the “New Women”: Advertising in an Age of Consumption; Gangsters and G-Men; and Jackie Robinson and the American Dilemma.

AMST 2020 treats the period from 1950 to the present as we examine best-sellers, films, sports and television, radio, ads, newspapers, magazines, and music. We try to better understand the ways in which popular culture shapes and/or reflects American values. The course also depicts popular culture as “contested terrain,” the place where social classes, racial and ethnic groups, women and men, the powerful and less powerful seek to “control” images and themes. Topics include The Honeymooners and 1950s television, soap operas; “gross-out” movies; Elvis; the Beatles, and Guns ’n Roses; gothic romances; and People Magazine and USA Today. "
2017,2011Cornell,AMST 2765 Cinema and Migration (also FILM/VISST 2765) (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. S. Haenni. The invention of cinema in the late 19th century coincided with major waves of migration to and within the United States. Immigrants from Eastern Europe are often said to have “invented” Hollywood; those from Southern Europe were among its first and most eager consumers. By migrating north, many African Americans simultaneously “migrated to the movies.” This course will start by looking at this confluence between migration and cinema: How did European immigrants shape an emerging Hollywood? How did African American migrants negotiate the new medium? How did newly emerging issues of diversity manifest themselves in terms of representation, production, and reception of the filmic image? What in the end does that tell us about the American film industry, its hold on the nation, and its global dominance? Such questions will provide a grounding for the exploration of case studies, and different immigrant groups later in the 20th and 21st centuries. (MV) "
2018,2011Cornell,"AMST 3240 Varieties of American Dissent, 1880 to 1990 (also HIST 3240) (HA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. N. Salvatore. (HI) The idea of dissent in American society raises a variety of images. Civil rights activists, striking workers, and student radicals of the 1960s are familiar enough symbols of dissent. But might we understand a Pentecostal believer, filled with the spirit of his or her God in critiquing contemporary society, as an example of American dissent? This course explores the varieties of economic, political, and cultural dissent in American between 1880 and 1990, and examines how understanding dissent in its specific historical context illuminates major aspects of American life and culture. (HI) "
2019,2011Cornell,AMST 3812 Edge Cities: Celluloid New York and Los Angeles (also ARCH/ FILM/VISST 3812) (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Haenni and M. Woods. Anchoring the east and west coasts, New York and Los Angeles have been celebrated and excoriated in films. On the edge literally and metaphorically, these cities seem to be about competing visions of urban form, culture, and modernity. And the iconic forms of New York (tenements and skyscrapers) and of Los Angeles (highways and suburban homes) have fascinated film makers from the 19th century to the present day. We will both evoke and complicate the contrast between New York and Los Angeles by mapping the intersections of each city with cinema. We explore how the urban experience has been said to give rise to particular cinematic forms and the ways in which cinematic styles may be translated into urban design. Topics may include density and sprawl; place and creativity; class and ethnicity; race and gender; culture and commercialism; industrial and media economies; and insularism and cosmopolitanism. Screenings will include documentary, experimental, and commercial films and cover such genres as early actualities, city symphonies, film noir, science fiction, etc. Readings will be drawn from theories and histories of film, urbanism, and architecture. Possible field trips. "

2021,2011Cornell,ANTHR 1200 Ancient Peoples and Places (also ARKEO 1200) @ # (HA-AS) ,Spring. 3 credits. J. Henderson. A broad introduction to archaeology—the study of material remains to answer questions about the human past. Case studies highlight the variability of ancient societies and illustrate the varied methods and interpretive frameworks archaeologists use to reconstruct them. This course can serve as a platform for both archaeology and anthropology undergraduate majors. 
2022,2011Cornell,ANTHR 1400 The Comparison of Cultures @ (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 3 credits. D. Holmberg. An introduction to cultural anthropology through ethnographies, or the descriptive accounts of anthropologists. Through readings and lectures, students acquaint themselves with a number of cultures from several parts of the world. The cultures range in form from those of small-scale tribal societies to those of state societies. Throughout the course, we attempt to make sense of exotic cultures in their own terms. Attention is focused on variation in cultural patterns as they are expressed in social, economic, and ritual practices. In this encounter, the principles of anthropology, as a comparative enterprise that poses distinct cultural systems in relief, will be developed. Fiction, films, and exercises supplement the formal anthropological materials. "
2023,2011Cornell,ANTHR 1300 or 1400. S–U grades only. ,"D. Holmberg. This course is intended for majors in anthropology, prospective majors. Each week a different member of the faculty in anthropology at Cornell will make a presentation on the nature of their work within the field and discuss their interests with students. The course is meant to introduce the range of approaches found within anthropology and help students in planning future course work. "
2024,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2400 Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues @ (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 3 credits. B. Perley. This course will introduce students to the meaning and significance of forms of cultural diversity for the understanding of contemporary issues. Drawing from films, videos, and selected readings, students will be confronted with different representational forms that portray cultures in various parts of the world, and they will be asked to examine critically their own prejudices as they influence the perception and evaluation of cultural differences. We shall approach cultures holistically, assuming the inseparability of economies, kinship, religion, and politics, as well as interconnections and dependencies between world areas (e.g., Africa, Latin America, the West). Among the issues considered: “political correctness” and truth; nativism and ecological diversity; race, ethnicity, and sexuality; sin, religion, and war; global process and cultural integrity. "
2025,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2428 Slavery and Human Trafficking # (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Fiskesjo. In this course we will study slavery and trafficking in human slaves in the world today, as well as its roots and history in Asia, Africa, as well as in medieval Scandinavia, and in America and Europe today. We will make use of anthropological perspectives to look at influential historical and Classical definitions of slavery, such as Aristotle’s idea of the “natural slave,” and ask how ownership and domination over fellow humans have been justified in different societies. While introducing themes of gender, race, ethnicity, etc., and basic philosophical issues regarding autonomy and dependence, we also examine the economic forces of exploitation in the floating world of economic migration, people smuggling, and human trafficking. "
2026,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2450 The Anthropology of Food and Cuisine @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Fajans. You are what you eat! This course examines the way food is produced, prepared, exchanged, presented, and given meaning in cultures around the world. It examines the symbolism of specific foodstuffs. Who prepares food and how is it done? Who feeds whom and how these relations are expressed and valued? In addition to looking at these questions we analyze ideas about commensality; how food is used in public contexts for presentation or exchange, and how food is a marker of gender, class, status, ethnicity, and identity. In addition to looking specifically at food, we analyze cultural ideas about gender, the body, and identity in terms of how these cultural patterns are produced and expressed through concrete activities like eating, fasting, and special diets. In this class we stress critical and comparative thinking about subjects we tend to take for granted. "
2027,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2520 Indonesia Today ,"Spring. 3 credits. M. Welker. Comprised of over 10,000 islands, Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country and has the world’s largest Muslim population. This culturally diverse country has a colorful history and a complex political and religious life. This course will draw together faculty from the fields of Anthropology, History, Government, Linguistics, Ethnomusicology, and History of Art to introduce students to scholarship and debates over Indonesia’s past, present, and future. "
2028,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2546 South Asian Religions in Practice @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 3 credits. A. Willford. This course offers an anthropological approach to the study of religious traditions and practices in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal). The course begins with a short survey of the major religious traditions of South Asia: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Islam. We look to the development of these traditions through historical and cultural perspectives. The course then turns to the modern period, considering the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization upon religious ideologies and practices. The primary focus of the course will be the ethnographic study of contemporary religious practices in the region. We examine phenomena such as ritual, pilgrimage, possession, devotionalism, monasticism, asceticism, and revivalism through a series of ethnographic case studies. In so doing, we also seek to understand the impact of politics, modernity, diasporic movement, social inequality, changing gender roles, and mass mediation upon these traditions and practices. "
2029,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3000 Introduction to Anthropological Theory (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. P. Nadasdy. This seminar course is designed to give anthropology majors an introduction to classical and contemporary social and anthropological theory and to help prepare them for upper-level seminars in anthropology. The seminar format emphasizes close reading and active discussion of key texts and theorists. The reading list will vary from year to year but will include consideration of influential texts and debates in 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century anthropological theory especially as they have sought to offer conceptual and analytical tools for making sense of human social experience and cultural capacities. "
2030,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3130 Latin American Forms of Colonial Possession @ # (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. C. Garces. The persistence of colonial relationships in Latin America will be interrogated in this course using methods drawn from ethnography, psychoanalysis, historiography, political theory, and experimental literature. Key to this line of inquiry is the anthropological problematization of metaphors and practices of possession. Our course readings will explore the psychological internalization of colonial domination; the political ceremonies of territorial sovereignty; the everyday rituals of personal enchantment and disenchantment; the occult applications of magic, witchcraft, and sorcery; and the historical processes of de- and re-colonization that mark notions of “possession” with such longstanding and fraught cross-cultural implications. This class will demonstrate how commonplace understandings of race, class, ethnicity, labor, gender, sexuality, subjectivity, personhood, religion, and the state gain shape and meaning through discourses of possession. "
2031,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3425 Anthropology of the University (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Greenwood. Turning an anthropological gaze on the contemporary university as a social and cultural system, this seminar involves an examination of the convergences and divergences between the trajectories of the sciences and engineering, the humanities, and the social sciences in contemporary universities and some international comparisons with the trajectories of universities around the world. The overall aim is to link an ethnographic analysis of the microstructures of departmental differentiation, professional hegemonies, and local financing with the larger-scale processes of transformation of universities’ place in society under the pressures of corporativization, globalization, and competition from a host of alternative higher education institutions. "
2032,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3447 Sport @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Sangren. Long overlooked by anthropologists, sport and recreation are increasingly recognized as important windows into culture. Sport can be approached from a number of directions— interpreted as a ritual; viewed as a spectacle of ethnic, regional, or national identity; seen as a metaphor for life; understood as a major industry. This course will consider these and other approaches to sport, encouraging students to bring their own involvements in sport to reflect not only upon sport itself, but also upon how such reflection can illuminate cultural, psychological, and political dimensions of social life. Why, for example, do we take sport (and other forms of recreation) so seriously? Why do many of us apparently invest more passion in such pursuits than to life’s allegedly more serious activities? How is sport integrated into people’s identities? Readings will draw from popular literature and media as well as academic writing from a variety of disciplines (psychology, sociology, history) in addition to anthropology. "
2033,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3462 Democratizing Research (also ANTHR 6462) (SBA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Greenwood. This course centers on a family of research approaches variously known as activist research, engaged research, community-based research, public scholarship, and action research. These are both alternatives to and critiques of the common forms of university-centered research that separate “expert” researchers from the subjects of research and claim that the quality of research can be determined only by trained academics. Participants in engaged research view research as a means of social learning. Most importantly, they are guided by democratic ideals and values, in pursuit of public purposes and interests. No course can cover the full range of approaches and so this course brings the different approaches to the attention of the students, shows what the strengths and weaknesses of each are, and exhibits the various strategies and methods "
2034,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3465 Anthropology of the Body (also ANTHR 6465) @ (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. S. Langwick. This course examines a range of texts that treat the body as the subject and object of cultural, technological, political, and ethical processes. Students investigate the cultivation of physical and social bodies through ethnographic and historical materials concerning healing and medicine, discipline and labor, governance and religion, aesthetics and desire. The production and reproduction of bodies and embodied practices have long been central to the way that power works. In this class, we will read and discuss a range of approach to the body. There is much contention over how work, politics, environment, technologies, and violence shape the body and the senses. We will debate how histories of the body are intertwined with histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, modernization, science, transnationalism, and the webs of institution, ideas, and capital that comprise these phenomena. Some readings will investigate the complex mediations that account for the body as icon, text, metaphor, commodity, and raw material. Others will contend that serious attention to the production and reproduction of the body across different times and spaces challenge traditional notions of materiality and physicality. Because every examination of the body rests—implicitly or explicitly—in a theoretical and methodological approach to experience, we will also explore the histories of bodily senses, appetites, and capabilities. Ultimately, our inquiry into contests over and reflections on “the body,” as well as specific bodies, aims to open up broader anthropological questions about authority, agency, sovereignties, and material life. "
2035,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3546 Asian Minorities (also ASIAN 3345) @ (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Fiskesjo. This course will survey the situation of ethnic minorities in several Asian countries. We will learn about their culture and history, their recognition, identity and political status, as well as various forms of discrimination. We will adopt a comparative perspective that enables us to understand minorities in different Asian countries such as China, Japan, Burma, Thailand and others, and also compare with the United States and elsewhere, as well as enabling a discussion of identity production, race, power, and ethnicity on the global arena. We’ll use a relational approach that includes understanding the majorities against whom the minorities are defined, as well as the political and historical background that will help explain the sometimes very different current situation for ethnic minorities in Asian countries. "
2036,2011Cornell,"ANTHR 3734 Brazil: Many Cultures, One Nation @ (CA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. J. Fajans. From the streets of Rio to the shores of the Amazon, anthropology studies the lives, communities, beliefs, practices, and politics of the diverse region known as Brazil. This course will look at issues of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, ritual, environment, development, and human rights across Brazil. We will examine rural and urban cultures, discuss African and European Influences, and explore the relations between indigenous and national cultures. In this context, we will look at the roles that religion, food, dress, soccer, samba, and carnival all play in producing this vibrant culture. "
2037,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4165 Anthropology of Humanitarianism ,"Spring. 4 credits. C. Garces. It is commonplace to hear that we live in a humanitarian age, but to what extent is humanitarianism coextensive with global and cultural politics today? This seminar will explore how institutions and governments identify “states of emergency” in order to safeguard populations and political alliances. Our readings will problematize gift exchange and the logic of sacrifice across charitable, philanthropic, and peacekeeping efforts. Key topics include the gendered dynamics of aid distribution; the impact of philanthropy on private-public balances of power; the role of displaced populations as biopolitical communities; and the democratic applications of charity to mask imperial resemblances. We will together challenge the ethical knot of using “voluntary actions” as the basis of normative political systems, highlighting contingencies and exploring paradoxes in humanitarian endeavors. "
2038,2011Cornell,"ANTHR 4415 Creolization, Syncretism, and Hybridity ","Spring. 4 credits. V. Munasinghe. The concepts of Creolization, Syncretism, and Hybridity all convey a state of “mixture” that assumes a diasporic situation. This course explores theories and empirical case studies of processes of racial, cultural, and religious mixture from an interdisciplinary perspective. The course explores the interconnections among concepts denoting “mixture” that have diverse originary points. The overarching line of inquiry is to explore the geneaologies of the three concepts as a necessary precursor to understanding how these terminologies may, in concert, illuminate different aspects of the dynamics structuring processes of mixture in different historical and ethnographic settings. "
2039,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4435 Postcolonial Science (also ANTHR 7435) @ (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Langwick. This course examines science and technology in so-called “non-Western” countries as well as the ways that science and technology are shaping new “transnational” or “global” relations. We will explore the post-colonial as a dynamic space that both plays off of and refigures the complicated dynamics of colonialism. The postcolonial challenges the dichotomies through which colonial power moved: western/indigenous, white/black, modern/traditional, global/local, developed/ underdeveloped, and science/non-science. At the same time, it confronts the ways in which colonial histories are still embodied in institutions, identities, environments, and landscapes. Techno-scientific knowledge and practice have both enacted colonial divisions and been called on in post-colonial struggles. How them might we understand the work of scientific knowledge and practice in the kinds of hegemonies and struggles that shape our world today? We will explore this question by examining the way that technoscience is performed—by scientists, development workers, activists, government officials, and others. The class will pay particular attention to the located processes through which claims to the universal or global emerge. In addition by considering controversies over the environment, medicine, and indigenous knowledge, we will consider the effects of such claims. "
2040,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4444 God(s) and the Market (also ANTHR 7444) @ (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. H. Miyazaki. One of the oldest and most powerful insights of anthropology is that different domains of society such as religion and economy shape and condition each other. We will discuss a variety of old and new anthropological explorations into the intersections of religion and economy, from Max Weber’s classical study of the relationship between Protestantism and the rise of capitalism to recent studies of the work of faith in financial markets. This seminar is intended to bring together students interested in religion and students interested in business and economy. "
2041,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4455 Anthropology in the Real World (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. Staff. This course is designed to expose students to the range of ways and fields within which practitioners employ anthropological theory, methods, and perspectives. Class format will include both seminar discussions and workshop sessions with invited speakers. Both the invited speakers and the discussion topics will represent different broadly defined fields in which anthropologists practice. Through class discussion and writing, students will be expected to critically consider such issues as research ethics, professional responsibility, the academic versus activist role, methodological practices, and the relationship between individual practitioners and the national, international, and organization contexts within which they work. Students will produce a major research paper examining a particular field of “practical” anthropology of their interest. "
2042,2011Cornell,ANTHR 4682 Healing and Medicine in Africa (also ASRC 4682) (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Langwick. The most baffling aspect of ethnicity is that while ethnic sentiments and movements gain ground rapidly within the international arena, the claim that ethnicity does not exist in any objective sense is also receiving increasing credence within the academic community. How can something thought “not to exist” have such profound consequences in the real world? In lay understandings, ethnicity is believed to be a “natural” disposition of humanity. If so, why does ethnicity mean different “things” in different places? Anthropology has much to contribute to a greater understanding of this perplexing phenomenon. After all, the defining criterion for ethnic groups is that of cultural distinctiveness. Through ethnographic case studies, this course will examine some of the key anthropological approaches to ethnicity. We will explore the relation ship of ethnicity to culture, ethnicity to nation, and ethnicity to state to better understand the role ethnicity plays in the identity politics of today. "
2043,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2015 Archaeology of Empires (also ARKEO 2015) @ # (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 3 credits. L. Khatchadourian. The word “empire” today evokes modern, capitalist, European, even American experiments in expansion and asymmetrical relations of power. This course considers the precursors of these modern imperialisms. It offers a comparative study of early empires of the Old and New Worlds, approached from an archaeological perspective. We confront broad theoretical problems of empire—what they are, what they do, why they fail—and address these problems through archaeological interventions into such topics as conquest, colonialism, kingship and ideology, identity and inequality, tolerance and domination, and the everyday workings of empire. Is the very concept of empire as a construct of political, social, or historical analysis useful across time and space? What is archaeology’s contribution to the study of these complex, expansive, and messy sociopolitical phenomena? "
2044,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2201 Early Agriculture (also ARKEO 2201) @ # (HA-AS) ,"Spring. 3 credits. N. Russell. Throughout most of the human career, people survived by hunting and gathering wild foods. The advent of food production is one of the most profound changes in (pre)history. This course examines the current evidence for the appearance and spread of agriculture (plant and animal domestication) around the world. We will consider definitions of agriculture and domestication, the conditions under which it arises, the consequences for those who adopt it, and why it has spread over most of the world. "
2045,2011Cornell,ANTHR 2215 Stone Age Art (also ARKEO 2215) # (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 3 credits. T. Volman. When did “art,” however defined, appear during the human career, how was it produced and for what purposes? These are some of the questions we will investigate through a survey of the discovery, validation, analysis, and interpretation of the earliest art. The course will cover a variety of finds from the Old World, including the well-known cave art of southwestern France and northern Spain, and also consider portable art and decoration. The contributions of new analytical techniques and interpretive approaches are highlighted. "

2050,2011Cornell,ANTHR 3305 Anthropology of Parenting @ (SBA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. M. Small. Human children are packets of genes that represent individual reproductive success. Like all animals, humans are selected by evolution to care for their offspring, but human infants and children require more intense parental investment than the offspring of most other species. Why is this so? Human parents are also influenced by cultural belief systems and ideology that play out in parenting styles. How do various belief systems influence parent-offspring interaction? In this course we will examine the human infant as a biologically designed organism that has co-evolved with caretakers, and then look at the various parenting styles across cultures that also mold our young.

2055,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6000 Proseminar: Culture and Symbol ,"Fall. 6 credits. H. Miyazaki. Focuses on an appreciation of symbolic, expressive, and representational forms and processes both as producers and products of social activities. Through the study of symbolic anthropology, structuralism, exchange, myth and ritual, religion, gender, personhood, linguistics, semiology, etc., the course investigates how identity and meaning are linked to the practical exigencies of social life. While emphasizing aspects of the discipline generally associated with cultural anthropology, the course endeavors to set the stage for a dialectical understanding of social, political, economic, and symbolic activities as interrelated phenomena. The works of de Saussure, Levi-Strauss, Dumont, Geertz, Victor Turner, Sahlins, among others, as well as contemporary theories are given careful attention. "
2056,2011Cornell,ANTHR 6010 Proseminar: Social Organization ,"Spring. 6 credits. M. Welker. Focuses on linkages between culture and social institutions, representations, and practices. The nature of these linkages is debated from strongly contesting points of view in social theory (structuralist, poststructuralist, utilitarian, hermeneutic, Marxist). Unlike debates in critical theory where the form of contestation has been mainly philosophical, in anthropology these issues have developed in ethnographic analyses. The course briefly surveys kinship theory and economic anthropology with a focus on implications for general issues in social theory. Discussion of attempts to develop dialectical syntheses around the motion of “practice” follows. The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which poststructuralist readings of history are counterposed to Marxist ones. Finally, Lacanian and Marxist visions of ideology as they relate to anthropological theory and ethnographic analysis are examined with particular emphasis on the cultural and social production of persons.

Drawing from anthropological theories on language, this course will look at the place of language as a signifying practice in the United States by focusing on the experience of Latino communities. Topics to be explored include linguistic diversity and change, accommodation and resistance, language maintenance and shift, linguistic ideologies, the production of language hierarchies, and institutional applications of language.

Subsequent production proved that secular creativity could cater for the needs of new audiences, like women and a semi-literate public, for whom it created a space. It evolved a conceptual vocabulary that anticipated the important achievements of the Renaissance. This literature was an integral constituent of European tradition. It also interacted in powerful ways with Near Eastern letters.

A hemispheric American Studies perspective will encourage thinking about and across cultural, linguistic, and national demarcations. This course proposes taking seriously words from Africa, passed on by the novelist Paule Marshall: “Once a great wrong has been done, it never dies. People speak the words of peace, but their hearts do not forgive. Generations perform ceremonies of reconciliation but there is no end.” Countering the literature of amnesia and baseless optimism, the works that we will read cannot forget, and decline to forgive, the historical traumas that so bitterly flavor them. Our concern largely will be with understanding the aesthetic strategies and innovations that these writers use to perform ceremonies not bent on reconciliation. "

As globalization draws the Americas ever closer together, reshaping our sense of a common (uncommon) American culture, what claims might be made for a distinctive, diverse “poetry of the Americas”?

2452,2011Cornell,ENGL 2511 Introduction to Women Writers (also FGSS 2510) (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. K. McCullough. What or who is a “woman writer”? What impact, if any, does gender have on writing? What questions are particularly urgent to these writers and what genres do they choose to use to explore them? Looking mostly at novels with the occasional foray into other genres, we will focus our broader exploration by a thematic focus on the relationships among individual, family, and community identities. How do the authors under discussion represent these relationships and to what extent do they represent them as shaped by vectors of identity such as nationality, region, race, gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity? Authors under consideration may include Dorothy Allison, Alison Bechdel, Charlotte Brontë, Lan Cao, Cristina Garcia, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Jean Rhys, and Virginia Woolf, among others. "
2453,2011Cornell,ENGL 2680 Culture and Politics of the 1960s (also AMST 2680) (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. P. Sawyer. Nearly half a century ago, the civil rights movement, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War stimulated critiques and alternative experiments in living that changed American society forever. What can the experiences of young “boomers” and others who lived through the 1960s teach a later generation living through a similar period of turmoil and hope? This interdisciplinary course combines an historical overview with the close reading of texts, concentrating on the topics of racial justice, war, the counterculture, the New Left, the women’s movement, and the movement for gay and lesbian rights. Texts will include The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Wolfe’s Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-5, music of Dylan and Joplin, speeches of King, films, manifestos, memoirs, and poems. A research paper will explore the history of activism at Cornell during those years. "
2454,2011Cornell,ENGL 2730 Children’s Literature (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. P. Brady. An historical study of children’s literature from the 17th century to the present, principally in Europe and America, which will explore changing literary forms in relation to the social history of childhood. Ranging from oral folktale to contemporary novelistic realism (with some glances at film narrative), major figures may include Perrault, Newbery, the Grimms, Andersen, Carroll, Alcott, Stevenson, Burnett, Kipling, the Disney studio, E. B. White, C. S. Lewis, Sendak, Silverstein, Mildred Taylor, and Bette Greene. We’ll also encounter a variety of critical models—psychoanalytic, materialist, feminist, structuralist—that scholars have employed to explain the variety and importance of children’s literature. Finally, we will consider how the idea of “the child” has evolved over this period. "
2455,2011Cornell,ENGL 2750 Poetry and Song (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. R. Gilbert. Does poetry scare you? If so, you’re not alone. Yet think about this: we all carry bits of poetry around with us, in the form of song lyrics. In this class we’ll explore the meeting ground of these two major art forms, considering both similarities and differences between printed poems and lyrics. Our main focus will be on the intricacies of language and verse form that make for a great lyric, whether by Bob Dylan, Dolly Parton, or Stephen Sondheim. We’ll also look at poems that aspire to the condition of song by such poets as William Blake, Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot, and Langston Hughes. Our examples will be drawn from many genres, including folk ballads, blues, Broadway, country, rock, and rap. "
2456,2011Cornell,"ENGL 2760 Desire (also COML/FGSS 2760, THETR 2780) (LA-AS) ","Spring. 4 credits. E. Hanson. “Language is a skin,” the critic Roland Barthes once wrote: “I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.” Sexual desire has a history, even a literary history, which we will examine through an introductory survey of European dramatic literature from Plato and Aristophanes to Jean Genet and Caryl Churchill, as well as a survey of classic readings in Western sexual theory from the Ancient Greeks through Freud and Foucault to contemporary feminism and queer theory. Topics for discussion will include Greek pederasty, Christian mysticism, hysteria, sadomasochism, pornography, cybersex, and other performative pleasures. "
2457,2011Cornell,ENGL 2780 Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger (also FGSS 2780) (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Raskolnikov. We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted. Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This course looks at how the idea of “the body” gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called “gender,” “sexuality,” and “race”? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We’ll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film (Freaks, Hedwig and the Angry Inch), and the history of science. "
2458,2011Cornell,ENGL 2901 Utopia: From Thomas More to Philip K. Dick (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Mann. A “utopia” is an imaginary world, a fantastical “no-place” that conveys important truths about the real world. This course surveys the literary genre of utopia from the Renaissance to today, focusing on writers who invent new worlds through fiction. In Thomas More’s Utopia, we explore utopia’s emergence in the 16th century in response to European political upheaval and New World exploration, then turn to how British and American writers transform utopian visions in the following centuries. Finally, we consider how utopia is reworked in science fiction’s paradoxical emphasis on both fantasy and realism. Topics include the politics of gender, technology in a perfect society, and the wildly inventive forms of utopian fiction by Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, Jonathan Swift, Aldous Huxley, Ursula LeGuin, and Philip K. Dick. "

2463,2011Cornell,ENGL 3390 Jane Austen # (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. H. Shaw. It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a student who has read Jane Austen must be in want of excuses to continue that delicious experience. This course explores Austen’s characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems that resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen’s alluring mystique, her importance in literary history, and her continuing attraction in the 21st century. By immersing ourselves in her fictional worlds, we will enrich our experience of her novels and sharpen our awareness of the pleasures of reading. "
2464,2011Cornell,ENGL 3490 Shakespeare and Europe (also COML 3480) # (LA-AS) ,Fall. 4 credits. May be used as one of the three pre-1800 courses required of English majors. W. Kennedy. 
2465,2011Cornell,ENGL 3500 The High Modernist Tradition (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Schwarz. Critical study of major works by Hardy, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, Yeats, Wilde, Pound, and others. While the emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism (mostly but not exclusively in England), and relate literary modernism in England to that in Europe and America as well as to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture; on occasion, we shall look at slides. Within the course material, students will be able to select the topics on which they write essays. "
2466,2011Cornell,ENGL 3571 The Modern Irish Writers (CA-AS) ,"Spring 4 credits. K. Attell. This is a course on Irish writing of the modern period. In our readings over the semester (which will include some of the 20th century’s greatest literary texts), we will cover the development of Irish writing from the Yeats-led Irish Revival of the century’s early years through Joyce’s high modernist virtuosity to the proto-postmodernisms of O’Brien and Beckett. Along the way we will also examine how Irish modernism raises fundamental questions about such things as the relation between language and national identity; the nature of modernism’s “newness”; colonial, postcolonial, and “semicolonial” culture; the political uses of literature; and the contending forces of cosmopolitanism and nationalism in the modern period. "
2467,2011Cornell,FGSS 3620) (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. M. Pryse. What does it mean that some people still fly the Confederate flag while others vehemently protest it? How do Southern writers help us to understand sectional division and regional identity? Proposing that Southern history and culture embody fundamental social contradictions—about race, but also about gender and class—this course will consider black and white, male and female Southern writers from the Civil War to the pre-Civil Rights era and beyond. We will read first-person narratives and novels by Harriet Jacobs, Mark Twain, Charles Chesnutt, Kate Chopin, Lillian Smith, Flannery O’Connor, Richard Wright, William Faulkner, and Alice Walker. Students will write short papers to be shared and a longer final paper. "
2468,2011Cornell,ENGL 3622 Appalachian Cultural Studies (also AMST/FGSS 3622) (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. M. Pryse. When Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs wrote the theme song for The Beverly Hillbillies, did they contribute to stereotyping mountain people or did they focus national attention on regional identity? Appalachian writers, together with musicians, have worked to define their heritage while they explore the social, economic, and environmental tensions in the region. This course will interweave fiction by Appalachian writers Rebecca Harding Davis, Cormac McCarthy, and Bobbie Ann Mason (among others) with literary journalism (Michael Schnayerson’s Coal River), documentary film, Bluegrass music (Bill Monroe, Hazel Dickens), music cultural studies (Robert Cantwell’s Bluegrass Breakdown), and recent legal briefs concerning the future of mountaintop removal coal mining. Students will write two short papers and one longer paper. "
2469,2011Cornell,ENGL 3700 The Victorian Novel # (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Faulkner. Jane Austen and zombies, A Christmas Carol in 3D, an orgy of PBS miniseries: why is the 19th century so un-dead? The plot of the British novel—sexual betrayal, pathological greed and revenge, the sadistic damage wrought on helpless children—reflects wrenching social and technological transformations whose global sweep rivals that of our own era’s conflicts. Intertwining domestic and imperial spaces, realistic fiction embodied the most innovative attempt to grasp and contain such seismic shifts in an entertaining idiom for a rising mass readership. These works refract the cultural anxieties of the age and suggest sources of redemption. We can take pleasure in them even as we critically analyze how the Victorians live now. Likely authors include Austen, Dickens, Brontë, Eliot, Hardy, Conrad. "
2470,2011Cornell,ENGL 3703 Reading Joyce’s Ulysses (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Schwarz. A thorough episode-by-episode study of the art and meaning of Joyce’s masterwork Ulysses. We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce’s canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism— especially painting and sculpture—and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel—specifically, Joyce’s response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce’s role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce’s response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture. No previous experience with Joyce is required. "
2471,2011Cornell,ENGL 3732 Reading for Writers (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. E. Quinonez. The bulk of this course will be reading novels, short stories, and poems. However, there will be many craft lessons discussing narrative techniques, especially those used in film. We will watch a clip and break the scene down to figure out how a director is manipulating the narrative to tell a story. Then we will see the same manipulation being pulled off, only this time within a different medium, on paper. Good storytelling is good storytelling, and the same narrative techniques or, better said, tricks that are used in film can be applied to our fiction. "
2472,2011Cornell,ENGL 3745 Fiction and Film Noir (also FILM 3745) (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. I. Balfour. Detectives, blondes, hired guns, cheap booze, and city streets “dark with something more than night”: this course takes up examples of film noir and noir fiction, mostly from the 1940s and 1950s, often pairing a literary original with its filmic adaptation. We will be interested in the traffic between literature and film, as well as the specificity of the medium. Singular examples are read in the light of notions of “noir” as a genre and a style. Texts from Patricia Highsmith, Raymond Chandler, James Cain, and others are paired with films by Hitchcock, Hawks, the Coen Brothers, and more. Topics to include: corruption (governmental, individual), betrayal, guilt, the lures of ambiguity, the more or less mythical femme fatale, and other matters of life and death. "
2473,2011Cornell,ENGL 3762 Law and Literature: The Jury as Audience ,"Fall. 4 credits. B. Meyler. The jury is purportedly “the bulwark of democracy,” but it has also been seen as the most potentially destabilizing component of the Anglo-American legal system. Literature, drama, and TV crime shows have helped to form these competing views of the jury. How and why have plays compared jurors with spectators? How were 19th-century trial reports like and unlike novels, and how did jurors read both? Has the alleged “CSI effect” really made contemporary American juries demand more forensic evidence? This course will explore these and related questions in historical and legal context. Works studied may include Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, Daniel Defoe’s Moll Flanders, Wilkie Collins’s The Law and the Lady, Susan Glaspell’s “A Jury of Her Peers,” Anna Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles, and CSI. "
2474,2011Cornell,ENGL 3765 Literature of the Black Atlantic (also ASRC 3765) (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Woubshet. This course will examine literature from the contemporary black Atlantic world, including Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. We will ask: what are the salient themes that define the writing of contemporary black authors? What are the different articulations of blackness that emerge in this wide constellation? What forms of difference—nationality, region, gender, sexuality, etc.—inform contemporary black identities? How are the different modes of globalization, such as satellite media, altering the intercourse between the various black Atlantic worlds? Authors will include Toni Morrison, Jamaica Kincaid, Thomas Glave, Edwidge Danticat, Derek Walcott, Isaac Julien, Ben Okri, Uzodinma Iweala, and Dinaw Mengistu. "
2475,2011Cornell,AMST 3773) (CA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. M. Crawford. How do visual art, theater, music, poetry, and novels come together in particular cultural movements? How does the modernism of the 1920s and ’30s differ from the experimentations that shaped the 1960s and ’70s? How are artists influenced by social movements? How does art influence the very direction of social movements? This course will compare the 1920s and ’30s Harlem Renaissance and the 1960s and ’70s Black Arts movement. Both social movements produce a stunning interplay of words, images, music, dance, assimilation, and resistance. The selected artists may include Josephine Baker, Nella Larsen, Langston Hughes, Sun Ra, James Brown, Amiri Baraka, Gil Scott-Heron, Nikki Giovanni, Romare Bearden, and the AfriCobra collective. "
2476,2011Cornell,"ENGL 3980 Latina(o) Popular Culture (also LSP 3980, AMST 3981) (CA-AS) ","Fall. 4 credits. M. P. Brady. This course will explore Latino/a cultural work including music, film, websites, comics, television, lowriders, and art. We will consider how this work emerges in the context of U.S. engagements with Latin America and in the context of struggles for social and economic equality among ethnoracial groups in the United States. We will also study the relationship between cultural production, representation, and public policy. U.S. Latino/a history is strongly recommended as a prerequisite, but not required. "
2477,2011Cornell,ENGL 4020 Literature as Moral Inquiry (KCM-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. S. Mohanty. What can literary works, especially novels, tell us about moral issues? Should they be seen as suggesting a form of moral inquiry similar to the kind of philosophical discussion we get in, say, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics? Can reading philosophical works in ethics together with novels that deal with similar themes help us understand these themes better? This course is an attempt to answer these questions. We will read selections from Aristotle, Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche, and use these works to help us understand the nature of moral inquiry in novels like Eliot’s Middlemarch, Coetzee’s Disgrace, Morrison’s Beloved, Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, and Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. Other writers we will most probably read include Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Kazuo Ishiguro. "
2478,2011Cornell,ENGL 4090 Theories of Popular Culture (also ENGL 6090) (CA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. J. Juffer. Why study popular culture? Although it is often equated with mass culture and perceived to be unworthy of academic study, this course argues that popular culture is an important site for the production of both pleasure and politics. We consider a range of theoretical approaches and read a spectrum of cultural critics and theorists, from those who equate the popular with the “folk” and the marginalized to those who explore the highly mediated and commercialized aspects of the popular. We look across media and its sites— television, film, the porn industry, baseball, popular music, and Starbucks coffee shops. Studies of texts will be located in economic, political, and social contexts. Also, we ask what feelings of desire, pleasure, fear, and disgust does popular culture generate? "
2479,2011Cornell,ENGL 4212 Literature and the Scientific Revolution in England # (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. J. Mann. “I trust nothing but on the faith of my eyes”: Francis Bacon’s declaration became a central tenet of philosophical inquiry during the 17th century, as gentlemen and artisans began to collect specimens, dissect bodies, and survey the physical universe. This course explores how the new experimental “science” reverberated in imaginative productions in the age of Shakespeare and Milton. How did poetry and fiction find room for the growing domain of “fact”? Why did Englishmen focus this new scientific gaze on “curiosities” such as the human cadaver, the hermaphrodite, and the New World Indian? In surveying the major developments in English scientific thought before the Enlightenment, the interdisciplinary readings in this course will also introduce students to important literary and philosophical texts from the Renaissance. "
2480,2011Cornell,ENGL 4500 History of the Book # (HA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. K. Reagan. This course provides an overview of the book as a material and cultural artifact. Focusing on the era of the printed book (post-1450) in Europe and America, we examine the invention and spread of printing and publishing, and the evolution of book design, illustration, and binding. The course places an emphasis on practical tools for the identification and analysis of books and other printed artifacts, especially for literary students. Investigations and assignments are built around hands-on interaction with examples of Cornell Library’s rare books, manuscripts, and related materials. This course meets in the Carl A. Kroch Library. "
2481,2011Cornell,JWST 4580) (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Schwarz. What is the role of the literary imagination in keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive for our culture? We shall examine major and widely read Holocaust narratives that have shaped the way we understand and respond to the Holocaust. We shall begin with first person reminiscences—Wiesel’s Night, Levi’s Survival at Auschwitz, and The Diary of Anne Frank—before turning to realistic fictions such as Kineally’s Schindler’s List (and Spielberg’s film), Kertesz’s Fateless, Kosinski’s The Painted Bird, and Ozick’s “The Shawl.” We shall also read the mythopoeic vision of Schwarz-Bart’s The Last of the Just, the illuminating distortions of Epstein’s King of the Jews, the Kafkaesque parable of Appelfeld’s Badenheim 1939, and the fantastic cartoons of Spiegelman’s Maus books.

2482,2011Cornell,ENGL 4600 Melville (also AMST 4600) # (LA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. B. Maxwell. An American whose life and writing ranged over the globe, Herman Melville (in the estimation of C.L.R. James) “saw the tendency of things.” Our study of the fiction and poetry will turn on some of those “things” of modernity that most obsessively engaged Melville’s representational and critical capacities: slavery; illegitimate authority; exterminationist policy directed against American Indians; capitalism; orphanhood and homelessness; imperialism; the attempted occultation of women; the shifting terrain of male comradeship; and the ambivalent resort to religion. We will be interested in testing the premise that Melville charted the fault lines of his world with an “unenrolled” critical acuity unparalleled in United States literature. "
2483,2011Cornell,ENGL 4660 James on Film (LA-AS) ,"Spring. 4 credits. D. Fried. Henry James’s psychologically probing tales of betrayal, delusion, and tragically misdirected freedom pose a powerful challenge for screen adaptation. Analysis of selected films based on James’s novels involves close reading of these extraordinary texts as well as examination of screenplay form, verbal and visual styles of narrative, and larger questions of the expectations of moviegoers and readers. Study of James’s aspirations as a dramatist, his writings on theater, photography, painting, and fiction, and controversies about the interpretation of the novels contribute to understanding how James’s stories have been retold by filmmakers. Novels/films may include Daisy Miller, Washington Square/The Heiress, The Bostonians, The Turn of the Screw/The Innocents, and The Portrait of a Lady or The Wings of the Dove. "

This course will explore the internationalization of the field that marked Cultural Studies endeavors from the 1970s on, especially its articulation in sites such as Australia, the Far East (Hong Kong, among other centers) and, of course, the United States. How has the global reach of Cultural Studies changed how we think about culture, about the constructions of group identity, and about the social conditions in which artifacts are consumed and assigned value? The animating question for this course is: what is the standing of Cultural Studies for our moment? How can Cultural Studies provide us with the analytical tools for thinking about how we engage the world on an everyday basis? "

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, space, and popular culture. Ranging across media—film, literature, television, and music—the class analyzes how these different forms represent and constitute gendered and sexed bodies. How does the Lifetime channel, for example, represent itself as a woman’s space? Spike as a man’s space? Are these distinctions breaking down, resulting in more hybrid genres? How do race, ethnicity, age, and class figure in? We connect media to sites of production, distribution, and consumption, such as the theater, the home, and cyberspace with particular emphasis on the affective and often passionate realm of "

In addition to nourishing the body, food operates as a cultural system that produces and reflects group and individual identities. In this class we will examine foodways—the behaviors and beliefs attached to the production, distribution, and consumption of food—to explore the way food practices help shape our sense of gender, race, sexual orientation, and national identity. In doing so we will focus primarily on literature and film but will also range into the fields of anthropology, sociology, and history. Some questions under discussion: How do factors such as gender, class, race, and religion shape the foods we eat and the circumstances in which we eat them? How do writers use the language of food to explore issues such as gender, sexuality, class, and race? "

Some of the most powerful approaches to visual practices have come from outside or from the peripheries of the institution of art history and criticism. This seminar will analyze the interactions between academically sanctioned disciplines (such as iconography and connoisseurship) and innovations coming from philosophy, psychoanalysis, historiography, sociology, literary theory, mass media criticism, feminism, and Marxism. We will try especially to develop: (1) a general theory of “visual ideology” (the gender, social, racial, and class determinations on the production, consumption, and appropriation of visual artifacts under modern and postmodern conditions); and (2) contemporary theoretical practices that articulate these determinations. Examples will be drawn from the history of oil painting, architecture, city planning, photography, film, and other mass media. "

This graduate seminar provides a basic introduction to the thinking of Nietzsche and Heidegger, and to the latter’s interpretation and appropriation of the former. A major concern is the articulation of philosophy and politics, particularly in the case of Heidegger. We are also interested in the types of argumentation and styles of writing of both thinkers, including in light of the hypothesis that they were working in the ancient tradition of prudent exotericism, viz. that they never wrote exactly what they thought and that they intended their influence to come slightly beneath the level of conscious apprehension. We also consider their impact on the long list of intellectuals across the “Left-Center-Right” spectrum, including (depending on seminar-participant interest): Adorno, Agamben, Bataille, Badiou, Bourdieu, Butler, Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, Gadamer, Irigaray, Klossowski, Löwith, Marcuse, Rorty, Leo Strauss, Vattimo, Zupancic.

Why is war a recurring feature of international politics? Are democracies more peaceful than other types of states, and if so what explains this “democratic peace”? Why do democratic publics seem to reward threats to use force by “rallying around the flag” in support of their governments? Does the inexorable pattern of the rise and fall of nations lead to cycles of great power wars throughout history? These and other questions will be examined in our survey of theories of war at three levels of analysis: the individual and small groups, domestic politics, and the international system.

In this course, we will explore the roots of these controversies and follow the logics and economics of their development and deployment. We will try to identify the fundamental underpinnings of various arguments for and against the use of transgenic crops as a tool for agricultural development.

By scholars, it is often used as a synonym for “structuralism,” which it need not be. In this course, we will look closely at the tradition of realism in IR theory, both to find out exactly what realism does stand for, and in order to better understand world politics more generally. "

2543,2011Cornell,GOVT 6075 Field Seminar in Political Thought: The Enlightenment ,"Fall. 4 credits. I. Kramnick. The topic for the field seminar in political thought this year will be the Enlightenment. We will read and discuss central texts of 18th-century Enlightenment thought, including texts by Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Condorcet, Hume, Smith, Burke, Paine, and Kant. We will explore the political dilemmas to which these Enlightenment texts responded—such as political theology, feudalism, and absolutist monarchy—and critically evaluate their attempts to establish a more secular, rational, and democratic form of politics. Was there a single Enlightenment? How do we characterize it? How do we assess its political, moral, and philosophical legacies? "
2544,2011Cornell,GOVT 6171 Politics of Public Policy ,"Spring. 4 credits. S. Mettler. Much of the literature that comprises the field of policy analysis is characterized by antipathy to politics: scholars attempt to excise political battles and concerns from their studies in order to advance a “rational” portrayal of how policies do or should function. Yet, public policies are, themselves, inherently political. They are defined through political processes, designed and implemented in the context of political institutions, and they in turn shape the character of politics and public life. This course entails the examination and evaluation of a variety of approaches to policy analysis, all of which are united by their inclination to take politics seriously. Readings have been included that comprise variations of rational choice, institutionalist, historical, behavioral, and interpretivist analyses. The first part of the course examines different models of the policy process that may inform policy analysis. The second part of the course investigates policymaking processes and institutions and examines stages of the policy process, including public mobilization, policy definition, agenda setting, and policy design and implementation. Special attention is given to the American system, focusing on policymaking institutions, processes and outcomes in that context, but students who focus on other nations or international system may also find the course useful. The course concludes with an examination of how policies, once created, may in turn restructure political processes and shape policies adopted subsequently. "

This course is concerned with understanding how and under what conditions citizens seek to influence political elites through use, expansion, circumvention or subversion of existing channels of political participation. Cases from a variety of institutional contexts over time will be used to examine how mediating institutions diminish and/or exacerbate social inequalities in the exercise of political voice. We will consider readings from both the United States and comparative contexts to examine and dominant conceptions in the political participation literature. "

This course examines the role of international law in influencing states’ behavior regarding issues related to war and human rights. It draws on literature in the fields of international relations and law to study such questions as: why states comply with international law; under what conditions legal norms become customary and widely accepted; under what conditions long-standing legal norms become undermined; and what is the relative influence in shaping the law of state practice, the efforts of non-state actors and popular movements, and the opinions of legal professionals? Much of the substantive focus of the course will be on the development of international humanitarian law and human-rights law, and the impact of the “War on Terror.” "

We will begin with Hart’s classic work, The Concept of Law, and then consider Dworkin’s criticisms. Then we will make a detour to the Rawls versus Sen debate to place “meta” questions pertaining to distributive justice, rights, and deliberation on the table. Returning to legal theory, we will consider Michelman’s work on Rawls, social rights, and the constitution, and Cover’s theory of plural nomian fields. Dworkin’s confidence in the judiciary raises serious questions about the role of judicial review in a liberal democratic society; we will consider the critical approaches of Waldron, Tushnet, and Siegal in this regard. Finally, we will read several works from the critical race theory field; in the fall 2010 version of this course, we will concentrate on the writings of Derrick Bell. "
2558,2011Cornell,HIST 1500 History of the Present (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. D. Magaziner. The present is a confusing place. It is as big as the rise of China and India, as small as the phone in your pocket, as global as the worldwide movement for gay rights, as local as the immigrant family that just moved in next door. It is as abstract as devastating events a world away and as personal as evolving ethical norms about what is right and just and fair. History of the Present pauses time and asks “how did we get here?” Through fiction, film, and other media, we will explore how the past helps to explain the present. "

How do we make sense of the recent controversies around Islam and the “veil” in France, the reform of the Welfare State in Great Britain, the anti-globalization protests in Davos, the rise of demagogic anti-immigrant parties from the Netherlands to Italy, or the fact that Swedes get more than thirty paid days off per year? This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May ’68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestoes, films, and art), we will consider why “old Europe” is still relevant for us today. (EM) "

A survey of the social, political, cultural, and economic history of Latin America from roughly 1800 to the present. Primary aim is to develop a mental map of the history of Latin America—of prominent themes issues; of historical eras and trajectories. Given the vastness of Latin America, and its somewhat arbitrary composition as an object of study, the approach of the course is thematic and chronological rather than regional. We will pay attention to a number of more specific and interconnected themes: the development of, and relationship between, economies and processes of state formation; the complex roles Britain and the United States have played in the region, but always with an appreciation for how Latin Americans have shaped their own histories and those of the United States and Britain; the ways in which non-elites— slaves, workers, peasants, among others—have shaped history; the politics of the production of history; and Latin America’s “situatedness” in a broader world.

This course will examine the practice of “microhistory” as a method for understanding early-modern European culture and society. Microhistory as a genre of history writing has been most strongly developed by early-modern European historians and has largely dealt with the everyday lives of marginal but otherwise ordinary people—criminals, heretics, witches, lovers, peasants, and artisans. Students in this seminar will read exemplary contributions to the genre in an attempt to analyze the successes and shortcomings of this approach to history writing. Written assignments will ask students to theorize the relationship between everyday life and macrohistorical phenomena, to analyze specific microhistories, and to write their own microhistories based on primary sources such as memoirs and court cases.

A writing-intensive, interdisciplinary sophomore seminar on the United States-Mexico border. The study of borders, and specifically of the United States-Mexico border, requires us to cross the disciplinary and methodological borders of academe itself. The proliferation of provocative writings on the border in recent years bears this assumption out: in no other field of study has the literature been so remarkably interdisciplinary; so methodologically eclectic; nor so theoretically provocative. This seminar intends to tap that literature to help students analyze and understand the histories, cultures and representations of the border that are so important to contemporary self-fashioning and policy-making in the United States and Mexico. Students can expect to write several papers of varying lengths that will develop their skills in historical research and textual criticism. (AM) "

The period covered will span half a century, approximately from the early 1880s to the late 1920s. This means the course treats both Imperial and Soviet Russia and will try to think these two together under the general heading of “Russian modernity.” What happened to the intelligentsia over the course of these turbulent years? How did modernization, revolution, war, and the construction of the world’s first socialist society affect the intelligentsia’s composition, political thought, literature, and art (including cinema)?

The Indian Ocean was the first oceanic basin that supported large-scale cross-cultural contact for mankind. These warm tropical waters saw peoples from East Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Sub-Continent, and Southeast Asia all meet and mix over many centuries. The course will look at these histories of contact, spanning maritime studies, archaeological perspectives, winds and weather patterns (including the vital monsoons), religious migrations (including Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam), and the history of commerce (such as the Spice Trade). We will ask how the Indian Ocean became a crucial canvas for painting human history over vast, oceanic distances. Open to students interested in world history and its regional variants. (AS) "

This course will examine the role of antisemitism in 19th- and 20th-century European ideological, political, and socioeconomic developments. Attention will be paid to the way in which antisemitism illuminates the underside of European history, allowing us to see how anti-Jewish intolerance and prejudice becomes embedded in the worldviews of significant sectors of the European populations, culminating in the Holocaust. Topics will include the Christian roots of antisemitism and the extent to which modern antisemitism marks a break with the medieval past; the politicization of antisemitism by both Left and Right; the role of antisemitism in socioeconomic conflicts linked to the rise of capitalism; Jewish responses to antisemitism; antisemitism in the Nazi and Fascist revolutions; and contemporary interpretations of antisemitism.

2578,2011Cornell,HIST 2431 Postcolonial Memories and Politics of History @ (HA-AS) ,"Fall. 4 credits. K. Hirano. Postcolonial studies, which seek to uncover and (re-)articulate repressed voices, memories, and experiences of colonized peoples around the world, have altered the way we understand history. They have brought about the recognition that the historical profession and its mode of knowledge production have been deeply complicit with colonial strategies of domination and violence. This new recognition challenges the normative understanding of history as a discipline devoted to the objective reconstruction of the past enabled by scrupulous efforts to gather data and facts. If historical knowledge is not as “objective” as assumed, it follows that “date” and “facts” are not free from values and subjective judgment. Nor can history reveal the truth about the past. Rather, data/facts themselves constitute a certain type of narrative (that is, they are always already value-ridden) and authors of history select facts and data according to their judgments and criteria in order to explain the causes, effects, processes, and consequences of events they study. In this seminar, by paying attention to this epistemological predicament of history, we will examine the relationship between history and colonialism, and try to imagine a critical and self-reflective mode of historical inquiry based on the insights of Postcolonial Studies.

Charlemagne (Charles the Great, 775–814) is still revered as “the Father of Europe.” In his time as king of the Franks and then emperor of the West, we see for the first time with any clarity the shape of Europe as it would remain for a millennium and more, also of the structures and cultural mix that would characterize the West before there were a France, Germany, or United Kingdom. The “Carolingian Renaissance” promoted a brief but fruitful burst of writings and artifacts, including an intimate if slippery Life of Charlemagne and much better documentation of the public and to an extent even the everyday life of the age.

This is a lecture and discussion course focusing on how China has encountered the world since the 17th century, with an emphasis on the late 19th and 20th centuries. In particular, it will analyze the age-old Chinese “Central Kingdom” conception and how the conception was challenged during modern times as the result of Western and Japanese incursion and China’s inability to deal with the consequences of the incursion. It will further analyze the impact of the Chinese “victim mentality” in order to pursue a deeper understanding of why radical revolutions have dominated China’s modern history. While the emphasis of this course is China’s external relations, foreign policy issues will be examined in the context of China’s political, economic and social developments in broader terms. The course’s purpose is not just to impart information but also to cultivate a basic understanding of the significance of the Chinese experience in the age of worldwide modernization.

This course targets the intelligent student seeking an accelerated entrance to the formative period of Western Civilization during the Middle Ages. It therefore aims to convey what was significant in that area of the “West” that became Europe, between the end of the Roman Empire in the West and the Renaissance, say 395–1450. Students may expect to gain a basic knowledge of the events and institutions of Medieval Christendom. The real and more ambitious goal is, however, to introduce some of the choicer aspects of the medieval world, those judged most likely to intrigue, delight, and satisfy. This Medieval Sampler is like a classic French hors d’oeuvre, in that it presents for the discriminating palate some of the very best dishes known to the chef. Among these dishes figure Beliefs, Gender and Power Relations, Economics (Greed and Subsistence), Arts and Entertainments (Architecture, Literature, Music, Painting), even some Deviance and Protest.

Chinese discourses have long linked the circulation of cosmic energies, political power, and bodily vitalities. In these models political order, spiritual cultivation, and health are achieved and enhanced through harmonizing these flows across the levels of Heaven-and-Earth, state, and humankind.

Their authority becomes apparent in that they were constantly adapted to changing social, political, cultural, etc. conditions. Although this seems to be a widely accepted definition so far, it is deeply influenced by Greek tradition. Not only is the term mythos (word, tale) Greek, but the ubiquity of Greek gods, heroes, and their deeds in ancient literature and material culture has given myths an importance they might not have had in other cultures.
