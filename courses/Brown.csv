357,Brown,CLAS 0010. The Greeks.,"From poetry to philosophy, from music to economics to political theory, itis hard to find a subject of study that did not originate with the Greeks, atleast in word. Biology? Greek. Physics? Still Greek. Math? Technology?Gym? You guessed it. Since we cannot escape the Greeks, in this classwe will be on the lookout for them, reading the first classics of Westernliterature and discussing the great ideas behind them. All texts read inEnglish."
358,Brown,CLAS 0210B. Death in Ancient Greece.,"Examines how ancient Greeks understood, described, and experienceddeath. Making use of sources in translation, considers how death isanticipated, imagined, feared, and sometimes sought. Also contrastsclassical ideas with current experiences in our own society in order tosee whether and how our assumptions concerning death are culturallydetermined. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students."
359,Brown,CLAS 0210T. Travelers in Greece: from Pausanias to ShirleyValentine.,"Ever since Pausanias the Periegete wrote his ""Description of Greece""in the 2nd century CE, travelers have been inspired both to see thesights of Greece and to narrate their travels. The subject of this courseis travel narratives about Greece, and our own journey will lead us tosites throughout the country. Yet we will also be using these narratives aslaunchpads for exploring the imaginary and imagined power of the Greeklandscape: from its ancient status as seat of the gods to its modern appealas a land of anonymity, relaxation and freedom for the wearied 'westerner'."
360,Brown,CLAS 0660. The World of Byzantium.,"Caught between the East and West, the culture of Byzantium inheritedthe ancient worlds of Greece, Rome, and Jerusalem, nurturing many amodern ideology, conflict, and identity. Byzantium is explored throughits history, texts, and art. We examine the foundation and history ofConstantinople, Iconoclasm, the Crusades, medieval Christianity andIslam, Byzantine court life, concepts of gender, self, and sexuality."
361,Brown,CLAS 0750. Gender and Sexuality in Classical Antiquity.,"This course will analyze women in classical Greek and Roman societyand literature. Using gender as a critical tool, we will examine Greekand Roman women in various sources, from Homeric epics and publicinscriptions to scathing Roman satire. These sources show how theGreeks and Romans defined normative gender categories and how theyused these categories as a vehicle for social and political criticism. Wewill cover both social history and gender discourse, focusing especially onthe body and sexuality as a site for power. The limitations imposed by thesource materials, both literary and non-literary, will be a topic of discussionthroughout, as well as the relation of these ideas to contemporaryconstructions of gender."
362,Brown,CLAS 0765. Witches and Vixens: Nasty Women in Ancient Greeceand Rome.,"What do video vixens and Foxy Brown have in common with ""WitchyWoman""? These modern metaphors continue a long history of equatingfemale sexual allure with dangers found in/or capable of subvertingNature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make senseof similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how dothe Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class,and/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categorieshelp distinguish what is ""natural"" from ""unnatural""? To what end doesthis discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or otheraspects of ""civilization""?"
363,Brown,CLAS 0810A. Alexander the Great and the Alexander Tradition.,"This course focuses on a single historical figure, Alexander the Great,using him as a point of departure for exploring a wide range of problemsand approaches that typify the field of Classical Studies. How knowledgeof Alexander has been used and abused provides a fascinating case studyin the formation and continuous reinterpretation of the western Classicaltradition."
364,Brown,CLAS 1120B. Epic Poetry from Homer to Lucan.,Traces the rich history and manifold varieties of the genre of epic poetryin the literatures of ancient Greece and Rome beginning with Homer'sIliad and Odyssey (VII c. B.C.) and ending with Lucan's Civil War (I. c.A.D.). Masterpieces such as Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphosesare included. Original sources read in translation.
365,Brown,CLAS 1120G. The Idea of Self.,"Literature gestures us toward a certain kind of knowledge not quitepsychological, not quite philosophical. We read widely in the classicaland medieval traditions in order to gauge the peculiar nature of what thisknowledge tells us about experience and the ways in which expressionsof selfhood abide or are changed over time. Authors include but are notlimited to Sappho, Pindar, Catullus, Horace, Augustine, and Fortunatus."
366,Brown,CLAS 1120R. Social Conflict and Political Factions in the RomanRepublic.,"Traces the evolution of social conflict and political factions at Rome fromthe foundation to the dissolution of the Republic (C5-C1 BCE). Romanarmies secured a vast empire of territory, raw materials, and manpowergoverned by the senate and the people of Rome itself. The influx ofresources, however, destabilized Rome’s constitution and upset politicalpower balances at the city of Rome. How did the Romans—elites andmasses—compete amongst themselves for the bounty of empire abroadand confront their own internal conflicts at home? Was concord possible,or were the developments of empire inconsistent with the constitution ofthe Republic?"
367,Brown,CLAS 1120U. The American Presidents and the Western Tradition.,"We are accustomed to engaging the American presidency as a publicoffice best approached through the prism of government or politicalscience, but this course studies the ways in which the presidents inthought and action are part of a larger continuum of humanistic expressionin the western tradition. It is organized around five categories: memory,language, consolation, farewell, and self-reflection. Our work involvesreading and viewing/listening to various materials, including videos andoriginal documents. The words we study, both by and about presidents,will be compared to various masterworks of Greco-Roman antiquity andthe western Middle Ages."
368,Brown,CLAS 1160. Classics of Indian Literature.,"This course will introduce, in English translations, the most powerfulexamples of the literature of India. The course will introduce students toIndia’s unparalleled literary richness by reading selections of the bestpoetry, drama, and narrative literature of Indian civilization from any ofits many languages (Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, etc., and English),ancient and modern."
369,Brown,CLAS 1205. The Long Fall of the Roman Empire.,"Once thought of as the ""Dark Ages,"" this period of western Europeanhistory should instead be seen as a fascinating time in which late Romanculture fused with that of the Germanic tribes, a mixture tempered by anew religion, Christianity. Issues of particular concern include the symbolicconstruction of political authority, the role of religion, the nature of socialloyalties, and gender roles."
370,Brown,"CLAS 1210. Mediterranean Culture Wars: Archaic Greek History, c.1200 to 479 BC.","From the end of the Bronze Age to the end of the Persian Wars is a periodof considerable change in the Mediterranean and beyond. The Greek polischallenges the powers of the ancient Near East. Over seven centuries wemeet Greek writing, Homeric epic, and the first historian (Herodotus). Butthe Greek world lay on the edges of the Ancient Near East and this coursetries to offer a more balanced approach than the typically Hellenocentricperspective of the standard textbooks. CLAS 1210 addresses political,social and economic history. Literary, epigraphical and archaeologicalcultures provide the evidence."
371,Brown,"CLAS 1750P. Homicide, Revenge, & Marital Disasters: Reception ofGreek Drama in Rome, England, & Japan.","(1) We examine theater and its relation to society, particularly, its reflectionof legal culture (detections of murderers, adulterers, and young lovers);we also examine law’s ‘theatricality’ (‘productions’ of trials). (2) We alsoexplore more broadly how dramas were performed, using as comparandaJapanese Noh and Kabuki (in each, for example, we find all-male casting).(3) Attention is also directed toward twentieth century receptions of theseplays; we focus largely on Japanese productions, particularly of YukioNinagawa, mastermind of Japanese theater who directed numerous Greektragedies and Shakespearean plays in different venues, absorbing andsubverting phenomena of traditional Japanese theater."
372,Brown,CLAS 1750T. Love and Identity in the Roman Empire.,"Sex, pirates, powerful goddesses, and mistaken identities: these are justsome of the aspects of the so-called Ancient Novel and its parodies. Inthis course we will investigate how a few fictional texts from the 1st-3rdcenturies A.D. construct their characters' gender and sexuality, andtherefore reflect concerns about wisdom, power, and difference within theRoman Empire."
373,Brown,CLAS 1930B. Dying God.,"The figure of the dying god (like Adonis, Osiris, or Attis), embodyingboth beauty and tragedy, has exerted a fascination from ancient times tothe present day. His worship was sometimes central to the community,sometimes marginal, yet compelling in its ""outsider"" status. His mythsinvited meditations on love and death in various modes from comedy toepic. This course, through the great mythological texts of Greece andRome as well as modern literature and art, will explore the figure in all itsvariety, along with Christian adaptations and recent interpretations. Therewill be writing assignments."

How can these “ancient fictions” inform an interest innarrative innovation and formal ingenuity today?"
1447,Brown,LITR 1151Q. Great Adventure.,"This hybrid seminar/prose workshop will take you to Antarctica, Japan,France, Cambodia, outer space—and to other places too. But much ofyour writing will be about yourself. Your cross-genre wandering throughnovels, essays, and indefinable hybrid works by a fascinating list ofthinkers and stylists, will lead to questions about your own sense ofplace, belonging, contextual otherness, and the pleasures, powers andimplications of your gaze. You'll search for answers through the medium ofyour own creative work—lyric essays, fictional vignettes, pictures."
1448,Brown,LITR 1151S. Fan_Fic.,"Fan fiction is a thing, right? And, let's be honest, we all secretly love thiskinda thing! O, to relive those Microsoft '95 nights spent reading semi-romantic Legend of Zelda fan fiction... What compels us to reinvent thestories we're already attached to? The texts we might consider fan fictionexist on a spectrum somewhere between high literary and kitsch, betweenMilton and My Immortal. If not a proper genre, let's imagine that fan fictionis a particular (perhaps ancient) practice of literary mimesis. The questionis whether it's possible to create a wholly original derivative."
1449,Brown,LITR 1151X. Interdisciplinary Arts Workshop: Translation of Concept.,"Art-making is an act of translation – a thought, process, question, object,declaration, desire, system, or intention is filtered through the artist andsubsequently finds new existence in the form of art. This project-centeredworkshop is a cross-genre exploration of that filter, where participantsworking in differing genres will be asked to engage a wide range ofmaterials to “translate” into their art-making process.

1451,Brown,LITR 1152A. Survey of the Historic Avant-Garde.,"The avant-garde is a famously slippery category; the definition we'll beworking from, more or less, is the series of movements and individualsfrom 1900 to 1940, based mostly in Europe, that led culture and the artsin directions that talked back to power, pushed aesthetic limits outward,and explored ways to give the arts social and political weight. While largelyfocused on writers, we'll also spend a lot of time with visual artists andother media and will address questions such the line between Modernismand the Avant-Garde and the roles of women in these movements."
1452,Brown,LITR 1152B. Ekphrasis in Action.,"Ekphrasis, according to its most basic definition, is simply poetry thataddresses art; we'll be stretching that definition, making it into a way ofinteracting with art and even into a way of looking at things in the worldthat makes them into art. We'll be visiting art in action, from paintingstudios to dance rehearsals to a natural history museum, using these visitsas premises for writing that we will then share in a workshop format, givingcopious feedback. The whole will be supported by readings of theoreticaland creative works that address ekphrasis."

In this seminar we will examine texts likeMichael Ondaatje's Coming Through Slaughter, Toni Morrison’s Belovedand W.G. Sebald's The Emigrants as part of an exploration of that prosewhich, if we can kick awake that poor overworked pearl, posits thehistorical as its grain of sand. Students can expect a substantial weeklyreading load of primary and secondary source material and should cometo each class prepared to discuss the assigned texts."

1526,Brown,MCM 0902M. The end of politics as we know it? New Media & PoliticalImagination.,"Technical inventions have always spawned utopian visions of total socialamelioration, followed closely by dystopian fears and moral panics. Digitalinformation technologies are no different. Producing the full range ofreactions—from celebrations of “networked protests” to wild accusations of“fake news”—responses to today’s media environments proclaim the endof politics as we know it. Reading works by political theorists alongsidescholars of the digital, this course will question both triumphant digitalutopianism and fatalist assumptions of ubiquitous manipulation, andinstead engage in more complex readings of the ways media shapes andis shaped by subjects and communities alike."

The title of this course is a provocation that posesthe question of whether we can identify the existence of a black gaze,while asserting the transformative potential such a gaze both promisesand portends. Starting from a close examination of theories of the gaze,we will engage the relationship between contemporary black visuality andwhat constitutes a black gaze in the twenty-first century. Focusing on aselect group of black contemporary artists, we will explore how their workchallenges traditional notions of what constitutes the power/politics of thegaze."
1528,Brown,MCM 1204K. From Analog to Analogue: Digitality and Ephemerality inAudiovisual Archives.,"This seminar explores histories of moving image and sound archives inrelation to social movements, technological change, and philosophies ofcultural memory and value that dictate the content of archives and shapeperceptions of their use value. We begin by exploring archives as physicalentities (buildings), structures of information (catalogs, databases, findingaids) and arbiters of meaning (collections). We also consider enterprisesthat increasingly present themselves as archives of our contemporaryselves and collective existence: Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube,Twitter.

1617,Brown,PHIL 0390. Global Justice.,"Is it unjust that people in some countries have less wealth, worse health,etc., than those in other countries? Does this depend on whether thebetter off countries partly caused the disparity? Does it depend on whetherthe worse off are poor, or is it enough that they are relatively worse off?If there are global injustices, what obligations are there, and on whomdo they fall, to remedy them? We will study (mostly) recent philosophicalwork on such questions, including attention to special contexts such asimmigration, climate change, poverty, colonialism, secession, intervention,and war."
