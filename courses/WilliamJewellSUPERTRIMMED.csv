How can these philosophies be practically applied in actual communities in a way that protects individual happiness, community values and environmental capital? We will examine real-world proposals for community planning that attempt to answer questions such as: How are the values of that community translated into a healthy development plan for that community? What factors must be considered in designing the infrastructure that underlies healthy neighborhoods and communities within the urban context? "
