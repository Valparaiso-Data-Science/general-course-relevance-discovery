It will approach these topics through philosophical analysis and literary methods. Students will read and develop philosophical analyses of the key concepts and write scenarios (biographical, autobiographical, historical and/or imaginative) that implicate the three main themes. The scenarios will be critiqued for their adequacy in light of the demands of philosophical coherence, and the philosophical analyses will be critiqued in light of their capacity to deal with the nuances of the scenarios. This approach will be extended through reading and analyzing selected works of literature. Students will also consider the nature of relations of the methods, philosophical and literary, that are used for understanding and appreciating human relations. (Interdisciplinary humanities course)"
18,WilliamJewell,CTI 216 Wagner: Lord of the Ring	(4 cr. hrs.),"The development of modern mass media and the synthesis of art and entertainment both have their genesis in Richard Wagner’s operas, especially in his epic “Der Ring des Nibelungen.” This course will explore the context and content of the 15-hour cycle, Wagner’s influence on 20th century art, politics, and the complexity of multi-media expression in cultural formation. The ways in which his thematic materials are made manifest in cinema will also be investigated. Particular attention will be given to answering the questions: Why (and how) do artistic expressions cause controversy? How does art contribute to cultural formation and ideology? When does art become entertainment and entertainment become art? (Interdisciplinary humanities course)"
19,WilliamJewell,CTI 217 The Digital Community	(4 cr. hrs.),"Combining classic and contemporary critical theory with cultural analysis, this course examines the way new means of communication and virtual representation remap (if not reconstruct) reality and the way these re-mappings affect our identities, frames of thinking, values, relations, labor and material conditions of life–our community and the way we understand its boundaries.

We will raise these questions: What does it mean to be an American? What should it take to enter the United States legally? What does it mean to acquire United States citizenship? The goal of this examination will be to understand how various conceptions of national identity, citizenship and national borders shape the current debates over immigration policy. After exploring the ethical, economic, biological and social issues regarding immigration, students will create an immigration policy. That policy will be assessed as to its internally consistency, fit with the U.S. Constitution, moral soundness and comprehensiveness in defining the bounds of legal immigration as well as consequences of illegal entry."
53,WilliamJewell,CTI 411 Well-being by Design? 	(4 cr. hrs.) ,"This course will explore what structural attributes are needed to make a community strong and sustainable.

Then we will review the structures and properties of amino acids that are the “building blocks” of proteins. Proteins perform most cell functions. Hence, we will focus on protein structure and how changes in protein structure cause changes in protein function. We will emphasize interactions between protein molecules and small water-soluble molecules called ligands. Importantly, these interactions lead to changes in protein and therefore cell function. The laboratory section of the tutorial will cover techniques of protein visualization and protein function.
