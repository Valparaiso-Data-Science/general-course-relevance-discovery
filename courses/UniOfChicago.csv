","This sequence takes the view that traditions are not normative but formative: less stable, pre-given structures than self-constituting and self-questioning bodies in perennial transformation. In that light, it offers a grounding in some major texts of the Classical Greek and Latin traditions (read in English translation) as well as their reception at pivotal moments in modernity. These are texts that have sustained a community of reading and commentary, debate and critique, ever since their inception, and which continue to resonate through our institutions and values today. In our encounter with them, we will develop the tools to follow our curiosity and read in inquiring and original ways, as well as to defend our readings with respect to the texts. Each quarter is devoted to one or two genres and each includes Greek, Roman, and modern texts that build on each other. Autumn opens with the epic. Winter sees us delve into the paired genres of tragedy and history, examining how each tries to explain and evaluate societies through distinct modes of narrative and speech.

This sequence explores these and related matters, and helps us to examine critically our opinions about them. To this end, we read and discuss seminal works of the Western tradition, selected both because they illumine the central questions and because, read together, they form a compelling record of human inquiry. Insofar as they force us to consider different and competing ways of asking and answering questions about human and civic excellence, it is impossible for us to approach these writings as detached spectators. Instead, we come to realize our own indebtedness to our predecessors and are inspired to continue their task of inquiry. In addition to providing a deeper appreciation of who we are as human beings and citizens, this sequence aims to cultivate the liberating skills of careful reading, writing, speaking, and listening. 2017–18 readings for this general education sequence consisted of philosophical and literary texts from Ancient Greece to the twentieth century, organized around the themes of ""Human Being"" and ""Citizen.""

138,UniOfChicago,HUMA 13500-13600-13700. Introduction to the Humanities I-II-III. ,"This sequence emphasizes writing, both as an object of study and as a practice. As we study the texts of the course, we pay special attention to questions about how they function as instances of writing: How does the writing of a text shape the way that we understand it? How does writing shape our sense of what we are doing in the humanities? Such questions about writing will lead to similar questions about language in general: How is our understanding shaped by the language we use? In the Autumn Quarter, we'll ask these questions within classical and familiar norms for using language to argue, to analyze, to be accurate, to be logical, and so on. In Winter and Spring Quarters, we'll move to challenges, and radical criticisms, of these familiar ideas. As to practice: The writing workload of the course is significant. Students will write at least one writing assignment each week, and we discuss these assignments in small writing workshops. This is not a course in remedial writing; rather it is a course for students who are particularly interested in writing or who want to become particularly proficient writers. Readings for the course are selected not thematically or chronologically, but to serve the focus on writing. "

","This sequence is devoted to the cultivation of the art of interpretation through the close reading of objects across a broad range of times and places, from the Homeric epic to contemporary film, folk tale to museum. In each case the goal is to work outward from the textual details—construing the term text generously so as to include any form of cultural production—and develop insight into the local emergence and global circulation of objects of interpretation. In the process the sequence explores questions about memory, home, and belonging; about the various historical forms of cultural production, from epic to folk tale, music, film, and novels; about the challenges of translation to responsible interpretation; about texts as formative sources of human community, inter-personal obligation, and transcendence; about hybridity and the legacy of colonialism; and, of course, about the role of humanistic inquiry in addressing all these questions. The year is divided into three conceptual themes that allow us to explore the above questions: collection, travel, and exchange. Readings in the past have included Homer, ""The Odyssey""; ""The Arabian Nights""; Ovid, ""Metamorphoses""; Balzac, ""Père Goriot""; Harriet Jacobs, ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl""; Pu Songling, ""Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio""; Charlie Chaplin, ""Modern Times""; Zora Neale Hurston, ""Of Mules and Men""; T.

The sequence traces philosophical and aesthetic debates about media from antiquity to the present in various cultural contexts; we examine discussions of image, text, and sound in Plato, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, W. E. B. Du Bois, Alfred Hitchcock, Toni Morrison, and recent critical theory.

How is poetry as language and action different from other forms of activity? What is the role of poetry in society, in regard to memory, performance, storytelling, and history; ritual and creation; knowledge and formation of selfhood; institution and revolution? This sequence addresses these questions in the poetry of different eras and peoples, including works of Homer, Sappho, Catullus, poets from the T’ang period in China, Rumi, Ki no Tsurayuki, John Donne, Louis Zukofsky, Dahlia Ravikovitch, Anne Carson, N. Scott Momaday, Claudia Rankine, and others.

Experts must meet many familiar standards for successful writing: clear style, logical organization, and persuasive argument. But because they work with specialized knowledge, experts also face particular writing difficulties: they must be clear about complexities and specific about abstractions; they must use uncomplicated organization for very complicated ideas; they must create straightforward logic for intricate arguments; they must be concise but not incomplete, direct but not simplistic; they must clarify the obscure but not repeat the obvious; and they must anticipate the demands of aggressively skeptical readers. The seminars do not repeat or extend the substantive discussion of the Humanities class; they use the discussions and assignments from those classes as a tool for the advanced study of writing. We study various methods not only for the construction of sophisticated and well-structured arguments but also for understanding the complications and limits of those arguments. These seminars also address issues of readership and communication within expert communities. As students present papers in the seminars, we can use the reactions of the audience to introduce the techniques experts can use to transform a text from one that serves the writer to one that serves the readers.

At stake are issues about agency-human or material-and about determinism-how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface).

196,UniOfChicago,"PHSC 12600. Matter, Energy, Space, and Time. 100 Units. ","A comprehensive survey of how the physical world works, and how matter, energy, space, and time evolved from the beginning to the present. A brief survey of the historical development of mathematics, physics, and astronomy leads to a conceptual survey of the modern theory of the physical universe: space and time in relativity; the quantum theory of matter and energy; and the evolution of cosmic structure and composition. The major theme of this course is the understanding of all nature, from the prosaic to the exotic, using powerful quantitative theory grounded in precise experiments. Although quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, students will not be expected to employ mathematics beyond algebra.

197,UniOfChicago,PHSC 12610. Black Holes. 100 Units. ,"Black Holes are the most exotic, extreme and paradoxical systems in the universe. They are the densest concentrations of energy, yet they convert all matter that falls in to pure space-time curvature; they radiate more power than anything else, even though most of their radiation is not even made of light; they are mathematically the most perfectly understood of any physical structure, but their enigmatic behavior is still the subject of a violent disagreement among experts that highlights our ignorance of how quantum physics relates to gravity. This course will survey the physics of space and time, the nature of black holes, their effects on surrounding matter and light, the astrophysical contexts in which they are observed, frontier areas of research as quantum gravity and gravitational waves, and the importance of space-time physics to everyday needs such as navigation and energy. The modern theory of space and time, as well as black holes, will be placed in historical context, with special attention to the work of Albert Einstein. Experimental exercises will include direct measurement of the speed of light and gravitational mass, and experience with interferometry.

198,UniOfChicago,PHSC 12620. The Big Bang. 100 Units. ,"The Big Bang model describes the Universe on the largest scales and its evolution from the earliest observationally accessible times through the formation of the complex world we live in today. This powerful framework allows us to interpret a wide range of observations and to make detailed and precise predictions for new experiments. The key motivating observations include the expansion of the Universe and how it has changed with time; the existence of radiation indicating a hot and dense early phase; the abundance of the light elements; and how matter is organized over a wide range of physical scales. The model naturally incorporates dark matter and dark energy, two surprising and poorly understood components that govern the growth of structure over time. The course will explore the history of scientific cosmology and the evidence for the Big Bang model, its consequences for the earliest moments after the Big Bang, and its predictions for the eventual fate of the Universe. Labs will include a hands-on measurement of the relic cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe and the use of astronomical data to verify key discoveries in the history of Big Bang cosmology. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, but prior experience with mathematics beyond algebra will not be required.

199,UniOfChicago,PHSC 12700. Stars. 100 Units. ,"Elements such as carbon and oxygen are created in fusion reactions at high temperatures and pressures in the deep interiors of stars, conditions that naturally arise in stars like the Sun. This course will outline the physical principles at work and the history of the development of the key ideas: how nuclear physics and the theory of stellar interiors account for how stars shine, why they live for such long times, and how the heavy elements in their cores are dispersed to form a new generation of stars. Gravity assembles stars out of more diffuse material, a process that includes the formation of planetary systems. The course shows how, taken together, these physical processes naturally lead to the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life, namely elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and planets in stable orbits around long-lived stars. The course features quantitative analysis of data; any tools needed beyond pre-calculus algebra will be taught as part of the course.

200,UniOfChicago,PHSC 12710. Galaxies. 100 Units. ,"Galaxies have been called island universes, places where stars are concentrated, where they are born, and where they die. The study of galaxies reaches back to the Renaissance; Galileo Galilei first pointed a telescope skyward in 1610 and confirmed a then 2000 year-old Greek conjecture about the nature of our own galaxy-the Milky Way. This course will use extensive modern observational data from a wide range of telescopes to trace the modern picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the stars in them. Galaxies will then be used as markers of yet larger scale structures, in order to explore the influence of gravity over cosmic time. The object of study in this course is galaxies, and the narrative arc traced through that extensive data and understanding will highlight our profound discovery that most of the mass in galaxies (and the Universe as a whole) is in fact an exotic form of matter-dark matter-that we cannot directly see. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course in both laboratory work and lectures, but mathematics beyond algebra and some geometric understanding will not be required. This course will feature several observationally-oriented labs that will allow students to directly experience how some of the modern understanding of galaxies has arisen.

We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere.

The course aims to provide the student with an introduction to the philosophy of social science inquiry, a sense of how that inquiry is conducted, and an understanding of how policy implications can be drawn responsibly from evidence provided by empirical social science. The sequence's objective is to convey both the promise and the pitfalls of social science and a sense of its uses and abuses. During the 2018–19 academic year, two sections within the Social Science Inquiry"" sequence will each offer a different topical focus: one section on formal theory (Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory SOSC 13110-13210-13310) and one section on spatial analysis (Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis"" 13120-13220-13320).

Mastering game theoretic and public choice models is an invaluable tool for understanding how interest groups influence politics, how voting takes place in Congress, how matches are made in the dating world, or how neighborhood arrangements are coordinated. More broadly, applications of formal theory to social science include explaining how peace negotiations occur between governments and rebels in the aftermath of civil war, how trade unionists bargain over wages with employers, and even the decisions of autocrats to step down from power and allow for free elections. SSI-Formal Theory will introduce students to the systematic study of social, political, and economic interactions, where the optimal course of one person's action depends on the options and preferences of other people involved in the interaction.

In Global Society, students read these statements simultaneously as theoretical treatises, as empirical approaches, and as normative prescriptions for the social world. This three-pronged approach enables us to disentangle differences in empirical perception from differences in values and to assess how, in combination, these color our own inevitably particular judgments of world events. The course opens a set of themes that will run through the entire sequence: individual-and-society, tradition-and-change, sources of social values, difference and particularity.

How many people can this earth support? What are the implications of population shifts for individual life chances? For social values and patterns of difference? Students will learn how to construct basic period lifetables, how to compare populations and sub-populations using basic standardization techniques, and how to analyze generations and cohorts in context.

Populism is currently the word on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in current public debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time as the dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, but are not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Does populism look different in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the Global South force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants?

295,UniOfChicago,"ANTH 20009. Embodiment: Governance, Resistance, Ethics. 100 Units. ","What does a study of the body teach us about governance and the experience of being governed? This course approaches bodies from three angles. First, bodies are targets of governance. They are objects to be reformed, regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and cared for. Next, as bodies get targeted for reform, they are also converted into potent sites of resistance and critique. Certain bodies in certain places elicit discomfort, unsettling common ideals of private and public, of developed and backward, of religious and secular, and, with them, dominant understandings of modern citizenship. Finally, bodies in their sensory and affective capacities are also mobilized as resources for crafting belonging beyond the assigned terms of law or the state. Drawing from ethnographic texts and with special emphasis on Latin America, this course introduces students to the anthropology of embodiment as well as related themes of bio-politics, gender, intimacy, political subjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, race, and aesthetics. In so doing, the hope is to generate new ways to make sense of matters near and far-from Lenin's body to Trump's hands, reproductive labor to sex work, dirty protest to women's marches, indigenous eco-rituals to queer intimacies.

296,UniOfChicago,ANTH 20010. Anthropology of the Future. 100 Units. ,"Two major subfields of anthropology - archaeology and ethnography - have traditionally been oriented around the human past and the human present. But what about the future? Conceptions of the future and future-oriented behavior have long been understood to be a critical plane of difference between political economies, religions, and cultural groups, yet they have rarely been an explicit focus of study. When we shift the temporal frame to the future, questions that arise include: do all cultures have theories of the future? how much about human societies are intentional? how does ideology shape future possibilities? what role do imagined futures play in political life? We will consider theories of temporality, past futures (Aztec, Polynesian, Italian), and movements such as millenarianism, messianic religions, Marxism, Dadaism, utopian communities, Afro-futurism, transhumanism, and today's neo-futurist movements that deploy radical technology and speculative design in response to looming climate change. We will also explore the intimate relationship between speculative fiction (e.g., Ursula K. LeGuin, Kurt Vonnegut) and anthropology. Instructor(s): S. Dawdy Terms Offered: Autumn.

297,UniOfChicago,"ANTH 20011. Peasants: Anthropology, Rural Life, Capitalism. 100 Units. ","Only a few short decades ago, rural societies were at the center of anthropological inquiry and key sources of ethnographic insight. Today, anthropological attentions have redirected toward cityscapes and urban experiences, leading a recent review piece to wonder: Where have all the peasants gone? The answer, of course, is nowhere. Peasants may have slipped by the wayside of analysis, but nearly half of the world's population today remains rural, and more than ever, countrysides are acutely affected by the economic transformations reshaping our world and the uncertainties facing our future: the challenges of food security, sustainable living, (agricultural) biotechnology, ecological precariousness, global poverty, and escalating rates of urbanization and urban migration. In a decidedly non-trendy move, then, this course will take the anthropology of peasantry as its focus, and will make the case that small-scale farming communities remain highly relevant sites for diagnosing capitalism's changing conditions and its lived consequences. Our discussions will be at once historical, conceptual, and ethnographic, and will draw on a broad set of case-studies around the globe. We will review classic debates about peasantries in relation to the history of capitalism, and reflect on the analytical possibilities and limitations of the peasant concept.

298,UniOfChicago,ANTH 20144. London Program: Institution. 100 Units. ,"In the first part of the course, focusing on William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's monumental poetic work Lyrical Ballads (1798), we will consider the implications of revolutions abroad and of institutionalizations of arts and culture at home for the rise of modern literary culture in Romantic-era Britain. Wordsworth famously envisioned a new role for the poet as that of a man speaking to men who could make incidents and situations from common life the proper matter of literature. As he did so, Wordsworth was confronting both the disappointed hope of the blissful dawn of the French Revolution and a cultural milieu reshaped by the emergence of institutions like the British Museum (1753), the Royal Academy of Art (1768), and the National Gallery (1824)-all of which continue to define British national culture. In the second part of the course, we will consider analogous developments of the present moment, including the institutionalization of new arts like fashion, to consider where (in what scenes, and in what forms of writing and media) we might look for Lyrical Ballads of our own time.

310,UniOfChicago,ANTH 21107. Anthropological Theory. 100 Units. ,"Since its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed the relation between a self-consciously modernizing West and its various and changing others. Yet it has not always done so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories-a fact that has led, since at least the 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemological foundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over the course of the discipline's long twentieth century, form the 1880s to the present. Although we focus on the North American and British traditions, we review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German social theory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of modern anthropology as an empirically based, but theoretically informed, practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.

Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds, this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters, and motifs. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society.

314,UniOfChicago,"ANTH 21333. The Lived Body: Anthropology, Materiality, Meaningful Practice. 100 Units. ","The body is implicated in all facets of human life. It is at once constraint and enabler, relational and personal, real and imagined. It is both individually performed and socially determined, the site of both domination and resistance. Anthropological theory has moved far from Cartesian dualism in which mind and body can and must be separate; this course will travel through ways of understanding bodies that have supplemented or bypassed this idea, or have existed outside of it entirely. We will consider what it means to have a body, to know a body, to be defined by a body-in short, to live a body. This course's topical readings are oriented around the idea that embodiment involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will consider experience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and ways of knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies, both internally and externally. To do so, we will balance theory and ethnography in both our consumption and production of scholarly material, including a final auto-ethnography in which students adopt a new body practice for the quarter.

315,UniOfChicago,ANTH 21341. Making Plants Work: Anthropology of Human-Plant Relationships. 100 Units. ,"Food, drink, fuel, pharmaceuticals, clothing, cosmetics, construction material, furniture… Plants and their byproducts are everywhere we look. How have plants become so ubiquitous to human life? How have plants been used, adapted, processed, and sold over the course of history? How can studying plants and their interactions with humans provide a different perspective on the past, and insight into the future? This course explores how humans have made plants work, and how these working plants have, in turn, shaped the world in which we live. While often perceived as passive in comparison to human and animal counterparts, plants have played a critical role in shaping global social, economic, ecological, and political dynamics. As desired products, plants have entangled far-flung individuals and societies into complex relationships that reverberate across time and space. This course will survey the history of human-plant interactions through three units: domestication, colonialism, and modern technologies. We will examine a wide range of case studies, in an effort to gain comparative and multivocal understanding of human-plant relationships. In doing so, course materials touch on topics of general anthropological interest: political ecology, agency, social inequality, labor, global processes, the impacts of colonialism, the production of knowledge, and human/non-human relationships.

316,UniOfChicago,ANTH 21342. Welcome to the Good Life: The Black Edition. 100 Units. ,"What do we mean when we say the good life? In the United States, the good life has long been synonymous with the idea of the American dream (the white picket fence, secure union job, stable marriage with 2.5 kids). But over the past several years, this romanticized image has increasingly been thrown into crisis with the rise of a destabilized national economy, political infighting, and in the aftermath of the housing collapse. It seems as though the veil has been lifted and the American Dream has been exposed as a fantasy object, if not a complete impossibility. But for people of color, and black people in particular who have been historically disenfranchised and thus unable to access the housing, education, and medical resources necessary to make the American dream a reality, this fantasy has always already been understood as such. Indeed, black experiences reveal how whiteness as a structural mechanism stands at the foundation of the American Dream. Instructor(s): Bock, Emily Terms Offered: Spring. Spring 2019 "
317,UniOfChicago,ANTH 21343. Anthropology and/of Tourism: Of Otherness and Encounters. 100 Units. ,"Travelling as a mode of self-cultivation and world awareness has always captivated our imagination. With increasing ease of travel, tourism is a $ 2.3 trillion industry, with 1.25 billion annual travelers. How does reading ethnographies of tourism help us examine encounters with others as anthropology's central prerogative? From Emerson's quote - is the meaning of an encounter located within us or in the object? Is otherness some inherent quality or a product of specific narratives and practices? Encountering otherness being anthropology's primary research methodology, can ethnographers be compared to tourists? How is the discipline itself implicated in unequal power relations of cultural encounters? We will read ethnographies covering a range of concerns about tourism - its linkages with colonialism/neo-colonialism, its role in stereotyping indigenous cultures, its impact on the environment, on gender dynamics, on representations of nationhood and on cultivation of bourgeois selfhood. Our aim is to use anthropological insights to appraise the phenomenon of tourism as a whole, identifying its pros and cons; and to also flip this perspective to ask: what insights does tourism give us into encounters and othering as foundational concerns of anthropology?

318,UniOfChicago,ANTH 21344. The Meaning of Police. 100 Units. ,"The purpose of this class is to offer students an intellectual toolkit for thinking critically and engaging politically with contemporary problems of police. It will introduce classical as well as emerging themes, drawing on research from diverse social and geographical locations. We will discuss, among other things, the paradox of legal lawlessness, the relationship between law and the body, and the unstable distinction between public and private violence. Paying attention to classed, sexed, and racialized notions of danger and threat, we will discuss the historical fabrication of criminality as well as the complex legacies of security and protection that underpin practices of criminal punishment. While subjecting policing to an anthropological interrogation-asking what police means for different people in different times and places-we will also consider the uneasy affinity between policemen and ethnographers in order to ask what it can teach us about police, and how it might illuminate our understanding of ethnography.

320,UniOfChicago,ANTH 21420. Ethnographic Methods. 100 Units. ,"This is a course on how to do ethnographic research. While recent decades have seen scholars rightfully insist on the artistic and inherently personal quality of 'doing' and 'writing' ethnography, the course aims to illuminate the regulating structures of thought and practice underpinning every piece of original ethnographic work. The course is both a reading and a research workshop. As a reading workshop, it seeks to enable students to read ethnography like ethnographers: identifying and learning from the inner workings of the research project at the heart of each ethnographic text. As a research workshop, the course progressively leads students to construct and implement a research project of their own. Students will methodically enact the physical techniques and analytic practices emerging from their reading of ethnography. Throughout the course, we will grapple with the challenges facing an ethnographic researcher, and identify the building blocks of an ethnographic project. In this effort, we will focus on the posing of a research question; the formulation of conceptual frameworks; constructing a statement of problem; actors and informants; the semiotics and pragmatics of interviewing; analysis of interactions qua participant-observer, and historical approaches in ethnography. Students will also experiment with forms of non-verbal visual representation.

","This seminar introduces undergraduates to anthropologies of counting, calculation and computation. The course is split into two parts. In part one (Weeks 1-3), we will explore anthropological and historical approaches to number, mathematics and calculation per se, with the goal of developing an analytical toolset through which we can approach the categories counting and number more critically and creatively. In part two (Weeks 4-10), we expand on this toolset ethnographically, moving through a series of cases to examine how number, counting and calculation are situated variously in contemporary social life, with powerful ethical, political and even biological effects. We will move through themes including war and genocide, health and the body, human-machine interfaces, state science, environmental metrics, and software algorithms and big data. The ultimate objective will be to train students to identify and interrogate some of the myriad ways that number is always-already situated in social life - not coming objectively from nowhere. At the same time, we will try to firmly root our project in an anthropology of number per se, approaching our ethnographic selections from a footing slightly outside of STS or familiar humanist critiques of statistics. Together, we will test whether this footing leads us somewhere new. Instructor(s): Mullee, John Terms Offered: Winter. Winter 2019 "

325,UniOfChicago,ANTH 22129. The Vocation of a Scientist. 100 Units. ,"Max Weber wrote that to be a scientist one needed a strange intoxication with scientific work and a passionate devotion to research as a calling. And yet, such passion seemed to conflict with the ideal of value-neutral inquiry. This class considers the vocation of science since the turn of the twentieth century. What political, economic, and cultural forces have shaped scientific professions in the United States? How are scientists represented in public culture? How was American science experienced during the colonization of the Philippines? By exploring these questions, this class will examine the values and norms that make science into a meaningful vocation. Equivalent Course(s): HIPS 21407, KNOW 21407 "
326,UniOfChicago,ANTH 22165. Politics of Technoscience in Africa. 100 Units. ,"Euro-American discourse has often portrayed Africa as either a place without science and technology or as the home of deep and ancient wisdom. European imperialists used the alleged absence of science and technology as a justification for colonialism while pharmaceutical companies sought out African knowledge about healing plants. In addition to their practical applications, science and technology carry significant symbolic weight in discussions about Africa. In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation? How have independent African governments dealt with the imperial legacies of science? From the interpretation of archaeological ruins to the design of new medical technologies, this class will examine science and technology as political practice in Africa.

Science in the South: Decolonizing the Study of Knowledge in Latin America  the Caribbean. 100 Units. ,"This seminar will bridge anthropologies and histories of science, technology, and medicine to Latin American decolonial thought. Throughout Latin America, techno-scientific objects and practices, with their presumed origin in the Euro-Atlantic North, are often complexly entangled with neo-imperial projects of development and modernization that elongate social forms of colonization into the present. Technoscience and its objects, however, can also generate new creative, political, and life-enhancing potentials beyond or despite their colonial resonances, or even provide tools to ongoing struggles for decolonization. Together, seminar participants will explore what a decolonial approach to the study of science, technology, and medicine in the Global South, particularly in Latin America, has been and could become and how decolonial theory can inflect our own disciplinary, conceptual, and political commitments as anthropologists of technoscience.

329,UniOfChicago,ANTH 23093. Latin American Extractivisms. 100 Units. ,"This course will survey the historical antecedents and contemporary politics of Latin American extractivisms. While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current neoextractivisms have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells, open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformations to local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present. Yet parallel to neo-extractive regimes, emergent Latin American social movements have unleashed impassioned and often unexpected forms of local and transnational resistance. Readings in the course will contrast cross-regional trends of extractive economic development and governance with fine-grained accounts of how individuals, families, and communities experience and respond to land dispossession, local and transregional conflict, and the ecological and health impacts of Latin American extractivisms.

It encourages students to read along the grain of developmental discourse at different stages of twentieth-century development, thus advancing students' capacity to critically situate and condition global and national policies. The course analytically foregrounds problems of governance, resource distribution, and sociopolitical complexity, providing students with a representative range of case studies from across the subcontinent and interrogating what it means for social and economic goods to be labeled human rights. Throughout the course students will examine diverse housing arrangements and policies in the context of national, regional, and global development histories.

338,UniOfChicago,ANTH 23607. The Immigrant as American Prototype. 100 Units. ,"This undergraduate seminar explores how the figure of the immigrant has come to mediate various origin myths and anticipatory imaginations of Americanness in contemporary political struggles. A central proposition of the course is that the immigrant should be seen NOT as an original founding subject of the United States and its American Dream but rather, as a modern prototype-forged only since the late 19th century-for stress-testing different models of American presence and power in the world. Importantly, this is a world increasingly ordered, as well as destabilized, by the expanding logics of industrial and corporate capital-a historical development with reverberating effects into our contemporary debates over the relation of the immigrant to American values and global competitiveness. Drawing on various historical, anthropological and audiovisual resources, this seminar aims to situate the emergence of the immigrant as American prototype in relation to (1) earlier cultural-historical archetypes of mass migration, such as the settler and the emigrant"" and (2) current debates over nativist and cosmopolitan models of American security-cum-prosperity that take the immigrant as the limit case for evaluating the human, the normal, and the good life across nationalist and globalizing space-times. Besides conventional reading and writing assignments, this seminar will offer students the opportunity to experiment with multimedia methods for ethnographic research through a final web-based project in which students will draw from current news and popular media sources to assemble and critically present on their own version of the Immigrant as American prototype.

Populism is currently the word on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in current public debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time as the dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, but are not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Dose populism look different in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the Global South force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants?

Disability cuts across age, gender, class, caste, occupation, and religion- or does it? By some measures, people with disabilities are the largest minority group in the world today. In this course, we critically examine both the experiences of people with disabilities in a global context as well as the politics and processes of writing about such experiences. Indeed, questions of representation are perhaps at the core of this course. What role have the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and other nongovernmental social and human service agencies played in the creation of specific understandings of disability experience? We will ask whether disability is a universal category and we will consider how experiences of health, illness, disability, and debility vary. We will engage in concept work by analyzing the relationships between disability and impairment and we will critically evaluate the different conceptual and analytical models employed to think about disability. In doing so, we will engage with broader questions about international development, human rights, the boundaries of the nation, the family and other kinship affiliations, and identity and community formation. How is disability both a productive analytic and a lens for thinking about pressing questions and concerns in today's world? Equivalent Course(s): CHDV 25250, MAPS 46460 "

The natural aspects of reproduction intersect in increasingly fraught and often surprising ways with its technological/ scientific, institutional/professional, religious/spiritual, and political/ ideological aspects. The starting point for the course is that the reproduction of bodies is differently understood and politically contested among and for various groups of people. We will pay particular attention to the ways bodies, ideas, and technologies flow throughout global contexts, while exploring how inequalities at various levels (race, class, geographic region, nationality, gender, sexuality, practices of family making) impact the nature of the reproductive body, and how reproductive practices reproduce such inequalities. We will also explore how knowledge of the reproductive body is contested through biomedicine, law, and media, with particular attention to naturalizing discourse about gender and intuition. Finally, we will look at how ecology and reproduction are intertwined via concern about environmental toxicities and the impact of non-human actors. Instructor(s): A.

In the first half, we will focus especially on the role of the body in religious experiences: how people comport, discipline, and alter their bodies in attempts to create religious experiences. In the second half, we will turn to the mind: how religion mediates cultural understandings of mental health, well-being, and illness and the experience of a normatively healthy mind and body.

In this course, we will draw upon readings from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies to examine this paradox and to examine mental health and illness as a set of subjective experiences, social processes, and objects of knowledge and intervention. On a conceptual level, the course invites students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Questions explored include: Does mental illness vary across social and cultural settings? How are experiences of people suffering from mental illness shaped by psychiatry's knowledge of their afflictions? Instructor(s): E.

Despite assaults on the field from numerous quarters, psychoanalytic thinking remains central to the work of practitioners across an array of disciplines. After an introduction to key psychoanalytic concepts including the unconscious, repression, and transference, we will investigate some of the ways in which these ideas are mobilized within clinical practice, neuroscience, anthropology, education, philosophy, literary studies, and the visual arts through a series of lectures presented by specialists from these fields.

At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of normal psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of culture and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

","This course takes a critical, historical and anthropological look at what is meant by the good life."" Anthropologists have long been aware that notions of the good play an essential role in directing human behavior, by providing a life with meaning and shaping what it means to be a human being. Over the past several years, however, there has been an increasing demand for clarification on what is meant by the good life,"" as well as how cultural conceptions of the good relate to science, politics, religion, and personal practice. In this course, we will take up that challenge by exploring what is meant by the good, focusing on three domains in which it has most productively been theorized: ethics, morality, and well-being. Through a close reading of ethnographic and theoretical texts, as well as through analysis of documents and resources used and produced by different communities in order to explore the good life, we will gain an understanding of the different theoretical and methodological approaches for understanding the good in the social sciences, the various cultural logics shaping knowledge and practices of the good, and how human experience is shaped by those iterations in the process. The topics to be discussed include: the good life, moral reason, moral relativism, utility, deontology, virtue, happiness, well-being, flourishing, techniques of the self, spiritual exercises, professional ethics, neuroethics, and the moral sentiments.

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of psychopathology or madness. By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/ depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of how to represent mental illness,"" students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.

372,UniOfChicago,ANTH 25118. Earthbound Metaphysics: Speculations on Earths and Heavens. 100 Units. ,"Social thought has recently reopened the subject matter of the world: what is it made of, how does it hold together, who and what inhabits it? Proposals and inquiries generated in response are as imaginative as they are self-consciously urgent: written on the crest of the global ecological disaster, from within the zones of disturbance or the sites of extreme intervention into the living matter and forms of life, contemplating the end of the world and possibilities of extinction, redemption, cohabitation, or collateral survival (Tsing 2015). All are variously political. Foregrounding the plurality of the material worlds and lived worldviews on the one hand, and of the shared historical predicament on the other, social thinkers question universal values and conceivable relations, and search for alternate forms of grasping, engaging, and representing the pluriverse. This course goes along with such interests in the worlds and collects a number of compelling, contemporary texts that are variously oriented towards cosmopolitics, minimalist metaphysics, new materialisms, speculative realisms, ecotheology, and multispecies coexistence. Readings will stretch out to examine some classic ethnographic texts and past theoretical excursions into the perennial problem of how to know and tell the unfamiliar, native, worlds, which are swept by, mingling with, or standing out in the more globalizing trends of capitalist, scientific, and secular materialism.

376,UniOfChicago,"ANTH 25207. Gender, Sexuality,  Religion. 100 Units. ","In many cultural contexts today, religion is often seen as a socially conservative force in public and political realms. For instance, Christian pro-life movements in the US often draw on tropes of women's traditional role as mothers to argue against easily accessible abortion clinics or contraceptives; recent faith-based objections to legal protections for LGBTQ individuals; and debates in the US and Western Europe about Muslim women's use of the veil as inherently disempowering women. Social scientists have often noted the logics of duality that shape our contemporary world: religious/secular, traditional/modern, conservative/liberal, private/public, etc. Within this logic, religious peoples are presumed to be traditional or primitive and therefore hostile to modernity or foreclosed from being modern. Similarly, to be progressive or liberal, one is assumed to be secular and skeptical of religion. Is it always the case, though, that religion is conservative, traditional, and works to maintain the status quo of possible gender roles and sexual identities in society? The goal of this course is to investigate this question. We will look at contemporary places around the world, multiple religions, and various genders and sexualities in order to complicate the picture of how religion and gender inform one another.

377,UniOfChicago,ANTH 25209. Morality across the Life Course. 100 Units. ,"Morality across the Life Course. What does it mean to be a moral person? And how do moral expectations within a given society shift across the life course? Social scientists have noted that what it means to be a moral child may not always be the same as what it means to be a moral adolescent or middle-aged adult. At the same time, scholars have been interested in how moral ideals pass from one generation to another through processes such as socialization. Social reproduction must also deal with globalization and other sources of social change. By honing in on such processes of social reproduction and change, many have suggested we may better understand how moral beliefs change across generations and over time. In this course we will explore these processes of moral development, socialization, and change, drawing largely on anthropological and psychological research. While early developmental psychologists theorized moral development as stage-based and teleological (i.e., an ultimate, ideal adult moral personhood towards which developmental stages were progressive steps), anthropologists and cultural psychologists working in many different cultural contexts have complicated this understanding of morality. We will begin the quarter by looking at some of the early texts and theories about moral development in addition to early concerns about social reproduction across generations. Afterwards we will turn to a series of ethnographic monographs in order to explore in detail how particular life course stages are conceptualized in moral terms in various parts of the world and in different contexts of social change.

To what extent do individuals possess the right to move to other states? How do different states with large populations of refugees and asylum seekers develop and enforce migration policies, and what do the differences in these policies reveal about the social histories and futures of these states? To address these questions, we will consider how borders, institutions, and categories of migrant groups mutually shape one another. We will explore the interrelationships between categories of migration-forced, economic, regular, and irregular-in order to understand the multiple and unequal forms of mobility experienced by those who inhabit these categories. By utilizing a framework of human rights, this course will investigate how contemporary issues in migration-such as border management, illicit movement, and the fuzzy distinction between forced and economic migration-raise and reopen debates concerning the management of difference. We will draw on the work of anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers, as well as journalists, legal, and medical professionals. Our readings each week will include a mix of conceptual, ethnographic, long-form journalism, and policy texts.

From Silicon Valley's reinvention of the world through technology, to Hollywood's national storytelling through film, from Disney's fantasyland to San Francisco's communes to LA's metropolis, California is a lightening rod for various visions of the future. It epitomizes the frontier where traditions hold less sway, especially for women and LGBTQ people. Both reactionary and progressive when confronted with social change, California previews debates that later happen on a national stage. Its current opposition to federal immigration policy should be considered alongside its history of legalized sinophobia and Japanese internment. It exaggerates American ideals and disgraces; consider the Gold Rush, which epitomized an American Dream of wealth for the taking and entailed a brutal genocide of Native Californians. The Bay Area sustainability cult exists alongside the most polluted places in the country. California hosts extremes of poverty and wealth, urban and rural, liberalism and conservatism (Reagan was, after all, Californian). We will consider California through ethnography, history, literature, sociology, theory, film, photography, and music. How do ideas about a place, and its lived reality, mutually shape each other? What is the role of utopian/dystopian thinking? A premise of the course is that utopia for some is dystopia for others. "

Archaeology of Bronze Age China. 100 Units. ,"Bronze Age in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during which bronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by the society, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. Bronze Age in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy.

Our structure will be roughly chronological, including his late fifteenth-century Florentine artistic and social context; his two long periods in Milan as a court artist; his triumphant return to Florence and rivalry with the young Michelangelo; his brief and unsatisfying stay in papal Rome; and his final years in France. Among the themes that will be critically examined are: Leonardo's role in the creation of what is still grandiosely called the High Renaissance; the value and problematic aspects of thinking of him as the quintessential artist-scientist; the significance of the fact that he has been a figure of such obsessive art-historical and broader cultural significance for over 500 years; and the ways in which recent scientific examination and digital imaging have shed surprising amounts of new light on his art. Through the concentrated study of the works of Leonardo and his artistic context, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art history to some of the major avenues for analysis and interpretation in this field.

422,UniOfChicago,ARTH 18000. Photography And Film. 100 Units. ,"This is a core course that serves as an introduction to the history of art by concentrating on some fundamental issues in the history of photography and film. The course is divided roughly in half between still photography and film. The central theme of the course concerns the way in which photographs and films have been understood and valued during the past 165 years. There have been profound changes in attitudes and beliefs regarding the nature of photographs throughout the history of photography (this is likewise true of film). The current range of views is very different from those held by the various audiences for photographs and films in the last century and the century before. For instance, photographs were originally conceived of as copies of things that can be seen, but the notion of copy was drawn from a long-established set of views about what makes a picture a work of art and copies were said to be incapable of being works of art. This view continues to haunt the writings of some critics and historians of photography and film. The course will concentrate on the work of photographers, theorists of photography and film, and on films by John Huston, Billy Wilder, and Roman Polanski. Instructor(s): J.

Philippe Parreno's Media Temporalities. 100 Units. ,"In the 2013 exhibition Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, the French artist Philippe Parreno (b. 1964) turned the monumental space of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris into a living, evolving organism, where music, light, films, images, and performances led visitors through a precisely choreographed journey of discovery, based on the idiosyncratic body of work that he had created since the early 1990s. This course is devoted to an in-depth study of Parreno's work and the highly original form of media thinking that informs it. Rather than focusing on the properties of distinct media or on multimedial forms or presentation, his works explore the new forms of life and social existence that result from the various ways in which 20th- and 21st-century media technologies store, manipulate, and produce time. This is a form of thinking and artistic creation that addresses the realities of formats, programs, and platforms rather than media apparatuses and messages, and that engages everything from architecture and design to social situations, natural worlds, and virtual beings.

432,UniOfChicago,ARTH 23015. Ornament and Islamic Art. 100 Units. ,"Intricate patterns, luxurious materials, the absence of human figures: in the western imagination ornament and Islamic art are synonymous. This class will interrogate why, even after decades of scholarship to the contrary, the rhetoric of ornament and Islamic art persists. What does it mean to call a work of art-and by extension an entire culture-ornamental? This class positions ornament as a critical lens and explores how western ideas about the role of ornament shaped, and were shaped by, the study of Islamic artworks. In locating the ornamental history of Islamic art, we will confront legacies of imperialism and orientalism, interwoven with politics of technology, representation, and design. Islamic ornament once inspired artists and fueled early art historians. But the seeds that had been sown in the nineteenth century bore quite a different fruit in the twentieth, and modernism's explicit rejection of the ornamented surface pushed Islamic art from center stage to the periphery. We will consider foundational works of Islamic art and architecture (including textiles, carpets, metalwork, ceramics, arts of the book, calligraphy, and examples of mosque and palace architecture) and analyze the ways in which they have been imagined by European and American artists, theorists, and historians. In-class lectures and discussions will be supplemented with visits to Special Collections and the Rookery. Instructor(s): M. MacMurdie Terms Offered: Winter "

442,UniOfChicago,ARTH 24810. The Body and Embodiment in Ancient Greek Art. 100 Units. ,"Whether naked or clothed, male or female, mortal or divine, the body takes pride of place in the visual worlds constructed by ancient Greek artists. Yet this emphasis on depicting the body begs the question: What is a body that exists as an image? What, in other words, is a body that is not embodied? This problem, articulated already in our ancient sources, serves as the starting point for this course's investigation of the relationship between images of the body in Greek art and the experiences such images solicited from their viewers. It examines, on the one hand, how Greek art promoted the body as a social construct--through artistic practices that configured the body's appearance, like distinctive techniques, styles, and iconography; through conceptual categories that ascribed identities, like gender, class, and race; and through contexts that integrated depictions of the body into lived experience, like sanctuaries, cemeteries, and domestic settings. But we will give equal attention to the viewer's subjective experience of embodiment, including its sensorial and affective dimensions, and the ways in which that experience is negotiated and articulated as a function of works of art. Finally, we will turn to the legacy of the Greek body in more recent centuries and consider its enduring impact as a visual paradigm today. Instructor(s): S.

What sense can we make of concepts such as the unmediated or immediate? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of metapictures or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)?

We will be using this exhibition project, originally conceived for the 2018 Venice architecture biennial, as a framework, test site and occasional hut-sized classroom for hands-on curatorial exercises as much as artistic and philosophical debate. Both seminar and exhibition center on three philosophers' huts; these act as platforms to discuss a wide range of issues pertaining to modern and contemporary art debates: Ludwig Wittgenstein's hut in Norway, Martin Heidegger's hut in the Black Forest, and a Ian Hamilton Finlay sculpture titled Adorno's Hut (after Theodor Adorno). The course will map the relationships between these three philosophers and the shadows they cast across 20th century aesthetics and art theory, as well as consider topics related to escape and escapism, exile and retreat, habitation and homelessness, as seen through the prism of architecturally inflected contemporary art practices. The seminar's bibliography will be shaped in large part by readings of said philosophers. We will also be studying artworks, meeting artists and visiting exhibitions and sites of architectural interest. A final project, consisting of writing  construction work, will seek to expand the scope of philosophical architecture and building philosophy. Instructor(s): D.

Modernist Architecture on Campus. 100 Units. ,"How have universities brought modern architecture into campuses designed in traditional architectural styles, whether classical or medieval? How have they balanced architecture's capacity to exemplify a consistent institutional image and to symbolize innovative leadership? Can the two be integrated, whether in single new buildings, renovations of old buildings, or groupings of old and new? What effect do new building materials, methods, and technologies, as well as new purposes for buildings, have on these questions? While acknowledging other institutions, the course will focus on our own campus history, examining varied approaches to updating our collegiate Gothic campus architecture and layout from the construction of Levi Hall (the Administration Building) in the 1940s to the present. We will analyze buildings and campus plans in relation to the abundant and largely unstudied drawings and related building documents at Special Collections, and work together to interpret the histories we produce in the context of the broader, changeful history of modernist architecture and its debates. Our work will lay the foundation for a future architectural exhibition. This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Urban Design. Instructor(s): K.

The Films of Alfred Hitchcock. 100 Units. ,"No single filmmaker has equaled Alfred Hitchcock's combination of popular success, critical commentary and widespread influence on other filmmakers. Currently, his work is so familiar it threatens to be taken for granted. This course will reveal Hitchcock as the filmmaker who systematically used the stylistics of late silent film to forge a dialectical approach to the so-called Classical Style. Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, yielding a configuration of suspense, sensation and perception. Tracing Hitchcock's career chronologically, we will follow his intertwining of sexual desire and gender politics, and his reshaping of melodrama according to Freudian concepts of repression, memory, interpretation and ab-reaction, as he navigates from silent film to sound and from Great Britain to Hollywood.

This course will survey the physics of space and time, the nature of black holes, their effects on surrounding matter and light, the astrophysical contexts in which they are observed, frontier areas of research as quantum gravity and gravitational waves, and the importance of space-time physics to everyday needs such as navigation and energy. The modern theory of space and time, as well as black holes, will be placed in historical context, with special attention to the work of Albert Einstein.

This powerful framework allows us to interpret a wide range of observations and to make detailed and precise predictions for new experiments. The key motivating observations include the expansion of the Universe and how it has changed with time; the existence of radiation indicating a hot and dense early phase; the abundance of the light elements; and how matter is organized over a wide range of physical scales. The model naturally incorporates dark matter and dark energy, two surprising and poorly understood components that govern the growth of structure over time. The course will explore the history of scientific cosmology and the evidence for the Big Bang model, its consequences for the earliest moments after the Big Bang, and its predictions for the eventual fate of the Universe. Labs will include a hands-on measurement of the relic cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe and the use of astronomical data to verify key discoveries in the history of Big Bang cosmology.

This course will outline the physical principles at work and the history of the development of the key ideas: how nuclear physics and the theory of stellar interiors account for how stars shine, why they live for such long times, and how the heavy elements in their cores are dispersed to form a new generation of stars. Gravity assembles stars out of more diffuse material, a process that includes the formation of planetary systems. The course shows how, taken together, these physical processes naturally lead to the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life, namely elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and planets in stable orbits around long-lived stars.

This course will use extensive modern observational data from a wide range of telescopes to trace the modern picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the stars in them. Galaxies will then be used as markers of yet larger scale structures, in order to explore the influence of gravity over cosmic time. The object of study in this course is galaxies, and the narrative arc traced through that extensive data and understanding will highlight our profound discovery that most of the mass in galaxies (and the Universe as a whole) is in fact an exotic form of matter-dark matter-that we cannot directly see.

Cinema and the Holocaust. 100 Units. ,"Focuses on cinematic responses by several leading film directors from East  Central Europe to a central event of 20th century history -- the Holocaust. Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioning cameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandistic schemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocide produced after the actual traumatic events. This class aims at discussing the challenge of representing the Jewish genocide which has often been defined as un-representable. Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raise questions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production  a search for relevant artistic means with which to engage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation of death  suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization; intertwined notions of chance  hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims. The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the course simultaneously explores extensive  continuous cinematic production of the genre  its historical development in various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary,  Czechoslovakia during the Cold War.

Philippe Parreno's Media Temporalities. 100 Units. ,"In the 2013 exhibition Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, the French artist Philippe Parreno (b. 1964) turned the monumental space of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris into a living, evolving organism, where music, light, films, images, and performances led visitors through a precisely choreographed journey of discovery, based on the idiosyncratic body of work that he had created since the early 1990s. This course is devoted to an in-depth study of Parreno's work and the highly original form of media thinking that informs it. Rather than focusing on the properties of distinct media or on multimedial forms or presentation, his works explore the new forms of life and social existence that result from the various ways in which 20th- and 21st-century media technologies store, manipulate, and produce time. This is a form of thinking and artistic creation that addresses the realities of formats, programs, and platforms rather than media apparatuses and messages, and that engages everything from architecture and design to social situations, natural worlds, and virtual beings.

Starting out as a regional film production center, how did the Bombay film industry and Hindi cinema gain the reputation of being the leader of Indian cinema? This despite the fact that most critical acclaim, by the state and film critics, was reserved for art cinema. Through an analysis of Hindi films from the 1950s to the present we map the main trends of this complex artistic/ industrial complex to arrive at an understanding of the deep connect between cinema and other social imaginaries.

While Indian cinema has recently gained international currency through the song and dance ensembles of Bollywood, there remains much more to be said about that body of films. Moreover, Bollywood is a small (though very important) part of Indian cinema. Through a close analysis of a wide range of films in Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, and Urdu, this course will ask if Indian cinema can be thought of as a form of knowledge of the twentieth century.

It places cinema in Sub Saharan Africa in its social, cultural, and aesthetic contexts ranging from neocolonial to postcolonial, Western to Southern Africa, documentary to fiction, art cinema to TV. We will begin with La Noire de... (1966), ground-breaking film by the father of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene, contrasted w/ a South African film, African Jim (1959) that more closely resembles African American musical film, and anti-colonial and anti apartheid films from Lionel Rogosin's Come Back Africa (1959) to Sarah Maldoror's Sambizanga, Ousmane Sembenes Camp de Thiaroye (1984), and Jean Marie Teno'ss Afrique, Je te Plumerai (1995).

We will view ten films by most renowned directors from Poland. The course will assess what the end of World War II, joining the Eastern Bloc, the fall of communism, and finally the entry into post-Soviet Europe have meant for the film culture and the Polish national film tradition.

Soviet Science Fiction. 100 Units. ,"In the Soviet Union, science fiction played an integral part in intellectual debates about the best way to engage with the new realities of the twentieth century. This literary and cinematic genre was thought capable of reinventing the lives, realties and even beliefs of the Soviets. This course will study the cultural, historical, and political contexts of science fiction from the Soviet Union through literature such as Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopian novel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), Ivan Efremov's The Andromeda Nebula (1956), and the work Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, as well as through films such as Iakov Protazanov's Aelita (1924), the first Soviet science fiction film, along with later imaginings of space travel such as Pavel Klushantsev's Road to the Stars (1957), and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972)-a mysterious, human drama set in space. The primary goal of the course is to study how Soviet writers and filmmakers utilizes science fiction to interpret and/or comment upon their present historical moment? What alternatives to Soviet reality were proposed through science fiction? Lastly, how did science fiction texts and films relate to scientific research in the Soviet Union, especially the Soviet space program? Equivalent Course(s): REES 24414 "

742,UniOfChicago,CMST 24530. Cowboys and Tramps in Film and Literature. 100 Units. ,"The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the invention of two distinctly American literary archetypes: the cowboy and the hobo. Based on historical conditions of labor, economics, and westward expansion, the cowboy and the hobo, though both itinerant workers primarily employed seasonally in agriculture and ranching, were depicted very differently in literature and, later, film, during the decades in which they held influence over America's imagination and mythologization of itself. Evoking responses from fear to admiration and pity to envy, the cowboy and the hobo, both as historical figures and as fictional types, reflected the evolving realities of-and the broad range of attitudes toward-labor, masculinity, and place in a modernizing America. This course will examine literary and cinematic representations of hoboes, tramps, cowboys, and gunslingers from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, tracing their historical and cultural contexts. We will address pulp and dime novels as well as literary masterpieces, stage plays, poems, and feature films from the silent and sound eras, paying special attention to the effects of different media and art forms on the depiction and mythologization of these figures. Other themes include violence and the state, the American West, technology (trains, automation in agriculture, weapons), immigration and migration, race, and material culture. Authors and directors include Jack London, Charlie Chaplin, John Ford, Preston Sturges, Jack Kerouac, Hart Crane, Bret Harte, Terrence Malick, and Martin Scorsese.

This course will trace the encounter with cinematic modernity through the analysis of individual films by major directors, including (but not limited to) Shukhrat Abbasov, Melis Ubukeev, Ali Khamraev, Tolomush Okeev, Sergei Paradzhanov, Gulshad Omarova. In addition to situating the films in their cultural and historical situations, close attention will be paid to the sources of Central Asian cinema in cinemas both adjacent and distant; to the ways in which cinema enables a distinct encounter with modernity; and to the cinematic construction of Central Asia as a cultural entity.

744,UniOfChicago,"CMST 24568. The Underground: Alienation, Mobilization, Resistance. 100 Units. ","The ancient and multivalent image of the underground has crystallized over the last two centuries to denote sites of disaffection from-and strategies of resistance to-dominant social, political and cultural systems. We will trace the development of this metaphor from the Underground Railroad in the mid-1800s and the French Resistance during World War II to the Weather Underground in the 1960s-1970s, while also considering it as a literary and artistic concept, from Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground and Ellison's Invisible Man to Chris Marker's film La Jetée and Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker. Alongside with such literary and cinematic tales, drawing theoretical guidance from refuseniks from Henry David Thoreau to Guy Debord, this course investigates how countercultural spaces become-or fail to become-sites of political resistance, and also how dissenting ideologies give rise to countercultural spaces. We ask about the relation between social deviance (the failure to meet social norms, whether willingly or unwittingly) and political resistance, especially in the conditions of late capitalism and neo-colonialism, when countercultural literature, film and music (rock, punk, hip-hop, DIY aesthetics etc.) get absorbed into-and coopted by-the hegemonic socio-economic system. In closing we will also consider contemporary forms of dissidence-from Pussy Riot to Black Lives Matter-that rely both on the vulnerability of individual bodies and global communication networks.

How and why are ghosts represented in particular forms in a particular culture at particular historical moments and how do these change as stories travel between cultures? This course will explore the complex meanings, both literal and figurative, of ghosts and the fantastic in traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tales, plays, and films . Issues to be explored include: 1) the relationship between the supernatural, gender, and sexuality; 2) the confrontation of death and mortality; 3) collective anxieties over the loss of the historical past 4) and the visualization (and exorcism) of ghosts through performance.

China's New Documentary Cinema. 100 Units. ,"Since the early 1990s, the new documentary has emerged as one of the most prominent phenomena in Chinese film and video, widely circulating at international film festivals and eliciting considerable critical debate. This course examines the styles and functions of China's new documentary over the last fifteen years, paying particular attention to the institutional, cultural, economic, and political conditions that underpin its flourishing. This overview will lead us to consider questions that concern the recent explosion of the documentary form worldwide, and to explore the tensions and imbalances that characterize the global circulation of the genre. We will address such issues as: what is new about China's recent documentary cinema; the national and transnational dimensions of documentary filmmaking, and the ways in which these dimensions intersect in its production and circulation; the extent to which the international demand for unofficial images from China has contributed to its growth; the politics involved in documentary filmmaking, and the forms and meanings of independent cinema in the wake of intensified globalization; the links between Chinese documentary and the global rise of documentary filmmaking, and the ways in which they challenge extant concepts and theorizations of the genre.

While we will watch films of the great auteurs such as Mizoguchi, Ozu, and Naruse, the increasing number of subtitled films and DVDs of prewar Japanese cinema allows for unprecedented access to a wide variety of filmmaking practices. Hence, in addition to auteur films, we will watch old-school period films and adaptations from popular literature, high speed nihilistic action films, socialist tendency films, critical documentaries, melodramas, experimental film and animation, and wartime propaganda. Along with the films, we will read writings on film by a range of thinkers and artists to engage with a variety of issues, including gender, realism, modernism, propaganda, human/animal, violence, and mass culture. We will look at the ways cinema, as both a participant in and a unique reflection on modernity, fundamentally transformed the relationship of Japan to the world.

We will question how and why stories are created, as well as what motivates us to continue reading, watching, and listening to stories. We will explore how particular genres (such as detective stories and thrillers) and the mediums of literature and film influence our understanding of suspense and narrative more broadly. Close readings of primary sources will be supplemented with critical and theoretical readings. Literary readings will include work by John Buchan, Arthur Conan Doyle, Feodor Dostoevsky, Graham Greene, Bohumil Hrabal, and J.M. Coetzee.

750,UniOfChicago,CMST 25514. Symbolism and Cinema. 100 Units. ,"In his 1896 essay on cinema, Russian writer Maxim Gorky described the new medium to madness or symbolism. The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was a dominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly) that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and even invisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention to French and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematic medium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and the mystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relates to notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and some American) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage to Andrei Tarkovsky.

While this course touches upon the early history of television, we will focus our attention on the era between the commercialization of television in the United States (in the early 1950s) and the rise of internet-based television via services such as Hulu (in the 2000s). As we will see, the history of television in these years, intersects with numerous other media, such as radio, film, video, digital games, and the novel. Alongside a study of the medium of television and its role in American culture, we will attend carefully to the form of TV narrative as it changes from an early episodic format to the complex long-form serial narratives that attained maturity in the 1990s. Through historical, formal, and cultural analyses, we will attempt to make sense of the recent renaissance of television narrative characterized by such serial programs as The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Mad Men. The course combines theoretical texts with close readings of particular television shows.

Currently, his work is so familiar it threatens to be taken for granted. This course will reveal Hitchcock as the filmmaker who systematically used the stylistics of late silent film to forge a dialectical approach to the so-called Classical Style. Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, yielding a configuration of suspense, sensation and perception. Tracing Hitchcock's career chronologically, we will follow his intertwining of sexual desire and gender politics, and his reshaping of melodrama according to Freudian concepts of repression, memory, interpretation and ab-reaction, as he navigates from silent film to sound and from Great Britain to Hollywood.

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with - during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions - but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

Combining philosophical, critical, and historical readings with careful analysis of films, we will cover topics that include early spectators' fascination with the moving image itself, the relation between the natural perception of movement and cinematic movement, the history and poetics of camera movement, different technologies for recording and simulating movement (including cel animation and CGI), and the problems that movement has posed as an object of aesthetic analysis. Texts discussed include works by Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson, Vivian Sobchack, Kristin Thompson, and Arthur Danto. Screenings include works by Busby Berkeley, Maya Deren, Max Ophuls, Chuck Jones, Chris Marker, Chantal Akerman, and Gus Van Sant. Instructor(s): J. Schonig Terms Offered: Autumn "

The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the unmediated or immediate? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of metapictures or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become mixed in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T.

","By cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible band called film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to new media and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels and reassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the most radical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between the OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving image for more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologies to explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrial forces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use new computer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developed for and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching, analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless of previous programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture.

This course will look at how these media work: the history of their development, the changes they have brought about in a broader media culture, their political implications, and their social status and significance (e.g., the place they occupy in culture, the kinds of interactions they make possible). The focus will equally be on the ways in which cinema has responded to the changing digital landscape, which will be explored through both blockbuster and experimental films as well as video and web-based art. Readings will be taken from the history of film theory, recent work in media history and archeology, and theoretical studies of digital media and technology. Instructor(s): D.

820,UniOfChicago,CLCV 24017. The Spartan Divergence. 100 Units. ,"Sparta was a Greek city, but of what type? The ancient tradition, or at least the larger part of it, paints the portrait of an ideal city-state. The city was supposed to be stable and moderately prosperous. Its citizens were allegedly models of virtue. For many centuries the city did not experience revolutions and its army was invincible on the battlefield. This success was attributed to its perfect institutions. Following the track opened by Ollier's Spartan Mirage, modern scholarship has scrupulously and successfully deconstructed this image of an ideal city. But what do we find if we go beyond the looking glass? Was Sparta really a city like all the others? This class will show that we must go deeper into our evidence in order to make sense of the extraordinary success followed by the brutal collapse of this very special city-state.

","Doubt has been a fundamental tool from the foundations of Western philosophy, used by radicals and orthodox thinkers, skeptics and system-builders, theologians and scientists. Philosophical skepticism and its evolving palette of intellectual tools shaped the ancient philosophical schools of Greece and Rome, the solidification of early Christian doctrine, the scholastic debates of the later Middle Ages, the neoclassical explosions of the Renaissance, the new philosophy of the seventeenth century, the radical projects of the Enlightenment, and the advent of the modern scientific method. This course reviews the history of systematic philosophical doubt, focusing on primary source readings from Sextus Empiricus and Cicero to William of Ockham and the Averroist controversies, to Montaigne, Descartes, Bacon, and Diderot. Undergraduate writing assignments focus on polishing advanced writing ability through short assignments targeting concision, critical thinking, and journalistic writing skills with creative elements.

826,UniOfChicago,CLCV 24818. The Body and Embodiment in Ancient Greek Art. 100 Units. ,"Whether naked or clothed, male or female, mortal or divine, the body takes pride of place in the visual worlds constructed by ancient Greek artists. Yet this emphasis on depicting the body begs the question: What is a body that exists as an image? What, in other words, is a body that is not embodied? This problem, articulated already in our ancient sources, serves as the starting point for this course's investigation of the relationship between images of the body in Greek art and the experiences such images solicited from their viewers. It examines, on the one hand, how Greek art promoted the body as a social construct--through artistic practices that configured the body's appearance, like distinctive techniques, styles, and iconography; through conceptual categories that ascribed identities, like gender, class, and race; and through contexts that integrated depictions of the body into lived experience, like sanctuaries, cemeteries, and domestic settings. But we will give equal attention to the viewer's subjective experience of embodiment, including its sensorial and affective dimensions, and the ways in which that experience is negotiated and articulated as a function of works of art. Finally, we will turn to the legacy of the Greek body in more recent centuries and consider its enduring impact as a visual paradigm today. Instructor(s): S.

This course interrogates the representations of islands in ancient thought as well as their own archaeological and historical records in order to trace their often elliptical categorization in modern scholarship. Are islands unique because they are isolated, or rather because they become crossroads of interaction? From the mythical island of the Cyclopes, to the Aegean archipelagos, to the large masses like Sicily or Cyprus, discussions will explore approaches to insularity, isolation, connectivity, and identity using a wide range of textual and material evidence and theoretical insights from geography, anthropology, history, literature, and environmental science.

840,UniOfChicago,CLCV 26011. Ancient Views of the Economy. 100 Units. ,"The ancient economy is a topic that for a long period had fallen into neglect. But for a few years it has experienced an exceptional revival in the field of ancient studies. This is why it is time to revisit classical authors and examine what they can tell us on the economic world they were living in. Starting with Herodotus, moving on with Thucydides, Ps-Iamblichus, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, Livy and Cicero, this course will provide a general outlook of what the writers of the Classical and Hellenistic period (for Greece) or Republican period (for Rome) can teach us on the topic. It will show certain continuities between some of them but will also be explicit on the vivid debates that could oppose others. Beyond the economic paradigm, it will also provide a new approach to a series of ancient authors. Instructor(s): A. Bresson Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CLAS 36011 "
841,UniOfChicago,CLCV 26017. Gods and God in Imperial Asia Minor (1-300 CE) 100 Units. ,"Roman Asia Minor in the Imperial period provides an extraordinary case of religious plurality and creativity. Pagans, Jews, Christians, even already Christian heretics, interacted in the same space. The frontiers between Jewish and Christian communities were, at least at the beginning, more fluid than was long thought. But even the frontiers between paganism and Judaism or Christianity were certainly not as rigid as was later imagined. This does not mean, however, that there were no tensions between the various groups. This class will examine the various aspects of this religious diversity as well as the social and political factors that may explain the religious equilibrium prevailing at that time in Asia Minor.

843,UniOfChicago,CLCV 26216. Pagans and Christians: Greek Backgrounds to Early Christianity. 100 Units. ,"This course will examine some of the Greco-Roman roots of early Christianity. We will focus on affinities between Christianity and the classical tradition as well as ways in which the Christian faith may be considered radically different. Some of the more important issues that we will analyze are: 1. The spell of Homer. How the Homeric poems exerted immeasurable influence on the religious attitudes and practices of the Greeks. 2. The theme of creation in Greek and Roman authors such as Hesiod and Ovid. The Orphic account of human origins. The Early Christian theme of Christ as creator/savior. 3. Greek and Roman conceptions of the afterlife. The response to the Homeric orientation in the form of the great mystery cults of Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The views of the philosophers (esp. Plato). The New Testament conception of resurrection. 4. Greek and Roman conceptions of sacrifice, the crucifixion of Christ as archetypal sacrifice and early Christian reflection upon it. 5. The world of ancient magic and the Christian response. Instructor(s): David Martinez Terms Offered: Spring Equivalent Course(s): RLST 20505 "

We will focus our attention on Plato and Aristotle, but will also spend some time with Longinus and Plotinus. Topics will include: the analysis of poetry in terms of mimesis and image; poetry-making as an exercise of craft, divine inspiration, or some other sort of knowledge; the emotional effect on the audience; the role of poetry in forming moral character and, more broadly, its place in society; the relation between poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy; aesthetic values of beauty, wonder, truth, and grace.

Introduction to Women and Gender in the Ancient World. 100 Units. ,"This course provides an introduction to aspects of women's lives in the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean: primarily Greece and Rome, but drawing occasionally on examples also from the Near East and Egypt. We will examine not only what women actually did and did not do in these societies, but also how they were perceived by their male contemporaries and what value to society they were believed to have. The course will focus on how women are reflected in the material and visual cultures, but it will also incorporate historical and literary evidence, as well. Through such a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, we will examine the complexities and ambiguities of women's lives in the ancient Mediterranean and begin to understand the roots of modern conceptions and perceptions of women in the Western world today.

846,UniOfChicago,CLCV 26601. The Ancient City: The Greek World. 100 Units. ,This annually offered course focuses on the development and transformation of cities in the ancient Mediterranean world. Among the issues to be discussed are how one defines a city and whether ancient cities satisfy those definitional criteria; what factors account for the emergence of cities; and what elements give rise to a particularly urban way of life. Theoretical reflections will be interspersed with specific case-studies. This year the focus will be on the cities of the Greek world and will consider topics such as the relationship between the city and the polis and the degree to which Athens was a typical Greek city.

This course will explore how cities became such a dominant feature of settlement patterns in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, ca. 4,000 BCE-350 CE. Was there an Urban Revolution, and how did it start? What various physical forms did cities assume, and why did cities physically differ (or not) from each other? What functions did cities have in different cultures of the past, and what cultural value did urban life have? How do past perspectives on cities compare with contemporary ones? Working thematically and using theoretical and comparative approaches, this course will address various aspects of ancient urban space and its occupation, with each topic backed up by in-depth analysis of concrete case studies.

At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of normal psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of culture and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century.

In cultural, political, and educational spheres, disabilities are non-normative, marginal, even invisible. This runs counter to many of our lived experiences of difference where, in fact, disabilities of all kinds are the new normal. In this interdisciplinary course, we center both the category and experience of disability. Moreover, we consider the stakes of explicitly designing for different kinds of bodies and minds. Rather than approaching disability as a problem to be accommodated, we consider the affordances that disability offers for design. This course begins by situating us in the growing discipline of Disability Studies and the activist (and intersectional) Disability Justice movement. We then move to four two-week units in specific areas where disability meets design: architecture, infrastructure, and public space; education and the classroom; economics, employment, and public policy; and aesthetics. Traversing from architecture to art, and from education to economic policy, this course asks how we can design for access. Instructor(s): M. Friedner, J.

Some guiding questions will be: how do we, and should we, conceive the materiality of the body? How do assumptions about 'nature' and the 'natural' determine how we view categories of identity, and what are the political ramifications of these determinations? Why, within certain discourses, has the fluidity of gender been promoted, while the fluidity of race remains controversial and generally unsupported? How do we account for these different receptions, and what kind of opportunities do they make available for politically engaged communities? How can we simultaneously value performative theories of gender, while also maintaining a certain stability of identity as developed within trans criticism, even when these two discourses seem in direct conflict?

929,UniOfChicago,"CMLT 23212. Art, Ekphrasis, and Myth in Early Modern Spanish Theater. 100 Units. ","In the early modern age, the verbal had a strong visual component. Poets and playwrights utilized the sense of sight since it was the highest of the Platonic senses and a mnemonic key to lead spectators to remember vividly what they had read or heard, long before spectacle plays were in fashion. One important technique for visualization was ekphrasis, the description of an art work within a text. Often, to perform was to imitate the affects, sentiments and poses of a painting. For this purpose, playwrights such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega and Calderón often turned to the mythological canvases of the Italian Renaissance along with the portraits of great rulers and images of battle. The class will examine the uses of art onstage: mnemonic, mimetic, political, religious comic, tragic, lyric and licentious. It will also delve into different forms of ekphrasis from the notional to the dramatic and from the fragmented to the reversed. Although the course will focus on Spanish plays of the early modern period, it will also include ancient treatises by Cicero, and Pliny as well as Renaissance mnemonic treatises by Della Porta. The course will be in English. Reading knowledge of Spanish is required since plays will be read in the original. Those taking the class for credit in Spanish must write their final paper in Spanish.

930,UniOfChicago,CMLT 24105. Letters to Zion. 100 Units. ,"This seminar centers the question: what do we mean when we describe Jewish authors and thinkers from the past as Zionist, anti-Zionist, or non-Zionist? We will approach this question by reading three correspondences: Kafka's letters to Felice Bauer, and the correspondences between Gershom Scholem and Hannah Arendt and between Paul Celan and Ilana Shmueli. In each case, the question of Zionism and of Israel looms in the background of the exchange in some way. Our key question is: can we definitively determine the position of each of these letter-writers on the question of Zionism? And do we want to? Or does the form of the correspondence rather open a possibility for a more flexible, complex account of their positions, allowing us to think of them as changing and evolving, indeed as dialogic? In addition to the letters themselves, we will read other texts by these authors and about them, as well as background reading on the letter as genre and as historical document. We will also take note of the fact that these are all exchanges that cross the gender divide and ask how the question of Zionist ideology intersects with issues of gender in Jewish history.

931,UniOfChicago,CMLT 26210. Oedipus in Zion: The Oedipal Figure in Modern Hebrew Literature. 100 Units. ,"Historians often refer to the emergence of Zionism as an Oedipal Revolution. Hence, the secular son's rebellion against his orthodox father is understood as the thrust that triggered the modern Jewish revolution. Alan Mintz aptly described the inter-generational rift between fathers and sons at the turn of the 20th century as a tragic yet inevitable consequence of modernity, underscoring the psychological difficulties and political dilemmas that haunted the sons who were banished form their father's table. This seminar will focus on the (highly androcentric) oedipal figure in literary theory and explore its prominence in modern Hebrew literature. Freud's preoccupation with the Oedipus complex at the turn of the century coincided with the emergence of a powerful oedipal narrative in modern Hebrew culture. This confluence provides a fascinating backdrop to the invention"" of the Oedipus complex. We will read a variety of literary texts which rework the oedipal figure from the late 19th century to the 1980s and beyond.

The course will explore the intertwining political and intellectual histories of the Russian Eurasianist movement, Hungarian Jobbik, the American Traditional Workers Party, the French GRECE, Greek Golden Dawn, and others through their published essays, blogs, vlogs and social media. Perhaps most importantly, the course asks: can we use f-word (fascism) to describe this problem? In order to pose this question we will explore the aesthetic concerns of the New Right in relation to postmodern theory, and the affective politics of nationalism.

The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time.

Proud… This course provides insight into identity dynamics between the West, as the center of economic power and self-proclaimed normative humanity, and the Rest, as the poor, backward, volatile periphery. We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units. ,"The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

We will continue with fictional and nonfictional narrative responses to apartheid and decolonization in film and in print, and examine the power and the limits of what critic Louise Bethlehem has called the rhetoric of urgency on local and international audiences. We will conclude with writing and film that grapples with the complexities of the post-apartheid world, whose challenges, from crime and corruption to AIDS and the particular problems faced by women and gender minorities, elude the heroic formulas of the anti-apartheid struggle era.

950,UniOfChicago,CRES 27502. Africans in the Early Americas. 100 Units. ,"During the era of the transatlantic slave trade, more than 350,000 Africans were forcibly trafficked to what is now the United States. The experiences of these men and women and their descendants-particularly their exploitation under a system of racialized slavery-profoundly shaped the course of US history up to and including the present day. These individuals were significant, but they were also only one part of the more than 12 million people who came from Africa to the Americas in the colonial period. Focusing on the diverse experiences of Africans and their descendants-as slaves, but also as colonizers, soldiers, revolutionaries, family members, and free men and women-this course surveys the history of Africans in the Americas from the late fifteenth through the late nineteenth century. Adopting a broad geographic and temporal perspective allows for an exploration of the evolving relationships between labor, gender, and race in North, Central, and South America, including the Spanish, French, and English Caribbean. In this course we will ask: How did the experiences of Africans in the colonial and early republican United States compare with those of Africans in other parts of early America? How might learning about and comparing the experiences of free and enslaved Africans and Afro-descended peoples in different parts of the Americas re-shape our understanding of the multiple origins, meanings, and possibilities of race and national belonging?

957,UniOfChicago,"CRES 24255. Everyday Maoism: Work, Daily Life, and Material Culture in Socialist China. 100 Units. ","The history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns: land and marriage reform, nationalization of industry, anti-rightist campaign, Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, etc. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, socialism was as much about material changes as about politics: about the two-story brick houses, electric lights and telephones (loushang louxia, diandeng dianhua) that the revolution had promised; about new work regimes and new consumption patterns-or, to the contrary, about the absence of such change. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the new objects of socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people's daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people's life experiences out of material objects?

969,UniOfChicago,CRES 27504. Racism without Race. 100 Units. ,"In early 2010 a member of staff at the Regenstein library contacted the police to report an unruly student. The police arrived at the scene and charged the student with criminal trespass and resisting arrest. The student was put in a choke hold and handcuffed before being taken to the local police station where he was held in a cell overnight.According to witnesses, the library staff member's response was unwarranted and so too were the actions taken by the police officers. Individuals later interviewed for the Chicago Maroon described the student's treatment as an instance of 'racial profiling.' How are we to make sense of this incident and others similar to it? There is strong evidence to suggest that the reactions of the authority figures involved were shaped by their attitudes toward skin color. It would seem farfetched, however, to conclude that these reactions reflected an ideology of racial differentiation or what we might call 'traditional' race ideology: the view that human beings can be classified scientifically according to race and that some races are better than, or superior to, others. Theories of race and racial difference have largely been discredited and there are no longer any official institutions, respected academics or public individuals who espouse these. How then do we explain the continued salience of skin color, and what value is there in applying terms such as 'race' and 'racism' to describe it? The following course seeks to reframe the way we go about analyzing contemporary forms of social differentiation based on skin color. It looks at skin color as a culturally recognizable sign, which, like other signs, acquires significance only within the context of a broader set of semiotic ideologies and practices. This means directing our attention to the ways in which color-as-sign takes on meaning in the world we live. Such an approach offers a conceptual framework for a comparative study of past and present forms of discrimination based on skin color while also remaining sensitive to the particularities that define these.

Students will then dive into studies of the daily struggles and successes of Native American city-dwellers, with an emphasis on mid-20th-century Chicago. Readings and in-class activities will explore issues related to: housing, work, stereotypes and discrimination, cultural survival and traditionalism, physical and mental health, the rise of pan-Indianism, activism, schooling, class divisions, multi/locality, generational differences, identity and intersectionality, representation and the arts, and the very recognition or lack thereof mentioned above. The knowledge and analytic skills developed in this course will therefore serve as an uncommon window into Native American studies and urban studies, as well as broader race- and place-conscious work in the social sciences and humanities.

977,UniOfChicago,"CRES 20207. Race, Ethnicity, and Human Development. 100 Units. ","Twenty-first century practices of relevance to education, social services, health care and public policy deserve buttressing by cultural and context linked perspectives about human development as experienced by diverse groups. Although generally unacknowledged as such post-Brown v. 1954, the conditions purported to support human development for diverse citizens remain problematic. The consequent interpretative shortcomings serve to increase human vulnerability. Specifically, given the problem of evident unacknowledged privilege for some as well as the insufficient access to resources experienced by others, the dilemma skews our interpretation of behavior, design of research, choice of theory, and determination of policy and practice. The course is based upon the premise that the study of human development is enhanced by examining the experiences of diverse groups, without one group standing as the standard against which others are compared and evaluated. Accordingly, the course provides an encompassing theoretical framework for examining the processes of human development for diverse humans while also highlighting the critical role of context and culture.

985,UniOfChicago,"CRES 27302. Gender, Sexuality, Indigenous Women in the Colonial Encounter. 100 Units. ","This course is premised on the belief that the history of gender and sexuality in colonial contexts is just as crucial and revealing as other more geopolitical, military, or diplomatic topics. In this sense, laws regulating marriage or Europeans exchanging of postcards of exotic women are just as significant as land annexations or military technology. Through the quarter, we will think through not only what the history of imperialism tells us about gender and sexuality, but also what this type of analysis reveals about colonialism and empire. What was the relationship between the socio- political organization of European empires and ideologies of gender and sexuality in both colony and metropole? We will also consider intersectional questions, such as the connections between regulating intimacy and the creation of race-based imperial hierarchies. To gain historical precision in examining these more abstract or theoretical questions, we will anchor our readings and discussion around particular indigenous woman and their contexts. While the study of gender and sexuality in a colonial context has come a long way in recent years, the majority of sources for examining gender and colonialism are about white women. To push back against this absence, we will take a case study approach to consider the lives and narratives surrounding indigenous women in colonial cultures. Instructor(s): E.

1036,UniOfChicago,CMSC 23310. Advanced Distributed Systems. 100 Units. ,"In recent years, large distributed systems have taken a prominent role not just in scientific inquiry, but also in our daily lives. When we perform a search on Google, stream content from Netflix, place an order on Amazon, or catch up on the latest comings-and-goings on Facebook, our seemingly minute requests are processed by complex systems that sometimes include hundreds of thousands of computers, connected by both local and wide area networks. Recent papers in the field of Distributed Systems have described several solutions (such as MapReduce, BigTable, Dynamo, Cassandra, etc.) for managing large-scale data and computation. However, building and using these systems pose a number of more fundamental challenges: How do we keep the system operating correctly even when individual machines fail? How do we ensure that all the machines have a consistent view of the system's state? (And how do we ensure this in the presence of failures?) How can we determine the order of events in a system where we can't assume a single global clock? Many of these fundamental problems were identified and solved over the course of several decades, starting in the 1970s. To better appreciate the challenges of recent developments in the field of Distributed Systems, this course will guide students through seminal work in Distributed Systems from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, leading up to a discussion of recent work in the field.

1084,UniOfChicago,CRWR 20401. Technical Seminar in Nonfiction: The Synecdoche. 100 Units. ,"Every writer of personal nonfiction knows that ultimately the story isn't about them: it's about something larger, perhaps universal, and their personal story is merely a means to that end. The key to this paradox is the synecdoche, or the part that stands for the whole. It's the grain of sand that contains the universe, the one story that by implication tells other peoples' stories. When Anne Fadiman told the story of a Hmong immigrant to the United States, she told a larger story about immigration in general. So did Joan Didion, in Where I Was From; by telling the story of her family, she told the story of California, and by telling the story of California she told the story of the West and thus of America. Rian Malan did the same in My Traitor's Heart: by telling the story of his family he told the story of Apartheid, and thus of South Africa, and of our segregated world. Through weekly exercises and analytic essays you'll see how these and other writers locate the universal in their particulars, and you'll apply their examples to your own work.

These are all labels that critics and reviewers have used to characterize prose styles that call attention to themselves in distinct ways. Of course, what constitutes style not only changes over time, but also means different things in different literary traditions. How, then, do translators carry style over from one language and cultural milieu to another? And to what extent does style structure storytelling? We will explore these questions by reading a variety of modern and contemporary stylists who either write in English or translate into English, paying special attention to what stylistic devices are at work and what their implications are for narration, characterization, and world building. Further, we'll examine the range of choices that each writer and translator makes when constituting and reconstituting style, on a lexical, tonal, and syntactic scale. By pairing readings with generative exercises in stylistics and constrained writing, we will build toward the translation of a short work of contemporary fiction into English.

We'll look at the Modernists' experiments with refrain, repetition, and pure verbal music, their attempts to find out what's behind things, as Woolf put it. We'll consider literary improvisation as Ellison meant the term: the gathering of seemingly disparate materials to synthesize something wildly new. We'll explore how musicians are often allowed (or forced) to cross cultural boundaries through texts like Baldwin's This Evening, This Morning, So Soon and interviews with Wendy Carlos and Fred Hersch. We'll also look at the burgeoning field of rhythmology, and use it as a bridge to examine how music also borrows from fiction, through storytelling in song and a guest lecture from a Pulitzer-Prizenominated composer.

1108,UniOfChicago,EALC 10710. Topics in EALC: Intertwined Literatures of Postwar Asia. 100 Units. ,"This course explores literature that illustrates the interconnectedness of Asia in the decade following the conclusion of the Second World War. While the surrender of Japan and the onset of the Cold War contributed to the re-entrenchment of fiercely independent national literatures in Asia, national frameworks tend to obscure the ongoing links across Asia evoked in the works of many writers dealing with this period. Further, the notion of the postwar tends to disregard the ways in which war's effects continued to shape the Asian continent through Allied occupations and such widespread conflicts as the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. By putting the postwar literatures of Asia in conversation with one another, we will aim to achieve a fuller understanding of these texts that have both depicted international circulation and spread through international communities themselves. Course materials include short stories, novels, plays, reportage, and autobiographical writings from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Tibet, Mongolia, Okinawa, and North and South Korea. All readings for this course are available in English; no knowledge of any Asian language is required. Instructor(s): N. Lambrecht Terms Offered: Spring "
1109,UniOfChicago,EALC 22235. Revolutionary Romance in Socialist China. 100 Units. ,"One of the goals of the socialist revolution was to transform social relations, not only those between classes but also family and romantic relations. One of the first laws that the Chinese Communist Party issued after the founding of the People's Republic was the New Marriage Law, which banned arranged marriages, concubinage, and arrangements involving minors. 1950s cinema and literature advertised romantic love as an important achievement of the new society. At the same time, loyalty to the Party and to the collectivity were also core values that the media emphasized. In this class, we will look at how literature and cinema instructed viewers on how to select one's object of love in Revolutionary China, and how love for a romantic partner, for the party, and for the people were differently foregrounded at specific historical moments. How did ideas of romantic love change from the 1940s to the 1980s, and how did cinema contribute to promoting them? What forms of intimacy and models of attachment characterized revolutionary romance? Which kind of person constituted an ideal romantic partner? Who was to be loved, how, and why? Should one orient one's passion toward one person, many, or none? Instructor(s): P. Iovene Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): EALC 32235 "

","The socialist period (for our purposes here, c. 1949-1990) fundamentally transformed the institutions of Chinese social and economic life. Marriage and family were redefined; rural communities were reorganized on a collective basis; private property in land and other means of production was abolished. Industrialization created a new urban working class, whose access to welfare, consumer goods, and political rights depended to a large extent on their membership in work units (danwei). Migration between city and countryside came to a halt, and rural and urban society developed in different directions. This course will focus on the concrete details of how this society functioned. How did state planning work? What was it like to work in a socialist factory? What role did money and consumption play in a planned economy?

1111,UniOfChicago,EALC 23001. Censorship in East Asia: The Case of Colonial Korea. 100 Units. ,"This course examines the operation and consequences of censorship in the Japanese Empire, with focus on its effects in colonial Korea. It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities' measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship-both external and internal-and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.

China's Eco-Environmental Challenges and Society's Responses. 100 Units. ,"In nearly four decades of reform and opening policies, China's economic achievements have come at a high cost for its ecological environment; air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, among other problems, are facts of life for most Chinese citizens. In addition, China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and has recently acknowledged its contributions to global warming and the need for drastic mitigation of greenhouse gases. Facing these tremendous challenges, remarkable shifts in the way that Chinese society communicates and tackles these problems are occurring. This seminar will look, in particular, at relevant public debates, crucial policies, as well as popular initiatives and protest, to approach this wide topic. How is the relationship between humans/society and nature/environment conceptualized and communicated? Can we detect shifts from traditional to modern, even contemporary 'Chinese approaches'? And to what extent and how do political authorities, media, the general population and scientists in China interact in the face of the acknowledged risks that environmental pollution poses to communities, to China's (economic) development and, not least, to individual health and well-being. Basic knowledge about modern Chinese society and politics as well as Chinese reading skills are helpful, but not a strict requirement for participation in this course. Instructor(s): A.L.

They raise questions as to how citizenship, i.e. in this case membership in a community, a country/nation state, or a social system is defined and which rights and duties it entails, as well as what are the prerequisites for obtaining and loosing it. In this class we will discuss concepts of citizenship and analyze their representations in modern Chinese society. This includes historical and conceptual-history dimensions and encompasses notions of citizenship that are pertaining to the local, national (incl. empire/civilization), and the global level.

The novel not only displays the unprecedented usage of realistic language in portraying the quotidian life, but also shows intricate literary skills in narrative and lyricism. This class investigates the internal and external worlds of Honglou meng, and reflects on the ethics and aesthetics of novel in late imperial China. We will explore, on the one hand, literary choices that made the novel sophisticated, such as the narrative strategies, the complexity in characterization, and the high degree of intertextuality which shows the creative use of other literary genres (poetry, drama, riddle). On the other hand, reading alongside recent scholarship on material culture and gender studies, we examine the interactive relations between the novel and the fashion of exquisite domestic life in the late imperial society and answer these questions.

Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. Bronze Age in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production.

1232,UniOfChicago,"ECON 12210. Economic History II: The Early Modern World, circa 1300-1800. 100 Units. ","This course both describes preindustrial economic life and weighs the models used to explain fundamental changes to it. We will begin by describing some of the basic structures that determined patterns of production, exchange, and consumption in a period of low and easily reversible growth. These include agricultural productivity, demographic constraints, modes of transportation, and the social structures that governed the distribution of what little surplus premodern societies produced. Turning to the sources of economic dynamism that may have contributed to later industrialization, we will first examine the growth of long-distance trade networks starting in the late fourteenth century. How were traditional economies characterized by limited movement stimulated by the circulation of people, goods, and money from afar? We will then move to a discussion of the factors leading to (or frustrating) transformational patterns of economic growth: agricultural productivity, institutions, proto-industrial production in an era of limited urban growth, and changing norms of consumption.

","If meteorological data and models show us that climate change is real, art and literature explore what it means for our collective human life. This is the premise of many recent films, novels, and artworks that ask how a changing climate will affect human society. In this course, we will examine the aesthetics of climate change across media, in order to understand how narrative, image, and even sound help us witness a planetary disaster that is often imperceptible. Our approach will be comparative: what kind of story about climate change can a science fiction novel about a dystopian future tell, and how is this story different than, say, that of an art installation made of melting blocks of Arctic ice? Do different media tend to emphasize different aspects of ecological crisis? Readings and discussions will introduce students to some of the ways that humanities scholarship is contributing to climate change research.

1312,UniOfChicago,"ENGL 12720. Inventing Consciousness: Literature, Philosophy, Psychology. 100 Units. ","Consciousness is an historical achievement. As a phenomenon, consciousness probably came into being somewhere deep in evolutionary time. Yet as a concept consciousness is relatively new: the European notion of consciousness emerges only in the late seventeenth century. This course draws on the resources of literature, history, philosophy, and psychology to examine how the concept of consciousness came to possess the explanatory dominance it currently holds. We will begin by acquiring a sense of what consciousness currently means in philosophy and psychology, paying particular attention to how the Western concept differs from similar ideas in such traditions as Buddhism. After examining the pre-history of consciousness by reading such authors as William Shakespeare, we will then turn to two historical moments that were central to the concept's development. First, we will train our attention on the interplay between philosophy and literature in the late seventeenth century, reading texts by René Descartes, John Milton, Thomas Traherne, and John Locke. Second, we will focus on how, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the psychology of William James contributed to the development of stream of consciousness techniques in the novels of Henry James and Virginia Woolf. In this course, we will stress the historical contingency of this concept-consciousness has a birthdate-in order to determine the nature of a consequence that follows from this fact: the extent to which current uses of this concept are still shaped and constrained by the historical circumstances that conditioned its appearance and development.

The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the unmediated or immediate? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of metapictures or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become mixed in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T.

Thinking with Race in Medieval England. 100 Units. ,"The medieval period is often thought of as the era just before the idea of race emerged - before the Atlantic slave trade, before European colonialism, before scientific racism. At the same time, the Middle Ages have been crucial to modern phenomena of racialized nationalism and ideologies of whiteness. In recent years, medievalists have studied and debated race's significance. Acknowledging the complex and urgent status of medieval race today, this course examines some of the stories, images, ideas, and institutions of medieval England. We will test how race helps us think about the articulation and operationalization of human difference between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, especially with respect to Jews, Saracens (a term created by Christians to refer to Arabs and Muslims of varying ethnicities), and the so called monstrous races who were thought to populate the far reaches of the world. We'll ask - How did geography, religion, and history come to be corporealized, or understood as legible on the body? How did the essentialization of differences between groups act to satisfy desires, or seemingly to solve intellectual and ideological difficulties? How does thinking with race in medieval England throw new light on race and racism today? Readings will be both in Middle English and modern English translation. No previous experience with medieval literature is expected. This is a 2018-19 College Signature Course.

1316,UniOfChicago,ENGL 15107. Some Versions of Apocalypse. 100 Units. ,"The end of the world is one of the most durable of mankind's obsessions, from prophetic texts of antiquity to today's fascination with zombie plagues, environmental disaster, and nuclear winter. In this course we will explore what is both fearful and alluring about catastrophe on an unimaginable scale, as we read and view some paradigmatic apocalyptic works across a wide historical range. The course will focus on close attention to the aesthetics of individual works, locating those works in their historical contexts, and the conceptual analysis of the texts' motivating concerns. We will especially attend to the relationship between aesthetic form and the political, economic, and subjective forms that mediate catastrophe--as well as the ways that the end of things asks us to think beyond mediation. Texts include the biblical Book of Revelation, William Langland's medieval allegory Piers Plowman, Daniel Defoe's early modern chronicle of the black death A Journal of the Plague Year, Cormac McCarthy's postapocalyptic novel The Road, and both the novel and film versions of World War Z.

The Declaration of Independence. 100 Units. ,"This course explores important intellectual, political, philosophical, legal, economic, social, and religious contexts for the Declaration of Independence. We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke's Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine's Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson's drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (1650-1830, 1830-1940) This is a 2018-19 College Signature Course.

1322,UniOfChicago,ENGL 18500. American Horrors. 100 Units. ,"This course is a survey of horror in American literature and film, with a special focus on the genre's relation to racial and sexual violence. How does horror reflect, contribute to, or intervene into structures of racism, sexism, xenophobia, and queerphobia? How do fictional texts represent or transform non-fictional horrors, from lynching to rape to police brutality? And what is the status of horror as an emotion that structures relations of power and privilege in the United States? Together, we will gain a historical perspective on the genre, for instance tracking the figure of the zombie from its birth in Haitian folklore as a projection of the horrors of slavery, through 20th century works like George Romero's film Night of the Living Dead, and into present day works including Colson Whitehead's novel Zone One. We will pay special attention to the present moment, interrogating a renaissance of horror tropes in, for instance, feminist fiction (Karen Russell and Carmen Maria Machado), television (American Horror Story and Stranger Things), and cinema (It and Get Out).

To get a handle on this vast topic, our archive will be wide-ranging, including legal statutes and court opinions on sexual harassment and pornography; fiction, poetry, and graphic novels that explore the limits of representing sexual trauma; activist discourses in pamphlets and editorials from Take Back the Night to #MeToo; and groundbreaking essays by feminist and queer theorists, especially from critical women of color. How does the meaning of sex and of power shift with different kinds of representation, theory, and activism?

The period of literary modernism stretching from the late-19th century to roughly the Second World War coincides with the high point of European imperial claims as well as the sedimentation of Jim Crow. We will trace the articulation of forms of belonging - and non-belonging - along the interrelated axes of space and race in modernist figures and writings ranging from Joseph Conrad, George Orwell, James Joyce, and Jean Rhys to Djuna Barnes, Aimé Césaire, Albert Camus, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Richard Wright.

Frazer's The Golden Bough, a foundational work in the anthropology of magic, religion, purity, pollution, sacrifice, fertility, and the death and reincarnation of gods. Reading Frazer's work alongside works by William Butler Yeats, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, H.D., Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Robert Graves, Sigmund Freud, and Jane Harrison, we will examine the widespread impact of Frazer's tome, its resonance in the tumultuous war years, and the ways in which it participated in the creation of pagan, heretical, outsider, country, rural, and ethnic values in modernist London. Inasmuch as Frazer's work possessed a literary life, we will examine how its anthropology possessed by literature lives on in the works of such anthropologists as Mary Douglas and Michael Taussig.

London from the Outside-In. 100 Units. ,"In discussing Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Edward Said writes of the Bertram estate's colonial holdings in Antigua, and the few references in the novel itself to these plantations, claiming that the novel demonstrates the avowedly complete subordination of colony to metropolis. In this course, we will explore and expand upon this idea, seeking to understand the ways in which London's cosmopolitan and prominent history depend upon England's imperial endeavors. This pursuit will also involve representations of the city from the outside,"" such as Samuel Selvon's The Lonely Londoners and Tayeb Salih'sSeason of Migration. Readings will be diverse in genre, style, and period, attempting to open as many related discourses as possible, as this course is aimed at developing an independent research project.

1331,UniOfChicago,ENGL 20562. Freedom and Fate in the Renaissance. 100 Units. ,"In this course, we will study theories of will and of action that held sway in the Renaissance. Is human choice governed by reason, or are our wills overruled by our own passions-or by divine grace? Can self-determination genuinely arise in political or physical systems determined by history? What does it mean to depict free choice? Questions like these shaped crucial Renaissance debates in parliaments and churches, in laboratories and in the arts. We'll examine them through both literary and philosophical texts by writers including William Shakespeare, John Donne, Thomas Hobbes, John Milton, Margaret Cavendish, and Isaac Newton.

Excrement and Ecstasy: The Devotional Body in Early Modern Literature. 100 Units. ,"This class asks why writers in the seventeenth century turn to bodily metaphor and erotic language to describe their interactions with the divine. We will investigate the materiality of the body in early modern poetry-where it is frequently depicted as in orgasmic frenzy, failing, and even producing excrement-and its involvement with religious devotional practice.

From massive medieval farts to modern perfumes, we will consider what a focus on scent can contribute to our understanding of literature. Drawing from fiction, poetry, objects, history, and science, this course integrates an interdisciplinary approach. Primary literary texts will likely include H.D., Huysmans, Baudelaire, Burney, Shakespeare, and Chaucer.

1334,UniOfChicago,ENGL 22150. Luxury and Global Modernism. 100 Units. ,"The desire for and consumption of luxury is central to the world-building enterprise of capitalist modernity as we understand it, from the elaboration of colonial trade routes to the emergence of the era-defining aesthetic mode known as glamor. As both the object of the primitivizing imaginary of colonial social science and the motor of excitement for the new in the modern Western city, luxury infused some of the complexities of global interconnectedness into the imagination and the arts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With readings across the literary, but also the material-cultural and social-scientific archives of Western and non-Western modernisms, this course asks how luxury might open new avenues for the study of modernism's inherently global character. Course texts will include literary works by Henry James, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy, and MP Shiel; social scientific works by Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille; visual works by Raghubir Singh, Coco Chanel, and Josephine Baker; theoretical readings from the fields of postcolonial, queer, and fashion studies.

How do we make sense of idiocy? How do we interpret and evaluate what an idiot's idiocy means? What other codes -- ethical, political, ideological, sexual, etc. -- come into play when we respond aesthetically to a story about an idiot? How, and to what degree, is it possible for us to identify with the experience of being stupid? What means do writers and filmmakers do to exploit the aesthetic possibilities of idiocy (that is, the pleasures that can be derived by representing or evoking idiocy in particular ways)?

In order to propose some answers, this comparative course traverses a wide range of cultural and historical contexts, moving chronologically through civil wars and revolutions in the United States, Russia, Spain, Ireland, Vietnam, Lebanon, and Syria. In doing so, we will query current debates around the relation between aesthetics and politics in critical theory, as well as pressing questions of human rights, citizenship, exile, refugee crisis, national sovereignty, and international humanitarianism. In addition to encountering artists and writers who work in a variety of different media (poetry, novels, visual art, film, etc.), we will read recent work by political theorists, philosophers, art historians, and literary critics. We will examine artists and writers such as Walt Whitman, El Lissitzky, Pablo Picasso, Etel Adnan, Lan Cao, Colm Toíbín, Claudia Rankine, Mounira Al Solh, and Ghayath Almadhoun, as well as the theoretical writings of Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, Susan Sontag, and Giorgio Agamben.

Using a constellation of literary, filmic and televisual, and other popular texts, we will consider how modes of psychological study, manipulation, and repair figure in the American popular imagination. Our eclectic archive will include pamphlets on psychological warfare, psychological thrillers, sitcoms, reality tv, studies on personality tests, and self-help tracts. Students will be encouraged to bring in their own examples as well.

This course corrects such misconceptions by exploring modern and contemporary literatures that have been written with, or in response to, such sign-systems as pictographs, hieroglyphs, totem poles, wampum, and khipu. Focusing especially on the sign-systems of the native Americas, this class gives students a basic introduction to the mechanics of these signs, in order to discuss how these mechanics might be at play in the works of such poets, writers, and artists as Anni Albers, Simon Ortiz, Gerald Vizenor, Louise Erdrich, John Borrows, Charles Olson, Bill Reid, Robert Bringhurst, Fred Wah, Clayton Eshleman, Cy Twombly, Joaquín Torres-Garcia, Cecilia Vicuña, and others. Key questions to be asked include: how are these signs an interface for contemporary histories of nation and capital? And: how do those material histories and their identifications in race, gender, kinship, and ecology change when cast in the mechanics, tropes, and figures of these signs?

At the same time, our readings will allow us to explore the ways in which the disgusting has historically been utilized as a way of producing socially critical literature, by representing that which a culture categorically attempts to marginalize, exclude, and expel. Readings will engage with the variety of aesthetic functions that the disgusting has been afforded throughout modern literary history, including the carnivalesque and grotesque in Rabelais and the bawdy and satirical in Swift; revolted Victorian realism and gruesome Zolaesque naturalism; and Sartre's existential nausea and Kafka's anxious repulsion; as well as Thomas Bernhard's experiments with contempt and William Burroughs' hallucinogenic inversions of pleasure and disgust.

It has shaped societies throughout time, and the degree to which it is perceived as a problem or an opportunity"" changes radically according to circumstances and ideologies. In this course, we will analyze the different ways in which migration has been perceived, understood, and experienced. We will focus on two intense episodes in the global history of migration: migration from early nineteenth-century Britain; and migration to late 20th and 21stcentury America. Our emphasis throughout will be on the ways in which migration is narrated: the stories that societies tell about the migration of themselves and others. We will cover a wide range of migration narratives, including those of creative writers and artists, and will consider them through the lenses of literary criticism, history, theory, and also artistic practice itself.

1354,UniOfChicago,ENGL 28650. Outsider Writing. 100 Units. ,"A kinship between poetry and mental illness is a commonplace in myth, received opinion, and literary history, whether formulated as divine inspiration or bipolar disorder. Similarly the pejorative ascription of insanity to poets has been a commonplace of literary review and criticism. 'My vocabulary did this to me' are the reputed dying words of the poet Jack Spicer who claimed to respond to dictation as though himself a radio tuning to messages. Language's dictation, however experienced, unites mental disorder and the literary arts - the pressure of language that might become unhinged. What of the reader? Aesthetic response also is both formally contained and threatens to become unhinged. This class will read 20th and 21st century works of Outsider poetry and fiction in English, and consider how best to respond.

Incarcerated Life. 100 Units. ,"The United States today is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, one in which millions of Americans are currently warehoused within, or have passed through, carceral institutions. Many scholars locate the emergence of this punitive turn in the 1970s, and with good reason: the landscape of penality and confinement looks much different in earlier historical periods. Turning to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this course will explore literary, philosophical, and pragmatic engagements with the prison across the British Empire and in the postcolonial United States. By tracing the particular fears and fantasies that grouped around institutions of confinement, we will explore the logic by which an institution once marginal to social life has become so central to society that incarceration is now a conventional form of life. This course will involve a robust research component, culminating in a final paper; while this course is rooted in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, students will be welcome to pursue research on contemporary regimes of incarceration. Our theoretical readings will include Michel Foucault, Angela Davis, and Ruth Wilson Gilmore. Our archive of literary, philosophical, and practical texts will include the Newgate Calendar, Cesare Beccaria, Oliver Goldsmith, John Gay, Jeremy Bentham, James Williams, Harriet Jacobs, and Austin Reed.

Using both classic and contemporary works, this course will highlight some of the fundamental and unavoidable philosophical questions presented by such environmental issues. Can a plausible philosophical account of justice for future generations be developed? What counts as the ethical treatment of non-human animals? What do the terms nature and wilderness"" mean, and can natural environments as such have moral and/or legal standing? What fundamental ethical and political perspectives inform such positions as ecofeminism, the Land Ethic, political ecology, ecojustice, and deep ecology? And does the environmental crisis confronting the world today demand new forms of ethical and political philosophizing and practice? Are we in the Anthropocene? Is adaptation the best strategy at this historical juncture?

1392,UniOfChicago,ENST 22506. The Natures of the Factory Farm. 100 Units. ,"This course looks at the culture, technology, politics, and ecology of industrial agriculture through the lens of the animal-based factory farm. Over the quarter we will trace key steps along the process of manufacturing industrialized animals from life to death in order to think about the factory farm's logic, value, and consequences for rural environments (primarily) within the United States. By emphasizing the historical and cultural conditions of possibility that enable the modern-day factory farm, this course illustrates how mass-producing life forms is more than just a matter of technology, profit-making, or necessity. Instead, we will see how legal definitions of the farm versus the factory, ideological notions of animal (and human) nature, labor law, animal confinement, and the corporate ownership of genetic breeds contribute to its growing ascendancy as a global norm of animal production. But the factory farm has also led to new ideals for rural life that go far beyond classic forms of American agrarianism. As such, we will look to a series of case studies that take up the ecological politics of heritage-breed animals, raw milk production, and recent (Europe-based) projects that try to redeem certain elements of industrial agriculture. Along the way, students will receive an introduction to the analysis of food chains, applied ethology, animal studies, agrarian studies, and rural environmental politics. Instructor(s): A.

Fruited Plains and Scarred Mountains: The Environmental History of Work in the United States. 100 Units. ,"Ask most people to name an ecosystem, and they'll probably talk about mountains, beaches, plains, or forests. But most of us spend nearly a third of our adult lives in another ecosystem we often don't think about: our workplace. In fact, one of the most common ways humans interact with the environment in our modern world is by working-from farming and mining to housekeeping and coding. This course will examine the environmental history of work in the United States from the colonial era to the present through lectures, discussion, and other forms of active learning. We will cover a range of topics including racialized and gendered labors, the work of empire, energy workplaces, industrialization, agriculture, the information revolution, and climate adaptation. By engaging this history, we will also consider broader interdisciplinary questions: how should environmental concerns shape labor policy and organizing? What workplace considerations must be incorporated into the development of climate adaptation strategies and just transition programs?

1400,UniOfChicago,ENST 23650. Revolutionizing Agriculture: Early Modern Technologies for the New Millennium. 100 Units. ,"Based on a wave of sustainable and organic farming technologies that have reinvented early modern growing practices, this course integrates USDA reports and modern field and lab studies into the historiography of The British Agricultural Revolution. Not all historical technologies were sustainable, and this course relies upon modern agronomy to evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of the farming improvements that defined the British Agricultural Revolution. We similarly explore primary historical sources and historiography to better understand the environmental limits of the technologies used by organic and sustainable farmers today. By bringing the science and history into discourse, we will take a critical look at the British Agricultural Revolution, which is thought to have facilitated the Industrial Revolution by accumulating capital for investment and by allowing England to feed a growing urban population and manufacturing sector without a significant increase in arable acres. We know that yields per acre per worker did increase, but this is the only aspect of the story that remains unquestioned. Some agricultural improvement technologies, like light plowing and enclosure, caused catastrophic environmental harms that ultimately lowered yields over time. Other technologies like The Norfolk Rotation may have had small and gradual impacts over time and cannot be easily correlated with increases in yields on a site-by-site basis in the historical literature or in modern field trials. Other early modern technologies have proven to be more beneficial than previously thought. How can a better understanding of this history inform farming practices today?

China's Eco-Environmental Challenges and Society's Responses. 100 Units. ,"In nearly four decades of reform and opening policies, China's economic achievements have come at a high cost for its ecological environment; air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, among other problems, are facts of life for most Chinese citizens. In addition, China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide and has recently acknowledged its contributions to global warming and the need for drastic mitigation of greenhouse gases. Facing these tremendous challenges, remarkable shifts in the way that Chinese society communicates and tackles these problems are occurring. This seminar will look, in particular, at relevant public debates, crucial policies, as well as popular initiatives and protest, to approach this wide topic. How is the relationship between humans/society and nature/environment conceptualized and communicated? Can we detect shifts from traditional to modern, even contemporary 'Chinese approaches'? And to what extent and how do political authorities, media, the general population and scientists in China interact in the face of the acknowledged risks that environmental pollution poses to communities, to China's (economic) development and, not least, to individual health and well-being. Basic knowledge about modern Chinese society and politics as well as Chinese reading skills are helpful, but not a strict requirement for participation in this course. Instructor(s): A.L.

It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses.

Cities long have been lauded as unique incubators of these social features. In contrast to the national level, the smaller scale and dense diversity of cities is thought to encourage the development of civic solutions that work for the many. But cities are inhabited by distinct groups of people with divergent interests and varied beliefs about how to address countless urban issues, such as creating jobs, delivering education, ensuring safe neighborhoods, promoting environmental sustainability, and taking care of the vulnerable. Many groups and organizations have an interest in the outcomes of these processes. Some take action to try to shape them to their own advantage, while others have few chances to make themselves heard.

Natural history was upended by the first European encounters with the New World. The encounter with these new lands exposed Europeans for the first time to unknown flora and fauna, which required acute empirical observation, collection, cataloguing, and circulation between periphery and metropole in order to understand their properties and determine their usefulness. As the Spanish, Portuguese, British, French, and Dutch competed with one another to establish overseas trade and military networks in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, they also competed over and shared information on natural resources. The course will combine lecture and discussion and mix primary source readings on natural history in the early modern world with modern historical writings.

1427,UniOfChicago,ENST 27201. Food Security and Agriculture: Calumet. 100 Units. ,"Do you know where your next meal will come from? Many people around the world, and even close to home, do not. The Food and Agricultural Organization explains that food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food security is thus a complex issue involving aspects of food production and distribution, poverty, buying power, and social networks, and cultural choice. In this course we use the Calumet region as a case study to examine some aspects of the food security debate, especially the basic conceptual divide between the framework of food security, as defined by international organizations above, and the more grass-roots notion of food sovereignty. Though we will aim for an overview of the issues, we focus this quarter more specifically on issues of agriculture and the food system, including urban agriculture, permaculture, and other challenges to the dominant industrial model. In a region with significant economic distress and area of food desert, the Calumet presents examples of both challenge and response to this critical topic. Instructor(s): K.

1491,UniOfChicago,GNSE 21001. Cultural Psychology. 100 Units. ,"There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of normal psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of culture and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

1494,UniOfChicago,GNSE 22905. Gendering Privacy. 100 Units. ,"Interest in privacy has surged in recent decades in light of the emergence of Big Data, the rise of increasingly sophisticated methods of surveillance, and the ubiquity of networked social media in everyday life. Yet privacy remains a notoriously slippery concept to pin down-across disciplines, privacy has been conceptualized variously as a legal right, a psychological state of being, a set of preferences, and a boundary-making process. In this course, we take a sociological approach to privacy, starting with the notion that privacy is at once a decidedly micro individual phenomenon and at the same time a product of macro social-structural forces. Thus, while privacy preferences can vary from person to person, the capacity to achieve privacy is shaped by social position (e.g., race, class, gender, etc.). In this course, we focus specifically on how women and men experience possibilities for privacy and how these experiences are shaped by their racial and class location. We will draw on a range of theoretical perspectives, including feminist theory, critical legal theory, and critical race theory to examine privacy through the lens of social inequality. Empirically, we will investigate how the twin systems of welfare and criminal justice present challenges to privacy for men and women living in poverty. The main questions guiding our inquiry include: Who gets to have privacy (and who doesn't), why, and at what costs? Instructor(s): C. Hughes Terms Offered: Winter "

We discuss the contrasting descriptions and conceptions of sexual behavior before and after the emergence of a science of sexuality.

1497,UniOfChicago,"GNSE 23603. Grace, Love, and Pleasure. Painting in Eighteenth Century France. 100 Units. ","The easing of political life and the relaxation of private morals which came to characterize the long reign of Louis XV (1715-1774) was mirrored by the development of a new conception of art, an art more intimate, decorative, generally amorous, and often erotic. It is these last two related dimensions which are the basis of a new visual aesthetic which constitutes the subject matter of this course. Through the exploration of contemporary novels and theater, as well as contemporary critical and philosophical writings, we will demonstrate how both the sensual and the erotic become essential components of the century's cultural ethos. Artistic subjects, the mechanisms to represent them, their metaphorical stakes, and their phenomenological effects on the beholder will therefore be considered as the expression of a particular historical and ideological context. It is in this context that love became the symbol of a king who privileged peace against war, and where emotional pleasure triumphed over moralizing values and asserted itself as a new aesthetic category.

1616,UniOfChicago,GRMN 22312. Reforming Religious Media: Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. 100 Units. ,"The Protestant Reformation began with a carefully orchestrated media event, when Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the door of a church in Wittenberg. Concurrently, he resorted to the still new medium of print to disseminate more widely his scathing critique of the Catholic Church's use of indulgences to communicate God's grace. This was only the beginning of Luther's sweeping attack on the Church's role as the sole mediator of salvation. No religious medium or communicational practice remained unquestioned, resulting in their comprehensive reform. Soon other reformers joined in, pushing the critique even further by questioning the need and validity of all religious mediation. Approaching the Protestant Reformation as a reform of religious media, this lecture course will give particular attention to the congenial alliance between Martin Luther's religious message and the emerging technology of the printing press, the role of Scripture in legitimating Protestant theologies of communication, controversies around particular religious media like images or the eucharist, and the role of direct inspiration in radical reformers. This course will be taught in lecture format. Instructor(s): Christopher Wild Terms Offered: Spring "

To what extent do individuals possess the right to move to other states? How do different states with large populations of refugees and asylum seekers develop and enforce migration policies, and what do the differences in these policies reveal about the social histories and futures of these states? To address these questions, we will consider how borders, institutions, and categories of migrant groups mutually shape one another. We will explore the interrelationships between categories of migration-forced, economic, regular, and irregular-in order to understand the multiple and unequal forms of mobility experienced by those who inhabit these categories. By utilizing a framework of human rights, this course will investigate how contemporary issues in migration-such as border management, illicit movement, and the fuzzy distinction between forced and economic migration-raise and reopen debates concerning the management of difference. We will draw on the work of anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers, as well as journalists, legal, and medical professionals. Our readings each week will include a mix of conceptual, ethnographic, long-form journalism, and policy texts.

1636,UniOfChicago,GLST 24110. In the Beginning: Origin Stories in Science and Religion. 100 Units. ,"What is the origin of the universe? What is the origin of humanity? These questions have generated a plethora of answers, many of which fall within domains of what we now consider to be science and religion. However, as we will see through our readings, these two categories are hard to define; classifications often overlap, and science and religion intertwine throughout history and until today. What do we call myth, and what do we term theory? In this class, we will focus on not only the cultural embeddedness of religious and scientific narratives, but also the cultural implications of these texts. The course begins with origin stories and asks students to consider their power in shaping our world and perspectives, focusing on the ethical dimensions and implications of these narratives. What kind of relationships do we imagine among human beings, and between human and nonhuman beings in this world, given particular origin stories as our starting point? Finally, in relation to this goal of interrogating the ethical import of origin narratives, this course will close by asking whether we can imagine other kinds of origin stories (such as in the genre of science fiction), and what implications these imaginal narratives hold.

Medical Knowledge in the Islamicate World. 100 Units. ,"Drawing on Marshall Hodgson's term 'Islamicate' this course follows medical knowledge as a cultural and political object as it travels through various iterations across and between dynastic and modern colonial imperial formations. For students of Islamic studies, the course suggests how medical knowledge can be a point of departure for illuminating intellectual, social and political history. For students of globalization, it situates that phenomenon's association with the space-time compressions of capitalism within a longer genealogy of migrations and knowledge exchanges. The course asks students to engage with several fundamental questions: Why was the medical knowledge produced in Greek antiquity absorbed and transformed by the Islamicate world? How did this medical knowledge change in translation between languages and across regionally specific cultural assemblages? How might close attention to the historically situated practices of medical knowledge production disrupt an essentialist understanding of 'Islamic culture'? Ultimately, the central aim of this course is to urge students to think more deeply about the methods and sources for understanding the entangled histories of the Islamicate world.

How far it travelled to make its way to your table? This class begins from the observation that the everyday act of eating is often a global practice in contemporary societies. From the international circulation of mega-brands like Coca-Cola, to the migrant labor that harvests much of America's fresh produce, food provides a vantage-point for examining global connections. These connections are often produced through food: such as eating foreign cuisines, or receiving the international distribution of humanitarian food aid. Taking food as its central object, this class examines issues of the 'global' related to labor, political economy, biotechnology, humanitarian aid, nutrition science, brands and marketing, as well as everyday consumption and meaning-making. We will ask questions about the global politics of food, such as: How are global conditions of food production structured and organized? How do people make sense of global commodities within their own social worlds, and how do they use them to imagine connections with distant others? How are scientific concepts of nutrition and obesity made to circulate globally, and what impact do these ideas have in the places where they are exported? How do people imagine culture in relation to food, and what meanings is food given in contexts of cosmopolitanism and diaspora? Instructor(s): Butler, Ella Terms Offered: Spring "

","This course aims to provide students an overview of key environmental and ecological issues in the Indian subcontinent. How have the unique precolonial, colonial, regional and national histories of this region shaped the peculiar nature of environmental issues? We will consider three major concepts-extinction, disaster and dystopia to see how they can be used to frame issues of environmental and ecological concern. Each concept will act as a framing device for issues such as conservation and preservation of wildlife, erasure of adivasi (first dwellers) ways of life, environmental justice, water scarcity and climate change. The course will aim to develop students' ability to assess the specificity of these concepts in different disciplines. For example: What methods and sources will an environmental historian use to write about wildlife? How does this differ from the approach an ecologist or literary writer might take? Students will analyze various media: both literary and visual, such as autobiographies of shikaris (hunters), graphic novels, photographs, documentary films, ethnographic accounts and environmental history.

The aim of this upper-level undergraduate seminar is to examine the history of borders, borderlands, and frontiers as political and social concepts and as produced spaces. We will examine an array of case studies in addition to more theoretical scholarship that spans the disciplines of history, environmental studies, political science, anthropology, and geography. While using South Asia (itself a rather recently invented area) as the primary geographic and historical focus this course will not be bound exclusively to it. The first goal of the course is to explore the evolution of key concepts such as space, territory, frontier, and borders/borderlands. The second goal is to develop methods for analyzing subjects that are simultaneously physical spaces and political, social, and historical ideas. Finally, it seeks to introduce students to areas that often fall beyond the penumbra of historical surveys centered on the nation-state. No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed.

1642,UniOfChicago,GLST 27703. Earthbound Metaphysics: Speculations on Earths and Heavens. 100 Units. ,"Social thought has recently reopened the subject matter of the world: what is it made of, how does it hold together, who and what inhabits it? Proposals and inquiries generated in response are as imaginative as they are self-consciously urgent: written on the crest of the global ecological disaster, from within the zones of disturbance or the sites of extreme intervention into the living matter and forms of life, contemplating the end of the world and possibilities of extinction, redemption, cohabitation, or collateral survival (Tsing 2015). All are variously political. Foregrounding the plurality of the material worlds and lived worldviews on the one hand, and of the shared historical predicament on the other, social thinkers question universal values and conceivable relations, and search for alternate forms of grasping, engaging, and representing the pluriverse. This course goes along with such interests in the worlds and collects a number of compelling, contemporary texts that are variously oriented towards cosmopolitics, minimalist metaphysics, new materialisms, speculative realisms, ecotheology, and multispecies coexistence. Readings will stretch out to examine some classic ethnographic texts and past theoretical excursions into the perennial problem of how to know and tell the unfamiliar, native, worlds, which are swept by, mingling with, or standing out in the more globalizing trends of capitalist, scientific, and secular materialism.

This course introduces answers to this question by previous scholars and challenges students to assess how these answers relate to their own education and intellectual interests at the University of Chicago. We will touch on major approaches and trends in the growing field of world history, including civilizational studies, the great divergence or rise of the West, world-systems theory, environmental history, big history, and the study of specific people, places, and objects in the context of world history. Students will leave with a solid grounding in one of the most vibrant and contentious fields of history today and a better understanding of the diversity of ways to situate historical narratives and current events into a global perspective.

1644,UniOfChicago,GLST 29525. The Global Life of Things. 100 Units. ,"What is a commodity? And can we read capitalism's global history through the commodity form? This course will investigate how historians and anthropologists have studied commodities and commodification to account for the environmental, social, and cultural developments of capitalism over the last four centuries. We will begin by considering canonical theoretical approaches, including Marx, Polanyi, and Appadurai. Readings will then be based around case studies of, among other things, land, cotton, and slavery; sugar, guano, and mushrooms. Readings will span from the early modern Atlantic World through to the nineteenth-century Pacific, the twentieth-century Middle East, and the United States and Japan in the present day. The course should appeal to students pursuing studies of the early modern Atlantic world, economic history, or environmental history. Instructor(s): O.

The third quarter of America in World Civilization focuses on multiple definitions of Americanism in a period characterized by empire, transnational formations, and America's role in the world. We explore the construction of social order in a multicultural society; culture in the shadow of war; the politics of race, ethnicity, and gender; the rise and fall of new social movements on the left and the right; the emergence of the carceral state and militarization of civil space; and the role of climate change and the apocalyptic in shaping imagined futures.

1684,UniOfChicago,HIST 13803. The Soviet Union. 100 Units. ,"This lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature. In the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation--from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab--will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; Stalinism, its origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.

Throughout its past, the United States has been defined by endless and unpredictable struggles to establish and extend self-government of one kind or another--even as those struggles have encountered great resistance and relied on the exclusion or subordination of some portion of society to underwrite expanding freedom and equality for those enjoying the fullest benefits of citizenship. American democracy has also relied on a conceptual separation between state and society that has necessarily broken down in practice, as political institutions produced and sustained economic forms like slavery or the corporation, social arrangements like the family, and cultural values such as freedom--even as private interests worked their reciprocal influence over public institutions. Over the course of the quarter we will explore this contested history of democracy in America through a close reading of classic texts (including Tocqueville's famous study), contextualized by the most current historical scholarship. Small, incremental writing assignments and individual presentations will culminate in a final essay that can emphasize philosophical/theoretical or historical/empirical questions according to students' interests. Students will also have the option of conducting their own original research to satisfy some portion of the course work, which may lead to subsequent internship opportunities with relevant faculty.

","This course both describes preindustrial economic life and weighs the models used to explain fundamental changes to it. We will begin by describing some of the basic structures that determined patterns of production, exchange, and consumption in a period of low and easily reversible growth. These include agricultural productivity, demographic constraints, modes of transportation, and the social structures that governed the distribution of what little surplus premodern societies produced. Turning to the sources of economic dynamism that may have contributed to later industrialization, we will first examine the growth of long-distance trade networks starting in the late fourteenth century. How were traditional economies characterized by limited movement stimulated by the circulation of people, goods, and money from afar? We will then move to a discussion of the factors leading to (or frustrating) transformational patterns of economic growth: agricultural productivity, institutions, proto-industrial production in an era of limited urban growth, and changing norms of consumption.

This course seeks to answer these questions by looking to the accounts of those who traveled both within and beyond Europe, in fact and in imagination, during the centuries preceding Columbus's voyage. Its argument will be that to understand what Columbus and his contemporaries found when they arrived in the new world, we must first understand what they thought they were looking for--and that what they were looking for is not necessarily what we might expect.

We will view these epochal changes through the prism of France's capital city. Paris shaped the revolution in many ways, but the revolution also reshaped Paris. The urbane city of European enlightenment acquired new identities as democratic hub from 1789 and as site of popular democracy after 1793-94.

1763,UniOfChicago,"HIST 28607. War, Diplomacy, and Empire in US History. 100 Units. ","World politics have profoundly shaped the United States from its colonial origins to the war on terror. Yet only recently have US historians made a sustained effort to relate the foreign relations of the country to its domestic history. For a century and a half prior to independence, empire, trade, great-power politics, and violent conflict with Native Americans formed the large structures of power and meaning within which colonists pursued their everyday lives. In violently repudiating the claims of the British Empire, the revolutionaries commenced a political tradition that sought to avoid the perils of great-power statecraft for roughly the next century and a half. Yet even as it lent a distinctive cast to US politics and society, this pursuit of exceptionalism had to reckon with the requirements of state power and geopolitics from the Civil War onward. With its sudden embrace of great-power politics and the rise to globalism from WWII onward the United States became increasingly like the European societies it had repudiated at the founding, even as its exceptional military and economic power set it apart as a unipolar power by the turn of the millennium. To understand these developments in depth students will write two modest-length deep-dive analytical essays and three brief reports on targeted expeditions into primary materials, while reading broadly across the historiography of the new diplomatic and international history.

1765,UniOfChicago,HIST 29324. Slavery and Capitalism. 100 Units. ,"The course examines how the interrelated transnational forces of slavery and capitalism shaped our modern world from the 1400s to the present. We will examine the history of this relationship and the living legacy of that history in the narratives of everyday people. Are recent frameworks theorizing a global hegemonic system of slavery and racial capitalism really our ultimate horizon? Are there any redemptive possibilities in older renderings committed to a more distinctive and disaggregated parsing of slavery and capitalism? Critical to approaching these questions are how people of African descent have themselves remembered slavery, experienced capitalism, and marshalled those memories in the service of emancipatory political movements. As such this course will focus on primary documents that give voice to enslaved peoples as well as secondary literature written by black historians attempting to shape international thought on this question. The ultimate aim is a wider understanding of the rise of Western modernity and how peoples of the African diaspora navigated and, at times, contested its consequences. Instructor(s): G.

A Transnational History of Reparative Justice. 100 Units. ,"In light of recent revelations tying the University of Chicago to slavery, this course will explore the long history of reparations as a global, national, and local set of questions. How does a given polity go about repairing the un-repairable and forgiving the unforgivable? Are the discursive norms of reparations irredeemably bound to our current conceptualizations of politics, governance, private-property rights, individualism, and the law or can reparations, and how we talk about them, serve as a means of reimagining these categories? How might the practice and performance of reparations actually be structured to foster both intra-group and inter-group unity while avoiding a potentially divisive backlash? Beginning with ancient forms of restorative justice and proceeding briskly into more recent attempts at truth and reconciliation, this course aims to take a transnational and comparative approach to exploring the history of reparations from an interdisciplinary perspective. The ultimate aim is a greater understanding of the possibilities of reparations as they relate to slavery, Jim Crow, and post-1968 discrimination against people of African descent in the United States, which constitutes the second half of this course.

The Politics of Memory in Modern France. 100 Units. ,"Most of a nation's past is forgotten, and even momentous, heroic, or villainous events fade from memory within a generation or two. Governments, organized groups, and individuals often do not agree about what should be remembered and what forgotten, nor is there consensus concerning appropriate forms of and audiences for commemoration. Does everyone see commemorations the same? How effective is naming of a street sign or a métro stop? Do people see statues or just walk past? Is it legitimate to shock with graphic representations of violence? What memorial work do histories, novels, poems, films, and museums do? We will analyze French, starting with the heart of state commemoration-the Pantheon-where those deemed of the highest national service are interred. Next, we focus on revolution, such as the Place de la Bastille column, the Mur des Fédérés, or the Sorbonne amphitheater, occupied in 1968. Regarding WW2, while the government and civil society accepted responsibility for the deportation and murder of some 76,000 Jews quite late. There are now, however, numerous monuments to their lives and deaths across Paris. Concerning France's imperial past, we will focus on debates over remembering metropolitan France's long and fraught relationship with North Africa and North Africans.

1801,UniOfChicago,HIPS 21407. The Vocation of a Scientist. 100 Units. ,"Max Weber wrote that to be a scientist one needed a strange intoxication with scientific work and a passionate devotion to research as a calling. And yet, such passion seemed to conflict with the ideal of value-neutral inquiry. This class considers the vocation of science since the turn of the twentieth century. What political, economic, and cultural forces have shaped scientific professions in the United States? How are scientists represented in public culture? How was American science experienced during the colonization of the Philippines? By exploring these questions, this class will examine the values and norms that make science into a meaningful vocation. Equivalent Course(s): ANTH 22129, KNOW 21407 "
1802,UniOfChicago,HIPS 21408. History of Medicine. 100 Units. ,"This course surveys the history of medicine from the medieval period to the present. How did medicine emerge as a defined body of knowledge? To what extent do diseases and disorders have an independent existence, and to what extent are they cultural constructs? How have social mores-particularly those related to religion, class, nationality, race, and gender-influenced the ways in which health was and is understood and maintained, and illness treated? What does it mean to practice medicine ethically, and how has that changed over time? Topics include the emergence and evolution of the medical profession, the history of medical research and method, the interpretation and treatment of the unhealthy and healthy alike, eugenics, euthanasia, the quest for immortality, and the changing relationship between technology and disease.

1803,UniOfChicago,HIPS 21409. History of Extraterrestrial Life. 100 Units. ,"In 2014, the Vatican Radio made a splash when it reported that the pontiff, Pope Francis, condoned the baptism of extraterrestrials-if they so desired it. Who are we to close doors? he asked rhetorically. It was both a metaphor for spiritual inclusion and an accurate representation of the modern Vatican's position on the possibilities of modern astrobiology and the search for extrasolar planets, fields whose rapid growth over the past two decades make serious consideration of extraterrestrial life seem like a uniquely modern phenomena. Its history, however, is in fact many centuries old. In this course we will examine the development of beliefs concerning life in the universe from the sixteenth century to the present. How did historical actors understand the nature, abilities, and location of extraterrestrial life, and its relationship to man and god? We will analyze connections between these beliefs and contemporary political, social, scientific, and religious developments. These include the role of the plurality of worlds in the debates over heliocentrism, its impact and application in the context of deism and social and political freethought, its literary and artistic depictions and use as a tool of satire and social commentary, its influence on natural philosophy, its decline and the subsequent rise of alien conspiracists and their critics, and how and why conceptions of the extraplanetary other took a dark and sinister turn toward the early-to-mid twentieth century.

1804,UniOfChicago,HIPS 21410. Politics of Technoscience in Africa. 100 Units. ,"Euro-American discourse has often portrayed Africa as either a place without science and technology or as the home of deep and ancient wisdom. European imperialists used the alleged absence of science and technology as a justification for colonialism while pharmaceutical companies sought out African knowledge about healing plants. In addition to their practical applications, science and technology carry significant symbolic weight in discussions about Africa. In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation? How have independent African governments dealt with the imperial legacies of science? From the interpretation of archaeological ruins to the design of new medical technologies, this class will examine science and technology as political practice in Africa.

We will critically examine how new modes of scientific inquiry brought Africans, Americans, and Europeans into contact and conflict. Along the way, we will ask how, why, and with consequences imperial science created new knowledge claims about human inequality, especially racial and sexual difference. We will draw primarily on British, Iberian, and French imperial agendas in order to track the experiences of men and women from all corners of the Atlantic world, including indigenous peoples, enslaved black Africans, free people of color, and white Europeans. Through a variety of primary and secondary sources, we will uncover European aspirations to curate, control, and exploit the natural world and the agency of subjugated peoples in responding to and resisting these designs. Topics covered include natural history collecting and classification; the invention of racial theory; slavery and maroons; women, gender, and reproduction; consumption; and violence, resistance, and revolution.

In our course, the terms sex, Enlightenment, and science will be problematized in their historic contexts using a variety of primary and secondary sources. Through these texts, as well as images and objects, we will see how emerging scientific theories about sex, sexuality, and gender contributed to new understandings of the human, especially female, body. We will also see how the liberating potential of Enlightenment thought gave way to sexual and racial theories that insisted on fundamental human difference. Topics to be covered include theories of generation, childbirth, homosexuality, monstrosities, race and procreation, and hermaphrodites and questions about the sex of the enlightened scientist and the gendering of scientific practices.

During the twentieth century, sociologists, historians, philosophers, and anthropologists raised original, interesting, and consequential questions about the sciences. Often their work drew on and responded to each other, and, taken together, their various approaches came to constitute a field, science studies. The course furnishes an initial guide to this field. Students will not only encounter some of its principal concepts, approaches and findings, but will also get a chance to apply science-studies perspectives themselves by performing a fieldwork project. Among the topics we may examine are: the sociology of scientific knowledge and its applications; actor-network theories of science; constructivism and the history of science; and efforts to apply science studies approaches beyond the sciences themselves.

Natural history was upended by the first European encounters with the New World. The encounter with these new lands exposed Europeans for the first time to unknown flora and fauna, which required acute empirical observation, collection, cataloguing, and circulation between periphery and metropole in order to understand their properties and determine their usefulness. As the Spanish, Portuguese, British, French, and Dutch competed with one another to establish overseas trade and military networks in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, they also competed over and shared information on natural resources.

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of science to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains.

We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, Ibn Khaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful and reverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in the historical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? How did the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge?

Drawing on a number of classic and contemporary texts, we will consider both the specificity of local medical cultures and the processes which increasingly link these systems of knowledge and practice. We will study the social and political economic shaping of illness and suffering and will examine medical and healing systems-including biomedicine-as social institutions and as sources of epistemological authority. Topics covered will include the problem of belief; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; the placebo effect and contextual healing; theories of embodiment; medicalization; structural violence; modernity and the distribution of risk; the meanings and effects of new medical technologies; and global health.

","While mental illness has recently been framed in largely neurobiological terms as brain disease, there has also been an increasing awareness of the contingency of psychiatric diagnoses. In this course, we will draw upon readings from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies to examine this paradox and to examine mental health and illness as a set of subjective experiences, social processes, and objects of knowledge and intervention. On a conceptual level, the course invites students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Questions explored include: Does mental illness vary across social and cultural settings? How are experiences of people suffering from mental illness shaped by psychiatry's knowledge of their afflictions? Instructor(s): E.

1839,UniOfChicago,HIPS 29629. Tutorial: Romantic Bodies: Theater in the History of Science and Medicine. 100 Units. ,"It seems that science and theater have longed shared an ambiguous treatment as amoral yet bordering the ethically suspect. Scientific, medical, and technological advancements alter our everyday lives in profound ways and theater can play with the development and repercussions of these advancements, altering our memories of history. This stimulates a line of questioning for historians who view science plays, or plays that use science as the basis of their content and often also their form. In this tutorial, we will explore how these plays can (or cannot) fit into intellectual history as well as social and cultural histories of science. We will investigate how these plays can act as vehicles for remembering (or reconstructing) histories of science, reminding ourselves that the moral quandaries and ethical dilemmas that we juggle in science and medicine are as recurring as the theatrical productions are.

Their own contested histories have been taught and critiqued as a matter of course in the majority of sociology and anthropology departments in the US and Europe since their inception--hardly a surprise, given how dense, kaleidoscopic, and political they are. Meanwhile, the philosophy of social science has been gaining popularity in philosophy departments, apparently independently of the centuries-old reflection on social scientific methodologies that can be found within sociological and anthropological texts2. In true interdisciplinary fashion, this course seeks to marry these areas of scholarship, bringing together readings in philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and classical social theory, under the common themes that unite (and divide) them. We will cover debates on the epistemological priority of the individual or of society, the priority of naturalist or humanist perspectives, and the generalisability or spatio-temporal specificity of social scientific explanations.

From Roman generals to Arabic mathematicians to the Zimmerman telegram, cryptography has long been important to military and diplomatic history, while technological developments in the last forty years have brought cryptography to the masses, securing bank transactions, text messages, and countless other data on the Internet. This course will survey the long history of cryptology from the ancient world to today, with a focus on its uses in society. We will discuss, among other things, changing ideas of secrecy, privacy, and freedom of speech; the relationship between the state and science; and how technological developments influence and are influenced by cultural context.

I'm interested in understanding a way of writing about scientists that is not readily available to historians of science, a more expressive, more intuited way of writing that we can find in some poets and novelists: Osip Mandelstam writing of the way Lamarck wept his eyes out over his magnifying glass; Arthur Koestler of how Kepler laid a monstrous egg with his elliptical orbit. I am interested in the particular license taken in these instances-that flash of soul; I think the same license is taken to great effect in, for instance, the historical fiction of Hilary Mantel, and I want to see what we can win by it if we permit ourselves to tolerate it in real histories, and particularly in histories of science.

Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units. ,"The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious, political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of texts continues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course, we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualize their ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt. Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient Near East. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along with representative selections from secondary literature. We will also spend some time thinking about the nature of biblical interpretation. Instructor(s): J.

1901,UniOfChicago,JWSC 24105. Letters to Zion. 100 Units. ,"This seminar centers the question: what do we mean when we describe Jewish authors and thinkers from the past as Zionist, anti-Zionist, or non-Zionist? We will approach this question by reading three correspondences: Kafka's letters to Felice Bauer, and the correspondences between Gershom Scholem and Hannah Arendt and between Paul Celan and Ilana Shmueli. In each case, the question of Zionism and of Israel looms in the background of the exchange in some way. Our key question is: can we definitively determine the position of each of these letter-writers on the question of Zionism? And do we want to? Or does the form of the correspondence rather open a possibility for a more flexible, complex account of their positions, allowing us to think of them as changing and evolving, indeed as dialogic? In addition to the letters themselves, we will read other texts by these authors and about them, as well as background reading on the letter as genre and as historical document. We will also take note of the fact that these are all exchanges that cross the gender divide and ask how the question of Zionist ideology intersects with issues of gender in Jewish history.

Hence, the secular son's rebellion against his orthodox father is understood as the thrust that triggered the modern Jewish revolution. Alan Mintz aptly described the inter-generational rift between fathers and sons at the turn of the 20th century as a tragic yet inevitable consequence of modernity, underscoring the psychological difficulties and political dilemmas that haunted the sons who were banished form their father's table. This seminar will focus on the (highly androcentric) oedipal figure in literary theory and explore its prominence in modern Hebrew literature. Freud's preoccupation with the Oedipus complex at the turn of the century coincided with the emergence of a powerful oedipal narrative in modern Hebrew culture. This confluence provides a fascinating backdrop to the invention"" of the Oedipus complex. We will read a variety of literary texts which rework the oedipal figure from the late 19th century to the 1980s and beyond.

1913,UniOfChicago,JWSC 29550. Cinema and the Holocaust. 100 Units. ,"Focuses on cinematic responses by several leading film directors from East  Central Europe to a central event of 20th century history -- the Holocaust. Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioning cameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandistic schemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocide produced after the actual traumatic events. This class aims at discussing the challenge of representing the Jewish genocide which has often been defined as un-representable. Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raise questions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production  a search for relevant artistic means with which to engage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation of death  suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization; intertwined notions of chance  hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims. The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the course simultaneously explores extensive  continuous cinematic production of the genre  its historical development in various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary,  Czechoslovakia during the Cold War.

Science in the South: Decolonizing the Study of Knowledge in Latin America  the Caribbean. 100 Units. ,"This seminar will bridge anthropologies and histories of science, technology, and medicine to Latin American decolonial thought. Throughout Latin America, techno-scientific objects and practices, with their presumed origin in the Euro-Atlantic North, are often complexly entangled with neo-imperial projects of development and modernization that elongate social forms of colonization into the present. Technoscience and its objects, however, can also generate new creative, political, and life-enhancing potentials beyond or despite their colonial resonances, or even provide tools to ongoing struggles for decolonization. Together, seminar participants will explore what a decolonial approach to the study of science, technology, and medicine in the Global South, particularly in Latin America, has been and could become and how decolonial theory can inflect our own disciplinary, conceptual, and political commitments as anthropologists of technoscience.

Special emphasis will be placed on the emergency of social movements and collective agencies that have shaped the present racial order in the region. This course will first present how racialization processes intermingled with the formation of mestizo nation-states in Latin America, and, by doing so, establishing racial democracy as the corner stone of modern democracies (1920s to 1960s). Second, examine how authoritarian regimes promoted economic development but were incapable of curtailing social inequalities in the region, eventually dismantling the international perception of these countries as racial democracies (1960s to 1980s). And, finally, explore how processes of racial formation operated in the whole region, giving way to the formation of multiracial nations and to the visibility of racism as a structural component of these societies (1990s to 2010s).

1931,UniOfChicago,"LACS 25120. Territorial Identities, State Formation, and the Experience of Modernity in the Modern World. 100 Units. ","During the last twenty years, scholars interested in the history of the crisis of the Spanish Monarchy focused on the development of the idea of nation and nationhood in the Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic. Criticizing the idea of the birth of post-colonial Latin American republics as the triumph of a national sentiment, historians reconceptualized the nation as a result of the imperial crisis. However, considerably less attention has been paid to the parallel process of state building in the Iberian World. This course will offer an introductory overview of the process that led from imperial monarchy to national republics from the point of view of statehood formation. It will focus on the complexity of the process of emancipation as a transition from monarchical tutorship to the birth of modern Administración, while also addressing territorial identities as forms of non-national self-recognition that transited from colonial monarchy to post-colonial state.

While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current neoextractivisms have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells, open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformations to local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present. Yet parallel to neo-extractive regimes, emergent Latin American social movements have unleashed impassioned and often unexpected forms of local and transnational resistance. Readings in the course will contrast cross-regional trends of extractive economic development and governance with fine-grained accounts of how individuals, families, and communities experience and respond to land dispossession, local and transregional conflict, and the ecological and health impacts of Latin American extractivisms.

1979,UniOfChicago,LING 20001. Introduction to Linguistics. 100 Units. ,"This course offers a brief survey of how linguists analyze the structure and the use of language. Looking at the structure of language means understanding what phonemes, words, and sentences are, and how each language establishes principles for the combinations of these things and for their use; looking at the use of language means understanding the ways in which individuals and groups use language to declare their social identities and the ways in which languages can change over time. The overarching theme is understanding what varieties of language structure and use are found across the world's languages and cultures, and what limitations on this variety exist.

Language and Communication. 100 Units. ,"This course can also be taken by students who are not majoring in Linguistics but are interested in learning something about the uniqueness of human language, spoken or signed. It covers a selection from the following topics: What is the position of spoken language in the usually multimodal forms of communication among humans? In what ways does spoken language differ from signed language? What features make spoken and signed language linguistic? What features distinguish linguistic means of communication from animal communication? How do humans communicate with animals? From an evolutionary point of view, how can we account for the fact that spoken language is the dominant mode of communication in all human communities around the world? Why cannot animals really communicate linguistically? What do the terms language acquisition and transmission really mean? What factors account for differences between language acquisition by children and by adults? Are children really perfect language learners? What factors bring about language evolution, including language speciation and the emergence of new language varieties? How did language evolve in mankind?

Did it start late or early and then proceed in a protracted way? Was the emergence monogenetic or polygenetic? What were the ecological prerequisites for the evolution, with the direct ecology situated in the hominine species itself, and when did the prerequisites obtain? Did there ever emerge a language organ or is this a post-facto construct that can be interpreted as a consequence of the emergence of language itself? What function did language evolve to serve, to enhance thought processes or to facilitate rich communication?

1990,UniOfChicago,LING 23450. Language and Violence. 100 Units. ,"Language is generally associated with the abstract realm of thought, representation and expression, a realm that contrasts sharply with the material realm in which we tend to place violence. Language is furthermore often seen as antithetical to violence: violence is outburst that comes when the rational order of language fails. In fact, however, questions of language, and especially of speech, surface in every aspect of thinking about violence. Speech is a medium within which violence is performed, and is part of the modern machinery of war. It is also a medium through which systems of oppression and subordination are articulated and registered by groups and individuals, socially and psychically. Violence relies on speech for its justification, rationalization, and sustention. At the same time, the rawness of violence challenges our fundamental faith in the representational and expressive capacities of language, in both destructive and creative ways. This intensive reading seminar explores the relation between speech and violence through scholarly and literary texts from a variety of humanistic fields and traditions.

Truth. 100 Units. ,"One of the salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit, says the Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurt in his 1986 essay, 'On Bullshit.' Frankfurt distinguishes bullshit from lying, and argues that it is the more insidious of the two because it involves not an attempt to conceal the truth, but rather a failure to even care about the truth in the first place. But what exactly is truth, and why should we care so much about it? This course will begin with an examination of the fundamental role of a truth convention in meaning and communication, the way that such a convention makes bullshit possible, and the causes and consequences of bullshit. We will then turn to foundational questions about the nature of truth, criticisms of the value of truth and why they have had such appeal, and expressions of skepticism about the possibility of objective truth. Along the way, we will consider whether it makes sense for everyone to agree that something is the case and yet still be wrong; whether our claims to know certain things are always limited because they come from a particular perspective; paradoxes of truth and falsity and their relevance for scientific inquiry; and what value (if any) truth contributes to the well-lived life.

All courses in the sequence require experience with a theoretical treatment of the real numbers, and hence MATH 20300 has a prerequisite of either MATH 16300 or MATH 15910. Additionally, MATH 20400 requires a serious treatment of linear algebra, and thus has a prerequisite of either MATH 20250 or STAT 24300. MATH 20300 covers the construction of the real numbers, the topology of R^n including the Bolzano-Weierstrass and Heine-Borel theorems, and a detailed treatment of abstract metric spaces, including convergence and completeness, compact sets, continuous mappings, and more. MATH 20400 covers differentiation in R^n including partial derivatives, gradients, the total derivative, the Chain Rule, optimization problems, vector-valued functions, and the Inverse and Implicit Function Theorems. MATH 20500 covers integration in R^n including Fubini's Theorem and iterated integration, line and surface integrals, differential forms, and the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. This sequence is the basis for all advanced courses in analysis and topology. "

In the 16th century truth appears to harden through advances in science, mathematics, and art. But simultaneously religious schisms, the discovery of the New World, and political anarchy shake the notion of the world's stable limits to the core. The 17th century is known for Descartes' rationalism and classical regularity. But even here there is the unexpected, the surprising je ne sais quoi and overwhelming ineffable.

On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato's Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino's text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione's The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo's Dialogues on Love, Tullia d'Aragona's On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo's canzoniere, Maurice Scève's Délie, and Fray Luis de León's Poesía.

Babylon and the Origins of Knowledge. 100 Units. ,"In 1946 the famed economist John Maynard Keynes declared that Isaac Newton was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians. We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, Ibn Khaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful and reverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in the historical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? How did the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge? And is it reasonable to draw, as Keynes did, a line that begins with Babylon and ends with Newton? In this course we will take a cross comparative approach, investigating the history of the ancient city and its continuity in the scientific imagination. Instructor(s): E.

Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units. ,"The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious, political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of texts continues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course, we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualize their ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt. Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient Near East.

What does a scandal tell us about the public that consumes and disseminates it? In this course, we tackle these questions through an investigation of some the major scandals of the early modern and modern periods in both Europe and the Middle East. From courtroom dramas in Paris and London to fierce debates in coffee houses and newspapers in Cairo, Beirut, and Istanbul, this course offers a comparative view of how scandals were disseminated, received, and narrativized across time and space. In doing so, we will also examine the central role of the public both as a concept and as an actor in early modern and modern scandals. The course will also introduce students to a wide variety of primary sources as well as a rich literature on the subject. All readings are in English. No prior background on the subject is required.

2382,UniOfChicago,NEHC 20802. Empires and Peoples: Ethnicity in Late Antiquity. 100 Units. ,"Late antiquity witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of peoples in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Vandals, Arabs, Goths, Huns, Franks, and Iranians, among numerous others, took shape as political communities within the Roman and Iranian empires or along their peripheries. Recent scholarship has undone the traditional image of these groups as previously undocumented communities of barbarians entering history. Ethnic communities emerge from the literature as political constructions dependent on the very malleability of identities, on specific acts of textual and artistic production, on particular religious traditions, and, not least, on the imperial or postimperial regimes sustaining their claims to sovereignty. The colloquium will debate the origin, nature, and roles of ethno-political identities and communities comparatively across West Asia, from the Western Mediterranean to the Eurasian steppes, on the basis of recent contributions. As a historiographical colloquium, the course will address the contemporary cultural and political concerns-especially nationalism-that have often shaped historical accounts of ethnogenesis in the period as well as bio-historical approaches-such as genetic history-that sometimes sit uneasily with the recent advances of historians.

We will finally examine the distinction between Pan-Arab nationalism (qawmiyya), which considered Arab culture, history, and language as markers of one's national identity, and often strove for political unity with other Arab states; and territorial-patriotic nationalism (wataniyya), which hailed the national cultures of particular Arab states (Egyptian, Iraqi, Lebanese), focusing on their geography, archaeology, and history the key features of national identity.

2551,UniOfChicago,PLSC 20280. The Politics of Popular Sovereignty: Participation and Protest. 100 Units. ,"If government is of, by and for the people, what kinds of politics are possible? Certainly, politics will operate through established institutions such as elections and legislatures. But popular politics may also take other forms: petitions, social movements, protest in the streets, and cultural critique. These efforts often fail, sometimes dramatically, but they have also contributed to major social change including the abolition of slavery, the expansion of rights, and demands for new understandings of justice. This course will explore the history of popular politics within democratizing societies, the development of new forms of collective mobilization and technologies of political influence, and the changing relation of popular politics to formal political institutions.

2552,UniOfChicago,PLSC 21390. Philosophy of Poverty. 100 Units. ,"Global poverty is a human tragedy on a massive scale, and it poses one of the most daunting challenges to achieving a just global order. In recent decades, a significant number of philosophers have addressed this issue in new and profoundly important ways, overcoming the disciplinary limitations of narrowly economic or public policy oriented approaches. Recent theories of justice have provided both crucial conceptual clarifications of the very notion of 'poverty'-including new measures that are more informed by the voices of the global poor and better able to cover the full impact of poverty on human capabilities and welfare-and vital new theoretical frameworks for considering freedom from poverty as a basic human right and/or a demand of justice, both nationally and internationally. Moreover, these philosophers have pointed to concrete, practical steps, at both the level of institutional design and the level of individual ethical/political action, for effectively combating poverty and moving the world closer to justice. The readings covered in this course, from such philosophers as Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, David Graeber, and Martha Nussbaum, will reveal, not only the injustice of global poverty, but also what is to be done about it.

2554,UniOfChicago,"PLSC 21505. Sex, Gender and War. 100 Units. ","This course explores the sexed, gendered, and oftentimes racialized dimensions of war. With the rise of civil wars and the decrease of interstate or world wars, the nature of warfare has changed: wars are no longer being fought in battlefields, but neighborhoods; and combatants and civilians are no longer distinguishable. Additionally, over the last century, women's formal participation in armed groups and militaries has increased, challenging the traditional segregation of men and women into different roles during war. As such, this undergraduate seminar explores various dimensions of contemporary war, in order to understand how war is not only made possible, but is perpetuated and reinforced by sexed, gendered, and racialized inequalities. It draws from literature in armed conflict studies and gender studies, as well as from contemporary representations of gender and war in films and novels. The goals of the course are two-fold: to engage with the five themes of the course in order to understand, analyze, and interrogate the sexed, gendered, and racialized dimensions of war, and to develop critical writing skills for the social sciences.

It explores urgent ethical questions in international affairs, with a particular focus on global poverty, global inequality and the ethics of immigration. Addressed questions will include the following: what does justice require at the global level? Does the very idea of global justice make sense? Are economic inequalities between countries morally objectionable and, if so, why? What do affluent countries (and their citizens) owe to less affluent countries (and their citizens)? Should states have a right to control their territorial borders? To what extent do they have a right to exclude immigrants? What are the obligations of states towards newly arrived immigrants? We will address these normative questions by reading and critically assessing important texts written by leading scholars within the field of political theory and applied ethics, including John Rawls, Charles Beitz, Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, Joseph Carens and many others.

This analysis is rooted in a discussion of contemporary issues, including the election of the first African American president, Barack Obama, the emergence of the Movement for Black Lives, the exponential incarceration of black people, and the intersection of identities and the role black feminism in shaping the radical freedom tradition in black politics. Throughout the course we attempt to situate the politics of African Americans into the larger design we call American politics. Is there such a thing as black politics? If there is, what does it tell us more generally about American politics? Instructor(s): C. Cohen Terms Offered: Winter Equivalent Course(s): CRES 22150, LLSO 25902 "

Using both classic and contemporary works, this course will highlight some of the fundamental and unavoidable philosophical questions presented by such environmental issues. Can a plausible philosophical account of justice for future generations be developed? What counts as the ethical treatment of non-human animals? What do the terms nature and wilderness"" mean, and can natural environments as such have moral and/or legal standing? What fundamental ethical and political perspectives inform such positions as ecofeminism, the Land Ethic, political ecology, ecojustice, and deep ecology? And does the environmental crisis confronting the world today demand new forms of ethical and political philosophizing and practice? Are we in the Anthropocene? Is adaptation the best strategy at this historical juncture? Field trips, guest speakers, and special projects will help us philosophize about the fate of the earth by connecting the local and the global. (A) Instructor(s): B.

Is happiness the ultimate good for human beings, the essence of the good life, or is morality somehow prior to it? Can it be achieved by all, or only by a fortunate few? These are some of the questions that this course engages, with the help of both classic and contemporary texts from philosophy, literature, and the social sciences.

Are they what they should be, for purposes of cultivating flourishing citizens of a liberal democracy? What are the biggest challenges-philosophical, political, cultural, and ethical-confronting educators today, in the U.S. and across the globe? How can philosophy help address these? In dealing with such questions, this course will provide an introductory overview of both the philosophy of education and various educational programs in philosophy, critically surveying a few of the leading ways in which philosophers past and present have framed the aims of education and the educational significance of philosophy. From Plato to the present, philosophers have contributed to articulating the aims of education and developing curricula to be used in various educational contexts, for diverse groups and educational levels. This course will draw on both classic and contemporary works, but considerable attention will be devoted to the work and legacy of philosopher/educator John Dewey, a founding figure at the University of Chicago and a crucial resource for educators concerned with cultivating critical thinking, creativity, character, and ethical reflection. The course will also feature field trips, distinguished guest speakers, and opportunities for experiential learning. (A) (B) Equivalent Course(s): PHIL 22819, MAPH 32819, CHDV 22819 "
2563,UniOfChicago,PLSC 22913. The Practice of Social Science Research. 100 Units. ,"This is a first course in empirical research as it is practiced across a broad range of the social sciences, including political science. It is meant to enable critical evaluation of statements of fact and cause in discussions of the polity, economy, and society. One aim is to improve students' ability to produce original research, perhaps in course papers or a senior thesis. A second objective is to improve students' ability to evaluate claims made by others in scholarship, commentary, or public discourse. The specific research tools that the course develops are statistical, but the approach is more general. It will be useful as a guide to critical thinking whether the research to be evaluated, or to be done, is quantitative or not. Above all, the course seeks to demonstrate the use of empirical research in the service of an argument. Instructor(s): P. Conley Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,Winter "

We concentrate, though not exclusively, on the United States. We look at which populations have the most access to technology-based information sources (the digital divide), and how individual and group identities are being forged online. We ask how is the responsiveness of government being affected, and how representative is the online community. Severe conflict over the tension between national security and individual privacy rights in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Ireland will be explored as well. We analyze both modern works (such as those by Turkle and Gilder) and the work of modern democratic theorists (such as Habermas). Instructor(s): M.

Black Feminism in a Transnational Perspective. 100 Units. ,"This course surveys Black women's experiences living with and confronting state oppression around the across the Americas and the Caribbean. From the United States to Brazil, Black women experience similar patterns of political, social and economic inequality. Transnationally, racism, sexism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia, misogynoir, and classism affect the quality of life of Black women, particularly within nation-states with legacies of slavery and colonialism. This course takes a historical, social and theoretical look at the roots of this inequality and how Black women have chosen to respond to it locally and globally.

This course will investigate a series of questions prompted by this supposed relationship between democracy and equality. Is democracy an important part of a just society? What institutions and practices does democracy require? Is equality a meaningful or important political ideal? If so, what kind of equality? Does democracy require some kind of equality, or vice-versa? The course will begin by studying classical arguments for democracy by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Stuart Mill, and then focus on contemporary approaches to these questions. The course will conclude with some treatment of current democratic controversies, potentially including issues of race and representation; the fair design of elections; the role of wealth in political processes; and the role of judicial review. The course aims to deepen participants' understanding of these and related issues, and to develop our abilities to engage in argument about moral and political life.

2569,UniOfChicago,PLSC 24201. Liberalism. 100 Units. ,"The post-war consensus on liberal democratic government can today seem under siege in Europe and the United States. Has liberalism run its course, its once revolutionary promise now dimmed by rising inequality, populist ideology, and perceived threats to national cultures? What newer, more persuasive liberalism might replace the managerial, economistic, instrumental model that we've inherited? This seminar explores a variety of answers to that question, arguing that the canonical replies may be stranger, the forgotten alternatives more compelling, and liberal thought far more variegated than liberalism's critics or defenders have recognized. Our eclectic respondents include F.A. Hayek, Judith Shklar, Bernard Williams, Susan Okin, Richard Rorty, and Nancy Rosenblum. We will also explore some surprisingly topical interventions by John Locke, Voltaire, Diderot, Condorcet, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Dewey, and José Ortega y Gasset.

Empire and International Justice. 100 Units. ,"How did European thinkers from 1492 onward understand and evaluate the extraordinary developments by which some European countries came to rule over much of the non-European world? This seminar examines theories of international justice and global relations from the early sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Philosophers, theologians, and political actors in this period responded to the key issues of global politics in the modern age, including the seizure of non-European lands; the establishment of slavery and the slave trade; the religious and cultural conversion of colonized peoples; the emerging institutions and practices of global commerce; and the impact of these developments upon both European and non-European societies. Indeed, many dilemmas that confront citizens and states today about humanitarian intervention, national sovereignty, conquest and occupation, empire, and human rights in a global context have an intriguing and complex intellectual history. The readings are primary texts by influential thinkers from the period of the initial Spanish conquests of the Americas through the mid-nineteenth century, including Montesquieu, Diderot, Burke, Bentham, Adam Smith, Cugoano, Kant, Herder, Constant, Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx.

2577,UniOfChicago,PLSC 25501. Race and Imperialism in the 20th Century. 100 Units. ,"The turn of the 20th C. marked the legal sanctioning of Jim Crow segregation in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision while the Scramble for Africa only a decade earlier had inaugurated a new era of imperial expansion. For W.E.B. Du Bois and others, these confluences indicated a singularity about the global experience of race in the 20th C. Focusing on the period prior to WWII, this course is an effort at understanding this specificity through an engagement with the politicians, statesmen, activists, and intellectuals writing in the midst of the problem of the color line. The course exposes students to thinkers on both sides of the color line as we read Sir Frederick Lugard, the colonial administrator of Nigeria and a member of the League of Nations' Permanent Mandates Commission, alongside George Padmore, the anticolonialist of Trinidadian descent who played a central role in Ghana's independence movement. To further our insights, we engage recent commentary by scholars who have sought to understand the racial formations of the 20th C. The course aims are 1) to trace the processes-ideological, political, and economic-through which the Jim Crow color line became international and consider the reverberations of this internationalism, 2) to reexamine the crisis of WWI and the creation of the League of Nations in light of the problem of the color line, and 3) to trace the intellectual roots of a global anticolonial movement concerned with securing racial equality.

But the Roman philosophers give us much more, and we will study closely a group of key texts from Cicero and Seneca, including Cicero's De Finibus book III, his Tusculan Disputations book IV, a group of Seneca's letters, and, finally, a short extract from Cicero's De Officiis, to get a sense of Stoic political thought. For fun we will also read a few letters of Cicero's where he makes it clear that he is unable to follow the Stoics in the crises of his own life. We will try to understand why Stoicism had such deep and wide influence at Rome, influencing statesmen, poets, and many others, and becoming so to speak the religion of the Roman world.

A Right to Belong. 100 Units. ,"In this course we will seek to identify commonalities and disparities in the formal and informal ways in which we belong to political societies today, seeking to articulate how the formal and informal structures of inclusion mimic or contradict one another. Doing so should provide analytical opportunities to recognize the virtues and shortcomings of the institutional tools designed to guarantee the many pieces necessary to make belonging possible. Part of what this course seeks to accomplish is to support students in thinking about the commonalities between the many ways in which we belong, while avoiding the temptation of silver bullets and all-encompassing explanations. The end-goal is a more refined and informed approach to the topic, as well as the ability to articulate a cogent response to whether belonging should be understood as a human right or not. If belonging ought to be considered a human right, what kind of policies and international instruments are better suited to guarantee it?

To what extent are justice and legitimacy separate ideas? Does legitimacy require justice? Are just states necessarily legitimate? We will critically analyze and normatively assess how different contemporary theories have answered, whether explicitly or implicitly, such questions. The course will focus on five major contemporary theories: liberal-egalitarianism as represented by the work of John Rawls; libertarianism, as represented by the work of Robert Nozick, neo-Lockean theories as represented by the work of John Simmons, neo-republicanism as represented by the work of Philip Pettit, and neo-Kantian theories as represented by the work of Arthur Ripstein.

This course will evaluate these procedures mathematically, by considering the various properties that electoral systems may or may not satisfy. A classic example is Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which tells us that every electoral system must fail to satisfy one or more criteria of fairness or sensibility. We will examine this result and other legislative paradoxes, and learn why the choice of procedure is critical to our understanding of how good and bad decisions can be made-and how we can distinguish a bad decision from a good one.

Why do political parties organize themselves politically around ethnicity, language, religion, or ideology? This course explores these and other similar questions that lie at the core of comparative politics. Drawing on political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology, while utilizing a wealth of data and case studies of major countries, we will examine how power is exercised to shape and control political, cultural, and economic institutions and, in turn, how these institutions generate policies that affect what we learn, what we earn, how long we live, and even who we are.

2622,UniOfChicago,PSYC 23000. Cultural Psychology. 100 Units. ,"There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of normal psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of culture and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

2627,UniOfChicago,PSYC 24055. The Psychological Foundations of Wisdom. 100 Units. ,"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It's often used with a meaning more akin to smart or clever. Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom-how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

2632,UniOfChicago,PSYC 25120. Child Development and Public Policy. 100 Units. ,"The goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about what develops?, critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children's environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children's development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.

In this course we examine the structure of different negotiations and the psychology that governs the processes and outcomes of a negotiation. For instance, we consider the role of perceptions, expectations, intuitions, and biases. We evaluate the role of information processing, modes of communication, and power in influencing a negotiated outcome. We see how the psychology of trust, reciprocity, fairness, cooperation, and competition can affect our ability to benefit from an exchange or contribute to the escalation of conflict. To better understand the dynamics of the negotiation process, we learn both through engaging in a variety of negotiation role-plays and relating these experiences to research findings.

2652,UniOfChicago,PBPL 21390. Philosophy of Poverty. 100 Units. ,"Global poverty is a human tragedy on a massive scale, and it poses one of the most daunting challenges to achieving a just global order. In recent decades, a significant number of philosophers have addressed this issue in new and profoundly important ways, overcoming the disciplinary limitations of narrowly economic or public policy oriented approaches. Recent theories of justice have provided both crucial conceptual clarifications of the very notion of 'poverty'-including new measures that are more informed by the voices of the global poor and better able to cover the full impact of poverty on human capabilities and welfare-and vital new theoretical frameworks for considering freedom from poverty as a basic human right and/or a demand of justice, both nationally and internationally. Moreover, these philosophers have pointed to concrete, practical steps, at both the level of institutional design and the level of individual ethical/political action, for effectively combating poverty and moving the world closer to justice. The readings covered in this course, from such philosophers as Peter Singer, Thomas Pogge, David Graeber, and Martha Nussbaum, will reveal, not only the injustice of global poverty, but also what is to be done about it.

","Many analysts like Robert Putnam hold that bowling alone signals a decline in social capital, with major consequences for trust and legitimacy of the political system. But new work finds that certain arts and cultural activities are rising, especially among the young, in many countries. This course reviews core related concepts-political culture, social capital, legitimacy-and how they change with these new developments. We lay out new concepts and related methods, such as a grammar of scenes, measured for 40,000+ U.S. zip codes. Scenes, nightlife, design, the internet, and entertainment emerge as critical drivers of the post-industrial/knowledge society. Older primordial conflicts over class, race, and gender are transformed with these new issues, which spark new social movements and political tensions.

2664,UniOfChicago,PBPL 23650. Revolutionizing Agriculture: Early Modern Technologies for the New Millennium. 100 Units. ,"Based on a wave of sustainable and organic farming technologies that have reinvented early modern growing practices, this course integrates USDA reports and modern field and lab studies into the historiography of The British Agricultural Revolution. Not all historical technologies were sustainable, and this course relies upon modern agronomy to evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of the farming improvements that defined the British Agricultural Revolution. We similarly explore primary historical sources and historiography to better understand the environmental limits of the technologies used by organic and sustainable farmers today. By bringing the science and history into discourse, we will take a critical look at the British Agricultural Revolution, which is thought to have facilitated the Industrial Revolution by accumulating capital for investment and by allowing England to feed a growing urban population and manufacturing sector without a significant increase in arable acres. We know that yields per acre per worker did increase, but this is the only aspect of the story that remains unquestioned. Some agricultural improvement technologies, like light plowing and enclosure, caused catastrophic environmental harms that ultimately lowered yields over time. Other technologies like The Norfolk Rotation may have had small and gradual impacts over time and cannot be easily correlated with increases in yields on a site-by-site basis in the historical literature or in modern field trials. Other early modern technologies have proven to be more beneficial than previously thought. How can a better understanding of this history inform farming practices today?

The natural aspects of reproduction intersect in increasingly fraught and often surprising ways with its technological/ scientific, institutional/professional, religious/spiritual, and political/ ideological aspects. The starting point for the course is that the reproduction of bodies is differently understood and politically contested among and for various groups of people. We will pay particular attention to the ways bodies, ideas, and technologies flow throughout global contexts, while exploring how inequalities at various levels (race, class, geographic region, nationality, gender, sexuality, practices of family making) impact the nature of the reproductive body, and how reproductive practices reproduce such inequalities. We will also explore how knowledge of the reproductive body is contested through biomedicine, law, and media, with particular attention to naturalizing discourse about gender and intuition. Finally, we will look at how ecology and reproduction are intertwined via concern about environmental toxicities and the impact of non-human actors. Instructor(s): A.

2670,UniOfChicago,PBPL 24605. Introduction to Urban Sciences. 100 Units. ,"This course is a grand tour of conceptual frameworks, general phenomena, emerging data and policy applications that define a growing scientific integrated understanding of cities and urbanization. It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses. We will show how issues of inequality also have consequences at more macroscopic levels and derive the general features of population and economic growth for systems of cities and nations.

Exploring the Resilient City. 100 Units. ,"In recent years, sub-national units of government have enacted meaningful policy plans in the wake of the ongoing failure of the international community to address global climate change. Cities in particular have shaped their plans to address the now-inevitable effects of climate change by adopting policies that emphasize resilience and environmental protection, without sacrificing economic growth, and with attention to the ongoing challenges of poverty and inequality. This course will take a comparative look at the policies adopted by cities on an international basis, while defining what it means to be a resilient city and how much the built environment can be adjusted to limit the environmental impact of densely populated metropolises. It will also consider what impact citizen activism and input had upon the shape of each plan and the direction that its policies took.

Punishment and Social Theory. 100 Units. ,"In this course, students examine the rise of the penal state, tracing its roots from the birth of the prison to the ascendance of mass imprisonment. The course is organized around four lines of inquiry--(1) How is the power to punish derived? (2) In what ways has the role of punishment in society been conceived? (3) What do the practices of punishment produce and tell us about ourselves? (4) Are there alternatives? Taking up these questions, students will outline the major theories of punishment advanced by classical political philosophers and penologists (Locke, Hume, Beccaria, Bentham, etc.), and trace the trajectory of our modern impulse to punish through the works of the masters of suspicion, (Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche). We will interrogate the political economy, culture, and consequences of punishment through readings on the carceral state (i.e. Alexander, Allen, Dubois, Garland, Gilmore, Gottschalk, Foucault, Harcourt, Muhammad, Melossi and Pavarini, Rusche and Kirchheimer, Wacquant, Western, etc.), and conclude by raising new questions about the role, force, consequence and alternatives to punishment in an age of mass imprisonment.

Child Development and Public Policy. 100 Units. ,"The goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about what develops?, critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children's environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children's development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.

The first part will focus on understanding the problems of economic development in the region. It will address how and why Latin America is different by looking at its economic outcomes, economic and social policies and political institutions. It will also look at different examples of how political institutions shape policy outcomes. The second part will ground the distinctiveness of Latin America in its history, and show why understanding this is critical for comprehending why it is so different from the United States. It will explore how these historical factors persist, for example, how the legacy of authoritarianism shapes redistributive policies and how these historical foundations have created the weak Latin American states we see today. The third part of the course will look at how groups such as civil society or violent actors can also shape policymaking and welfare in this region. Finally, it will discuss some perspectives on whether some countries in the region have managed to find ways to change their political institutions and subsequently their social and economic policies with the prospect of creating a more prosperous society. The aim of this course is for students to gain empirical knowledge on the region's politics and policies as well as a practical understanding of political factors that shape policy outcomes.

Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics. 100 Units. ,"The Indian city of Bombay and the Mumbai it has now become has been referred to as the imagined city, the kinetic city, the cosmopolitan city, and the city of slums. What do these labels mean to the practice of sociality and politics in Bombay/Mumbai; how does the urban experience in South Asia differ from that in other parts of the world; and how do gender, religion and class influence the different experiences of the city? Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics is an interdisciplinary course that will address these and several related issues. Using the city of Mumbai as its lens it introduces students to the ways in which urban subjects and urban life are constituted in a globalizing South Asia. The course explores the city of Mumbai through an urbanculturalist perspective and problematizes the ways in which the built environment of the city: its transportation, streets, slums, neighborhoods, tenements, markets, malls and businesses animate and are animated by the everyday life and politics in the metropolis. It encourages students to think about the ways in which Mumbai's past and present patterns of urban informality, capitalism, consumption, criminality and urban dislocations mediate very particular experiences of politics, sociality, class, gender and globalization. The course uses a range of historical, theoretical, literary, and ethnographic readings as well as films, photography, and music to highlight the connections between place, space and everyday life in Mumbai.

We will address empirical and theoretical questions about voters, candidates, parties, and the electoral system as a whole. For example, who runs for political office? How do they choose their policy platforms? How do citizens form their vote choices? Who turns out to vote and why? Who is informed and why? Does it matter that many citizens abstain from politics and are uninformed? What roles do race, ethnicity, and prejudice play in elections? What role does the media play? What laws and policies could improve political participation and political representation? We will address these questions through the applications of game theory, microeconomic theory, and most importantly quantitative/statistical analysis. Instructor(s): A.

2739,UniOfChicago,PBPL 28747. The Modern Welfare State. 100 Units. ,"In 2016, Denmark was the happiest country in the world according to a United Nations happiness report. Denmark, along with Sweden and Finland have shared 20 years of relative prosperity and now are among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita. They are also welfare states with very high levels of taxation and redistribution--policies at odds with traditional views on the power of incentives to encourage prosperity. The influence of the Nordic Model is evident is policy discussion in the US on issues ranging from educational subsidies to family-friendly workplaces. What can policy makers in other countries learn from the successes and failures of the Nordic Model? This class has three goals: 1. to familiarize you with Nordic taxes and subsidies, 2. to help you understand why these policies are successful (or appear to be successful), and 3. to give you the tools to critically evaluate suggestions for similar policy implementation in the US.

2742,UniOfChicago,PBPL 28780. The Art and Science of Negotiations and Persuasion. 100 Units. ,"The ability to influence other people and convince them to go along with your beliefs about what they should do is perhaps one of the most sought after, but misunderstood, professional skills. Those who appear to be successful at negotiation and persuasion are routinely built up as having unique traits like charisma, excellent leadership skills, and innate talent. However, this course will explain how success in influencing others depends not on innate or unique traits, but rather on knowledge and practice of basic psychological principles that govern interpersonal behavior. This course will increase your understanding of negotiations and persuasion in several ways. First, you will experience varied negotiation situations firsthand in the classroom on a weekly basis. Second, you will learn how to analyze your work using insights collected from decades of research in social psychology, decision-making, and behavioral science. Third, and unlike most real-life situations, you will be able to receive feedback on your performance. Life, unfortunately, does not often offer the opportunity to compare your outcomes to other people's outcomes. This course does, thereby enabling you to identify what you did right, what you did wrong, and improve your performance by evaluating your work compared to the rest of the class. This course aims to provide you with negotiation experience, tools for persuading others to go along with your beliefs, and general knowledge of human psychology.

2743,UniOfChicago,PBPL 28805. Behavioral Economics and Policy. 100 Units. ,"The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness? Instructor(s): J.

Machine Learning and Policy. 100 Units. ,"The goal of this course is to make students better producers and consumers of machine learning tools designed to help solve public policy problems. One thing this goal requires is some understanding of the basics of machine learning: how it works, what makes it different from the usual sort of statistical and econometric tools that we tend to use in social science studies of public policy problems, and how to implement these prediction models (which we will be doing in R, a free statistical program that now includes many machine learning packages). But this goal also requires some understanding of issues that are outside the usual machine learning toolkit, such as: what sorts of public policy problems are right for these tools, and which are not; how do we know whether a new prediction tool is capable of actually improving policy decisions, not just predicting outcomes accurately within some hold-out set; what additional considerations around fairness and other normative values may arise in using machine learning tools for public policy applications; and what challenges are associated with getting policymakers, front-line practitioners or individual citizens to make use of prediction tools and resulting decision aids.

2749,UniOfChicago,PBPL 28923. Health Impacts of Transportation Systems. 100 Units. ,"Transportation systems affect human health through complex pathways. Governments invest in transport infrastructure because it encourages economic growth and mobility of people and goods, which have direct and indirect benefits to health. Yet, an excessive reliance on motorized modes of transport harms population health, the environment and social wellbeing. The impact on population health is substantial: Globally, road traffic crashes kill over 1.3 million annually. Air pollution, to which transport is an important contributor, kills another 3.2 million people. Motorized modes of transport are also an important contributor to sedentary lifestyles. Physical inactivity is estimated to cause 3.2 million deaths every year, globally. This course will introduce students to thinking about transportation as a technological system that affects human health and wellbeing through intended and unintended mechanisms. The course will examine the complex relationship between transportation, land use, urban form, and geography, and explore how decisions in other sectors affect transportation systems, and how these in turn affect human health. Students will learn to recognize how the system level properties of a range of transportation systems (such as limited-access highways, urban mass transit, inter-city rail) affect human health. The course reviews the pathways through which road transport impacts population health and focuses on how to measure these impacts, and how to compare them with other leading causes of health loss.

2750,UniOfChicago,PBPL 28957. The Social Psychology of Behavior in Organizations. 100 Units. ,"Understanding others' thoughts and behaviors is essential for professional and personal success. Most of us try to understand others by putting on the cap of an intuitive scientist, relying on our intuitions to identify others' thoughts and motivations and to predict others' behavior. However, decades of psychological research suggest that our intuitions about other people are often misguided in systematic ways. This course will enable you to have a more accurate understanding of others' motivations, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors by teaching you to think like a psychological scientist rather than an intuitive scientist. Relying on research in social psychology, judgment and decision-making, and behavioral science, this course will help you understand when your intuitions are likely to be reliable and when they are unlikely to be so, giving you important knowledge and tools to succeed professionally and interpersonally. Managing other people-be they co-workers, customers, constituents, or competitors-is critical for professional and personal success. At the very start of your professional career, your success will likely depend on having the necessary technical expertise to produce excellent work product for your organization. As you progress in your career, however, success will increasingly require you to manage groups of people, to align their skills, solve interpersonal problems, and create well-functioning teams. This course is intended to provide the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical for successfully managing others, and also for successfully managing yourself.

Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient Near East. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along with representative selections from secondary literature. We will also spend some time thinking about the nature of biblical interpretation. Instructor(s): J.

","L'Afrique et les Antilles sont généralement présentées comme des régions hautement superstitieuses, figées dans les croyances et les traditions. La littérature apparaît comme le lieu privilégié où se reflètent ces éléments culturels. Les écrivains africains et antillais (plus précisément d'Haïti, de Martinique, de Guadeloupe et de la Guyane française) analysent, questionnent, reformulent des récits, mythes et légendes tirés d'une tradition avant tout orale. A leur suite, nous essayerons de remonter aux origines de ces croyances et superstitions. Nous naviguerons entre essais théoriques et récits linéaires pour mener une réflexion critique, et formuler des réponses à un certain nombre de questions, notamment : Croyances et superstitions sont-elles uniquement les vestiges d'un héritage oral ? Comment se rattachent-elles à l'histoire de ces peuples ? Quelle perception [sociale] suscitentelles ? En tant qu'éléments du récit, quels effets provoquent-elles chez le lecteur ?

This course will explore the mix of social, political, and cultural factors which caused its outbreak in 1789 and go on to consider the overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy in 1792, the drift towards state-driven Terror in 1793-94, and the ensuing failure to achieve political stability down to the advent of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. We will view these epochal changes through the prism of France's capital city. Paris shaped the revolution in many ways, but the revolution also reshaped Paris. The urbane city of European enlightenment acquired new identities as democratic hub from 1789 and as site of popular democracy after 1793-94. In addition, the revolution generated new ways of thinking about urban living and remodelling the city for the modern age. A wide range of primary sources will be used, including visual sources (notably paintings, political cartoons and caricatures, and maps). Instructor(s): C.

2833,UniOfChicago,FREN 22818. Figures du poète au XXème siècle (1900-1950) 100 Units. ,"En quoi consiste la crise du moi poétique théorisée par Mallarmé à la fin du XIXe siècle ? Quelles sont les formes du lyrisme « neuf et humaniste à la fois » envisagé par Apollinaire au début du XXe ? Est-ce qu'il est encore possible de dire « je » en poésie ? Face à ces changements, le poète doit reconfigurer son rapport à une histoire à la fois bouleversée et bouleversante, et retrouver sa place au milieu d'un renouvèlement littéraire désormais nécessaire. Ce cours analysera la façon dont la recherche poétique, dans son contenu comme dans sa forme, fait front au défi de la modernité sans renoncer à sa nature d'expérience de « vie intégrale » (Saint-John Perse). Par le moyen d'une variété expressive extraordinaire, le poète devient une figure souple, en mesure d'adapter son langage et son rôle aux sollicitations de la réalité. Les textes du corpus (Breton, Aragon, Char, Cocteau,Claudel, Éluard, Ponge, etc.) seront accompagnés de références critiques qui serviront de guide pour l'étudiant.À travers ces lectures on essaiera d'examiner comment le poète rend compte des expériences qui l'entourent à l'aube du XXe siècle : la guerre, le cosmopolitisme, l'appel à un engagement politique et culturel, la confluence des arts - autrement dit, tous les champs d'application d'une nouvelle forme de lyrisme. Ainsi le poète se fait-il soldat, voyageur, peintre, musicien, artiste engagé, dans un processus de métamorphose incessante et pourtant indispensable. Instructor(s): C.

In direct contrast to an understanding of the Middle Ages as a time of cultural isolation and homogeneity, we will be considering some of the many points of contact between medieval France and other Mediterranean geographies, cultures, and peoples. Our readings will take us to such places as Greece and Rome, Constantinople, Cairo, Syria, Jerusalem, and Spain. The emphasis will be on texts that present these trans-Mediterranean relationships in complex and varied ways.

This seminar will be devoted to the literary life of two writers whose canon for more than a century has occupied a central place of importance in contemporary literary criticism. It will be our task to place their work in perspective within the context of the rise of modernism, which is to say, the new status of literature as of the year 1857. We shall endeavor, thus, to discern the authenticity of the creative relationship of each artist with himself and subsequently with others. The point will be to foreground three fundamental principles that will aid in grasping the evolution of the literary world under the Second Empire and under the Third Republic: literary history, writing and the elevation of the writer (Bénichou). Our work will be based on three or four texts by Baudelaire and Flaubert, it being understood that additional works of criticism will illuminate the discussion of these texts. Instructor(s): D.

2839,UniOfChicago,FREN 23810. Memory and Identity in French Literature: Proust to the Present. 100 Units. ,"This introductory-level course takes as its point of departure Marcel Proust's conceptualization of memory as the foundation both for the self and for literature. For Proust, literary style conveys the singularity of an individual vision while rescuing experience from the contingencies of time. Literature, identity, and memory are inseparable. Later writers will follow Proust's lead in defining literature as an art of memory; but they develop this art in different ways, whether by inventing new forms of life-writing or attempting to revive, via fiction, a lived connection to history. How does memory serve as the foundation of individual or collective identities? How does fiction imagine and give form to memory, and how does literature serve as a medium for cultural memory? How do literary works register the intermittence of memory, its failings and distortions, its fragility as well as its attachment to bodies and places? We will tackle these questions through close analysis of a range of texts. In addition to Proust, authors studied may include Yourcenar, Perec, Modiano, Roubaud, and Ernaux. Instructor(s): A. James Terms Offered: Spring Note(s): Taught in English. French reading knowledge desirable but not required.

","Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles helped shape European culture and history from the Baroque era through the French Revolution, and it continues to animate contemporary international culture. How does this astounding assemblage of architecture, visual arts, landscaping, performance spaces and political arenas reveal transformations in cultural tastes and power arrangements over the centuries? How do literature and art alternately support and subvert absolutist power and state propaganda? To respond we will range across media, from the bitingly satiric comedies and provocative tragedies of the 17th century (Molière, Racine), through royal edicts regulating colonial slavery and first-hand accounts of the 1789 Women's March on Versailles that upended the monarchy, and finally to cinematic depictions (from Jean Renoir to Sophia Coppola) and experimental palace installations by the world's leading contemporary artists (Jeff Koons, Anish Kapoor, etc.). While this course will broadly introduce major themes of French and European culture and history of the early-modern and modern periods, students are also encouraged to pursue in-depth projects in their own areas of interest, from history and political philosophy to the visual arts, theater and performance, and literature.

Autobiographies Maghrébines: de l'Ecriture de Soi à l'Ecriture de l'Histoire. 100 Units. ,"Dès sa naissance, la littérature maghrébine d'expression française s'est distinguée par son ancrage dans le contexte historique, politique et socio-culturel des trois pays du Maghreb que sont le Maroc, l'Algérie et la Tunisie. Souvent, l'écriture de soi a donné lieu à une (ré)écriture de l'Histoire, mettant l'individuel et le collectif en dialogue permanent. L'autobiographie, par exemple, devient le champ d'une exploration simultanée des identités individuelle et collective, le lieu d'un témoignage littéraire autour de l'expérience coloniale et de ses conséquences, ou encore de la confrontation entre le poids persistant de la tradition et le désir de liberté et de changement. En se racontant, l'écrivain maghrébin restitue les tensions qui hantent l'espace et la mémoire partagés tout en proposant des voies de reconstruction à travers la révolte, le désir, et le travail de la langue. En s'appuyant sur un corpus d'œuvres marquantes de la littérature maghrébine d'expression française (Albert Memmi, Driss Chraïbi, Kateb Yacine, Assia Djebar, Fatima Mernissi, Abdellatif Laâbi), ce séminaire sera consacré essentiellement à la question du rapport entre écriture personnelle et écriture de l'Histoire dans un contexte maghrébin.

Vico's New Science. 100 Units. ,"This course offers a close reading of Giambattista Vico's masterpiece, New Science (1744)-a work that sets out to refute all opinions hitherto held about the principles of humanity. Vico, who is acknowledged as the most resolute scourge of any form of rationalism, breathed new life into rhetoric, imagination, poetry, metaphor, history, and philology in order to promote in his readers that originary wonder and pathos which sets human beings on the search for truth. However, Vico argues, the truths that are most available and interesting to us are the ones humanity authored by means of its culture and history-creating activities. For this reason the study of myth and folklore as well as archeology, anthropology, and ethnology must all play a role in the rediscovery of man. The New Science builds an alternative philosophy for a new age and reads like a novel of formation recounting the (hi)story of the entire human race and our divine ancestors. In Vico, a prophetic spirit, one recognizes the fulfillment of the Renaissance, the spokesperson of a particular Enlightenment, the precursor of the Kantian revolution, and the forefather of the philosophy of history (Herder, Hegel, and Marx). The New Science remained a strong source of inspiration in the twentieth century (Cassirer, Gadamer, Berlin, Joyce, Beckett, etc.) and may prove relevant in disclosing our own responsibilities in postmodernity.

2868,UniOfChicago,ITAL 23101. Early Italian Lyric: Dante and His Rivals. 100 Units. ,"This course examines Dante's complicated relationship with other contemporary and near-contemporary lyric poets. In particular, we examine Dante's texts as part of a dense web of contending vernacular discourses instead of as the final word or telos of our studies. For this reason, special emphasis is given to the sonnet form as a ritualized genre in which poetic communities are formed and contending philosophical, political, and sociological visions of society are constructed and deconstructed. The role of books and manuscript culture is especially important as we try to understand the material production and reception of the emergent vernacular literature, and its role and function in late medieval urban Italy.

Unveiling Chivalry: Chivalric literature in Medieval and Early Modern Europe (1100-1600) 100 Units. ,"The myth of chivalry has been fostered and reshaped from the Middle Ages to the present with damsels-indistress, knights' self-sacrifice, adventures and courtly love. But how was chivalry in eleventh- or sixteenth-century literature different from today's perception? What changed between historical chivalry and its fictional representation? This course aims to challenge the narrative of chivalry as one characterized by rise and fall, or a movement from virtue to parody, or spirituality to skepticism. We will see instead how each text provides multiple layers of interpretation and how chivalry is redefined across time and space. Exploring the notion of chivalry will also allow us to focus on the so-called spirituality of the Middle Ages and the relationship between the Renaissance and the past. We will study chivalric literature from the Chanson de Roland to Cervantes's Don Quijote. A strong emphasis will be given to Italian literature, including Dante's Commedia, Boccaccio's Decameron and Ariosto's Orlando furioso. Readings will also include Chrétien de Troyes's Lancelot and Perceval, with a final session devoted to T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land. Instructor(s): F.

2870,UniOfChicago,ITAL 25218. Reading Nonhuman Animals: A Challenge to Anthropocentrism. 100 Units. ,"How can we read a literary nonhuman animal? In what ways does literature deal with ethical and political issues concerning nonhuman animals? What does it mean to live in a multicultural and multispecies world? What does it mean to be human? In this course we will ask these and other related questions as they are presented and represented in Italian 20th century literary texts, read alongside philosophical writings, scholarly essays, and visual materials. While maintaining a focus on Italian literature, a comparative approach involving literary works of non-Italian authors will be key in understanding the pervasiveness of the problems that have caused our detachment from nature and our broken relationship with nonhuman animals. We will closely analyze and critically evaluate the works of several authors, including those by Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Anna Maria Ortese, Elsa Morante, Italo Svevo, Alice Walker, and Franz Kafka, giving particular attention to techniques of close reading. A thematic approach will enable us to explore a large number of critical discourses, from the moral status of nonhuman animals to the long-held assumptions regarding the anthropocentric set of values that have defined (Western) culture. We will also take into consideration different theoretical frameworks such as posthumanist theory and gender studies in order to discuss and evaluate the selected texts from different perspectives and entry points.

2871,UniOfChicago,ITAL 26500. Renaissance Demonology. 100 Units. ,"In this course we analyze the complex concept of demonology according to early modern European culture from a theological, historical, philosophical, and literary point of view. The term 'demon' in the Renaissance encompasses a vast variety of meanings. Demons are hybrids. They are both the Christian devils, but also synonyms for classical deities, and Neo-platonic spiritual beings. As far as Christian theology is concerned, we read selections from Augustine's and Thomas Aquinas's treatises, some complex exorcisms written in Italy, and a recent translation of the infamous Malleus maleficarum, the most important treatise on witch-hunt. We pay close attention to the historical evolution of the so-called witch-craze in Europe through a selection of the best secondary literature on this subject, with special emphasis on Michel de Certeau's The Possession at Loudun. We also study how major Italian and Spanish women mystics, such as Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and Teresa of Avila, approach the issue of demonic temptation and possession. As far as Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophy is concerned, we read selections from Marsilio Ficino's Platonic Theology and Girolamo Cardano's mesmerizing autobiography. We also investigate the connection between demonology and melancholy through a close reading of the initial section of Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and Cervantes's short story The Glass Graduate (El licenciado Vidriera).

Women and the Mafia in Contemporary Italian Cinema. 100 Units. ,"This course will examine how gender dynamics within mafia contexts have been represented in a selection of Italian films. Students will engage in cinematic analysis by drawing from sociological and psychological studies on female roles in relation to organized crime. Both these fields, sociology and psychology, have underscored the important part that women play in relation to the mafia, notwithstanding the rigid patriarchal structure that allows only male affiliation. Although focusing primarily on Sicilian mafia, this course will include information on other types of Italian mafia, namely Camorra, 'Ndrangheta and Sacra Corona Unita.

2873,UniOfChicago,ITAL 27700. The (Auto)Biography of a Nation: Francesco De Sanctis and Benedetto Croce. 100 Units. ,"At its core, this course examines the making and legacy of Francesco De Sanctis's History of Italian Literature (1870-71), a work that distinguished literary critic René Wellek defined as the finest history of any literature ever written and an active instrument of aesthetic evolution. We will read the History in the larger context of De Sanctis's corpus, including his vast epistolary exchanges, autobiographical writings, and so-called Critical Essays in order to detail his reform of Hegelian aesthetics, his redefinition of the intellectual's task after the perceived exhaustion of the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic moments, and his campaign against the bent toward erudition, philology, and antiquarianism in 19th-century European scholarship. We will compare De Sanctis's methodology to that of his scholarly models in France (Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred Mézières) and Germany (Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Georg Voigt) to explore De Sanctis's claim that literary criticisms - not just literary cultures - are national. In the second part of the course, we assess Benedetto Croce's appropriation of De Sanctis in his Aesthetics (1902), arguably the last, vastly influential work in its genre and we conclude with Antonio Gramsci's use of De Sanctis for the regeneration of a literary savvy Marxism or philosophy of praxis.

","Literature on empathy has enormously increased in recent decades, especially from the point of view of neuroscience and neuro-aesthetics. Scholars, however, have been focusing on the ethical dimension of empathy: on the identification with the victims, which is also highlighted by the political use of this concept. The course focuses instead on the (more or less latent) empathy with negative characters, which can have a strong cathartic and social function, as a discharge of destructive and self-destructive drives, and is often linked to the representation of fear and other strong emotions. The preliminary step is a theoretical introduction to the category of empathy, from its first eighteenth-century conceptions to new aesthetic and psychoanalytic elaborations at the beginning of twentieth century (especially Theodor Lipp), up to recent developments coming from the neurosciences. Other parallel issues to be introduced are catharsis, identification, and discharge. Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, Giuseppe Verdi and Pier Paolo Pasolini will be studied, as well as the TV series Breaking Bad, which brilliantly exemplifies what negative empathy means today.

2926,UniOfChicago,"SPAN 23201. Art, Ekphrasis, and Myth in Early Modern Spanish Theater. 100 Units. ","In the early modern age, the verbal had a strong visual component. Poets and playwrights utilized the sense of sight since it was the highest of the Platonic senses and a mnemonic key to lead spectators to remember vividly what they had read or heard, long before spectacle plays were in fashion. One important technique for visualization was ekphrasis, the description of an art work within a text. Often, to perform was to imitate the affects, sentiments and poses of a painting. For this purpose, playwrights such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega and Calderón often turned to the mythological canvases of the Italian Renaissance along with the portraits of great rulers and images of battle. The class will examine the uses of art onstage: mnemonic, mimetic, political, religious comic, tragic, lyric and licentious. It will also delve into different forms of ekphrasis from the notional to the dramatic and from the fragmented to the reversed. Although the course will focus on Spanish plays of the early modern period, it will also include ancient treatises by Cicero, and Pliny as well as Renaissance mnemonic treatises by Della Porta.

As a lateral way of looking, queerness brings together, not without conflict, activism and academia, theory, action and creation. During the course, we will address how these Hispanic queer works problematize notions such as the canon, the tradition, the sociopolitical structures or the idea of family and lineage. By questioning them, we will see how not only these works challenge the fundamental basis of social, political and literary order, but also unfold a fluid, productive alternative to neoliberalism.

The courses are not in sequence. Language through Fiction is designed to help students and instructors over one of the most difficult hurdles in language training-the transition from working through lessons in a textbook to reading unedited texts. Literature represents the greatest development of the expressive possibilities of a language and reveals the bounds within which language operates. The texts will immerse motivated language students in a complete language experience, as the passages and related exercises present the language's structure on every page. Students will learn how to engage the natural, organic language of a literary text across a variety of styles and themes. The course assumes that students are familiar with basic grammar and vocabulary, as well as both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. It is particularly appealing to students who are interested in the literature, history, and anthropology of the region.

Emphasis is on interpersonal communication as well as the interpretation and production of language in written and oral forms. The course engages in systematic grammar review, along with introduction of some new linguistic topics, with constant practice in writing and vocabulary enrichment. The syllabus includes the screening of six films, each from a different director, region, and period, starting with Cinema Komunisto (2012), a documentary by Mila Turajlic. This film will be crucial for understanding how Yugoslav cinema was born and how, in its origins, it belongs to what a later cinephile, Fredric Jameson, has called a geopolitical aesthetic. We shall investigate the complex relationship between aesthetics and ideology in the Yugoslav and Post-Yugoslav cinema, and pay close attention to aesthetic conceptions and concrete formal properties, and more importantly, to language, narrative logic, and style.

The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writers struggle for breath - speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else.

The Soviet Union. 100 Units. ,"This lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature. In the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation--from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab--will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; Stalinism, its origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.

Since his death, Gogol has been the subject of ever-greater critical controversy. Reading representative works from each period of Gogol's career, including his Petersburg Tales and Dead Souls, we will trace the author's creative development and consider it in relation to his biography and early 19thcentury Russian literary and social history.

Dostoevsky. 100 Units. ,"Dostoevsky was an inveterate risk-taker, not only at the baccarat tables of the Grand Casino in Baden-Baden, but in his personal life, his political activities, and his artistic endeavors. This course is intended to investigate his two greatest wagers: on the presence of the divine in the world and on the power of artistic form to convey and articulate this presence. Dostoevsky's wager on form is evident even in his early, relatively conventional texts, like The Double. It intensifies after his decade-long sojourn in Siberia, exploding in works like The Notes from Underground, which one-and-a-half centuries later remains an aesthetic and philosophical provocation of immense power. The majority of the course will focus on Dostoevsky's later novels. In Crime and Punishment Dostoevsky adapts suspense strategies to create a metaphysical thriller, while in The Demons he pairs a study of nihilism with the deformation of the novel as a genre. Through close readings of these works we will trace how Dostoevsky's formal experimentation created new ways of exploring realms of existence that traditionally belonged to philosophy and theology. The results were never comfortable or comforting; we will focus on interpreting Dostoevsky's metaphysical provocations.

Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher. 100 Units. ,"In this course, we dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorial style and concepts that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. Entangled in an ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish author is a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowicz applied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth, as we focus on Gombrowicz's novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings. With an insight from recent criticism of these primary texts, we seek answers to the more general question: What makes this author a philosopher?

3006,UniOfChicago,"REES 21006. Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism. 100 Units. ","Course centers on Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel's relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad's interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative's ideology we discuss Conrad's historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent. Equivalent Course(s): ENGL 21006, REES 31006, ENGL 31006, FNDL 21006 "

The courses are not in sequence. Language through Fiction is designed to help students and instructors over one of the most difficult hurdles in language training-the transition from working through lessons in a textbook to reading unedited texts. Literature represents the greatest development of the expressive possibilities of a language and reveals the bounds within which language operates. The texts will immerse motivated language students in a complete language experience, as the passages and related exercises present the language's structure on every page. Students will learn how to engage the natural, organic language of a literary text across a variety of styles and themes. The course assumes that students are familiar with basic grammar and vocabulary, as well as both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

This literary and cinematic genre was thought capable of reinventing the lives, realties and even beliefs of the Soviets. This course will study the cultural, historical, and political contexts of science fiction from the Soviet Union through literature such as Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopian novel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), Ivan Efremov's The Andromeda Nebula (1956), and the work Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, as well as through films such as Iakov Protazanov's Aelita (1924), the first Soviet science fiction film, along with later imaginings of space travel such as Pavel Klushantsev's Road to the Stars (1957), and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972)-a mysterious, human drama set in space.

What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a public intellectual.

This course focuses on such works, as well as the narrative strategies and formal devices that allow these short stories and novellas to be both effective and economical. Throughout the quarter, we will read short fiction from a variety of Russian authors and examine the texts that establish the tradition of Russian short fiction as well as those that push its boundaries. This course will serve as a general survey of Russian Literature, as well as a focused introduction to a particular genre in that tradition. Although predominantly discussion-based, the class will also include short lectures by the instructor to introduce students to the broader historical contexts of the course texts, and to sample diverse theoretical approaches to those texts.

3028,UniOfChicago,REES 25603. Media and Power in the Age of Putin and Trump. 100 Units. ,"Over the past 200 years, various political and cultural regimes of Russia have systematically exploited the gap between experience and representation to create their own mediated worlds--from the tight censorship of the imperial and Soviet periods to the propaganda of the Soviet period and the recent use of media simulacra for strategic geopolitical advantage. During this same period state control of media has been used to seclude Russia from the advancement of liberalism, market economics, individual rights, modernist art, Freud, Existentialism, and, more recently, Western discourses of inclusion, sustainability, and identity. Examining this history, it is sometimes difficult to discern whether the architects of Russian culture have been hopelessly backward or shrewd phenomenologists, keenly aware of the relativity of experience and of their ability to shape it. This course will explore the worlds that these practices produce, with an emphasis on Russia's recent confrontations with Western culture and power, and including various practices of subversion of media control, such as illegal printing and circulation. Texts for the course will draw from print, sound, and visual media, and fields of analysis will include aesthetics, cultural history, and media theory.

3029,UniOfChicago,REES 25701. Memoir in Modernism. 100 Units. ,"This course serves as an introduction to Russian and European modernism, taking the fictionalized autobiography as its focus. In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers' approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely's Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam's The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others. Supplementary readings will include texts by Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, Gérard Genette and Mikhail Bakhtin. No knowledge of Russian or French is required, but an additional discussion section can be arranged for students with sufficient reading fluency in Russian. Equivalent Course(s): CMLT 25702 "

We will try to see communism as history and as promise, and to see how this relates to our own desire for social change in our own worlds. We will examine the interaction between Marxism, state power and image culture by focusing on key moments from the entire lifespan of the USSR (1917-1991) and from across the range of media,from graphic art and film to their reflections in literature and aesthetic theory.

3035,UniOfChicago,REES 26019. Symbolism and Cinema. 100 Units. ,"In his 1896 essay on cinema, Russian writer Maxim Gorky described the new medium to madness or symbolism. The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was a dominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly) that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and even invisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention to French and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematic medium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and the mystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relates to notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and some American) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage to Andrei Tarkovsky.

Apollon Grigor'ev later called Pushkin our everything; Dostoevsky claimed We all emerged out of Gogol's 'Overcoat.' During the quarter we will read a representative selection of both writers' major works, including Pushkin's verse novel Evgenii Onegin, verse epic The Bronze Horseman, and novel The Captain's Daughter, and Gogol's novel Dead Souls in addition to his fantastic stories The Nose and The Overcoat. We will focus on close readings of the texts, paying particular attention to their experiments with literary form, as well as attending to their broader historical contextualization. We will focus particularly on the conceptions of realism projected by the texts and imposed by later readers. All readings will be in English translation.

3037,UniOfChicago,REES 26064. Revolution. 100 Units. ,"Revolution primarily denotes radical political change, but this definition is both too narrow and too broad. Too broad, because since the late eighteenth century revolution has been associated specifically with an emancipatory politics, from American democracy to Soviet communism. Too narrow, because revolutionary political change is always accompanied by change in other spheres, from philosophy to everyday life. We investigate the history of revolution from 1776 to the present, with a particular focus on the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, in order to ascertain how social revolutions have been constituted, conducted, and enshrined in political and cultural institutions. We also ask what the conditions and prospects of revolution are today. Readings will be drawn from a variety of fields, from philosophy to social history. Most readings will be primary documents, from Rousseau and Marx to Bill Ayers, but will also include major statements in the historiography of revolution.

3038,UniOfChicago,"REES 26068. The Underground: Alienation, Mobilization, Resistance. 100 Units. ","The ancient and multivalent image of the underground has crystallized over the last two centuries to denote sites of disaffection from-and strategies of resistance to-dominant social, political and cultural systems. We will trace the development of this metaphor from the Underground Railroad in the mid-1800s and the French Resistance during World War II to the Weather Underground in the 1960s-1970s, while also considering it as a literary and artistic concept, from Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground and Ellison's Invisible Man to Chris Marker's film La Jetée and Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker. Alongside with such literary and cinematic tales, drawing theoretical guidance from refuseniks from Henry David Thoreau to Guy Debord, this course investigates how countercultural spaces become-or fail to become-sites of political resistance, and also how dissenting ideologies give rise to countercultural spaces. We ask about the relation between social deviance (the failure to meet social norms, whether willingly or unwittingly) and political resistance, especially in the conditions of late capitalism and neo-colonialism, when countercultural literature, film and music (rock, punk, hip-hop, DIY aesthetics etc.) get absorbed into-and coopted by-the hegemonic socio-economic system. In closing we will also consider contemporary forms of dissidence-from Pussy Riot to Black Lives Matter-that rely both on the vulnerability of individual bodies and global communication networks.

(origin of the robot), Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopian novel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), and Stanislaw Lem's Solaris (the inspiration for several film versions including Andrei Tarkovsky's in 1972).

The course will explore the intertwining political and intellectual histories of the Russian Eurasianist movement, Hungarian Jobbik, the American Traditional Workers Party, the French GRECE, Greek Golden Dawn, and others through their published essays, blogs, vlogs and social media. Perhaps most importantly, the course asks: can we use f-word (fascism) to describe this problem?

Cinema and the Holocaust. 100 Units. ,"Focuses on cinematic responses by several leading film directors from East  Central Europe to a central event of 20th century history -- the Holocaust. Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioning cameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandistic schemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocide produced after the actual traumatic events. This class aims at discussing the challenge of representing the Jewish genocide which has often been defined as un-representable. Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raise questions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production  a search for relevant artistic means with which to engage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation of death  suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization; intertwined notions of chance  hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims. The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the course simultaneously explores extensive  continuous cinematic production of the genre  its historical development in various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary,  Czechoslovakia during the Cold War.

He lived through the First World War and the Russian revolution and civil war, and survived Hitler, but not Stalin, who had him executed for nationalism in 1952. Yiddish and shtetl may suggest a self-enclosed community of pious Jews, celebrating their rituals in an annual cycle. In Bergelson's world, however, time is out of joint. Anachronism, belatedness, and untimeliness, both joyful and tragic, unfold as an emotional, sensory, and existential condition in the world his fiction creates and the world in which he lived. For Bergelson Yiddish is the vehicle for questions about time, history, justice, art, and bodily experience.

After all, shadows are cast by things and people…. Do you want to strip the earth of all the trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light? asks the Devil. Mikhail Bulgakov worked on his novel The Master and Margarita throughout most of his writing career, in Stalin's Moscow. Bulgakov destroyed his manuscript, re-created it from memory, and reworked it feverishly even as his body was failing him in his battle with death. The result is an intense contemplation on the nature of good and evil, on the role of art and the ethical duty of the artist, but also a dazzling world of magic, witches, and romantic love, and an irresistible seduction into the comedic. Laughter, as shadow and light, as the subversive weapon but also as power's whip, grounds human relation to both good and evil.

This course will confer general College elective credit, but it will not count toward the major. If the completed bachelor's paper is judged by the supervisor and a second faculty member to be a distinguished example of original research or criticism, the student is recommended to the College for graduation with honors in Russian and East European Studies. The final decision regarding the granting of any degree with honors rests with the Collegiate divisional master. Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter "

3064,UniOfChicago,SOCI 20000. Invitation to Sociology. 100 Units. ,"What do sociologists do all day? This course introduces students to the vast terrain of contemporary sociology, including: culture, deviance, economic life, education, family, health and the body, politics, population, professions, race, science and knowledge, and sex/gender, employing institutionalization as a basic lens that leads sociology to have a somewhat different approach from other social sciences. Why an invitation? Unlike introductory courses that cover 10 topics in 10 weeks with an emphasis on foundational texts, students will get to know sociology by reading and analyzing a rotating selection of books and articles that exemplify the field today. Students will complete exercises and write-ups that link claims about the social world to evidence. Throughout the quarter, class format takes a variety of forms, including lectures, informal presentations, student-led discussions, debates, and guest speakers. Instructor(s): J. Martin and J. Trinitapoli Terms Offered: Spring "
3065,UniOfChicago,SOCI 20001. Sociological Methods. 100 Units. ,"This course introduces the philosophy and practice of social research. Working from the idea that the research process is fundamentally a critical dialogue, we begin by exploring questions of causality and the epistemology of social research. Then we turn to examine the basic practices that are a component of all methods of social research through an in-depth examination of interviews, ethnography, surveys, and archival research.

3066,UniOfChicago,SOCI 20002. Social Structure and Change. 100 Units. ,"The title of this course is traditional more than it is descriptively accurate. It should be called How to Think Sociologically. Rather than attempt to survey the state of the field as introductory courses typically do, this course advances a particular vision of the discipline. We will be reading authors that fundamentally inform this vision (not all of whom were sociologists proper), including Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Garfinkel, Goffman, Geertz, Levi-Strauss, Mauss, Bourdieu, and Fanon. We will learn how to identify properly sociological objects and how to engage in various modes of sociological analysis. We will discuss social facts, forms, types, and relations; the collective nature of social reality, social identities such as race and gender, and social class. We may even get to talk about social structure and change. The course has been designed to provide students majoring in sociology a more solid-although, again, a very particular-disciplinary foundation.

3078,UniOfChicago,SOCI 20192. The Effects of Schooling. 100 Units. ,"From at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was the pre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education. The purpose of this course is to review what is known about the long-term effects of schooling.

3084,UniOfChicago,SOCI 20263. Human Migration. 100 Units. ,"At any moment, spatial location is a fixed, essential characteristic of people and the places they inhabit. Over time, individuals and groups of people change places. In the long run, the places themselves move in physical, social, economic and political space. These movements can be characterized by their origins and destinations, as intentional or accidental, forced or voluntary, individual or collective, within political borders (e.g. the farmto-city migration of the 1940's in the U.S), migration across political boundaries (e.g. displacement of pariah ethnicities after World War II), and by other criteria. All of these phenomena are aspects of migration This course reviews contemporary demographic research and theory concerning the nature of migration, and its extent, causes and consequences for individuals and collectivities. The demographic perspective absorbs a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including those of psychology (e.g. individual decision-making), sociology (collective behavior, stratification, race and ethnicity), economics (rational behavior, macroeconomic conditions), and more.

3085,UniOfChicago,SOCI 20264. Wealth. 100 Units. ,"Wealth is the value of a person's accumulated possessions and financial assets. Wealth is more difficult for social researchers to measure than earnings and income, and wealthy people are notoriously uncooperative with efforts to study them and their assets. Further, wealth data conveys less information than income data about the lives of the middle- and lower-classes -- who tend to have little or no wealth at all. However, information about wealth gives fundamentally important insight into the values, attitudes, behavior, consumption patterns, social standing, political power, health, happiness and yet more characteristics of individuals and population subgroups. This course considers the causes and consequences of wealth accumulation for individuals, the social groups to which they belong, and the societies in which they dwell. Instructor(s): R.

","The World Health Organization, United Nations and other international bodies consider health a fundamental human right. At the same time, most countries around the world are characterized by profound inequalities in health and wellbeing. In this course, we leverage sociological and social scientific concepts through a human rights framework to understand how these inequalities in mental and physical health are perpetuated by the structure and culture of society, with an emphasis on U.S. society. We will also examine medicine as an institution with a problematic history of repeated human rights violations (in the U.S. and around the world) and explore how that history shapes the current practice of medicine, medical research, and relations between doctors and patients. Finally, we will explore how institutions provide (or fail to provide) equal access to healthcare, and how state understandings of the right to health influence the lives of individuals and communities.

Certainly, politics will operate through established institutions such as elections and legislatures. But popular politics may also take other forms: petitions, social movements, protest in the streets, and cultural critique. These efforts often fail, sometimes dramatically, but they have also contributed to major social change including the abolition of slavery, the expansion of rights, and demands for new understandings of justice. This course will explore the history of popular politics within democratizing societies, the development of new forms of collective mobilization and technologies of political influence, and the changing relation of popular politics to formal political institutions.

Today, a near-record 14% of the country's population is foreign born compared with just 5% in 1965. These profound demographic changes raise critical questions: Why do immigrants come to the U.S.? What impact do they have on U.S. society? Are today's immigrants fundamentally different from previous waves of immigrants? Are these immigrants assimilating to the U.S. or retaining their culture? Why do some immigrant groups appear to fare better than others? This course will expose students to the latest social science research on contemporary immigration to the United States.

This course complicates the biomedical model of health and illness by exploring the social, cultural, economic, and political factors that shape medical research, clinical practice, and the structure of the healthcare delivery system. Focusing primarily on the American context, students will investigate how disease labels interact with social non-conformities, how medical diagnoses can serve as forms of social control, and how healthcare inequalities emerge. Students will also learn about resistance to stigma and medicalization, as well as the relationship between experiences of illness and new technologies, such as gene sequencing and the Internet.

This course investigates the relationship(s) between law and society, with a focus on the American civil legal system's historical and current role in inequality, social problems, and social disputes. We will examine the ways in which individuals and groups are oriented towards and mobilize the law within the constraints of the legal system and everyday life. We will ask: What are the roots of equality as the basis for addressing social discrepancies? What are the consequences of equality and rights forming the foundation for claims and cases in the American legal system? How do the overlaps of the criminal justice system, civil law, and everyday understandings of legality create or deny legal outcomes? What have the legal claims made by historical and current social movements brought into the picture and what has been left out of frame?

The Age of Empire has bequeathed us a wealth of literary texts, from adventure tales to more serious novels about colonial encounters and life in the colonies. Colonialism also introduced the novel as a new literary genre to many literatures in Asia. Over the past decades literary critics, theorists, historians and philosophers have examined the interdependence of imperialism/colonialism and literature from many perspectives, notably in what is generally referred to as postcolonial theory. The present course provides a first introduction to to colonial writing and theoretical approaches to literary practices under colonialism, to its key thinkers, concepts and methods by examining what Empire was in the case of British India and the Dutch East Indies (today's Indonesia) and by reading English and Dutch novels together with the work of Asian writers (Forster, Rajam Aiyar, Couperus, Abdoel Moeis). We will explore key terms, such as otherness, hybridity, agency, modernity, nationalism"" as well as larger themes, such as empire and gender and sexuality or colonial knowledge formation. - Of interest to students of literature, history, anthropology and other disciplines dealing with 'texts'.

The Indian subcontinent was home to some of the most vibrant literary traditions in world history. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the main trends in the premodern (/pre-nineteenth century) literatures of South Asia through a selection of poetic and theoretical texts translated from a variety of languages. We will discuss issues of literary historiography, the relations between orality and writing, literary and visual representations, poetry and music. Over two quarters, we will review the basic principles of Sanskrit, Dravidian, and Perso-Arabic poetics through a selection of representative theoretical treatises and poems. We will also explore the linguistic ecology of the Subcontinent, the formation of vernacular literary traditions, multilingual literacy, and the role of literature in social interactions and community building in premodern South Asia. Every week the first class will be devoted to the historical context and conceptual background of the texts we will read in the following class. Attention will be given to the original languages in which those texts were composed as well as the modes of performance of the poems and songs we will read together. Instructor(s): Thibaut d'Hubert Terms Offered: Autumn Prerequisite(s): The course is the perfect complement to the Introduction to South Asian Civilizations sequence (SALC 20100-20200). Beyond its focus on South Asia, students interested in classics, poetics, rhetoric, musicology, theater studies, and comparative literature will find plenty of food for thought in the readings, lectures, and class discussions. For students interested in languages, it is an ideal way to have a lively introduction to the linguistic variety of South Asia. No prior knowledge of South Asian languages is required. Note(s): One session titled “Poetry Carved in Stones” will bring us to the Art Institute to study the relation between poetic and visual representations of gods and episodes drawn from the rich narrative tradition of South Asia.

3165,UniOfChicago,SALC 23103. Problems In the Study of Gender. 100 Units. ,"The notion of differential citizenship is a topic that exercises scholars the world over. In particular, those interested in issues of feminism and ethnicity have studied why women (and then some women more than others) or particular social groups experience disenfranchisement more than their counterparts. This is so even when officially many cultures grant them formal equality before the law. This course explores issues of disenfranchisement, inequality, and violence through a focus on South Asia. We will begin with a set of theoretical readings mainly John Locke and John Stuart Mill whose works demonstrate some early strands of thinking about the political and cultural role (or the lack thereof) of women within the (fraternal) social contract. We will then move to contemporary works such as Joan Scott's Only Paradoxes to Offer (selections), Parite: Sexual Equality and the Crisis of French Universalism (selections), Leila Ahmed's A Quiet Revolution (selections), Amy Dru Stanley's From Bondage to Contract (selections) to frame the issue of differential citizenship and inequality in a historical and global context. Following this we turn to South Asia with a particular focus on gender and caste inequality and the violence unleashed by majoritarian politics (both overt and covert). Instructor(s): R.

We will look into the formation and peculiarities of its different branches such as the schools of Vaishnavism and Saivism, and learn about some of its central figures such as Shankara, Ramanuja and Chaitanya. Significant part of the course will be dedicated to the attempts to define and redefine Hinduism and its unity in the context of modernity, the encounter with colonialism and the course of globalization. We will explore some of its fundamental tensions, for instance between religion and liberation (dharma and moksha), social restrictions and freedom, knowledge and devotion.

","This course aims to provide students an overview of key environmental and ecological issues in the Indian subcontinent. How have the unique precolonial, colonial, regional and national histories of this region shaped the peculiar nature of environmental issues? We will consider three major concepts-extinction, disaster and dystopia to see how they can be used to frame issues of environmental and ecological concern. Each concept will act as a framing device for issues such as conservation and preservation of wildlife, erasure of adivasi (first dwellers) ways of life, environmental justice, water scarcity and climate change. The course will aim to develop students' ability to assess the specificity of these concepts in different disciplines. For example: What methods and sources will an environmental historian use to write about wildlife? How does this differ from the approach an ecologist or literary writer might take? Students will analyze various media: both literary and visual, such as autobiographies of shikaris (hunters), graphic novels, photographs, documentary films, ethnographic accounts and environmental history.

Popular images drawn from colonial-era representations continue to define our understanding of this complex institution. In this course we will work to complicate this understanding through considering the harem as a site of interplay between gender, family ties, and power. Taking into account influences from the larger Islamicate world as well as more local, Indic practices, we will historicize the harem, tracking its changes over the course of this long period, and critiquing its various (mis)representations. We will explore how the harem constituted a diverse space including not only elite women and their male relatives, but also other figures such as slave girls, eunuchs and guards. We will furthermore look at how this space was transformed in the era of European expansionism and colonial rule in the subcontinent, becoming a flash point over questions of social reform and Indian nationalism. Materials will include not just secondary literature but also excerpts from contemporary historical accounts, paintings, short stories, photographs, and films.

It is also a course on the representation of that transition. The Mughal Empire-which had been the dominant power in India for nearly two hundred years-underwent a process of decentralization in the early eighteenth century. The ensuing years saw the rise of regional powers across much of the Indian subcontinent; some modeled their institutions of state on those of the weakened Mughal center, while others asserted their sovereignty by cultivating a distinctive identity. Although the British East India Company would gradually integrate these polities into its expanding network of political and economic interests, the memory of the once-grand Mughal Empire and its mighty regional heirs loomed large over the colonial experience and endures today.

These inequalities are often grounded in gender and sex but also result from a complex intersection of gender, sex, and other identities. Inequality is what produces the experience of differential citizenship, a topic that exercises scholars the world over. In particular, those interested in issues of feminism, community, and ethnicity have studied why women (some women more than others) or particular social groups such as gay or trans groups, experience disenfranchisement more than their counterparts, even when, officially, many cultures/ nation states grant their members/citizens formal legal equality. Many of the examples around which this course is framed emerge out of South Asia, but our analyses will be structured through an engagement with theoretical texts that address issues of gendered oppression and discrimination in other parts of the world. Readings will include historical, anthropological, literary texts. Key themes of the course include: debates on parite in France and differential citizenship for religious minorities in India; caste based violence in India studied comparatively with debates on violence against aboriginal in Australia and Canada; rape and human rights; the politics of homosexuality; violence around popular and high culture; the panic around family values.

Geographically we will cover Asia very broadly defined: from the Ottoman Empire in the west, through the Middle East and Central and South Asia, to Indonesia and Malaysia to the east. Individual classes will focus, for instance, on imperial connections, the emergence of pan-Islamism, Sufi networks, oceanic travel, subaltern social and political movements, and Cold War-era Muslim ideologues. The course will conclude with a look at the rise of more militant Islamic ideologies in recent years.

The aim of this upper-level undergraduate seminar is to examine the history of borders, borderlands, and frontiers as political and social concepts and as produced spaces. We will examine an array of case studies in addition to more theoretical scholarship that spans the disciplines of history, environmental studies, political science, anthropology, and geography. While using South Asia (itself a rather recently invented area) as the primary geographic and historical focus this course will not be bound exclusively to it. The first goal of the course is to explore the evolution of key concepts such as space, territory, frontier, and borders/borderlands. The second goal is to develop methods for analyzing subjects that are simultaneously physical spaces and political, social, and historical ideas. Finally, it seeks to introduce students to areas that often fall beyond the penumbra of historical surveys centered on the nation-state. No prior knowledge of South Asian history is assumed.

This course considers the modern history of ethnic, religious, and racial identities across South Asia with particular attention to their representation in literature and film. We will begin with the colonial-era ethnographic state and the development and reification of caste-, religion-, and race-based classifications. We will then shift to Independence, Partition, and South Asian diasporas. We will conclude with contemporary articulations of nationalism, with particular attention to the case of Kashmir. Throughout the course we will focus on the social and political means through which ethnic, racial, and other identity categories are constructed-including colonial re-articulations of caste and the creation of the so-called martial races.

Caught between middle-class conservatism and the urge for social reform, Hindi and Urdu writers addressed controversial issues such as female education, child marriage, widow remarriage, and prostitution in their fictional and discursive writings.

Bombay/Mumbai: Urban Life/Urban Politics is an interdisciplinary course that will address these and several related issues. Using the city of Mumbai as its lens it introduces students to the ways in which urban subjects and urban life are constituted in a globalizing South Asia. The course explores the city of Mumbai through an urbanculturalist perspective and problematizes the ways in which the built environment of the city: its transportation, streets, slums, neighborhoods, tenements, markets, malls and businesses animate and are animated by the everyday life and politics in the metropolis. It encourages students to think about the ways in which Mumbai's past and present patterns of urban informality, capitalism, consumption, criminality and urban dislocations mediate very particular experiences of politics, sociality, class, gender and globalization.

What sense can we make of concepts such as the unmediated or immediate? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of metapictures or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become mixed in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality. Instructor(s): W. J. T.

","By cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible band called film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to new media and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels and reassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the most radical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between the OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving image for more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologies to explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrial forces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use new computer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developed for and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching, analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless of previous programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture.

In cultural, political, and educational spheres, disabilities are non-normative, marginal, even invisible. This runs counter to many of our lived experiences of difference where, in fact, disabilities of all kinds are the new normal. In this interdisciplinary course, we center both the category and experience of disability. Moreover, we consider the stakes of explicitly designing for different kinds of bodies and minds. Rather than approaching disability as a problem to be accommodated, we consider the affordances that disability offers for design. This course begins by situating us in the growing discipline of Disability Studies and the activist (and intersectional) Disability Justice movement. We then move to four two-week units in specific areas where disability meets design: architecture, infrastructure, and public space; education and the classroom; economics, employment, and public policy; and aesthetics. Traversing from architecture to art, and from education to economic policy, this course asks how we can design for access. Instructor(s): M. Friedner, J.

We ask whether all knowledge is relative, and if so, to what? When things are structured differently, does that mean that knowledge is lost? Or are there several diverse ways of structuring knowledge, each of which may be viable? We read a wide range of classical and modern thinkers in various disciplines. Instructor(s): W.

Yet when these connections are absent or disrupted, our minds and biology are likewise disrupted. Epidemiological studies have now clearly established a relationship between social isolation and both mental and physical health.

The Social Brain: Social Isolation and Loneliness. 100 Units. ,"The past two decades have witnessed a remarkable rise in the number of investigations published on the social brain. The discoveries conveyed by the titles of many of these reports (e.g., the neural basis of love, altruism, morality, generosity, trust) have piqued the interest of young investigators, funding agencies, the media, and laypeople alike. Such attention is a double-edged sword, however, as errors are exaggerated in importance, and oversimplifications create false expectations and, ultimately, disillusionment in what the field can contribute. It is, of course, one thing to assume that neural processes underlie all psychological phenomenon, it is another to claim that a given brain region is the biological instantiation of complex psychological functions like the self, empathy or loneliness. The purpose of this course is to examine opportunities and challenges in this field primarily through research on two of the most important topics in the field: social isolation and empathy.

The Affect System. 100 Units. ,"The term affect typically refers to feelings beyond those of the traditional senses, with an emphasis on the experience of emotions and variations in hedonic tone. The structure and processes underlying mental contents are not readily apparent, however, and most cognitive processes occur unconsciously with only selected outcomes reaching awareness. Over millions of years of evolution, efficient and manifold mechanisms have evolved for differentiating hostile from hospitable stimuli and for organizing adaptive responses to these stimuli. These are critically important functions for the evolution of mammals, and the integrated set of mechanisms that serve these functions can be thought of as an affect system. It is this affect system-its architecture and operating characteristics, as viewed from neural, psychological, social, and political perspectives-that is the focus of the course. Instructor(s): J.

Understanding Wisdom. 100 Units. ,"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It's often used with a meaning more akin to smart or clever. Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom-how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

We divide the topic this way to emphasize the different dimensions of cinematic address to questions of mental illness, and the ways that film genres imply distinct formal and epistemological conventions for the representation of insanity. Documentary ranges from instructional and neutral reportage, to polemical, essayistic interventions in the politics of psychiatry and the asylum, the actual conditions of mental illness in real historical moments. Documentary also includes the tendency in new media for the mad to represent themselves in a variety of media. With experimental film, our aim will be to explore the ways that the cinematic medium can simulate experiences of mania, delirium, hallucination, obsession, depression, etc., inserting the spectator into the subject position of madness. We will explore the ways that film techniques such as shot-matching, voice-over, montage, and special effects of audio-visual manipulation function to convey dream sequences, altered states of consciousness, ideational or perceptual paradoxes, and extreme emotional states. Finally, narrative film we think of as potentially synthesizing these two strands of cinematic practice, weaving representations of actual, possible, or probable situations with the special effects of mad subjectivity.

This course examines four case studies of conquerors who attained sovereign power in times of war (conquest, civil war, revolution), who had a foundational role in empire-building, and who consciously strove to link themselves to the divine and transcendent. Their immense but ambiguous legacies persist to this day. Although each is distinct as a historical individual, taken together they merge to form a paradigm of the exceptional leader of epic proportions. Each models himself on exemplary predecessors: each invokes and reinvents myths of origin and projects himself as a model for the future. Basic themes entail mythic history, empire, the exceptional figure, modernity's fascination with antiquity, and the paradox of the imitability of the inimitable. Instructor(s): M. Lowrie, R.

In Euro-American civilization, the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment championed the powers of human reason against religion and superstition to achieve scientific progress. Buddhism in the nineteenth century was represented by the heirs of Enlightenment as a religion for the Enlightenment to the point of not being a religion at all. Both traditions offer pathways to freedom (or liberation?) that draw on our rational capabilities, and both sponsor the production of knowledge that re-visions our place in the world. But they seem to be opposed: how could reason reject religious beliefs but also take part in religious traditions that aim to bring certain kinds of persons into being? We compare the mental models, discourses, methods of analysis, world-images, and practices of these traditions of enlightenment to assess the kinds of disciplines that their theoreticians and practitioners acquire and use.

3429,UniOfChicago,BPRO 28500. Sex and Ethics. 100 Units. ,"Sex is a big problem. How do we think about sex in proximity to considering the ethics of risk, harm, and the potential for good? Developing an account specifically of an ethics of sex requires thinking about the place of sex and sexual vulnerability in social life with an eye toward understanding what's good and what might count as abuses, violations, disruptions, or deprivations of specifically good things about sex. In popular discussion, for example, consent often demarcates ethically good sex from bad sex. This course inquires whether consent is an adequate metric for sexual ethics; if it is necessary or sufficient; if certain factors (e.g., age, gender, violence) vitiate its normative force; and whether its legal definition conflicts, coheres with, or contributes to its general cultural reception. These issues require us to think about the ways people do, do not, and cannot know what they're doing in sex, and complicate the aspiration to have an ethics in proximity to sex. This year's version of the course focuses on political theory/policy/popular scandal in relation to aesthetics and sex theory archives. We talk about sex in proximity to modes of comportment in love, scandal, prostitution, stranger intimacy, political freedom and discipline, impersonality, and experimentality. Instructor(s): L.

Christian Traditions and Medicine in the Late Modern World. 100 Units. ,"The course rests on the assumption that contemporary challenges in medicine stem from a moral pluralism reflecting the cultural conditions of late modernity, as well as from a growing inability to maintain clinical excellence in an increasingly complex and bureaucratic health care system. Throughout American history, Christians have often worked toward cultural change in various vocational spheres in order to align their practices in the world toward a religious and spiritual ideal. This course will explore a theological foundation for a different paradigm of active cultural engagement in medicine and bioethics. First, students will examine traditional Christian accounts both of medicine and of moral formation, to consider how they might inform answer to the question, How does one become (and remain) a good physician? Students will study sacred texts, traditions, and practices of Christianity to search for moral, spiritual, conceptual and practical resources within the tradition that physicians might draw upon to recover ways of practicing medicine as a vocation, as a sacred calling. Second, students will examine the empirical literature from vocational psychology on work motivation, focusing particularly on the construct of calling and its application to the pursuit of clinical excellence in medicine. Third, students will also examine recent research in the field of moral psychology that is shaping contemporary views regarding moral and professional formation and identity. Lastly, after surveying the contemporary challenges in medicine through the above interdisciplinary analyses, students will explore various Christian theological perspectives that attempt to re-imagine what faithful presence might entail in the current vocational sphere of medicine. Students will explore the diverse theological perspectives of Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy and bring them to bear on the following questions: What religious and spiritual resources does their Christian tradition bring to bear on the challenges and opportunities in the vocational sphere of medicine and bioethics? What would it mean to exhibit a faithful presence in medicine? What it might mean for the institutions that shape medicine to truly enhance the communities in which they live?""

Students will engage relevant literature from across these disciplines to address issues regarding the legitimate goals of medicine, medical professionalism, the doctor-patient relationship, vocation and calling, the role of religion in medicine, and character development in medical education. The course will first introduce the challenges that moral pluralism in contemporary society presents to the profession of medicine along with the subsequent calls for a renewed pursuit of clinical excellence in today's complex health care system.

Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals-personalizing medicine. The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted.

Natural philosophers and later scientists who wished to make arguments concerning nature's deep past and hidden or obscured processes (such as the long-term transformations of stars, strata, and organic species) faced an essential problem: the power of observation and experiment was limited. Our class will interrogate this problem, and examine the way in which the development of evolutionary thought prior to Darwin was intimately connected to contentious debates regarding speculation and scientific method. We will conclude by contemplating the ways in which the ideas and challenges raised by transformism and evolution influenced the reception of Darwin's work, and the way in which these ideas and challenges remain embedded within seemingly disparate fields of study today.
