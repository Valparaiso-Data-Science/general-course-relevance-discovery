0,Smith,"FRN 262 After Algeria: Revolution, Republic and Race in Modern France ","From the colonial conquest in the early 19th century through independence in 1962, Algeria has evoked passions on both sides of the Mediterranean Sea, passions frequently resulting in violence that has not entirely subsided. Through a variety of perspectives and readings, we explore a post-Algerian French society that appears to be permanently marked by its Algerian experience. To what extent has the experience in and of Algeria transformed contemporary French culture? In what ways can one speak of the Algerian experience in revolutionary terms?

1,Smith,FYS 165 Childhood in African Literature ,"A study of childhood as an experience in the present and as a transition into adulthood, and of the ways in which it is intimately tied to social, political and cultural histories, and to questions of self and national identity. How does the violence of colonialism and decolonization reframe our understanding of childhood innocence? How do African childhood narratives represent such crises as cultural alienation, loss of language, exile and memory? How do competing national and cultural ideologies shape narratives of childhood? Texts include Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions, Zoë Wicomb’s You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiongo’s Weep Not Child and Tahar Ben Jelloun’s The Sand Child.

"
3,Smith,HST 234 (C) Global Africa ,"This course interrogates how scholars have engaged the ""transnational"" and ""global"" in African history. In doing so, the course explores the complex networks of identities, loyalties, and attachments forged by diverse groups of African peoples in their attempts to live within and transcend the boundaries of the modern nation-state. As a result, over the course of the semester, the class will investigate issues of trade, nationality, citizenship, race, and identity as it queries the many ways in which Africans have shaped (and reshaped) their views of themselves and communities over seemingly vast distances in time and space. {H} Credits: 4 "
4,Smith,HST 257 (L) Early African History ,"This course is a general, introductory survey of African history prior to colonial rule.

9,Smith,GOV 257 Colloquium: Refugee Politics ,"This course examines refugees—i.e., people displaced within their country, to another country or, perhaps, somewhere “in between.” Refugee politics prompt a consideration of the cause of refugee movements; persecution, flight, asylum and resettlement dynamics; the international response to humanitarian crises; and the “position” of refugees in the international system. In addition to international relations theory, the seminar focuses on historical studies, international law, comparative politics, refugee policy studies and anthropological approaches to displacement and “foreignness.” Although special attention is devoted to the Middle East, other cases of refugee politics are examined.

17,Smith,AFR 218 History of Southern Africa (1600 to about 1900) ,"The history of Southern Africa, which includes a number of states such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Lesotho, is very complex. In addition to developing an historical understanding of the Khoisan and Bantu-speaking peoples, students must also know the history of Europeans and Asians of the region. The focus of this course is to understand the historical, cultural and economic inter-relationships between various ethnic groups, cultures and political forces which have evolved in Southern Africa since about 1600. "
18,Smith,AFR 242 Death and Dying in Black Culture ,"What does death and dying mean in black culture, given the evidentiary history of black death, even the ways that blackness—as an idea—signifies death? Using a cultural studies perspective, this course looks at the distinction between and representational meanings of death and dying in black culture.

Not open to first-year students. Credits: 4 "
19,Smith,AFR 243 Black Activist Autobiography ,"From the publication of “slave narratives” in the 18th century to the present, African Americans have used first-person narratives to tell their personal story and to testify about the structures of social, political and economic inequality faced by black people. These autobiographical accounts provide rich portraits of individual experience at a specific time and place as well as insights into the larger socio-historical context in which the authors lived. This course focuses on the autobiographies of activist women. In addition to analyzing texts and their contexts, we reflect on and document how our own life history is shaped by race. Writers and subjects include Sojourner Truth, Zora Neale Hurston, Angela Davis, Harriet Jacobs and Audre Lorde among others. {L} Credits: 4 "

23,Smith,"AFR 289 (C) Race, Feminism and Resistance in Movements for Social Change ","This interdisciplinary colloquial course explores the historical and theoretical perspectives of African American women from the time of slavery to the post-civil rights era. A central concern of the course is the examination of how black women shaped and were shaped by the intersectionality of race, gender and sexuality in American culture. Not open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 25. {H} Credits: 4 "
24,Smith,AFR 335 Seminar: Free Blacks in the U.S. Before 1865 ,"A study of the history of free blacks from the 17th century to the abolition of slavery in 1865. A major problem created by the establishment of slavery based on race by the 1660s was what was to be the status of free blacks. Each local and state government addressed the political, economic, and even religious questions raised by having free blacks in a slave society. This course addresses a neglected theme in the history of the Afro-American experience—that is, the history of free blacks before the passage of the 13th amendment. Recommended background: AFR 117. {H} Credits: 4 "
25,Smith,AFR 360 Seminar: Toni Morrison ,"Same as ENG 323. This seminar focuses on Toni Morrison’s literary production.

26,Smith,AFR 370 Seminar: Modern Southern Africa ,In 1994 South Africa underwent a “peaceful revolution” with the election of Nelson Mandela. This course studies the historical events that led to this dramatic development in South Africa from 1948–2000. {H} {S} Credits: 4 
27,Smith,CLT 205 20th-Century Literatures of Africa ,"A study of the major writers and diverse literary traditions of modern Africa with emphasis on the historical, political and cultural contexts of the emergence of writing, reception and consumption. We pay particular attention to several questions: in what contexts did modern African literature emerge? Is the term “African literature” a useful category? How do African writers challenge Western representations of Africa? How do they articulate the crisis of independence and postcoloniality? How do women writers reshape our understanding of gender and the politics of resistance? Writers include Chinua Achebe, Ngu˜gı˜ wa Thiong’o, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele and Ama Ata Aidoo.

28,Smith,"ENG 222 Spirometers, Speculums and the Scales of Justice: Medicine and Law in 19th-Century African Diasporic Literature ","During a time of rapid professionalization, medicine and law profoundly influenced New World ideas about what it means to be a human, a person, and a citizen, and how such definitions determined the rights of people of African descent. This course surveys 19th-century African diasporic authors’ and orators’ engagements with medical and legal theories on issues of slavery, emigration, crime and revolution. Supplementing our readings of slave literature, crime narratives, emigration writings, poetry and fiction, we study contemporary and current theories of race and racial science, the human, non-human, and post-human, environmentalism, colonization, pain, disability, gender, sexuality and legal personhood. Our literary travels take us from colonial West Indies, Jamaica, and the antebellum U.S. to colonial Canada, Cuba and the Bahamas. "
29,Smith,ENG 241 The Empire Writes Back: Postcolonial Literature ,"An introduction to Anglophone fiction, poetry, drama and film from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia in the aftermath of the British empire. Concerns include: the cultural and political work of writers as they respond to histories of colonial and racial dominance; their ambivalence towards English linguistic, literary and cultural legacies; the ways literature can (re)construct national identities and histories, and explore assumptions of race, gender, class and sexuality; the distinctiveness of women writers and their modes of contesting cultural and colonial ideologies; global diasporas, migration and "
30,Smith,FRN 290 The Colonial City: Global Perspectives ,"Same as ARH 258. This class examines the architectural history of French colonialism from a global historical perspective. French colonialism marked the longest episode of French interaction with the non-European world. This class encourages a broader understanding of its architectural impact through approaching the buildings, towns and cities that emerged during French imperialism. We engage colonial iterations of “high style,” or official, governmental architecture, in addition to examining vernacular forms engendered because of the blending of building traditions. We consider sites in Africa, North America, the Caribbean, Asia and the Indian Ocean. We think through the social and economic factors that caused architectural and urban typologies to display marked continuities despite geographical distinctions. (E) "
31,Smith,FYS 148 Migration Stories: Border-Crossing and Becoming in African-American Literature ,"This course explores how histories of migration have shaped the formation of black cultures and identities. African American culture and identities have always been produced in the crucible of migration, both forced and voluntary. Black people and black cultures have always been on the move and have always been in the process of formation and reformation. African peoples arrived in the “New World” as captives of the transatlantic slave trade. This historical event was devastating, yet it was also an occasion for new cultures and identities to be formed. Migration has compelled black peoples to refashion themselves, transform their environments and make their mark on the art and cultures of their new societies. Among the topics covered are: the transatlantic and domestic slave trades, fugitivity, the Great Migration from the South, the post–Civil Rights era “reverse migration,” and more recent immigrations by people from the Caribbean and Africa. We use literature, history, music and film to ask how these stories help us understand the intricacies of this rich history. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. Credits: 4 "
32,Smith,FYS 182 Fighting the Power: Black Protest and Politics Since 1970 ,"This seminar examines the various forms of black “politics,” broadly conceived, that emerged and developed in the wake of the modern civil rights movement to the present time. Major topics of concern include: black nationalism and electoral politics, black feminism, resistance to mass incarceration, the war on drugs, black urban poverty, the rise of the black middle class, reparations, the Obama presidency, Black Lives Matter and other contemporary social movements. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 "
33,Smith,HST 258 (L) Modern Africa ,"This course provides an introductory survey of African history under colonial rule and beyond. In doing so, the course offers students a framework for understanding the political, social and economic history of modern Africa by foregrounding the strategies African peoples employed as they made sense of and confronted their changing historical landscapes. Key subjects include the construction of the colonial state, African experiences with colonial rule, the dilemmas of decolonization and life in an independent Africa. {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
34,Smith,"HST 265 (L) Citizenship in the United States, 1776–1861 ","Analysis of the historical realities, social movements, cultural expression and political debates that shaped U.S. citizenship from the Declaration of Independence to the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. From the hope of liberty and equality to the exclusion of marginalized groups that made whiteness, maleness and native birth synonymous with Americanness. How African Americans, Native Americans, immigrants and women harnessed the Declaration of Independence and its ideology to define themselves as citizens of the United States. {H} Credits: 4 "
35,Smith,HST 266 (L) Emancipation and the Afterlife of Slavery ,"Examines the longevity of the U.S. Civil War in historical memory, as a pivotal period in the development of American racism and African American activism. Explores cutting-edge histories, primary source materials, documentaries, popular films, and visual and political culture. Explores the Civil War as a mass slave insurrection and studies the myriad meanings of Emancipation. Looks at the impact of slavery on race and racism on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. {H} Credits: 4 "
36,Smith,"IDP 102 Race and Its Intersections With Class, Gender and Sexuality ","This course offers an interdisciplinary, critical examination of race largely in the context of the United States. Although race is no longer held by scientists to have any essential biological reality, it has obviously played a central role in the formation of legal codes (from segregation to affirmative action), definitions of citizenship, economics (from slavery to discriminatory loan arrangements), culture (dance, fashion, literature, music, sport) and identities. Where did the concept of race come from? How has it changed over time and across space? What pressures does it continue to exert on our lives? How does it intersect with gender, sexuality, social class, religion and abilities? By bringing together faculty from a variety of programs and disciplines—and by looking at a range of cultural texts, social studies and historical events where racial distinctions and identities have been deployed, constructed and contested—we hope to give the students an understanding of how and why race matters. This course meets for 10 sessions, beginning in the second week of the semester and ending on the penultimate week. (E) Credits: 2 "
37,Smith,PHI 215 African American Philosophy ,"This course explores debates about race, racism, moral status and identity in recent and contemporary American philosophy.

38,Smith,SOC 214 Sociology of Hispanic Caribbean Communities in the United States ,"This community-based learning course surveys social science research, literary texts and film media on Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican communities in the United States. Historic and contemporary causes and contexts of (im) migration, settlement patterns, labor market experiences, demographic profiles, identity formations and cultural expressions are considered. Special attention is paid to both inter- and intra-group diversity, particularly along the lines of race, gender, sexuality and class. Students are required to dedicate four (4) hours per week to a local community-based organization. In addition, students are required to enroll in SOC309 (Thursdays 7 to 9:30).

40,Smith,SWG 204 This Bridge Called My Back: Women of Color Cultural Production ,"This course examines personal narrative, literature, visual art and performance created by women of color in North America to understand ideas of identity, belonging and difference. We study the formation of women of color feminism from the 1970’s to the present through an interpretation of cultural forms, looking specifically at categories of race, indigeneity, gender, sexuality and class. We analyze how women of color authors and artists articulate frameworks of intersectionality, hybridity, coalition and liberation. Students write both a personal narrative essay and an analytical essay and have the option of completing a creative project. Prerequisite SWG 150 or permission of the instructor. {A} {L} Credits: 4 "
41,Smith,THE 221 Rehearsing the Impossible: Black Women Playwrights Interrupting the Master Narrative ,"Building on the legacy of Alice Childress, Lorraine Hansberry, Adrienne Kennedy and Ntozake Shange, this course explores the work of Pearl Cleage, Lynne Nottage, Suzan Lori Parks, Anne D. Smith and other playwrights who from the 1950s to the present go about reinventing the narrative of America. We consider their theatrical/artistic production in the context of black feminism. As artists, audiences and critics grapple with the enduring legacy of minstrel storytelling in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, what were/are the particular artistic and intellectual challenges for these theatre artists? What are/were their strategies, missteps, triumphs? {A} {H} {L} Credits: 4 "
42,Smith,"THE 319 Shamans, Shapeshifters and the Magic If ","To act, to perform is to speculate with your body. Theatre is a transformative experience that takes performer and audience on an extensive journey in the playground of the imagination beyond the mundane world. Theatre asks us to be other than ourselves. We can for a time inhabit someone else’s skin, be shaped by another gender or ethnicity, become part of a past epoch or an alternative time and space similar to our own time but that has yet to come. As we enter this “imagined” world we investigate the normative principles of our current world. This course investigates the counterfactual, speculative, subjunctive impulse in overtly speculative drama and film with a particular focus on race and gender. We examine an international range of plays by such authors as Caryl Churchill, Tess Onwueme, Dael Orlandersmith, Derek Walcott, Bertolt Brecht, Lorraine Hansberry, Craig Lucas and Doug Wright, as well as films such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; Pan’s Labyrinth; Children of Men; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; X-Men; Contact and Brother From Another Planet.

43,Smith,AMS 201 Introduction to the Study of American Society and Culture ,"An introduction to the methods and concerns of American studies. We draw on literature, painting, architecture, landscape design, social and cultural criticism, and popular culture to explore such topics as responses to economic change, ideas of nature and culture, America’s relationship to Europe, the question of race, the roles of women, family structure, social class and urban experience. "
44,Smith,AMS 202 Methods in American Studies ,"What do Americans want? What do they fear? What is an “American”? How do we draw the line between those who belong and those who do not? How do we define citizenship, its rights and responsibilities? How do race, gender, class and other differences affect the drawing of these boundaries, and the contents of consciousness? This course introduces some of the exciting and innovative approaches to cultural analysis that have emerged over the last three decades. Students apply these methods to a variety of texts and practices (stories, movies, television shows, music, advertisements, clothes, buildings, laws, markets, bodies) in an effort to acquire the tools to become skillful readers of American culture, and to become more critical and aware as scholars and citizens. "
45,Smith,"AMS 225 Corporate Capitalism, Media and Protest in America ","The U.S. Constitution recognizes a free press as the lifeblood of democracy with a mandate to inform citizens and hold the powerful accountable. But there is widespread distrust of the media in American society today. This course analyzes the transformation of the press into a corporate enterprise over the past 150 years, and the opposition this has provoked. Examining key developments (the creation of multinational media conglomerates as well as new digital media alternatives) and focusing on case studies such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the 2016 Elections, we examine the influence of the media on American political, economic, and cultural life. {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
46,Smith,AMS 227 Trade and Theft in Early America ,"A seventeenth-century engraving imagines an encounter between two men wearing feathers and holding onto the same string of shells: depending on your perspective, this image looks like a scene of trade or one of theft at knife-point. In understanding moments from the past, representation and perspective shape not just interpretation, but sources themselves. Seeing moments as both trade and theft opens them to tellings and analyses from multiple perspectives, exposing overlooked elements and revealing the ways in which histories are made. This course introduces students to Early American history (c 1500–1800) through the themes of trade, theft, representation, and perspective. (E) "
47,Smith,AMS 229 Native New England ,"In this course we interrogate the space now known as “New England” by learning about it as a land with histories, peoples and life ways that predate and exceed the former English colonies and current United States. We devote our semester to studying the cultural distinctiveness of the Native peoples of New England—for example, the Mohawk, Mohegan, Abenaki, Wampanoag and Schaghticoke peoples—and to understanding the historical processes of encounter, adaptation, resistance and renewal that have characterized Native life in the area for centuries. We explore histories of the pre- and post- “contact” period through the perspectives of various Native communities, and discuss the legacies of these histories for Native New England today. {H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 "
48,Smith,AMS 230 Colloquium: The Asian/Pacific/American Experience ,"This course is open to anyone particularly interested in learning about Asian/ Pacific/American (A/P/A) history. The objective of the course is two-fold. The first is to provide the students with a fundamental understanding of A/P/A history that is inextricably linked to the goal of the United States to establish military, economic and cultural hegemony in the world as seen through its colonial and neo-colonial policies both in the U.S. and the Asian/Pacific region. The second is to introduce them to the various themes as well as methodological and theoretical frameworks used by scholars in the field of A/P/A Studies in order to encourage them to either work toward a Five College A/P/A Studies Certificate or pursue further studies in the field. {H} {L} Credits: 4 "
49,Smith,AMS 232 American Conservatism in the Age of Trump ,"This course surveys the recent history of political conservatism in the United States, with an emphasis on the present moment. Topics include the various ideological strains that inform American conservatism (traditionalism, Christian evangelicalism, neoliberalism, neoconservatism, reform conservatism, Alt-Right); affective styles and strategies that animate conservative politics; institutional networks that support conservative coalition-building and the propagation of conservative ideas (media, think tanks, PACs); the “tribal” polarization of the American political parties around issues such as race, gender, sexuality, climate change, and gun control. We will seek especially to analyze and interpret the election of Donald Trump as the nation’s 45th president. Enrollment limit of 25. (E) {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
50,Smith,AMS 235 American Popular Culture ,"This course offers an analytical history of American popular culture since 1865. We start from the premise that popular culture, far from being merely a frivolous or debased alternative to high culture, is an important site of popular expression, social instruction and cultural conflict. We examine theoretical texts that help us to “read” popular culture, even as we study specific artifacts from a variety of pop culture sources, from television shows to Hollywood movies, the pornography industry to spectator sports, and popular music to theme parks. We pay special attention to questions of desire, and to the ways popular culture has mediated and produced pleasure, disgust, fear and satisfaction. Alternating lecture/discussion format. Enrollment limited to 25. {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
51,Smith,AMS 236 Difference and the Digital Media ,"In this course, we will examine the ways that “difference”—race, gender, sexuality, disability, and class—is produced and reproduced in an era of digital media. Some questions to guide our inquiry include: How do digital technologies and digital media contribute to the intersectional production of gender, sexuality, disability, and race, particularly as these categories overlap with converged media, consumption, capital, labor, citizenship, participation, and surveillance? How are concepts of difference embodied in technology? In addition, we will trace how people use technology to resist and challenge racial, gender, and sexual norms. Enrollment limit of 20. (E) {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
52,Smith,AMS 240 Introduction to Disability Studies ,"This course serves as an introductory exploration of the field of disability studies. It asks: how do we define disability? Who is disabled? And what resources do we need to properly study disability? Together, students investigate: trends in disability activism, histories of medicine and science, conceptions of “normal” embodiment, the utility of terms like “crip” or “disabled” and the representation of disability in culture. Enrollment limit of 20. (E) {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
53,Smith,AMS 241 Disability in Popular Culture ,"From butt-kicking warriors like Imperator Furiosa, to state leaders like New York governor David Paterson and former president FDR, to ultra-glamorous models like Jillian Mercado and Nyle DiMarco, images of and persons with disabilities have shaped the discourse of American popular culture. Though popular literary genres have long framed disability as tragic or pitiable, disabled writers have successfully appropriated popular, commercial styles to leverage critiques against dominant conceptions of disability. The purpose of this course is to investigate what arguments these popular texts make, whether implicitly or explicitly, about disability. Enrollment limit of 20. (E) {H} {S} Credits: 4 "
54,Smith,AMS 253 Native Literacies to 1880 ,"This course explores the meaning and use of writing—in many forms— within Native communities in the Americas. We challenge the conventional understanding of writing by examining texts not usually considered as such— like hieroglyphic codices, wampum belts, khipu, and winter counts—alongside poetry, sermons, memoirs and treaties. To facilitate this work, the course is arranged thematically by tribe, technology, or text, rather than chronology, allowing us to deepen our knowledge about the peoples and histories concerned each week. In addition, we immerse ourselves in current-day debates over language study, textual recovery, cultural heritage and scholarly ethics.

309,Smith,CLS 190 The Trojan War ,"The Trojan War is the first conflict to be memorialized in Greco-Roman literature—“the war to start all wars.” For Homer and the poets who came after him it raised such questions as: What justifies going to war? What is the cost of combat and the price of glory? How does war affect men, women and children, winners and losers? We look at the “real” Troy of the archaeological record, then focus on imaginary Troy as represented by Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides, Virgil, Ovid and Seneca. WI {A} {L} Credits: 4 "
310,Smith,CLS 217 Greek Art and Archaeology ,"Same as ARH 217. This course is a contextual examination of the art and architecture of Ancient Greece, from the end of the Bronze Age through the domination of Greece by Rome (ca. 1100-168 BCE) and handles an array of settlements, cemeteries, and ritual sites. It tracks the development of the Greek city-state and the increasing power of the Greeks in the Mediterranean, culminating in the major diaspora of Greek culture accompanying the campaigns of Alexander the Great and his followers. The course takes a broadly chronological approach, and the question of a unified Greek culture is stressed. Continuing archaeological work is considered. (E) {A} {H} Credits: 4 "

What constituted a proper man and a proper woman in these ancient societies? Which sexual practices and objects of desire were socially sanctioned and which considered deviant? What ancient modes of thinking about these issues have persisted into the modern world? Attention to the status of women; the role of social class; the ways in which genre and convention shaped representation; the relationship between representation and reality. {H} {L} Credits: 4 "
313,Smith,CLS 237 Artifacts of Daily Life in the Ancient Mediterranean ,"This course uses the artifacts of the Van Buren Antiquities Collection as a starting point for investigating the daily life of the Greek and Roman worlds. In particular, students will select and research an object or objects for which to develop an ""object biography,"" through which the people who produced, used, and re-used these objects might be accessed. Additional attention is given to the place of objects in archaeological practice and narratives. (E) "
314,Smith,CLS 238 The Age of Heroes: Archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age ,"For many of us, the Mediterranean Bronze Age is associated with mythological events like the Trojan War. But how did the people of the Bronze Age actually live? This course surveys the archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age, including Egypt and the Aegean, among others, from 3000 to 1100 BCE. We explore not only the pyramids and palaces of the period, but also the evidence for day-to-day living, from crafts production to religion. We also examine how these cultures interacted, and the Mediterranean networks that both allowed them to flourish and led to their collapse. {A} {H} Credits: 4 "
315,Smith,CLS 260 Transformations of a Text: Shape-Shifting and the Role of Translation ,"Whose work are you reading when you encounter a text in translation? How is the author’s voice modulated through the translator’s? What constitutes a “faithful” or a “good” translation? How do the translator’s language and culture, the expectations of the target audience, and the marketplace determine what gets translated and how? We consider different translations of the same text, including rogue translations, adaptations and translations into other forms (opera, musicals, film). Students produce their own translations or adaptations. No prerequisites, but students who have not taken CLT 150 are urged to enroll in that (2-credit, S/U) course concurrently. Credits: 4 "

317,Smith,CCX 120 Community-Based Learning: Ethics and Practice ,"Service learning, civic engagement, community-based research and community service have become familiar terms for describing forms of community-based learning (CBL) in higher education. Theorists and practitioners continue to debate how to bring community issues into the classroom and how best to bring students into the neighborhoods surrounding their colleges and universities. This course considers these issues through exposure to both the literature of community engagement and the experiences of those who practice its different forms. CCX 120 serves as a gateway course for the Community Engagement and Social Change concentration. As such, one of the primary purposes of the course is to give students exposure to the varied opportunities available at the college for engaging with communities. Specifically, the course focuses on volunteer opportunities, course-based engagement and examples of community-based research. Within and across these different approaches, we identify and explore the ethical issues that characterize community partnerships and the best practices that attempt to address these issues. Students also interact with peers, faculty, guest speakers, and community members who provide firsthand perspectives on the local practice of CBL and the critical needs in surrounding communities. S/U only. Credits: 2 "

Students are provided with readings, discussions, mentoring and other support to complete capstone projects. Enrollment limited to 15; priority is given to seniors and juniors. (E) Credits: 4 "
320,Smith,FYS 101 The Lives of Animals: Literature and the Nonhuman ,"In this course, we will track animals across a range of poems, stories, novels, essays, and films that try to imagine what it is like not to be human. From stories of people transforming into animals to texts that insist that we have no clue what animals really feel, we will consider the various ways that writers distinguish—or refuse to distinguish—humans from other animals. Why, we will ask, are literature and art so haunted by animal life? We will discuss zoos, pets, fables, cartoons, animal rights, vegetarianism, anthropocentrism, and extinction. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 "
321,Smith,RES 127 Manuscripts Don't Burn: Literature and Dissent Under Stalin ,"Explores how Russian literary culture responded to the tumult and upheaval of the twentieth century, an epoch encompassing the Bolshevik Revolution, two World Wars, the ascent of Stalin, and the decline and collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as unprecedented aesthetic innovations.

324,Smith,FYS 146 Can Women Have Adventures? ,We will examine contemporary girls’ adventure in novels and films. These fictions rework the classic patterns of “boys’ books” to create heroic girls meant to inspire young female readers. We begin with two classic 19th-century boys' books to situate our readings of contemporary girls’ adventures. We will focus on the structure of the girls’ adventure landscape by creating maps and writing blog posts for each fiction asking questions such as: What significant boundaries do the fictions imagine? What gender and class ideas do they enforce? How do boy and girl heroes differ? What does a girl hero do? Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 
325,Smith,"CLT 150 The Art of Translation: Poetics, Politics, Practice ","We hear and read translations all the time: on television news, in radio interviews, in movie subtitles, in international bestsellers. But translations don’t shift texts transparently from one language to another. Rather, they revise, censor and rewrite original works, to challenge the past and to speak to new readers. We explore translation in a range of contexts by hearing lectures by experts in the history, theory and practice of translation. Knowledge of a foreign language useful but not required. Graded S/U only. Can be taken concurrently with FRN 295 for 4 credits. {L} Credits: 2 "

We associate islands with adventure, wilderness, freedom, magic, dystopia and utopia. In the cultural imaginary, the island exists to be invented, discovered, and reinvented. We will consider a wide range of texts (and some films) from the isles of the Odyssey (home to seductive goddesses, a fairy-tale virgin princess, giant cannibals, and lotus addicts) to Prospero’s magic kingdom, Swift’s Lilliput, Peter Pan’s Neverland, Golding’s man-made dystopia (Lord of the Flies), Jean Rhys’s Jamaica (Wide Sargasso Sea), and Jamaica Kincaid’s Antigua (A Small Place).

What is its relation to other forms of short fiction—the Italian novella or the German novella or the fairy tale? Why are they often so elaborately framed, with their kernel presented as a kind of oral performance; a story told by one Character to another? Why do they so often rely on the fantastic and the unlikely—and how, by the End of the century, did the story come to concentrate instead on the mundane and the ordinary? What, in short, makes a tale worth telling? Readings in Goethe, Hoffman, Hawthorne, Gogol, Turgenev, Maupassant, Verga, Kipling, Chekhov, Jewett and others. {L} Credits: 4 "

593,Smith,ENG 220 The Voyage Within: The Novel in England from George Eliot to Virginia Woolf ,"What it would be like to hear the squirrel’s heartbeat, to open one’s mind fully to the sensations and impressions of the world around us? The image belongs to George Eliot, who in Middlemarch suggested we couldn’t bear it; we would die of a sensory overload, the “roar on the other side of silence.” The novelists of the generations that followed tried to live in that roar: to explore the stream of consciousness, to capture the way we make sense of experience and order out of our memory’s chaos. Readings in George Eliot, Henry James, Virginia Woolf and others. {L} Credits: 4 "
594,Smith,ENG 223 Contemporary American Gothic Literature ,"This course traces the emergence of a 21st-century gothic tradition in American writing through texts including novels, films and television shows. We analyze the shifting definitions and cultural work of the Gothic in contemporary American literature in the context of political and cultural events and movements and their relation to such concerns as race, gender, class, sexuality and disability. From the New Mexican desert to the rural south, from New York City, San Francisco and the suburbs of Atlanta to cyberspace, these literary encounters explore an expanse of physical, psychological, intellectual and imagined territory. {A} {L} Credits: 4 "
595,Smith,ENG 224 Frankenstein: The Making of a Monster ,"At the age of 19, Mary Shelley began writing the first science fiction novel. Frankenstein not only describes fears about monstrosity and accelerating technology; it also sets the stage for continuing discussions about gender, reproduction, race, ethics, and disability. To celebrate this groundbreaking novel’s 200th anniversary, this co-taught class will explore the making of the text, alongside its monstrous legacy in contemporary culture. We will look at the novel’s influences and afterlives – from the Frankenstein collection in Smith’s rare book room to a range of films, electronic novels, and comics that reveal the enduring role of gothic monstrosity today. Meets on alternating days at Smith and Amherst College. Enrollment limit of 36. (E) {L} Credits: 4 "
596,Smith,ENG 228 Children's Literature ,"Shapes speak to us. Prose shapes us. From the picture book to the chapter book, we will explore the ways in which literature for children invents the child reading that literature. And we will attempt to break through our natural nostalgia for works we know to rediscover their innovative and experimental nature. In so doing, we will see these works work their magic on themes that will become familiar throughout the semester: identity, nostalgia, interiors and exteriors, authority, independence and dependence and, of course, the nature of wild things. Works may include Peter Rabbit; Where the Wild Things Are; Winnie-the-Pooh; Alice in Wonderland; Peter Pan; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Secret Garden; The Giver. {L} Credits: 4 Gillian Murray Kendall "
597,Smith,"ENG 229 Turning Novels Into Films: Imperialism, Race, Gender and Cinematic Adaptation ","“Not as good as the book,” is a frequent response to film adaptations of novels. Adaptation studies, an interdisciplinary field that combines literary and film studies, rejects this notion of “fidelity” (how faithful a film is to its source) and instead reads literature and film as equal but different artistic and cultural forms, where the film may translate, transmute, critique, or re-interpret the novel. This course will look closely and analytically at some paired fiction and film adaptations that focus on issues of imperialism, race, class, and gender. We’ll begin with some classics (Austen’s Mansfield Park, Forster’s Passage to India), move to international postcolonial fiction and film (Tagore’s Home and the World, Ondaatje’s The English Patient), and end with U.S. texts about non-white, hyphenated citizens (Lahiri’s Namesake, Stockett’s The Help). We will also read some critical and theoretical essays to frame our key concepts and conversations. Prerequisites: At least one college level course in literature or film. "

Topics include the American dream and its discontents; immigrant fiction; literary multilingualism; ethnic satire and humor; crises of the left involving 60s radicalism and Black-Jewish relations; after-effects of the Holocaust. Must Jewish writing remain on the margins, too ethnic for the mainstream yet insufficiently multicultural for contemporary gatekeepers of diversity? No prerequisites. {H} {L} Credits: 4 "
599,Smith,"ENG 231 Inventing America: Nation, Race, Freedom ","This course will focus on the extraordinary burst of literary creativity that coincided with the emergence of a new American nation. From its conflicted founding episodes to the crisis of the Civil War, American writers interpreted and criticized American life with unmatched imaginative intensity and formal boldness, taking as their particular subject both the promise of freedom implicit in the nation's invention—and the betrayals of that promise: in the horrors of slavery, and in the subtler entrapments of orthodox thinking, constricted vision, a self-poisoning psyche, and a repressive or unjust social life. {L} Credits: 4 "
600,Smith,"ENG 232 London Fog: Victorian Secrets, Sensations and Subversions ","The deadly fog that hung over London throughout the 19th century was both a social reality and a pungent metaphor for a metropolis in which it seemed that almost anything could be hidden: secrets, crimes, identities. But sometimes the fog parts—and then comes scandal. We'll begin with Dickens' anatomy of the city in Bleak House; move on to sensation novels by Wilkie Collins and Mary Elizabeth Braddon, which contest and subvert the period's gender roles; look at murder with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Jekyll; urban bombings with Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent; and end with a neo-Victorian novel by Sarah Waters. "
601,Smith,"ENG 233 Re-forming America: Region, Race, and Empire ","Re-forming the nation after the Civil War was no easy feat. During the period between 1865 and 1914, how did regions recently at war with one another view America differently? How did people of different races, classes, genders, and other identities define their relationship to the nation? What role did empire-building, science, and industrialization play in the re-forming of America into the superpower that it would become in the twentieth century? This course engages American writers as they explore these and other questions of meaning, value, and power—with an emphasis on writers who shaped, critiqued, and stood apart from their rapidly changing society. {L} Credits: 4 "
602,Smith,ENG 236 African-American Literature 1900 to the Present ,"Same as AFR 175. A survey of the evolution of African-American literature during the 20th century. This class builds on the foundations established in AAS 170, Survey of Afro-American Literature 1746 to 1900. Writers include Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison and Paule Marshall. "
603,Smith,ENG 237 Environmental Poetry and Ecological Thought ,"This course considers how literature represents environmental change and crisis, and shapes our understanding of the natural world. How can poetry provide new ways for thinking through extinction, conservation, and environmental justice? We explore these issues by reading a selection of environmental poetry in conversation with key texts from the environmental humanities. Central to the discussions: the sublime and the aesthetics of landscape and wilderness; garbage and the poetics of waste; the ethics of representing animal and plant life; the relation between landscape, labor, and power; and how ecopoetry intervenes in debates about climate change. {L} Credits: 4 "
604,Smith,ENG 238 What Jane Austen Read: The 18th-Century Novel ,A study of novels written in England from Aphra Behn to Jane Austen and Walter Scott (1688–1814). Emphasis on the novelists’ narrative models and choices; we conclude by reading several novels by Austen—including one she wrote when 13 years old. {L} Credits: 4 
605,Smith,ENG 239 American Journeys ,"A study of American narratives, from a variety of ethnic traditions and historical eras, that explore the forms of movement—immigration, migration, boundary crossing—so characteristic of American life. Emphasis on each author’s treatment of the complex encounter between new or marginalized Americans and an established culture, and on definitions or interrogations of what it might mean to be or become “American.” {L} Credits: 4 "
606,Smith,"ENG 247 Race, Suburbia, and the post-1945 U.S. Novel ","This course aims to identify, analyze, and complicate the dominant narrative of U.S. suburbia vis-à-vis the postwar American novel. While the suburb may evoke a shared sense of tedium, U.S. fiction positions suburbia as ""contested terrain,"" a battleground staging many of the key social, cultural, and political shifts of our contemporary age. Reading novels and short stories by writers like Toni Morrison, Hisaye Yamamoto, John Updike, Chang-Rae Lee and Celeste Ng, we assess the narrative construction of the suburb as a bastion of white domesticity, as well as the disruption of this narrative through struggles for racial integration. Enrollment limit of 20. {L} Credits: 4 "
607,Smith,ENG 249 Literatures of the Black Atlantic ,"Visiting the pulpits, meeting houses and gallows of British North America to the colonial West Indies and docks of Liverpool to the modern day Caribbean, U.S., Canada, U.K. and France, this course analyzes the literatures of the Black Atlantic and the development of black literary and intellectual history from the 18th to the 21st century. Some key theoretical frameworks, which help inform our study of literature emerging from the Black Atlantic, include diaspora, transnationalism, internationalism and cosmopolitanism. Readings range from early African diasporic sermons, dying words, poetry, captivity and slave narratives to newspapers, essays, novels, drama and film. {L} Credits: 4 "
608,Smith,ENG 250 Chaucer's Canterbury Tales ,"A contextualized close reading of Geoffrey Chaucer’s ambitious and enduring literary project, The Canterbury Tales, with attention to language change, narrative technique, the representation of varied and distinctive medieval voices, and the poem as vivid introduction to life and thought in the later Middle Ages. Not open to first year-students. {L} Credits: 4 "
609,Smith,ENG 255 What Makes a Tale Worth Telling: Reading the 19th Century Story ,"Same as CLT 255. How did the modern short story emerge—why, where, when? What is its relation to other forms of short fiction—the Italian novella or the German novelle, or the fairy tale? Why are they often so elaborately framed, with their kernel presented as a kind of oral performance: a story told by one character to another? Why do they so often rely on the fantastic and the unlikely—and how, by the end of the century, did the story come to concentrate instead on the mundane and the ordinary? What, in short, makes a tale worth telling? Readings in Goethe, Hoffman, Hawthorne, Gogol, Turgenev, Maupassant, Verga, Kipling, Chekhov, Jewett, and others. {L} Credits: 4 "
610,Smith,ENG 256 Shakespeare ,"A Midsummer Night’s Dream, As You Like It, I Henry IV, Measure for Measure, King Lear, Macbeth, The Tempest, and Shakespeare's sonnets. Enrollment in each section limited to 25. Not open to first-year students. {L} Credits: 4 "

612,Smith,ENG 258 Colonialism and Postcolonialism in Modern Irish Literature ,"Irish writing in the 20th century (and beyond) has been indelibly formed by the experience of British colonialism on the island. We will examine a range of literary responses to this history, and to the experiences of civil war, independence, partition, and postcolonial status. Writers include Yeats, Joyce, O'Casey, Boland, O'Brien, Moxley, Heaney, and Friel. Prerequisite: a college-level course in literature. {L} Credits: 4 "
613,Smith,ENG 260 Milton ,"A study of the major poems and selected prose of John Milton, radical and conservative, heretic and defender of the faith, apologist for regicide and advocate of human dignity, committed revolutionary and Renaissance humanist, and a poet of enormous creative power and influence, whose epic, Paradise Lost, changed subsequent English Literature. Not open to first-year students. {L} Credits: 4 "
614,Smith,ENG 264 Faulkner ,"The sustained explosion of Faulkner’s work in the dozen-odd years between The Sound and the Fury and Go Down, Moses has no parallel in American literature. He explored the microtones of consciousness and conducted the most radical of experiments in narrative form. At the same time he relied more heavily on the spoken vernacular than anyone since Mark Twain, and he made his “little postage stamp of native soil” in northern Mississippi stand for the world itself. We read the great novels of his Yoknapatawpha cycle along with a selection of short stories, examining the linked and always problematic issues of race, region and remembrance in terms of the forms that he invented to deal with them. {L} Credits: 4 "
615,Smith,ENG 267 Asian American Literature ,"Although we sometimes think only of modern-day authors like Amy Tan or Jhumpa Lahiri when we think of Asian American literature, in fact Asian Americans have been writing and publishing in English since at least 1887. In this course, we read selected Asian American poetry, novels, short stories, plays and films produced from the late 19th century until the present. We consider how works engage with issues that have always concerned Asian Americans, like identity development and racism. Also, we pay attention to how works speak to concerns specific to their period, such as the exclusion acts of the 1880s, the proletarian movement of the 1930s, the decolonization of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries since the 1940s, and the increasing size and diversity of the Asian American population in the late 20th century. At all times, we attend closely to matters of language and form. {L} Credits: 4 "
616,Smith,ENG 271 Imagining Evil ,"Same as GER 271. This course explores how artists and thinkers over the centuries have grappled with the presence of evil —how to account for its perpetual recurrence, its ominous power, its mysterious allure. Standing at the junction of literature, philosopy, and religion, the notion of evil reveals much about the development of the autonomous individual, the intersection of morality, freedom and identity, and the confrontation of fantasy and history. Readings include literary works from Milton, Goethe, Blake, Kleist, E.T.A., Hoffmann, Tolkien, Le Guin; theoretical texts from Augustine, Luther, Nietzsche, Freud, Arendt. In English. {L} Credits: 4 "
617,Smith,ENG 273 Bloomsbury and Sexuality ,"Members of the Bloomsbury movement led non-normative (what many now call queer) lives. The complexity and openness of their relationships characterized not only the lives but also the major works of fiction, art, design, and critical writings its members produced. “Sex permeated our conversation,” Woolf recalls, and in Bloomsbury and Sexuality we’ll explore the far-reaching consequences of this ostensible removal of discursive, social, and sexual inhibition in the spheres of literature, art, and social sciences. The course will draw from the art of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, the writings of E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Radclyffe Hall, Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and others, along with contemporary queer theory. {L} Credits: 4 "
618,Smith,ENG 274 The Pleasures of Not Thinking: Romanticism and the Irrational ,"Romantic writers were obsessed with uncertainty, ignorance, and the irrational, unthinking mind. Concerned with the unusual ideas that surface when we are sleeping or spaced out, absorbed or intoxicated, Romanticism embraced reason’s alternatives: forgetting, fragmentation, stupidity, and spontaneous, uncontrollable emotion. From Wordsworth’s suggestion that children are wiser than adults to Keats’s claim that great writers are capable of remaining uncertain without reaching for fact or reason, Romantic poets and novelists suggested that we have something to learn from not thinking. We will read texts by Austen, Blake, Burke, Coleridge, Cowper, De Quincey, Freud, Kant, Keats, Locke, and Rousseau. {L} Credits: 4 "
619,Smith,"ENG 275 Witches, Witchcraft and Witch Hunts ","This course has two central ambitions. First, it introduces themes of magic and witchcraft in (mostly) American literature and film. We work together to figure out how the figure of the witch functions in stories, novels and movies, what witches and witchcraft mean or how they participate in the texts’ ways of making meaning. At the same time, we try to figure out how witches and witchcraft function as loci or displacements of social anxiety—about power, science, gender, class, race and politics. Since the identification of witches and the fear of witchcraft often lead to witch panics, we finally examine the historical and cultural phenomenon of the witch hunt, including both the persecution of persons literally marked as witches and the analogous persecution of persons (Communists, sexual outsiders, etc.) figuratively “hunted” as witches have been. Open to students at all levels, regardless of major. (E) {L} Credits: 4 "
620,Smith,ENG 277 Postcolonial Women Writers ,"A comparative study of 20th-century women writers in English from Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia and Australia. We read novels, short stories, poetry, plays and autobiography in their historical, cultural and political contexts as well as theoretical essays to address questions such as: How have women writers addressed the dual challenge of contesting sexism and patriarchy from within their indigenous cultures as well as the legacies of western imperialism from without? How have they combined feminism with anti-colonialism? How have they deployed the act of writing as cultural work on multiple counts: addressing multiple audiences; challenging different stereotypes about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity? What new stories have they told to counter older stories, what silences have they broken? How have they renegotiated the public and the private, or called attention to areas often ignored by their male contemporaries, such as relations among women, familial dynamics, motherhood, bodily desire, or the gendered effects of migration and diaspora? Writers include Anita Desai, Kamala Das, Thrity Umrigar, Deepa Mehta, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Nawal el Saadawi, Jamaica Kincaid, Michelle Cliff, Zadie Smith, Sally Morgan. Prerequisite: a WI course. {L} Credits: 4 "

Arthurian legend in medieval and 19th-century England, the Gothic revival in British art and architecture, the cult of Chaucer, controversies over women’s education, and the idealization of medieval communities in Victorian social theory. {L} Credits: 4 "
622,Smith,ENG 285 Introduction to Contemporary Literary Theory ,"What do we do when we read literature? Does the meaning of a text depend on the author’s intention or on how readers read? What counts as a valid interpretation? Who decides? How do some texts get canonized and others forgotten? How does literature function in culture and society? How do changing understandings of language, the unconscious, class, gender, race, history, sexuality or disability affect how we read? “Theory” is “thinking about thinking,” questioning common sense, critically examining the categories we use to approach literature or any discursive text. This course introduces some of the most influential questions that have shaped contemporary literary studies. We start with New Criticism but focus on interdisciplinary approaches such as structuralism, poststructuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, New Historicism, postcolonialism, feminism, queer, cultural, race and disability studies with some attention to film and film theory. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate work. {L} Credits: 4 "

709,Smith,FMS 150 Introduction to Film and Media Studies ,"This course introduces students to FMS through units that pair four scholarly approaches with four influential media forms: the Aesthetics of Film, the History of Television, the Ideologies of Video Games, and the Technologies of Internet Media. Through these units, we will ask: what human desires animate our relationship with media? For what purposes have people invented and evolved these technologies? How do makers use them, and what are audiences seeking in them? These questions will help us see the fundamental forces that unite film, television, video games, and Internet media alongside the elements that distinguish them from each other. {A} Credits: 4 "
710,Smith,FMS 234 Cinema by Other Means ,"This course explores articulations of “cinema” in materials other than those typically associated with the film medium. Recasting the medium as a practice, an idea, and a cultural episteme, we’ll try to think beyond received wisdom about what the “cinema” is. We’ll investigate a broad range of unconventional works: from science fiction to the proto-filmic projections of the historical avantgarde; musique concrète; and the radical exhibition and film-performance practices of the postwar period, including militant film practice in the so-called Third World. We will also devote a week to discussing works on view in the Smith College Museum of Art. (E) {A} Credits: 4 "
711,Smith,FMS 235 Listening to Cinema ,"This course explores the sound worlds of narrative, experimental and documentary cinema. Emphasis is placed on critical listening with regular sound exercises and focused analysis of individual films. Topics addressed include the aesthetics and politics of listening; sound design; the voice; film music; and the history of sound technology. The first half of the course will be devoted to sound theory and practice, with sound-oriented readings drawn from disparate fields including philosophy, film theory, musicology and short fiction. In the second half, we will undertake an historical survey of sound technology since the late nineteenth century. {A} Credits: 4 "
712,Smith,FMS 236 Soundless Specters: The Afterlife of Silent Cinema ,"This course charts the life and death of silent cinema from the beginnings of film to the coming of sound (and after). We will exhume the cinema’s prehistory in motion studies, optical toys, and popular entertainments such as magic lantern shows and wax museums; then survey the critical reception of early cinema and major theoretical debates about the specificity of the film medium. The second half of the course addresses reception in more depth. Topics may include non-Western exhibition practices; African-American filmmaking and spectatorship; gender, sex and censorship; historical and contemporary practices of silent film music; and the afterlife of silent cinema in contemporary art. {A} Credits: 4 "
713,Smith,FMS 237 The Documentary Impulse ,"The drive to represent reality has animated media makers throughout history. In the service of this urgent, impossible ambition, documentarians have used myriad forms of media and produced some of each form’s most complex works. This course examines how they have done so, concentrating on different approaches to documentary (observational, ethnographic, essayistic, autobiographical), and considering work in photography, film, television, radio/ podcasts, websites and virtual reality. Throughout the semester, we interrogate the boundaries of the documentary mode; the unique ethical considerations of doing documentary work; and the social, cultural and technological factors that shape documentary’s history and current practice. {A} Credits: 4 "
714,Smith,FMS 241 Screwball Comedy ,"Classic screwball comedies were produced in a 10-year period from Capra’s It Happened One Night (1934) to Sturges’ Miracle at Morgan’s Creek (1944). The class will screen 20 films from these years, although it will include a few later films. Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot (1959), Mann’s Lover Come Back (1961) and the Coen Brothers’ Intolerable Cruelty (2003). We will examine the genre in its historical context and examine elements of the system studios, writers, producers, clothes and set designers, actors that produced this astonishingly witty and short-lived film genre. {A} Credits: 4 "
715,Smith,FMS 243 After the End of the World: Transnational/Transmedia Studies in Science Fiction ,"Perhaps no genre has addressed the prospect of the world’s end more fully than science fiction. In many science fiction narratives, the end of the world spells disaster. A future is imagined in which sinister forces threaten the continuation of life as we know it. In other narratives, leaving the world behind may represent a kind of liberation: from the tedium of everyday life, or from oppressive contemporary social and political systems. This course presents a series of investigations focused on compelling moments, themes and expressions within the wider universe of science fiction. Each case study enables us to imagine the world’s end from a different perspective. Each also demands that we carry out our investigation across and between various forms of media. {A} Credits: 4 "
716,Smith,FMS 244 Global Media: The Musical! ,"This course examines the film musical as a global genre traversing a range of media, not only including film but also theater, television, social media and recorded music. Since the advent of synchronous sound film, the musical has become one of the global film industry’s most enduring and profitable genres. What has made the musical so successful the world over? Though much critical and scholarly attention has been paid to the Hollywood studio-era musicals of the 1930s–’50s, the scope of our investigation is global and our focus is on more recent iterations of the genre. {A} Credits: 4 "
717,Smith,FMS 246 The Western and American Identity after World War II ,"This class examines the relation of perhaps the defining American film genre to questions of both American cinema and American identity. How are Westerns reflective and symptomatic of vital issues in United States history and culture? How does the genre help shape and define how Americans think of themselves? How did the genre change over the post-war period, and what does this tell us about the changing needs, ideas, and ideologies of both American filmmaking and the United States itself? We consider the classical films of John Ford and the revisionist work of Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman, as well as other canonical Westerns, considering the way they were used to think through historical and cultural events like the Red Scare, Civil Rights and the development of a more robust Queer Public Sphere. We also consider more recent developments and changes in the genre as produced by Reagan’s tenure as the Cowboy President (including US foreign policy in Latin America) and, currently, shifts in the genre affected by digital technology and the Age of New Media. {A} Credits: 4 "
718,Smith,FMS 247 American Film and Culture from the Depression to the Sixties ,"This course explores the relationship between film and culture during some of the most crucial decades of ""The American Century."" It looks at the evolving connection between films and their audiences, the extent to which films are symptomatic of as well as influential on historical periods, major events and social movements, and the ways in which film genres evolve in relation to both cultural change and the rise and fall of the Hollywood studio system. Among the questions we'll consider: How did the Depression have an impact on Hollywood film style and form? How were evolving ideas about American motherhood puzzled out in American cinema of the period? What were some of the important differences between the way mainstream U.S. cinema and European film represented World War II? How did Civil Rights and the Red Scare become appropriate topics for Westerns? Did the lighthearted veneer of the fluffy sex comedies of the sixties actually hide some serious questions about labor, independent female subjectivity and heteronormativity? Particular and sustained attention will be paid to relations among gender, genre, race and class. {A} {L} Credits: 4 "
719,Smith,"FMS 248 Women and American Cinema: Representation, Spectatorship, Authorship ","A survey of women in American films from the silent period to the present, examining: 1) how women are represented on film, and how those images relate to actual contemporaneous American society, culture, and politics; 2) how theoretical formulations, expectations, and realities of female spectatorship relate to genre, the star and studio systems (and other production and distribution modes), dominant and alternative codes of narration, and developments in digital and new media modes; and 3) how women as stars, writers, producers, and directors shape and respond to, work within and against, dominant considerations of how women look (in every sense). {A} Credits: 4 "
720,Smith,FMS 249 Queer Cinema/Queer Media ,"From the queer avant-garde of Kenneth Anger and Su Friedrich, to The Kids Are All Right and Glee, the queer in film and television is often conflated with gay and lesbian representation on screen. Instead of collapsing queer cinema into a representational politics of gay and lesbian film and television, we look at theories and practices that uphold what queerness means in a contemporary framework of America neoliberalism and transnational media. Screenings include the New Queer Cinema classics Paris Is Burning, It Wasn't Love and Poison, and work by multimedia artists including Shu Lea Cheang, Issac Julien, Carmelita Tropicana and PJ Raval. Readings by Alexander Doty, Thomas Elsaesser, Kobena Mercer, Jasbir Puar, B. Ruby Rich, J. Halberstam, Jose E. Munoz, Chris Straayer and Hayden White. {A} Credits: 4 "
721,Smith,FMS 250 Global Cinema After World War II ,"The post-war period was a time of increasing globalization, which brought about a more interconnected and international film culture. But it was also a time during which certain key national cinemas defined, or redefined, themselves. This course examines both trends, as well as focuses on the work and influence of significant directors and landmark films, emphasizing not only cinematic and cultural specificity, but also cross-cultural, and transhistorical concerns. What makes a film Italian or Brazilian or British? How does national identity help shape any country’s cinema, and how do films help shape national identity? How do films circulate through other cultures and what kinds of conversations do films from one nation or culture have with others? How and when is the idea of nation a counterproductive way to think about cinema? How do ideas of history and self inform cinema, and vice versa? How do we need to adjust our own spectatorship as we engage with films from other places and times? We examine films, filmmakers, and film movements including: Italian Neo-realism, French New Wave, New German Cinema, Brazilian Cinema Novo, Chinese Fifth Generation, Hong Kong Action Cinema, and the films of Ousmane Sembene, Thomas Gutierrez Aléa, Satyajit Ray, Akira Kurosawa, Julie Dash and Spike Lee. Satisfies the media histories requirement for the film and media studies major. {A} Credits: 4 "
722,Smith,FMS 260 Digital Media and Participatory Culture ,"Among the claims made for the newness of new media is the assertion that new media are interactive, turning the passive consumers of “old” media into active, engaged participants. This course explores the shape of this technologically-enabled “participatory culture” and will also investigate cracks in the foundation of the alleged digital utopia. To what extent are new technologies democratizing and to what extent do they offer new forms of surveillance and control to the powers that be? What social and economic factors govern “convergence culture?” How have fan cultures evolved as their material networks of conventions and zines go digital? {A} Credits: 4 "
723,Smith,FMS 261 Video Games and the Politics of Play ,"An estimated 63% of U.S. households have members who play video games regularly, and game sales routinely exceed film box office figures. As this medium grows in cultural power, it is increasingly important to think about how games make meaning. This course serves as an introduction to Game Studies, equipping students with the vocabulary to analyze video games, surveying the medium’s genres, and sampling this scholarly discipline’s most influential theoretical writing. The particular focus, though, is on the ideology operating beneath the surface of these popular entertainment objects and on the ways in which video games enter political discourse. Enrollment limit of 30. "
724,Smith,FMS 265 Film in the Digital Age ,"Film, a dominant entertainment form in the twentieth century, faces sweeping changes in the twenty-first. Digital technologies are widely replacing film cameras and projectors, theatrical exhibition continues to decline as audiences watch movies on smaller and smaller screens, and the list of other entertainment forms competing for the public’s attention grows longer each year. Appropriating Peter Greenaway’s provocation, “Cinema is dead, long live cinema,” this course will consider the challenge digital media present to film’s primacy, but also the ways in which film has survived and thrived during this and previous periods of dramatic technological change. Prerequisite: FMS 150. "
725,Smith,FMS 270 Making Knowledge ,"This colloquium examines the life cycle of knowledge making: studying what it means to produce knowledge, how one decides how (and with whom) to share one’s knowledge, and the implications of having the privilege to engage in such projects. We study a range of questions: Who desires knowledge, and why? When do data and information become knowledge? How does knowledge become wisdom? Students work collaboratively and independently on public scholarship projects, develop expertise in digital critique and seminar style discussion, and present work to a range of different publics. Enrollment by instructor permission, limit of 12. Credits: 4 "
726,Smith,FMS 280 Introduction to Video Production ,"This course will provide a foundation in the principles, techniques, and equipment involved in making short videos, including: development of a viable story idea or concept, aesthetics and mechanics of shooting video, the role of sound and successful audio recording, and the conceptual and technical underpinnings of digital editing. You will make several short pieces through the semester, working towards a longer final piece. Along with projects and screenings, there will be reading assignments and writing exercises. Prerequisite: FMS 150 or its equivalent (can be taken concurrently). Application and permission of instructor required. Enrollment limited to 12. {A} Credits: 4 "
727,Smith,FMS 282 Advanced Production Workshop ,"We will take skills and insights gained in introductory production courses and develop them through the creation of one 10-minute project. We will learn by making work as well as by researching, reading and watching films. We may take this opportunity to learn the conventions of our chosen form or we may decide that our content demands formal experimentation and risk-taking. The course will be structured by the projects each student brings to it. Prerequisite: Introduction to Video Production. Application and permission of instructor required. Enrollment limited to 10. {A} Credits: 4 "
728,Smith,FMS 285 Screenwriting ,"This class explores modes of screenwriting that give weight to cinematic elements usually ignored by orthodox screenplay form. We treat the pictorial and audio-visual as content rather than mere style, and we explore ways to write the visual in addition to dialogue. Throughout the class, the emphasis for student writing is on personal content and human-scaled stories rather than historical film genres. Weekly writing exercises includes both original content and scenes for established characters in finished films or TV shows. There are also specific technical exercises built on structural film elements like time-lapse, etc. A first workshop in narrative screenwriting. Weekly short writing assignments and in-class workshops of student scenes. Longer final project. Prerequisite: FMS 150 Introduction to Film and Media Studies (may also be taken concurrently). Enrollment limit 12. Instructor permission required. "
729,Smith,FMS 290 Theories and Methods of Film and Media Studies ,"This course is designed to give FMS majors and minors a solid grounding in the primary methods of our field. In other words, what are the broad approaches scholars have taken to the study of media, and what specific methodological strategies have proved most effective? We begin with theory as one such method—one that zooms out to ask broad questions about the essential nature of a medium. Our history unit shifts the focus to how media are impacted by and implicated in the progression of time and culture. Finally, our criticism unit features strategies for analyzing individual media objects. Prerequisite: FMS 150. Enrollment limit of 15. {A} Credits: 4 "
730,Smith,"FMS 345 Violence, Mortality and the Moving Image ","If cinema is, as André Bazin writes, “change mummified,” violence and death are among the most dramatic physical changes it can “mummify.” This course studies the long, complex relationship between cinema and these bodily spectacles. How has censorship impacted the way violence has been screened? How can cameras make the internal processes of death externally visible? What are the ethics of filming “real” violence and death in a documentary mode? How are cultural attitudes toward violence and death reflected in and shaped by films? As a cautionary note, this course necessarily includes graphic representations of violence and death. Prerequisites: FMS 150. Enrollment limit of 12. {A} Credits: 4 "
731,Smith,FMS 430D Honors Project ,A thesis on a film studies topic or a creative project. 8 credits for the full-year course; 4 per semester. Credits: 4 
732,Smith,LAS 201 Colloquium in Latin American and Latino/a Studies ,"Landscapes of Work, Wealth and Power: The Economic Geography of Latin America Members of the department "
733,Smith,FYS 100 My Music: Writing Musical Lives ,"This first-year seminar begins with an exploration of our own musical lives. What does the particular constellation of material that we call “My Music” tell us about who we are, where we come from, and how we relate to the world? After analyzing and comparing musical lives within the class, we will read selected case studies and collaboratively design a musical biography project. Each student will curate one person’s musical life story, gathering data through oneon-one interviews, weaving together their interlocutor’s words with their own interpretations, and ultimately reflecting on what they have learned from the experience. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 "
734,Smith,FYS 101 The Lives of Animals: Literature and the Nonhuman ,"In this course, we will track animals across a range of poems, stories, novels, essays, and films that try to imagine what it is like not to be human. From stories of people transforming into animals to texts that insist that we have no clue what animals really feel, we will consider the various ways that writers distinguish—or refuse to distinguish—humans from other animals. Why, we will ask, are literature and art so haunted by animal life? We will discuss zoos, pets, fables, cartoons, animal rights, vegetarianism, anthropocentrism, and extinction. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 "
735,Smith,FYS 103 Geology in the Field ,"Clues to over 500 million years of earth history can be found in rocks and sediments near Smith College. Students in this course attempt to decipher this history by careful examination of field evidence. Class meetings take place principally outdoors at interesting geological localities around the Connecticut Valley. Participants prepare regular reports based on their observations and reading, building to a final paper on the geologic history of the area. The course normally includes a weekend field trip to Cape Cod. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {N} Credits: 4 "
736,Smith,FYS 107 Women of the Odyssey ,"Homer’s Odyssey presents a gallery of memorable women: Penelope above all, but also Nausicaa, Calypso and Circe. Helen plays a cameo role, while Clytemnestra is regularly invoked as a negative example. Together these women define a spectrum of female roles and possibilities: the faithful wife, the bride-tobe, the temptress, the adulteress, the murderer. We begin with a careful reading of the Odyssey, then study the afterlife of its female characters in the Western literary tradition. Readings are drawn from authors both ancient (Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Ovid) and modern (H.D., Robert Graves, Louise Glück, Margaret Drabble). This course counts toward the classics, classical studies and study of women and gender majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 "
737,Smith,FYS 109 Exobiology: Origins of Life and the Search for Life in the Universe ,"This course explores interdisciplinary approaches to the search for life in the Universe by using the Earth as a natural laboratory. We will address fundamental questions surrounding the formation of our solar system and the first appearance of life, the definition of life and how we can search for it elsewhere, and the biases we introduce by using Earth as a model system. The goal of this class is to present a multidisciplinary view of exobiology by integrating geology, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and physics. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. (E) WI Credits: 4 "
738,Smith,FYS 117 The Bible and the American Public Square ,"We examine what the Bible (and to some extent the broader Jewish and Christian traditions) have to say about controversial issues that have divided Americans in the past (e.g., slavery) and present (e.g., abortion). The aim is to give students the skills to assess critically various arguments that invoke the Bible or religious tradition and authority, wherever they come from on the political spectrum. Students are introduced to the Bible and biblical scholarship, as well as learn about different understandings of biblical authority and views of applying the Bible to contemporary political and ethical debates. This course counts toward the Jewish studies and religion majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {H} {L} Credits: 4 "
739,Smith,FYS 119 Performance and Film Criticism ,"An introduction to the elements, history and functions of criticism.

The students attend live performances and film and video screenings, and write their own reviews and critical responses. This course counts toward the theatre major. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {A} {L} Credits: 4 "
740,Smith,FYS 124 Writers and the Body: Health and Illness in African Diasporic Women’s Literature ,"This seminar will explore representations of health and illness in writing by women of the African diaspora from the nineteenth century to the present. Our authors hail from Antigua, Bermuda, Canada, Guadeloupe, and the United States, and their interventions (ideological and geographical) engage an even broader territory. We will ask how women novelists, memoirists, poets, and playwrights (some of them health care professionals) challenge, support, influence, and/or respond to contemporary medical theories of health and illness. We will also make use of archival and digital resources at Smith. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 "
741,Smith,FYS 127 Cuba and the U.S. Embargo ,"This course explores the conditions in Cuban society that led to the revolution in 1959, the evolution of revolutionary policy and performance after 1959, the turn in its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union over the decades, and the impact that these relations had on Cuban society. Students write three papers, each focusing on the dynamics of Cuban society and relations with the United States, covering three time periods: pre-1959, 1959–88 and 1989– present. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 "
742,Smith,FYS 128 Ghosts ,"This course explores what Toni Morrison in Beloved calls “the living activity of the dead”: their ambitions, their desires, their effects. Often returning as figures of memory or history, ghosts raise troubling questions as to what it is they, or we, have to learn. We shall survey a variety of phantasmagorical representations in poems, short stories, novels, films, spiritualist and scientific treatises and spirit photography. This course counts towards the English major. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 "
743,Smith,FYS 137 Of Minds and Molecules: Philosophical Perspectives on Chemistry and Biochemistry ,"What is the “shape,” “size,” or “color” of a smell? We often use vision as a metaphor when describing our perceptions from our other senses, but does this limit what we perceive? How do the (often visual) models that chemists use, and the metaphors that are associated with those models, affect what chemists study? For example, what do we mean when we speak of molecular “switches” or “brakes”? How do the metaphors and the kinds of languages that chemists use differ from those used in the arts? Is chemistry a single discipline, sharing a common language? Is it even an autonomous discipline at all, or is it reducible to physics? We will explore these questions from a philosophical perspective, using examples drawn primarily from chemistry and biochemistry. The course is designed for first-year students who would like to explore current conceptual issues that challenge some of the common beliefs about science. Enrollment limited to 20 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 "
744,Smith,FYS 140 Literature and Medicine ,"How do stories heal? What can we learn about medicine from stories, novels, poems, plays and case studies? Comparing narratives from different cultures, students also compose their own stories. The course also introduces broader issues in the medical humanities, such as medical ethics, healthcare disparities and cross-cultural communication. Works (available in translation) from China, Taiwan, France, Russia, and North and Latin America. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {L} Credits: 4 "
745,Smith,FYS 142 Reacting to the Past ,"In Reacting students learn by taking on roles, in elaborate games set in the past; they learn skills—speaking, writing, critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and teamwork—in order to prevail in complicated situations. Reacting roles do not have a fixed script and outcome. While students adhere to the intellectual beliefs of the historical figures they have been assigned, they must devise their own means of expressing those ideas in papers, speeches or public presentations. Class sessions are run entirely by students; instructors guide students and grade their oral and written work. It draws students into the past, promotes engagement with big ideas, and improves intellectual and academic skills. Enrollment limited to 24 first-year students. WI {H} Credits: 5 "
746,Smith,FYS 146 Can Women Have Adventures? ,We will examine contemporary girls’ adventure in novels and films. These fictions rework the classic patterns of “boys’ books” to create heroic girls meant to inspire young female readers. We begin with two classic 19th-century boys' books to situate our readings of contemporary girls’ adventures. We will focus on the structure of the girls’ adventure landscape by creating maps and writing blog posts for each fiction asking questions such as: What significant boundaries do the fictions imagine? What gender and class ideas do they enforce? How do boy and girl heroes differ? What does a girl hero do? Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 
747,Smith,FYS 151 A River Runs Through Us ,"This course is a writing intensive (WI) first-year seminar (FYS) based in field experiences and reflections on the cultural and natural history of the Mill River—the river that flows through Smith’s Campus and connects multiple communities both upstream and downstream from Smith. Field experiences are complemented by readings, quantitative work with GIS, engagement with local historical collections and resources, participation in local events, and class discussions. Students in the course will learn about the place in which they are living by exploring its cultural landscape history as it relates to the river that run through us. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 "
748,Smith,"FYS 152 Demons, Deities, and Despots: The Myths, Magic, and Madness of Islands ","This course explores the island as a mythical blank space, a paradise, a no-man's land that encourages humankind's ""primordial"" impulses. We associate islands with adventure, wilderness, freedom, magic, dystopia and utopia. In the cultural imaginary, the island exists to be invented, discovered, and reinvented.

750,Smith,FYS 160 The End of the World as We Know It: The Post-Apocalyptic Novel ,"We explore a wide range of literary scenarios that depict the collapse of civilization in the wake of plague-like disease and/or nuclear war. The motif of the post-Apocalyptic novel has become common, yet its roots go back as far (and further than) Jack London’s The Scarlet Plague and Mary Shelley’s The Last Man. In the works we will be examining, we witness the attempts of the few survivors of catastrophe to create a new world, or merely to live in a world in which the past casts a vast shadow over the present.

755,Smith,FYS 177 The Tranquil(ized) Fifties ,"In popular culture and some political discourse, the 1950s appear as a lost paradise of a decade, a time of peace and prosperity, a golden age from which American culture has fallen. Any serious examination of the period, though, reveals not the fact of tranquility so much as the act of tranquilizing as Cold War tensions roiled internationally and political and social unrest continually erupted in the domestic sphere.

759,Smith,FYS 185 Style Matters: The Power of the Aesthetic in Italian Cinema ,"Examining Italian cinema from neorealism to today, this course investigates how major directors have negotiated two apparently independent postwar traditions: the aesthetic of realism (which purports to show Italian society and landscape without embellishments) and that search for beauty and style which has historically characterized Italian civilization and become its trademark in today’s global culture (Made in Italy).

We often use vision as a metaphor when describing our perceptions from our other senses, but does this limit what we perceive?  How do the (often visual) models that chemists use, and the metaphors that are associated with those models, affect what chemists study?  For example, what do we mean when we speak of molecular “switches” or “brakes”?  How do the metaphors and the kinds of languages that chemists use differ from those used in the arts?  Is chemistry a single discipline, sharing a common language?  Is it even an autonomous discipline at all, or is it reducible to physics?  We will explore these questions from a philosophical perspective, using examples drawn primarily from chemistry and biochemistry.

The history of the American musical is deeply intertwined with the assimilationist project, particularly among Jewish-Americans, who were highly instrumental in its development. The economics of theatrical production in the early 20th century, along with the rise of a burgeoning middle class with time for leisure (a new phenomenon), gave rise to a “popular” form of musical theatre—the musical comedy—that was instrumental in creating what became “show business.” {A} {H} {L} Credits: 4 "

Theatre is a transformative experience that takes performer and audience on an extensive journey in the playground of the imagination beyond the mundane world.

As we enter this “imagined” world we investigate the normative principles of our current world. This course investigates the counterfactual, speculative, subjunctive impulse in overtly speculative drama and film with a particular focus on race and gender. We examine an international range of plays by such authors as Caryl Churchill, Tess Onwueme, Dael Orlandersmith, Derek Walcott, Bertolt Brecht, Lorraine Hansberry, Craig Lucas and Doug Wright, as well as films such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; Pan’s Labyrinth; Children of Men; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; X-Men; Contact and Brother From Another Planet.
