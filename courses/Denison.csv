231,Denison,COMM 140 - The Politics of Popular Culture (4 Credit Hours),The terrain of popular culture has historically been a site of contentiousstruggles and debates. For long (as is the case even today) one’s cultural“taste” was a signiﬁcant factor in determining one’s standing in thesocial hierarchy. Debates about “high” vs “low” culture and about whatcultural texts and practices must stand in to represent a communityhave involved some of the most well known intellectuals in history.Analyzing the trajectory of these debates over the years provides us witha lens through which to understand historical social changes.

In readings, screenings, written assignments, anddiscussions you develop a working knowledge of different intellectualtraditions used to study media. From the very start, the course pushespast simplistic, binary assessments of media consumption as beingeither “good” or “bad.” Instead, we survey the complicated routes throughwhich media forms and practices inform people’s understandings ofthemselves and the world around them. Organized into three units, thecourse aims to provide you with conceptual frames for 1) understandingthe relationship between media and culture, 2) identifying how mediamake claims to represent truth and authenticity, and 3) comprehendingthe role of media in ideological conflict. Throughout the term, you areasked to question many ideas and beliefs that people take for granted:that media are “bad” for children, that some television programmingis “realistic,” or that we could ever exist outside the web of mediatedcommunication that informs our day-to-day lives, even if we wanted todo just that.

But what did these philosophers actuallybelieve? And why did they believe it? This course is an intermediate-levelsurvey of western philosophy from their period (now known as the “EarlyModern” or “Modern” era, which runs roughly from 1600-1800). Whilethese and other thinkers (such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley)in this era dealt with a wide variety of subjects, we will focus mostlyon their contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophyof mind. We will address their writings with three different aims: a) toappreciate the sense in which they were, at one time, fresh and radical;b) to understand how, for better or for worse, they set the foundation formuch of the modern—western, anyway—worldview; and c) to determine ifwhat they say is either true or false."

Feministcriticism probes some of the most fundamental philosophicalassumptions about our knowledge of and interaction with the worldand other people. How does feminism destabilize philosophy and affectphilosophical conceptions of knowledge, reality, metaphysics, agency,or morality? How does philosophy enrich feminist understandings ofoppression, privilege, or equality?

816,Denison,PHIL 298 - Existentialism (4 Credit Hours),"Existentialism asks how we can generate a meaning for our lives withoutappealing to outside sources. Many existentialists embrace a viewcharacterized with the slogan “existence precedes essence.” This sloganmeans that any attempt to ﬁgure out what one is must begin with thefact that one is. In addition, if existence precedes essence, then theremay well be a multiplicity of ways that one can be, making choosingbetween these ways a difﬁcult task. That one’s existence may well beexperienced as constrained by social forces seemingly beyond one’scontrol complicates matters. We will read from a variety of sources,including philosophical sources such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre,de Beauvoir, or Judith Butler as well as literary or biographical sources,e.g., Beckett, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, and others."
817,Denison,PHIL 305 - Metaphysics (4 Credit Hours),"This course is an introduction to the methodology of and various issueswithin metaphysics.

819,Denison,PHIL 321 - Metaethics (4 Credit Hours),"We spend much of our time trying to answer such questions as: Howought we to act? What should we value? and What type of person shouldwe be? But, it seems right that we can evaluate our answers to thesequestions and decide among them only if we correctly answer anotherset of questions ﬁrst. For instance, how can we know what we shouldvalue unless we understand what values are, whether they exist andwhether we can know them if they do? How can we know how we oughtto act if we do not know what it means for an act to be morally goodor why we are even obligated to do what is morally good in the ﬁrstplace? This course pursues answers to this other set of questions. Itinquires into the nature of ethical statements, properties, judgments andattitudes. As such, it draws on many other areas of philosophy, includingepistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language."

Can it be deﬁnedindependently of consideration of what the ""good"" is for human beings?Is justice possible in a society marked by signiﬁcant religious, ethnic,cultural or other sorts of pluralisms? What is the relation betweenjustice and nationhood, and what can be said about justice betweennations? How is justice connected to social equality, and to liberty?What is meant by economic justice?

822,Denison,PHIL 333 - History of Analytic Philosophy (4 Credit Hours),"This course is an introduction to the methods and the history of theanalytic tradition. This tradition can be distinguished in a number ofways. Methodologically, it tends to employ careful argumentationand formal tools like logic and mathematics to provide analyses ofscientiﬁc, psychological, and linguistic data. Historically, it is usuallytraced back to a group of Anglo-European philosophers—Frege, Russell,Moore, and Wittgenstein—writing around the beginning of the twentiethcentury. Thematically, it is primarily driven by the ambition of providinga systematic account of the relationship between language, thought,and the world.

885,Denison,POSC 348 - Foreign and Security Policy in Western Europe (4 CreditHours),"This course aims to compare key post Cold War foreign policy behaviorsduring crisis situations concerning the three ""big"" states in WesternEurope: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (also referred to asthe EU3, as they all are members of the European Union (EU). Why is itthat we know so little about the foreign policies of three countries whichhave been the most important allies for the US in the past ﬁfty years?Are these countries ""middle powers"" or ""big powers""? What role do theyplay in the international hierarchy? What others states in Western Europealso conduct foreign policies, they frequently do so as part of the EU,or at least tailor their policies so that they do not substantially deviatefrom the EU. They also tend to have more of a regional focus as they lackthe means and influence to project their power beyond the conﬁnes ofEurope. Thus, the ""three big"" can be put in a special category because oftheir status, wealth, influence and power. To explore their behaviors weﬁrst establish conceptual framework for a comparative study of foreignpolicy (comparative foreign policy analysis). This framework guidesour analysis in subsequent empirical cases examining decision-makingprocesses, the domestic and international environment, and foreignpolicy outputs. We will assess key variables at the individual, group, stateand systemic levels of analysis and develop a framework for comparingthe foreign policy incentives of these three powers. Speciﬁc areas ofinquiry include cognitive and psychological theories of decision-making,group dynamics, organizational interests, public opinion, national roleconception, strategic interaction and relative power/capability changes inthe international system."

We will investigate various deﬁnitions of terrorism. Most scholarsthink that terrorism is not a random act of violence. They see terrorismas planned and, for those who use it, rational. However, there is still a lotof disagreement on what terrorism is, what motivates terrorists, how itcan be fought, and on what we mean by rational and planned. We willcompare the various deﬁnitions and perspectives to determine whichmight work best for our understanding of the phenomena. In addition, wewill focus on some key concepts in the discipline of political science andhow they relate to terrorism, for example: power, ethnicity, religion, andthe media."
