0,UniofNorthCarolina,ENGL 105 English Composition and Rhetoric or ENGL 105I English Composition and Rhetoric (Interdisciplinary) ,"All entering first-year, first-time students at the University must complete, or transfer in, ENGL 105 or ENGL 105I. ENGL 105 introduces students to several disciplinary contexts for written work and oral presentations required in college courses, whereas ENGL 105I introduces students to one specific disciplinary context — digital humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, law, business, or health and medicine — for such written and oral assignments. Exempting the course on the basis of nationally normed examinations is not possible. Students may prepare for ENGL 105 or ENGL 105I while in high school by taking courses in English composition and speech communication beyond the requirements for admission to the University. "
