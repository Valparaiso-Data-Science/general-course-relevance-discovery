",P Students who have AP credit for ECON 151 must take one additional elective course. 
5,ColgateUni,P ALST 203 - The Caribbean ,"P An interdisciplinary course that introduces students to the field of Caribbean Studies. It uses literature, film, and the music of the region to explore the historical, societal, cultural, political, and economic development of the Caribbean. It also explores gender issues in the region. It is one of the required courses for students who seek to participate in the West Indies Study Group. "
6,ColgateUni,P ALST 212 - The Politics of Race and Ethnicity ,"P Examines the political dynamics of race in American society, focusing primarily on the experience of blacks as a socio-political group and to a lesser degree on that of other racial and ethnic minorities. The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue - racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics. "
7,ColgateUni,P ALST 225 - Jamaica: From Colony to Independence (Study Group) ,"P Surveys the history of Jamaica from 1655, when the British took possession of the island, through political independence in 1962, to the present. Examines the growth of Jamaica to become Britain's most prosperous colony during the 18th century based on an export sugar-based, slave-driven economy; the social the political consequences of its dependence on slavery; the economic effects of slave abolition and free trade during the 19th century; social and political developments after emancipation; the growth of black nationalism and decolonization; and post/neo-colonial developments. "
8,ColgateUni,"P ALST 228 - The Caribbean: Conquest, Colonialism, and Self-Determination ","P Surveys Caribbean history from European conquest and colonization to political independence. It introduces students to the salient features of the region's history from indigenous societies and their destruction by European invaders; through the rise of plantations and African slavery, the struggles for freedom, post-slavery social and economic developments; to the rise of nationalism leading to political self-determination, and the new American imperialism. "
9,ColgateUni,P ALST 230 - Introduction to Latin American Studies ,"P An introduction to the development of Latin America's diverse and distinctive cultural heritage and to its contemporary institutions and civilization. The study of pre-Columbian and New World cultures of Spanish and Portuguese America focuses on the interactions of Indian, European, and African cultures and the complexities of what is known as Latin American culture. The course, though not a historical survey, examines the historical origins of contemporary social, cultural, economic, and political issues in Latin America, and in those parts of the world that have been affected by significant numbers of Latin American immigrants. The approach is broadly multidisciplinary, reflecting various perspectives and materials. "
10,ColgateUni,P ALST 250 - Representations of Africa ,"P Critique the ways in which ""Africa"" has been constructed as an object of Western knowledge. The course interrogates how Africa and Africans have been portrayed to outside audiences historically and contemporarily, as well as the socio-political ramifications of such portrayals. Drawing on key texts from the social sciences, the humanities as well as the creative arts, the course explores specific depictions of Africa and Africans. It examines African self-representations alongside representations that focus on Africa as a site of difference or 'othering'. "
11,ColgateUni,P ALST 281 - Slavery and the Salve Trade in Africa ,"P Slavery and the slave trade are global phenomena with historical roots in the earliest civilizations. The course examines the long history of slavery and the slave trade in African societies, exploring the role that slavery played in African economic, political, and social life, as well as how the export of human beings as slaves transformed African societies. The course also considers how slaveholders and slaves shaped early African societies, the logic and consequences of African participation in the Atlantic slave trade, the aftermath of abolition in 20th-century colonial Africa, and how coercive forms of labor control have persisted into the 21st century. "
12,ColgateUni,P ALST 282 - The Making of Modern Africa ,P Surveys the history of Africa from 1880s to the contemporary period. Major themes will include: the imperial scramble and partition of Africa; African resistances; colonial rule in Africa; independence and problems of independence; socio-economic developments in independent Africa; ethnic conflicts; crises and contemporary issues. 
13,ColgateUni,P ALST 284 - Decolonization in Africa ,"P Surveys the history of the growth of anti-colonial nationalism, the end of colonial rule, and post-independence Africa to the contemporary period. It focuses on the comparative analysis of the winning of independence from French, British, Italian, Portuguese, and Belgian colonization. Major themes include African responses to colonial rule, wind of change, independence and problems of independence, pan-African movement, socio-economic developments, cold war, colonial legacies, political systems, and contemporary issues. "
14,ColgateUni,P ALST 290 - Model African Union ,"P The Model African Union is an annual national student simulation of the workings of a large multilateral organization, the African Union. Composed of 53 member states, the African Union was constituted in 2000 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Its objectives are to achieve continental integration, similar to that of the European Union, in balance with recognizing the national sovereignty of its member states. The Model African Union is in session for four days in late February, hosted by Howard University in Washington D.C., and students from more than 20 colleges and universities around the country participate. The on-campus portion of the course meets weekly for the five weeks prior to the trip and one week after, for debriefing. Students are assigned to specific country delegations and committees, research and prepare position papers, draft resolutions, debate and vote on action items, and generally take on the roles of African diplomats. The trip includes a visit to the embassy of the country each delegation is representing. May be taken more than once, with different country and committee assignments each year. "
15,ColgateUni,P ALST 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
16,ColgateUni,P ALST 309 - Latin America: Critical Landscapes of Development ,"P Explores the development experience of Latin America through examination of pressing environmental, economic, political, and social issues that currently face the region as a whole and play out differently across the region. The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries, and Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region. "
17,ColgateUni,P ALST 321 - Black Communities ,"P Uses a social scientific approach to examine the circumstances and dynamics characterizing black communities in the contemporary United States. Key areas of inquiry include the operation of major social institutions shaping community life, social class divisions, health and housing prospects, and the ways that the intersections of racial/ethnic identity, class, and gender shape the experiences of community members. "
18,ColgateUni,P ALST 326 - Jamaican Culture (Study Group) ,"P Examines the historical growth and fluorescence of Jamaican culture from the English conquest to the present. This culture is drawn from indigenous Taino, European, African, Jewish, Lebanese, Indian, and Chinese heritages, leading to the emergence of a unique Jamaican creole culture. The process of creolization over historical time forms the central and uniting theme of the course. In that context, various aspects of Jamaica's culture as well as the social forces that helped to shape it are explored. The examination of Jamaican culture includes religion and belief systems; marriage and family; art, music, and dance; literature; folkways; festivals; language; material cultures (food, dress, architecture, etc.); and sport. "
19,ColgateUni,"P ALST 327 - Authoritarianism, Dictatorships, and Democracy in the Caribbean ","P Examines the political development of the Caribbean from European occupation and colonization to the present. The imperial and societal foundations of authoritarianism in the Caribbean are studied, as are the popular democratic impulses arising especially since the end of slavery and culminating in self-governing ""democratic"" political regimes. "
20,ColgateUni,P ALST 330 - Race and Crime ,"P Uses a social scientific approach to examine the relationship between race and crime in the contemporary United States, with a particular emphasis on the African American experience. Key areas of inquiry include the nature of mass incarceration, urban crime, the politics of the new law and order regime, the relationship between punitiveness and prejudice, racial profiling, the community-level impacts of mass incarceration, the legitimacy crisis facing the criminal justice system, media depictions of race and crime, and racial stereotyping. "
21,ColgateUni,P ALST 332 - The Philosophy of Race and Racism ,"P Serves as a sustained investigation into the concepts of race and racism through an examination of metaphysical, psychological, ethical, linguistic, and political problems associated with race. Topics to be discussed include the nature of race (are races real and if so what are they?), the formation of racial identities, individual and institutional racism, and notions of distributive and compensatory justice and how they are used to address issues of racial injustice. Readings include Appiah, Boxill, DuBois, Fanon, Garcia, Hacking, Lycan, Taylor, and others. "
22,ColgateUni,P ALST 340 - Art and Culture in Contemporary Jamaica (Study Group) ,"P Introduces students to ways of reading and interpreting Jamaican culture using a broad interdisciplinary approach. In keeping with a cultural studies framework, students examine literature, theatre, music, dance, and film as expressions of Jamaican subjectivities and identities. The contexts and conversations out of which these artistic representations have emerged are considered through historical, sociological, and political texts that help to map the larger cultural matrix. Textual explorations are accompanied by field trips and guest lectures (from experts in the various disciplines) with the understanding that Jamaican culture is not fixed but evolving and dynamic, multifarious, and heterogeneous. "
23,ColgateUni,P ALST 345 - Topics in African American Philosophy ,"P An introduction to issues in African-American philosophy. In particular, it explores the political and ideological goals of leading intellectuals from the 19th century to the present. From DuBois and Delany to the black power movement of the 1960s, analysis of African-American experiences has produced divergent strategies intended to better the condition of black communities in America. The course investigates nationalist strategies and their roots in notions of black identity as they have been developed through the writings of intellectuals, artists, and political figures. It also addresses challenges as to whether or not nonintegrationist strategies can be used to achieve social equality. Authors include Elizabeth Anderson, Anthony Appiah, Countée Cullen, Martin Delany, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Alain Locke, Claude McKay, Tommie Shelby, Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. "
24,ColgateUni,P ALST 354 - Introduction to the Study of French Literature IV: the Francophone World ,"P Offers an overview of various bodies of literature written in French outside of France, focusing on five main geographical areas that historically constituted the French empire: the Caribbean, North Africa, West and Central Africa, Asia, and North America. Full texts as well as excerpts from a variety of genres are studied in the context of the history and geography of those regions. Through the exploration of key literary texts, particular attention is given to the effects of colonialism on language, identity, and artistic creation. "
25,ColgateUni,P ALST 355 - Rwanda since the 1994 Genocide ,"P Assess the Rwandan experience of post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in context and from the perspective of Rwandans themselves to ask, how sustainable is the country's post-genocide recovery? This course is concerned with understanding how to do field research in post-genocide Rwanda. Using the 'do no harm' framework of doing research with individuals who have lived through mass violence, this course equips students to undertake research in foreign field settings. In particular, students learn to design a 'human subjects' research proposal, rooted in The Belmont Report of ethical research and guidelines for research involving human subjects. The Report identified three core principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Using Rwanda since the 1994 genocide as a case study, these principles will be studied to highlight their shortcomings in the context of research in post-conflict societies. "
26,ColgateUni,P ALST 357 - Indigenous Politics of Latin America ,"P At the end of the 20th century, different indigenous or native peoples' voices seemed to become more prominent in Latin American social movements. These movements included an uprising to stop the advances of globalization, struggles to control resources, demands for dignity and recognition, and struggles against corporate environmental degradation. The apparent resurgence of Latin American indigenous politics is connected, in part, to global initiatives, like the work on what would become the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous politics in Latin America ultimately pose questions about customary, national, and international legal frameworks. This course works at the intersection of local and global understandings of what it means to be indigenous in different Latin American contexts. The course is taught through the disciplinary lens of anthropology, and readings are selected from case studies in Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. "
27,ColgateUni,P ALST 363 - Globalization and Social Change in Latin America ,"P Latin America has been globalized since before Napoleon invented the term ""Latin America"" to describe the Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonies to our south. This course explores the changing reality of what globalization means in Latin America. It examines the legacies of European colonization and African slavery; the struggles against transnational, national, and local forms of inequality; and the different ways that globalization is experienced by people today. Through case studies from South, Central, and North American, students focus on the themes of ethnicity, race, gender, social class, national citizenship, and transnational market production and consumption. The course uses an anthropological lens to analyze pressing social issues affecting Latin America, and Latin Americans, today. "
28,ColgateUni,P ALST 365 - Andean Lives ,"P While the Andes region may evoke quaint images often seen in tourism advertisements, a focus on the people living in this region reflects globally interconnected dynamics. The course engages with diverse authors who write about the Andes: as a place steeped in highland indigenous traditions; as the place of the Inca Empire; as a place of rural communities in which collective action can take priority over individual interest; as the original source of the coca leaf that has ritual significance through the region and contested political significance in the international sphere; as the birthplace of a Maoist guerrilla movement in the last gasp of the Cold War; and as the place where social movements have challenged global economic systems and brought an indigenous president to power. Through details about the lives of those who reside in the Andes, this course brings together anthropological and historical views of this region with cases primarily from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. "
29,ColgateUni,P ALST 367 - Jamaica in the Literary Imagination (Study Group) ,"P An introduction to Jamaican literature from the plantation to the diaspora, spanning a period from 1930 to the present. While this historical framing is central to the organization of the course, the study is not strictly a historical survey, but rather an attempt to read Jamaican literature produced at different historical moments, in rural and urban, global and local spaces, and across perspectives mediated by differences and convergences of race, gender, sexuality, and location. Writers may include Claude McKay, Roger Mais, Erna Brodber, Curdella Forbes, Margaret Cezair-Thompson, among others. Students examine how the historical forces of colonialism, nation building, migration, and the information age have helped to shape how the selected writers from different spaces and identities imagine Jamaica's culture, cultural products, and geopolitical relations in the global world. "
30,ColgateUni,P ALST 377 - History of Culture in the Caribbean ,"P Examines the historical development of diverse creole cultures in the Caribbean, based on a core of neo-African traditions and Amerindian influences, and shaped by the impact of almost five centuries of European cultural imperialism. It explores the cultures of various ethnic groups that co-habited the Caribbean in the wake of European colonization, their separate struggles for cultural autonomy and self-determination, and the emergence of creole cultures to which all contributed. Specific aspects of Caribbean culture are studied to comprehend the process of creolization. (GL) "
31,ColgateUni,P ALST 378 - Systems of Forced Labor in the Caribbean ,"P From the moment Europeans invaded the Caribbean under Columbus in 1492, they regarded the region as a zone of economic exploitation from which wealth could be extracted using forced labor. The Spanish enslaved and rapidly decimated the indigenous peoples before turning to Africa for slave labor. Other European nationalities tried white indentured labor before also turning to enslaved African labor. After slavery was abolished, the European colonizers continued the pattern of exploitation through forced labor by indenturing hundreds of thousands of new immigrant workers from India, Africa, and China. Forced labor remained the engine of the Caribbean plantation economy until the end of the First World War. This course examines how these forced labor systems shaped the growth of the economy and society in the Caribbean, as well as the relations among the various subaltern groups that made up the labor force. "
32,ColgateUni,P ALST 380 - Movements for Social Justice in South Africa (Extended Study) ,"P Considers social movements in the specific context of South Africa, a country which has been transformed by and continues to experience large-scale civil society mobilizations. South Africa's unusual heritage of settler colonialism, enforced racial segregation, and explosive economic growth fueled by resources like gold and diamonds combine to make the country a perfect setting in which to investigate the efforts of diverse groups of citizens to achieve a more just and equitable society. Theoretical models drawn from sociology and anthropology expose how social movements originate, succeed, fail, and transform. These models are then applied to the specific history of South Africa, including the early development of nonviolent protests, multi-racial labor movements, and the rise of the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups. In addition, the ongoing struggles for social justice since the democratic transition in 1994 are addressed, focusing particularly on movements for environmental justice, the rights of indigenous peoples, and access to adequate health care and schooling. New social media, art forms, and networking technologies that have transformed the ability of civil society groups to mobilize are also considered. The on-campus portion of the course is followed by a three-week extended study trip to two South African cities. As a final project, students use their experience to write a proposal for advanced research on a particular social movement. "
33,ColgateUni,P ALST 391 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
34,ColgateUni,P ALST 480 - Issues and Trends in Africana and Latin American Studies ,"P Serves as the senior capstone when UNST 410 is not offered. Exposes majors and minors in Africana and Latin American Studies to research in all areas through the theme of the course, through their individual projects, and through the faculty who visit the class to talk about research issues and trends in each of four program emphases: African Studies, African American Studies, Caribbean Studies, and Latin American Studies. It requires students to make broad connections between the four areas and challenges them to reflect deeply on theoretical ideas and developments in each individual area. The content of the seminars is interdisciplinary, theoretical issues that have significantly shaped the fields of Africana and Latin American studies are emphasized, and students complete major research projects demonstrating familiarity with relevant theory and methodology. "
35,ColgateUni,P ALST 491 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
36,ColgateUni,P ALST 499 - Honors Studies ,P Students pursuing honors research enroll in this course. 
37,ColgateUni,P ANTH 202 - Ancient States and Empires (MC) ,"P An introduction to the study of the archaeological and literary records of selected ancient states and empires of the Old and New Worlds. The course addresses such questions as when and where did cities and states first emerge? What forces accounted for the emergence of ancient states and empires? What were some of the institutions and practices that provided stability and cohesion in the social and political lives of these societies? Why did ancient states collapse? Each term, examples are chosen from the following civilizations or regions of the world: Africa, Mesopotamia, China, Southeast Asia, Mesoamerica, and the Andes. The course compares and contrasts achievements in these civilizations in their forms of social, political, and economic organizations, religion, writing and account-keeping, science, and art and architecture. (MC) "
38,ColgateUni,P ANTH 221 - Kinship and Marriage ,"P What is family? What is kinship? What is marriage? These are questions that have been central to anthropology since its inception in the 19th century. This course examines the culture and political economy of family life, kinship, and marriage in a broad range of human societies, ranging from small-scale communities to highly industrialized states. In addition to looking at the theories, methods, and data that are relevant to the study of kinship in anthropology and related disciplines, the class analyzes and compares different systems of descent and inheritance; various types of households, marriage patterns, and networks of exchange; and the myriad ways in which systems of kinship and marriage are informed by ideologies of gender and vice versa. The class also evaluates some of the recent classics on kinship in America as well as selected aspects of contemporary theoretical debates bearing on kinship and class, lesbian and gay kinship, and the new reproductive technologies. "
39,ColgateUni,P ANTH 226 - Critical Global Health ,"P In contemporary American society, Western medicine-or biomedicine-is seen as offering quick, effective, and technologically advanced solutions to pain and suffering. Biomedicine is a medical system that privileges the physiological and biological causes of disease. As a clinical science, biomedicine is usually seen as culture-less, as universally effective on all bodies. But what happens when Western medicine goes ""global,"" that is, when it encounters cultural values or beliefs that conceptualize illness, healing, or the body in different ways? Is medicine itself ""cultural,"" and if so, how? This course examines how people experience, use, and critique global health interventions across the globe, and why sociological and anthropological approaches to global health are critical to improving these interventions. "
40,ColgateUni,P ANTH 228 - Women and Gender in Prehistory (MC) ,"P Takes a feminist perspective to the study of gender and identity in prehistoric societies and ancient civilizations. By looking at the variation of gender roles and relations throughout history and cross-culturally, students help to deconstruct many modem-day assumptions about gender and gender roles in the present. The course will provide an overview of how material remains are used for understanding social identities in the past. It will review feminist critiques of archaeology and how feminism has impacted the discipline of archaeology. Students examine archaeological resources for gendering the past (burials, art, artifacts) and explore gender in a range of prehistoric cultural contexts (hunter-gatherers, farmers, states, and empires) using archaeological case studies as examples. Students additionally look at the ways in which historical archaeology has helped to better understand gender relations in historical contexts. Students critically examine how gender and identity have been represented in academic research, museums, and popular media, in order to deconstruct modem-day assumptions about gender. Case studies derive from the earliest human origins, ancient complex civilizations, and recent colonial America. This course is designed for students with little or no background in archaeology or anthropology. "
41,ColgateUni,P ANTH 230 - Astronomy in Culture (MC) ,"P Deals with the development of astronomy and, in a more general sense, with the relationship between the natural world and people in different societies and walks of life. Students examine the role of the sky in shaping religions and political ideologies in various kinds of cultures, among them hunter-gatherers, agrarian societies, and dynasties. Specific goals of the course include 1) gaining familiarization with the sky as seen with the naked eye, 2) understanding how various ways of comprehending the sky shape a society's world view, and 3) examining where cross-cultural parallels exist by seeking out the similarities and differences between the development of techno-assisted Western science and the so-called ""ethno-sciences"" in other cultures, both ancient and contemporary. Lectures are accompanied by sessions in the planetarium of the Ho Tung Visualization Lab, as well as out of doors, weather permitting. (MC) "
42,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 240 - World Archaeology, Material Culture, and Identity ","P From Neolithic settlements to the great cities of the ancient world, such as Uruk, Mohenjo Daro, Pompeii, Copan, and Teotihuacan, and encompassing Native American remains in our local central New York environment, this interdisciplinary course offers a global study of archaeology and focuses on the role of material culture in shaping human identity. The course entertains questions such as, how did the world's first great cities come to be? Where did writing come from? Why did ancient people all over the world revere their dead? What ends did human sacrifice serve? What are the lessons of archaeology regarding the human transformation of the environment? Perspectives on these issues are offered by faculty who specialize in a wide range of facets of the study of archaeology in different cultures of the world. "
43,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 242 - The Archaeology of Race and Ethnicity in America (MC, GR) ","P Explores the history of different ethnic groups in America through the study of their material remains: living quarters, burials, food remains, tools, toys, etc. Students consider how these material remains are used for understanding social identities in the past, specifically race and ethnicity in the United States, as well as the lasting impact of past events on the present day. Students also critically examine how race and ethnicity have been portrayed and ignored in museum displays and popular media. Some of the key questions students seek to address include: What is ethnicity and where does it come from? How has archaeology been used as a social weapon? What was the experience of ethnic and racial minorities in the United States and how can archaeology contribute to that history? How can archaeologists more effectively collaborate with descendant communities and work with museums to create a more inclusive history? (MC, GR) "
44,ColgateUni,P ANTH 244 - Who Owns Culture? ,"P Who owns a song? Who owns the tango dance? Who owns knowledge about medicinal plants? Key anthropological questions about culture and property intersect in each of these questions. Native and indigenous societies, whose views on cultural property and heritage have long been marginalized, bring their own perspectives to these questions. With reference to critical anthropological literature, this course uses specific case studies to examine local and global intellectual property and cultural heritage regimes. The topics in this course intersect with the fields of legal anthropology, cultural studies, Native American studies, museum studies, and indigenous studies. "
45,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics (MC) ","P The words ""nature"" and ""the environment"" conjure up visions of wild animals and open landscapes, but are people part of nature, too? This course shows how nature and human culture are intertwined, both in terms of how we shape our environment as well as how it shapes us. Through a series of case studies, students explore this relationship, focusing especially on the way that nature and culture are ""political"": inequalities, social problems and movements, and power relations all flow from the way that we interact with our environment. The course takes a global, comparative, and historical view of this process, and includes the following special topics: the rise of environmental awareness and environmental social movements; globalization and environmental values; consumption and the environment; environmental inequalities and justice; risk, technology, and environmental politics; and public policy and the environment. (MC) "
46,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 248 - African Art (MC, GR) ","P A study of the principal art styles of sub-Saharan Africa, this course gives attention to both the formal and cultural aspects of indigenous art. The manufacture and usage of art objects is examined within the contexts of local religious, social, and political systems, as well as within the larger framework of language and cultural areas. Traditional art styles are analyzed as products of both collective aesthetics and individual innovation. Attention is given to transmission of art forms from culture to culture and to the persistence of traditional art in the face of social change. (MC, GR) "
47,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 249 - Art and Architecture of the Ancient Americas (MC, GR) ","P Examines the principal art styles of the pre-Columbian cultures of South and Middle America, while also considering their impact on the art of indigenous cultures of North America. Relying on archaeological and art historical sources, students discover the usefulness of art and architecture in reconstructing the cultures of the pre-Columbian past. The course also considers the relationship of art and architecture to the environment; the effects of migration, trade, warfare, and technological innovation on the development of art styles; and the use of art in maintaining social hierarchies, political institutions, and religious systems. (MC, GR) "
48,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 250 - Native Art of North America (MC, GR) ","P Relying on archaeological, art historical, and ethnographic sources, this course examines the principal art styles of the indigenous cultures of North America. The course explores such issues as the usefulness of art objects in reconstructing cultures of the past and as historical documents for living peoples; gender roles in art production; the relationship between art, technology, and utility; the use of art as educational tools, memory aids, and religious devices; the relative importance of tradition and innovation; and the role of contemporary art in Native North American life today. (MC, GR) "
49,ColgateUni,P ANTH 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
50,ColgateUni,P ANTH 305 - Techno-Science in Society (MC) ,"P Critically examines techno-science as a transnational social-cultural phenomenon. The term ""technoscience"" refers to the fusion of science and technology under modern global capitalism. Using the tools of anthropology, this course explores how techno-science is embedded in social-cultural, political and economic systems and processes. Case studies drawn from the Global North and South show how the context in which techno-science is produced and consumed matters. They reveal how critical examination of different sciences and scientists teaches us as much about the social world as it does about the natural one, and challenge the divide between the two. They also demonstrate how techno-science is a transnational phenomenon, in which ideas, objects, methods and practices change as they travel. (MC) "
51,ColgateUni,P ANTH 315 - Gender and Culture ,"P Focuses on gender as a culturally constructed, historically variable, and politically contested category rather than an immutable biological ""given."" Students have two major objectives: first, to develop a cross-cultural understanding of femininity, masculinity, androgyny, and gendered phenomena generally by examining and comparing gender relations and gender ideologies in a wide variety of human societies, ranging from small bands of hunters and gatherers to post-industrial states; and second, to develop a critical understanding of the types of theories, methods, and data that are relevant to the study of gender and sexuality - including heteronormativity, same-sex relations, transgender practices and identities, ""third sexes,"" and ""third genders"" - in anthropology and related disciplines. "
52,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 316 - Religion, Culture, and Media ","P Explores the media practices through which people create and negotiate religious value and meaning. It takes as its staring premise the idea that all religious activity is mediated as well as sensual and that, through anthropological theories of religion, culture, and media, one can gain insight into religions' growing political power today. The course involves active participant observation of ritual performances and media as well as substantial engagement with theoretical questions anthropologists have posed about religion, ritual, and media over the last century. "
53,ColgateUni,P ANTH 322 - Medical Anthropology ,"P Introduces students to medical anthropology—the study of the relationships among cultures, social systems, the environment, and disease and healing. Interpretations of health and illness, and the experience of one's body are often taken for granted. Yet our ideas about and experiences of health, disease, and medicine are profoundly shaped by culture; by transnational flow of people, ideas, and resources; by histories of colonialism and structural inequalities; and by the development of new technologies. This course introduces students to approaches used by medical anthropologists to study the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of the human experience of the body, health, illness, and healing. Topics covered include cultural interpretations of sickness and healing, cultural ideas about the body, social and environmental causes of illness, the effects of poverty on health, the roles of doctors and healers in society, cultural clashes and ethical issues in health care delivery, anthropological critiques of Western biomedicine, and the place of medical anthropology in the study of public health. "
54,ColgateUni,P ANTH 330 - Deep Time: Representing the Human Past in Contemporary South Africa (Extended Study) ,"P Focuses on how the ""deep African past"" has been imagined and represented by authoritative knowledge-producing institutions including academic disciplines like Anthropology and Archaeology, museums, and site-specific public education projects. The course also considers how authoritative interpretations of ""the past"" reflect contemporary political and nationalist interests, biases, and knowledge-producing projects. The course asks how some indigenous peoples become enshrined as exemplars of the generalized human past, and how their representation shifts with changing views of human nature. The three-week extended study component in South Africa will visit museums, archaeological sites, and historical monuments to more recent events in the history of that country. "
55,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 337 - Globalization, Culture and Everyday Life ","P What does ""globalization"" mean, and what does it mean for societies and people facing the onslaught of global corporations? This course examines the phenomenon of globalization from a variety of theoretical perspectives, ranging from neo-liberal economics to cultural anthropology. It analyzes how each of these works defines the causes of globalization and its effects on traditional cultures, community relationships, economic wealth and justice, and political institutions. To put these theoretical works in perspective, interspersed with them will be actual case studies of real people and real communities, ranging from Costa Rican farmers to Thai factory workers, interacting with the forces of globalization. These case studies will allow students to test the abstract analyses and see which theories fit reality. "
56,ColgateUni,P ANTH 339 - Corporations and Power ,"P Business corporations are among the most influential institutions on the earth today. This course examines the place of corporations in the contemporary world, focusing on their roles critically in global political-economic and social systems, and in our own lives. It considers how studying business corporations can help to better understand capitalism, globalization, work, consumerism, law, inequality, cultural change and personhood. The course delves into case studies that follow transnational corporations from Silicon Valley, to Papua New Guinea, and back again. In addition, the course includes a research component in which students will conduct and analyze original interviews. "
57,ColgateUni,P ANTH 340 - Contemporary Issues in Native American Art ,"P Examines the responses of Native American artists and critics to issues that face Native American and First Nations peoples of the United States and Canada today. The course first considers the political, social, and economic milieu in which modern and contemporary indigenous art developed. It evaluates terms such as ""traditional"" and ""contemporary"" in discussing indigenous art. The course then focuses on Native artists of the last twenty-five years and the issues addressed in their work. "
58,ColgateUni,P ANTH 350 - Theorizing Contemporary Cultures ,"P Anthropologists are philosophers of the social. With firm roots in classical social theory, anthropologists have always questioned the relationship of materiality and imagination in human culture, the dialectic of individual and social, the structures of power and authority, the pull of kinship and cosmology, and the cultural patterning of time, space, gender, and story. Anthropology trains our attention on big questions of comparative and global import, but seeks answers in concrete things that people do, say, and make. Anthropological theory thus rests on the empiricism of ethnography, archaeology, and material studies, and provides the questions that drive research. This course links contemporary theoretical work in the discipline with essential forerunner texts and projects. It also considers influential texts from theorists outside the discipline proper, recognizing that anthropology takes insights from many theoretical quarters, and in turn informs theoretical endeavors across the social sciences and humanities. "
59,ColgateUni,P ANTH 355 - Ancient Aztec Civilization ,"P Debate key issues surrounding the Aztecs of Central Mexico using archaeological and written evidence to understand ancient Aztec culture. This course explores the great technological achievements of Aztec civilization, its complex rituals and beliefs, bustling marketplaces and cities, and the everyday lives of ordinary people. Questions addressed include: Who were the Aztecs? Why did the Aztecs practice human sacrifice and cannibalism? How did the Aztecs become the largest empire in ancient Mesoamerica? Did the Aztec Empire promote the well-being of its commoners? Was religion used as a tool of domination? What was the role of women in Aztec society? Why did the Aztec Empire fall to the Spanish? What happened to people following the fall of the Aztec Empire? Students will integrate primary sources, archaeological research, and ethnohistory to uncover the Aztec past. "
60,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 356 - Ethical Issues in Native American Archaeology (MC, GR) ","P Examines a range of significant ethical issues relating to the archaeology of Native Americans in North America primarily, but also to some extent in Central and South America. Students not only read about and discuss conflicting perspectives leading to ethical dilemmas, but also propose solutions and evaluate existing policies to combat such problems. Some of the key topics covered in the course include the conservation ethic and stewardship; excavation and repatriation of Native American skeletal remains and sacred objects; looting, collecting, and commodification of Native American archaeological sites and artifacts; and public and postgraduate education. In short, the class actively engages in the critical ethical, theoretical, and legal debates surrounding Native American archaeology that have emerged over the past 30 years. (MC, GR) "
61,ColgateUni,P ANTH 357 - Indigenous Politics of Latin America (GR) ,"P At the end of the 20th century, different indigenous or native peoples' voices seemed to become more prominent in Latin American social movements. These movements included an uprising to stop the advances of globalization, struggles to control resources, demands for dignity and recognition, and struggles against corporate environmental degradation. The apparent resurgence of Latin American indigenous politics is connected, in part, to global initiatives, like the work on what would become the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous politics in Latin America ultimately pose questions about customary, national, and international legal frameworks. This course works at the intersection of local and global understandings of what it means to be indigenous in different Latin American contexts. The course is taught through the disciplinary lens of anthropology, and readings are selected from case studies in Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. (GR) "
62,ColgateUni,P ANTH 358 - Native American Cultures (GR) ,"P Focuses on the comparative and historical study of Native American cultures and societies throughout the Americas. Through the reading of several ethnographies, students compare and contrast Native American social, religious, political, and economic institutions and practices from the time of European contact to the present day. (GR) "
63,ColgateUni,P ANTH 359 - Archaeology and Ethnology of Southwestern Indians (Study Group) ,"P Highlight the deep time depth and diversity of the traditional cultures of the Southwest. Topics will include environments and traditional technologies that underlie the transition from Paleoindian big game hunters to Puebloan farmers over the past 10,000 plus years. Review the dramatic changes of the past 400 years of cultural contact and conflict during the Spanish, Mexican, and American periods in the Northern Southwest. "
64,ColgateUni,P ANTH 360 - Comparative Cosmologies (MC) ,"P Concentrates on the description and analysis of cosmological models and world views, primarily as revealed through myth, developed by a variety of ancient and contemporary societies. One goal in formulating a contrast between Western and non-Western aspects of world view is determining which concepts and ideas might emerge as common to all cultures as opposed to being unique in American society: Do all societies believe in a beginning and an end to their universe? To what extent are cosmological ideas reflected in urban planning and particularly in the design of sacred space? In what specific ways do developed world views depend upon cycles of social interaction? (MC) "
65,ColgateUni,P ANTH 361 - Ancient Environments and Human Legacies (MC) ,"P Many, if not most of today's geopolitical problems can be traced to how people interact with the environment. Warfare, globalization, market economies, food production, ethnic conflicts, and disease are all contingent on the relationship between human beings and their environments. This course focuses on the complexity and nuance of those relationships through both space and time by utilizing an archaeological perspective. While many academic fields now focus on topics relating to environments, archaeology works with a dataset that spans the entirety of human history. Such a dataset allows archaeological researchers to ask powerful and fundamental questions, such as: How do human societies respond to environmental change? Have human beings ever successfully found a balance between themselves and their natural world? What events created today's environmental challenges? What leads to the downfall of a society? This course will consider questions like these through various case-studies across the globe that deal with the diversity of human societies and the specific environments from which they emerged. (MC) "
66,ColgateUni,P ANTH 362 - Political Anthropology ,"P Examines human political action in a variety of societies, both within and outside established political structures. Beginning with the attempt to construct truly cross-cultural definitions of power and politics, students look at examples of both centralized and un-centralized systems of authority and management. Topics include the management of cooperation and collective action in the absence of formal leadership roles; the use of informal mechanisms such as gossip, witchcraft, and influence; succession to office and the symbols and ceremonies surrounding the transfer of power; the construction of group identities based on race, ethnicity, and class; gender relations as a domain of political action; ethnicity, nationalism, and ethnic conflict; and the particular perspective anthropology can bring to the study of politics. "
67,ColgateUni,P ANTH 363 - Globalization and Social Change in Latin America (GR) ,"P Latin America has been globalized since before Napoleon invented the term ""Latin America"" to describe the Spanish, Portuguese, and French colonies to our south. This course explores the changing reality of what globalization means in Latin America. It examines the legacies of European colonization and African slavery; the struggles against transnational, national, and local forms of inequality; and the different ways that globalization is experience by people today. Through case studies from South, Central, and North America, students focus on the themes of ethnicity, race, gender, social class, national citizenship, and transnational market production and consumption. The course uses an anthropological lens to analyze pressing social issues affecting Latin America, and Latin Americans, today. (GR) "
68,ColgateUni,P ANTH 365 - Andean Lives (GR) ,"P While the Andes region may evoke quaint images often seen in tourism advertisements, a focus on the people living in this region reflects globally interconnected dynamics. The course engages with diverse authors who write about the Andes: as a place steeped in highland indigenous traditions; as the place of the Inca Empire; as a place of rural communities in which collective action can take priority over individual interest; as the original source of the coca leaf that has ritual significance through the region and contested political significance in the international sphere; as the birthplace of a Maoist guerrilla movement in the last gasp of the Cold War; and as the place where social movements have challenged global economic systems and brought an indigenous president to power. Through details about the lives of those who reside in the Andes, this course brings together anthropological and historical views of this region with cases primarily from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. (GR) "
69,ColgateUni,P ANTH 371 - Gender and Society in Africa (GR) ,"P Examines traditional notions about men, women, and reproduction from a number of African societies. Focuses on the impact of European colonialism and other foreign political and economic institutions on women and men. Finally, students study the role of gender in present-day African states, including participation in national life under democratic, socialist, and military regimes, and the challenges and options presented by the future. (GR) "
70,ColgateUni,P ANTH 372 - Anthropological Theory and Archaeological Praxis (MC) ,"P Examines the interplay between theoretical trends in anthropology and the emergence of a reflexive practice of archaeology. Formal archaeology in the U.S. was a latecomer to anthropology, appearing during the era of Franz Boas. Somewhat later, the field became methodologically standardized as a result of the New Deal. After World War II, Americanist archaeology became a battle ground for competing perspectives in anthropology, fueled in part by the appearance of the National Science Foundation. Today, archaeology in the United States and Europe confronts and integrates numerous new critiques and theoretical perspectives, many of which arrive from recent trends in anthropology and various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Among the topics addressed are cultural evolutionary theory, geoarchaeology, postcolonial critiques, practice theory, embodiment theory, gender archaeology, critical theory, discourse analysis, and indigenous archaeologies. The overarching goal is to assess the state of the art in anthropological approaches to the production of knowledge in archaeology. (MC) "
71,ColgateUni,P ANTH 374 - Anthropology of Media: Mass-Mediated Cultures ,"P Examines media in local, national, and global contexts. More specifically, it draws on media theory and on specific ethnographic cases to discern the social force of modern mass-mediated communication within and across contemporary cultures. Topics include the technologization of old media, language and performance; the emergence of mass-mediated ""imagined"" communities; and new social media networks. "
72,ColgateUni,P ANTH 375 - Captured by the Lens: Photography in Anthropology and Archaeology ,"P Examines the role that photography has played in the emergence of anthropology and archaeology as disciplines. Beginning in the 1860s, advances in technology turned the camera into a standard piece of fieldwork equipment, and a range of image genres emerged as cameras were taken on-site and into the field. Part of the course is historical and archival in intention, and examines the emergence of these image genres, asking questions about the nature of the gaze, about forms of representation, and about the relationship between the visual imagination and more empirically imagined knowledge projects. Another part of the course examines contemporary photographic practices and the leaking of anthropological image genres like the ethnographic photograph into popular forms. Students take a case-study approach and look at individual sites, photographers, and bodies of work, alongside a close reading of contemporary theory. Students are encouraged to take their own photographs, and the course concludes with an exhibition of student work. "
73,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 376 - Archaeology of the Inkas and their Ancestors (MC, GR) ","P Explores the many cultures that flourished in the Central Andes of South America, from the Inka Empire to the earliest inhabitants during the Paleolithic. By examining the cities, shrines, and habitations they left behind, archaeology allows for unique glimpses into the Pre-Columbian past in an area of the world with no written records prior to the 16th Century. Students trace the development of long-distance trade, the origins of agriculture, the spread of early religious traditions, and the formation of the first cities and empires in South America. In addition to learning the cultural history of the Central Andes, students engage in contemporary debates including cultural tourism and the popularization of the Andean past; art markets, looting, and ownership of archaeological remains; and the relationship of present-day Andean communities to their material heritage. (MC, GR) "
74,ColgateUni,P ANTH 378 - Social Theory of Everyday Life ,"P Since classical times, philosophers and historians have studied and recorded the details of everyday life with an eye to grasping the meaning of social practice. The past 50 years, however, have seen the bourgeoning of an exciting body of critical theory on the quotidian. Much of this work is concerned with profound questions about how the systems, structures, and practices of modernity shape basic human interactions with things, with places, and with other persons, and how these, in turn, reproduce social structures. This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed. "
75,ColgateUni,"P ANTH 382 - Nations, Power, Islam: Muslim Identity and Community in the Global Age (GR) ","P Muslims today belong at once to a global community of the faithful and to particular ethnic and national bodies. This course examines the social significance of these intersections of identity and community: What political, cultural, and religious conflicts and negotiations mark Muslim identity in the global age? Initial readings survey the colonial age, which forced the integration of Muslim communities into the global capitalist and state systems. With this foundation students then address specific conflicts and congruencies of contemporary Muslim identity in both the Muslim world and the West: between Islamic law and national-state laws; between local Islamic norms and transnational flows of media, persons, and products; between popular Islam and political power. How do these issues affect Muslims and their neighbors? How do they affect geopolitics? What is the present and future of the ""global village""? (GR) "

91,ColgateUni,P ARTS 236 - Realism and Impressionism: Global Styles (AH) ,"P From the 1820s to 1880, artists working on traditional media such as painting and sculpture, as well as on new ones such as photography, engaged everyday life in an environment transformed by industrialization, urbanization, and imperialism. In this period, modern art developed some of its characteristic strategies, such as an emphasis on originality, an ambivalent relation with tradition, problematic ties with cultural and economic institutions, and a strained allegiance to radical politics. This course explores the exhibitions, institutions, and art-critical discourses supporting the circulation of art, with particular regard to the impact of nationalism and globalization on the production and dissemination of art objects. "
92,ColgateUni,P ARTS 238 - Avant-Gardes: 1880-1920 (AH) ,"P This is a critical and historical survey of the visual arts from 1880 to 1920, examining how modern art transformed in reaction and response to radical technological, social, and political change.

The course examines problems of representation, abstraction, and modernism as they are exemplified in painting, drawing, and sculpture, alongside the newer media of photography, assemblage, film, and collage. "
93,ColgateUni,P ARTS 239 - Global Modernisms 1920-1950 (AH) ,"P World War II, totalitarian regimes, and revolutions form the backdrop for this global study of art and artists during the middle of the 20th century. Begins with an examination of the challenges to rationalism raised by the Dada and Surrealists groups in the context of World War I and its aftermath. The course also considers the forms of realism that coalesced concurrently in several countries as a reaction to the shifting political landscape of the interwar years. The reemergence of abstract painting at mid-century is considered in relation to the theoretical formation of modernist criticism and the tensions of the Cold War. Through the analysis of case studies — such as iconic exhibitions and the publication of key theoretical interventions — the students will develop close readings of objects and texts and situate them in their geo-political, theoretical, and social contexts. "

Eager to shake off colonial influences, Irish writers have sought to define a distinctly Irish literary tradition. This project characteristically worked by turning to history older than anything English, either to the forgotten writings of Irish antiquity or to elements from Classical antiquity.

The focus of this course is the concept of the African diaspora with its broad cultural, social, political, and economic implications. Students explore how these texts represent women's experience cross-culturally.

398,ColgateUni,P ENGL 334 - African American Literature ,"P A study of works by and about black Americans.

402,ColgateUni,P ENGL 339 - Modernist Poetry ,"P A study of selected British and American poets active between 1900 and 1950. Amidst all the discourse about the ""postmodern,"" it becomes increasingly clear that there is no consensus on what it is ""post."" More recent versions of the ""postmodern"" argue that it is not a period but a mode - one coeval with Modernism itself. Modernity and postmodernity can thus be understood only in relation to one another. This course pursues that relation by focusing on poets like W.H. Auden, Sterling Brown, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Muriel Rukeyser, Wallace Stevens, Melvin Tolson, or William Carlos Williams. "

While this historical framing is central to the organization of the course, the study is not strictly a historical survey, but rather an attempt to read Jamaican literature produced at different historical moments, in rural and urban, global and local spaces, and across perspectives mediated by differences and convergences of race, gender, sexuality, and location. Writers may include Claude McKay, Roger Mais, Erna Brodber, Curdella Forbes, Margaret Cezair-Thompson, among others.

Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides.

440,ColgateUni,P ENGL 444 - Modern Wisdom Literature ,"P Developing from the ""wisdom literatures"" of both Greco-Roman and Hebrew tradition, the modern aphorism is characterized by its brief and often pointed expression of an observation or precept. It differs from, say, maxims, proverbs, or apothegms in that it turns on paradox and antithesis; it differs from earlier forms in the ways it undermines rather than supports certainty. This seminar explores the relations of literary form to convictions about the nature and limits of human knowledge, habits of reading, and its uses in life. The course follows the transformation of the aphorism both as form and as impulse as it is reinvented in the Modern period-chiefly following the example of Friedrich Nietzsche-and explores its character as a lyrical corrective to overly definitive and linear ways of organizing and writing about experience. "
441,ColgateUni,P ENGL 445 - Life Writing: The Renaissance ,"P An exploration of the relationship between life writing, as practiced by modern biographers of Renaissance subjects, together with the autobiography and ""self-fashioning"" practiced by early modern subjects.

Land trusts are non-profit organizations with missions to protect natural resources (e.g., clean water, forests, and open space) of value to their members. Students will work as members of an interdisciplinary team to develop solutions to complex problems faced by land trusts in central New York. Lectures and discussions regarding conservation theory and practices provide an intellectual framework for these applied projects. Students will gain practical experience working in interdisciplinary teams and using contemporary technologies to facilitate effective collaboration. "
456,ColgateUni,"P ENST 316 - Nature, Technology, and the Human Prospect ","P Explores the complex interrelationships among Nature, technology, and people, especially the interactions that reconfigure what it means to be human. The aggregate significance of modern technologies is radically transforming the natural and human-built world in good and bad ways, even within remote societies and ecosystems. How do technologies control or influence the ways people value parts of the world over other parts, the ways they value the moment over the future and the past, the ways they value rapid change and innovation over long-standing traditions and slow-changing landscapes? These are some of the complex moral issues raised by the technological enhancement across the globe that is examined by careful reading, writing, argumentative discourse. "
457,ColgateUni,P ENST 319 - Food ,"P Food is fundamental — it sustains us and is essential for our survival — but food is more than just what we eat. Food is also a commodity with complex global markets and ecological impacts; it is highly regulated through our political processes and institutions; and it forms a key part of our culture and the social rhythms of everyday life. This course explores these many dimensions of food, focusing especially on key questions about where it comes from, how it is produced, and how it is embedded in our economic, political, and cultural institutions. Students participate in a service learning internship at Common Thread Community Farm in Madison, NY. The course also involves field trips to and guest speakers from local food and farming communities. "
458,ColgateUni,"P ENST 324 - Hunting, Eating, Vegetarianism ","P Historically, hunting for food has represented one of the most direct ways in which people have engaged with nature. Some scholars even believe that the ""hunting instinct"" is a fundamental aspect of human identity. People in modern industrialized societies, however, often have little idea about the origins of the flesh they consume, most of which is raised and slaughtered on an industrial-scale. While the majority continue to eat meat, poultry, and/or fish, a minority have chosen to become locavores, vegetarians, or even vegans for ethical, religious, cultural, health-oriented, or environmental reasons. Others continue to hunt and fish but within ecosystems dramatically altered by human intervention and amidst cultural landscapes complicated by commercialized and trophy hunting. Drawing upon a wide range of sources including literature, artistic and documentary films, works of popular culture, autobiographical accounts, online hunting (and anti-hunting) forums, diverse web resources, self-reflective essays, and scholarly approaches ranging from animal studies to humanistic ecocriticism, this course investigates the intertwined themes of hunting, industrial versus family farming and slaughter, eating, vegetarianism, and the ethical and existential choices they present to members of modern industrialized societies. Fishing and fish farming are also considered more briefly. "
459,ColgateUni,P ENST 333 - Environment and Community Health in Africa: A Case Study in Rural Uganda (Extended Study) ,"P The majority of this extended study is held in villages proximate to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in southwestern Uganda.

461,ColgateUni,P ENST 340 - Environmental Cleanup: Methods and Regulation ,"P Introduces students to the major hazardous environmental pollution problems in the US and the regulatory framework within which these problems are managed. Students will be challenged to examine the processes and structures that lead to hazardous environmental pollution, the strategies that are used to clean up environmentally polluted spaces and determine the major hazardous pollutants that are of highest concern for federal regulators. Additionally, students will critically assess the current regulatory framework for environmental pollution control, determining the strengths and weaknesses of these statues. Finally students will be presented with the opportunity to research and develop cleanup plans for a specific contaminated site based on field trips to local sites. "
462,ColgateUni,P ENST 344 - Managing Complexity: America's Public Lands ,"P Public land management is inherently complex. Typically there are multiple interested parties and potentially competing goals such as wilderness preservation, recreational accessibility, and resource exploitation. Also, the management of public lands may rest with several agencies. Management decisions made in pursuit of one goal often have implications for other goals, stakeholders, and management agencies. Complexity theory offers a new perspective for understanding the complicated workings of ecosystems, economies, and political systems. Such complex adaptive systems are characterized by feedback loops, chaos, nonlinear dynamics, self-organization, and emergence. The aims of this course are to investigate alternative public land management strategies and apply complexity theory 1) to model qualitatively the intricacies of both natural and human-built systems, 2) to propose and evaluate fresh ecological strategies and management policies for conserving public lands, and 3) to investigate new procedures for mitigating tension among competing interests in the use of public land. The course includes some weekend field trips. "

Films depicting immigration, exile, the refugee, insider/outsider status, and other modes of geographic movement are explored. "
469,ColgateUni,P FMST 212 - Global Media: Flows & Counterflows ,"P Regulating and being regulated by a variety of information flows on a daily basis from SMS texts, snapchats, and tweets, to live news feeds, corporate data transfers, and government communiques. We increasingly experience our private and public lives as a hypermediated encounter with the world at large. What impact do these media flows have on our experiences of the local and the global? Simultaneously, how should we understand contemporary mass media themselves as ""global""? Have transformations in print, broadcast, and digital media fundamentally altered how we think of the near and the far, the familiar and the foreign, the national and the transnational, the West and the non-West? This course will address these questions through the two structuring notions of the ""flow"" and the ""counter-flow,"" and analyze the role that media play as both a unifying and a divisive agent, consolidating identities and nationalisms in some instances, and deterritorializing the same in others. "
470,ColgateUni,P FMST 246 - Introduction to Performance Studies ,"P What is performance? The verb ""to perform"" can be variously defined as ""to carry out an action,"" ""to discharge a duty,"" ""to accomplish a task,"" and ""to present to an audience."" Interdisciplinary in nature, students explores performance in the context of the performing and media arts, as well as in the context of ritual, politics, and everyday life. Emphasizes the relationship between performance and race, gender, sexuality, and other vectors of identity: how are various types of difference enacted, articulated, and represented through performative acts?

472,ColgateUni,P FMST 320 - European Film History and Theory ,"P An introduction to the methods, concepts, movements, and reception of European cinema from 1945 to the present. Selectively surveying the history and theory of Western, Central, and Eastern European filmmaking, students juxtapose the close study of narrative and film form with theoretical texts. From neorealism to the transnational in film, from the postcolonial to double occupancies, lessons emphasize the historic hybridity of commercial and experimental film in Europe and complicate auteurist approaches to European film culture. The postwar thematic motifs which continually surface in European film's changing social and aesthetic landscape (marginality, desire, and the metropolis) is a focal point of discussion and reflection. "
473,ColgateUni,P FMST 320L - Required Film Screening ,P Required corequisite to FMST 320. 
474,ColgateUni,"P FMST 324 - Cinema, Sensation, & Body ","P To what extent does watching a movie imitate the body's own sensorial encounters with the world? How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema's bodily representations, and the relationship between the viewer's body and the events on the screen. The approach is organized around weekly film screenings that include silent film, art cinema, experimental cinema, classical Hollywood melodrama, and the horror film. Readings explore phenomenological theories of the body by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Vivian Sobchack, Jennifer Baker, Elena del Rio, Laura Marks, Martine Beugnet, and Steven Shaviro. Students explore related approaches such as affect theory, feminism, and the relationship of bodily representation to painting, especially in the depiction of masochism. "
475,ColgateUni,P FMST 333 - Documentary Film ,"P Surveys the traditions of personal, experimental, ethnographic, and political documentary filmmaking. This overview of the history and aesthetics of documentary examines its origins, forms, goals, and contemporary styles while at the same time problematizing its canonical readings and reception. Issues covered include documentary styles, documentary representation of history and memory, the filmmaker's relationship to the subject and the viewer, and the impact of technology on documentary techniques. Particular attention is paid to the influence that certain social and political movements have had on documentaries and filmmakers. A required film series accompanying the class includes works by directors such as Flaherty, Riefenstahl, Wiseman, Rouch, Morris, Moffatt, and many others. "
476,ColgateUni,P FMST 360 - The Cultural History of the Internet ,"P Examines the emergence, development, and socio-political outcomes of the explosion of online networks and social groups in the 20th and 21st Century. As the lines between the virtual and the real comingle with increasing fluidity, the defining characteristics of community, society, democracy, nation, and selfhood are fundamentally transformed. The hyper-accelerated and globalizing force of the Internet has been met with triumphalism from cyber-utopians and vehement caution from skeptics. Only one thing is certain, the organizing forces of online life have transformed the social fabric of global society. Examining the fluctuating character of citizenship, community, social identity, leisure, labor and economy, love and sexuality, privacy, and social mobilization, we will examine a cross-section of literature on post-Internet life. "
477,ColgateUni,P FMST 374 - Anthropology of Media: Mass-Mediated Cultures ,"P Examines media in local, national, and global contexts. More specifically, it draws on media theory and on specific ethnographic cases to discern the social force of modern mass-mediated communication within and across contemporary cultures. Topics include the technologization of old media, language and performance; the emergence of mass-mediated ""imagined"" communities; and new media social networks. "
478,ColgateUni,P FMST 375 - Media and Politics ,"P Uses a social scientific approach to examine the role that the media plays in American politics.

499,ColgateUni,P FREN 425 - Libertine Fiction of the French 18th Century ,"P Beginning in the 17th century under the label libertinage érudit, libertine fiction evolves into a major genre in the Enlightenment. The course follows its development through readings of Prèvost, Crébillon fils, Diderot, Denon, and Sade, and explores the following questions: How do philosophy, fiction, and sexual politics coalesce in libertine literature? How can one reconcile libertinage - a way of living and writing frequently reduced to passion and sensuality - with the broader currents of the most ""rational"" century in French literary history? An exploration of libertine literature thus entails a focus on cultural history, and serves as a point of departure for a broader reflection on the Enlightenment. "
500,ColgateUni,P FREN 427 - Literature of the Renaissance ,"P A detailed study of the lyric poetry of Louise Labé, Pierre Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Clément Marot. The course explores how each writer seeks to create his or her own unique poetic style within the context of the intense literary creation and experimentation that characterize Renaissance France. Special attention is given to the themes of love and Classical mythology as sources of poetic inspiration. Some attention to Renaissance painting, to the lyric poetry of François Villon, and to selected prose of Marguerite de Navarre, Montaigne, and Rabelais is given in order to illustrate the enormous and varied impact of humanism and the Italian Renaissance. "
501,ColgateUni,P FREN 429 - The Age of Enlightenment ,"P Examines some of the relationships between Enlightenment thought and the dominant forms of written expression in the French 18th century. Through readings, students consider a number of the Enlightenment's most pressing concerns, such as moral and political philosophy, religious and civil tolerance, natural law, and the role of literature and the arts in society, among others. Authors read include Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Beaumarchais, and Sade. "
502,ColgateUni,P FREN 430 - Literature of Adventure and Quest ,P Studies the evolution and transmutation of conventions of quest literature from the Middle Ages to the present day.

Readings range from the romances of Chrétien de Troyes to the contemporary French novel. 
503,ColgateUni,P FREN 431 - Molière and La Fontaine ,"P The course provides a detailed study of two major comic writers of French classical literature, emphasizing especially the creation of individual comic and satirical styles within the classical tradition. The course examines both specific themes such as the images of king, court, and society, and also more general literary and cultural questions. These include the nature of comedy, the relationship between popular culture and literary art, and the problem of literary translation. Readings are drawn from the farces, short plays, and major works of Molière and from the Fables, the Contes et nouvelles, and selected minor poems of La Fontaine, as well as from La Fontaine's legacy in pictorial art and folklore. "
504,ColgateUni,P FREN 433 - The Court of Louis XIV ,"P The theme of the court is used to explore the major works in prose and poetry of classical France, reading these works as examples both of insightful social analysis and of outstanding achievements in literary style and art. Readings are drawn primarily from the works of Madame de Sévigné, Racine, Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Lafayette, and La Bruyère. Key topics include the relationship between writer and society in 17th-century France, Versailles as a theatrical setting for the Sun-King, and literature as both social commentary and divertissement. The seminar also studies the theme of the court as it is expressed in 17th-century painting and music. "
505,ColgateUni,P FREN 440 - Contemporary French Civilization (Dijon Study Group) ,"P Examines, by means of lecture and discussion, the impact of geography, demography, history, politics, economics, patterns of behavior, and the French cultural heritage on contemporary France. "

One dimension of the course will involve student translations of various poems throughout the semester. Each student will thereby create an anthology of poems in translation to be shared during a public reading at the end of the term. "
508,ColgateUni,P FREN 445 - 20th-Century French Autobiography ,"P Examines the development and specificities of 20th-century autobiographical texts. While the main focus is on the texts themselves, some related theoretical problems are also considered, such as the conditions and possibility of writing the ""self""; autobiography's link to other types of personal writings; its relationship to fiction; and its role in our modern definition of ""humanity."" This genre being rooted in questions of the emergence of the ""self,"" particular attention is given to women, homosexuals, and Francophone writers, who were traditionally regarded as ""other."" Authors read may include Proust, Gide, Sartre, Beauvoir, Sarraute, Leiris, Yourcenar, Bigras, Laye, Leduc, and Roy. "
509,ColgateUni,P FREN 447 - The French Novel in the Romantic Period ,"P Focuses on the novel in the first half of the 19th century. The texts selected for discussion, as well as the visual materials used in the course, are centered on the representation of the hero in crisis in post-revolutionary France. The course examines critically such issues as le mal du siècle, changing conceptions of the self and gender relations in the wake of the French Revolution, social ambition and the desire to succeed, and the impact of the city on the individual. Works by such authors as Chateaubriand, Mme de Duras, Hugo, Sand, Constant, Stendhal, and Balzac are studied in the context of the dominant literary mode of Romanticism and the changing political and social scene under the Restoration and the July Monarchy. "
510,ColgateUni,P FREN 449 - The Realist and Naturalist Novel ,"P This seminar focuses on the novel in the second half of the 19th century. Works by such authors as Dumas fils, Flaubert, Maupassant, Daudet, and Zola are studied in the context of the literary modes of realism and naturalism, and their reaction against Romanticism. The texts selected for discussion, as well as the visual materials used in the course, are usually centered on the representation of women, changing definitions of femininity and masculinity, and leading social and ideological issues of the time. "
511,ColgateUni,P FREN 450 - 20th-Century French Literature ,"P This seminar examines some of the most important novels and plays of the first half of the 20th century, until World War II. Authors read generally include Gide, Proust, Breton, Malraux, and Giraudoux. The following questions are discussed: How did these writers see their role in the rapidly changing social and political climate of the period? How did they transform the two dominant literary modes of the end of the 19th century (naturalism and symbolism) to express more modern concerns? How is one to understand the emergence of an introspective hero who so often searches for his or her identity on the margins of society? "
512,ColgateUni,P FREN 453 - Contemporary French Literature ,"P This seminar examines how questions of identity, agency, intersectionality, and individual and collective responsibility inform major works of French literature of the late 20th and 21st centuries, and how literature can be used to make sense of them. Authors may include de Beauvoir, Duras, Sarraute, Djebar, Bey, and Cixous. "
513,ColgateUni,P FREN 455 - Francophone Voices from North Africa ,"P This seminar examines the literature written in French by Maghrebi and Beur women authors since the early 1980s. The product of a colonial and post-colonial history, this is a literature where cultures, histories, identities, genres, and languages intersect. It gives voice to new questions of identity and self-definition through the exploration of traditional as well as innovative forms of writing. In order to establish the historical and cultural contexts in which this body of literature has emerged and is growing, the course includes an overview of the history of Franco-Maghrebi relations and Maghrebi immigration to France. Through the reading of texts by Maghrebi and Beur authors, this course explores and discusses issues such as imperialism and colonialism, post-colonialism, cultural translocation, identity politics, gender and race, religion, multilingualism, sexuality, urban development and design, etc. "
514,ColgateUni,P FREN 469 - Topics in French Literature (Study Group) ,P Taught at the University of Burgundy as part of the Dijon Study Group.

It is taught by faculty members who have particular interest and expertise in the literature to be examined. FREN 481 is a category 1 course. "
516,ColgateUni,P FREN 482 - Major French Authors ,P This seminar provides the opportunity for extensive study of the works of the most distinguished authors writing in the French language after 1800. It is taught by faculty members who have particular interest and expertise in the literature to be examined. Counts toward Category II for the major. 
517,ColgateUni,P FREN 485 - Words into Paintings: Paintings into Words ,"P The course focuses on the way in which painters often paint subjects taken from literature and on the way writers, particularly poets, are fascinated by images from the visual arts. Students will explore the interrelated topics of ""poets on painting and paintings on poetry"" and on the transposition of paintings into words and words into paintings. The course concentrates on such painters as Poussin, Chardin, Delacroix, Manet, Gauguin and Van Gogh and on a number of writers whose work focuses very specifically on painters and paintings - Diderot, Baudelaire, Yves Bonnefoy, among others. "
518,ColgateUni,P FREN 490 - Honors ,P Students pursuing honors in French enroll in this course. 
519,ColgateUni,P FREN 491 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
520,ColgateUni,P GEOG 105 - Climate and Society ,"P Human-induced climate change--global warming--is the defining environmental and social issue of our times. That people are dramatically altering the climate is now the resounding consensus in the scientific community. Potential short- and long-term impacts include biodiversity loss, sea-level rise and coastal flooding, more intense storms, threats to human health, and disruptions of freshwater supplies and food security. But while the global community increasingly understands the basic processes driving climate change, and is starting to appreciate the consequences of a warmer world, the coupled social and biophysical dynamics of global warming are complex and the issue remains controversial. This course explores climate-society relationships in industrial and pre-industrial periods, and considers the multifaceted natural and human dimensions of global warming. It also highlights the integrative natural and social science modes of analysis commonly used in the discipline of geography. "
521,ColgateUni,P GEOG 107 - Is the Planet Doomed? ,"P ""End of the world"" scenarios have been linked to global pandemics, super-volcanoes, artificial intelligence, and melting permafrost. ""Is the Planet Doomed"" uses these and other examples to study contemporary catastrophism. The course explores arguments that suggest the world may have reached ""peak humanity."" Potential mass extinction events arise from the convergence of biological, climatic, economic, technological factors on one hand, and war on the other. The course analyzes these factors using the integrative modes of analysis commonly used in the discipline of geography. And it exposes how geography affects the catastrophic imaginary. "
522,ColgateUni,"P GEOG 121 - Earth, Society, and Sustainability ","P The spatial scale, magnitude, and pace of human-induced environmental changes over the past 300 years are unprecedented. It is essential to undertake reasoned assessments of the complex and interrelated political, socioeconomic, technological, cultural, and biophysical factors leading to environmental changes if society is to manage them appropriately. This course is an introduction to the major environmental problems of resource depletion, pollution, and ecosystem transformation. It explores the effects of environmental changes on society, as well as societal responses to them, and enhances understanding of the causes of these changes from multiple theoretical perspectives. "
523,ColgateUni,P GEOG 245 - Geographic Information Systems ,"P Focuses on the theory, function, and application of geographic information systems (GIS). The analytical powers of GIS are rooted in its ability to manage large volumes of geographically referenced data representing both physical and social characteristics. As such, GIS has become an important analytical approach in most subfields of geography. Students begin with an examination of basic mapping concepts, geographic data issues, symbolism, and generalization. Emphasis then shifts to issues in GIS data structure, collection, and input. Once a solid understanding of these GIS foundation issues is achieved, attention turns to the analytical powers and applications of GIS. These topics are reinforced by a series of exercises dealing with local geographic data. Students make use of the ArcGIS geographic information system and involves map digitization, geographic data collection (using global positioning systems, satellite imagery, and aerial photography), database management, and spatial analysis. "
524,ColgateUni,P GEOG 248 - Quantitative Analysis of Geographic Data ,"P Introduces students to the nature of quantitative research in geography and the spatial sciences through the statistical analysis of social, environmental, and spatial data. This research methods course is thus unique within the department in illustrating the analytic commonalities between human and environmental geography. Students develop a critical perspective on issues of measurement of empirical data collected or available to geographers. Students consider the implications for validity and reliability in measurement of social and environmental geographic concepts using quantitative methods of measurement and data collection. Strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to data collection and sampling of social, environmental, and spatial data are demonstrated. Students actively engage in the statistical analysis of geographic data to both describe frequency distributions of social, physical, and spatial characteristics, and to explain patterns of variation in outcome variable using statistical modeling. Students are challenged to undertake hypothesis testing and multivariate statistical analysis as well as to effective communicate the results of statistical analyses to readers of all subdisciplines of geography. "
525,ColgateUni,P GEOG 253 - Interviews ,"P Introduces students to the nature of qualitative social science research using interviews. Interviews are a flexible method of in-person data collection that include a range of structures (from structured surveys to open-ended questions), with varying group sizes (from one to a large focus group), and using multiple methods of eliciting responses (verbal questions, oral history, photo-elicitation, etc.). Students develop a critical perspective on different epistemological approaches to research and analysis within the contemporary social sciences, including issues of generalizability and the validity and reliability of qualitative methods. A series of hands-on original research projects provides students with the skills of interview protocol design, sampling for interview projects, interview facilitation, data management and analysis, and professional communication of research results. "
526,ColgateUni,P GEOG 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
527,ColgateUni,"P GEOG 304 - Criminal Underworld: Drugs, Guns, Bodies ","P Examines the violent networks of the illicit global economy: from guns and drugs smuggling, to human trafficking and animal poaching among others. Drawing from multiple scholarly traditions, it compares the concrete geographical organization of these illicit networks - that is, where and how they become grounded - and asks the following questions: What are the relationships of these illegal activities to legal circuits of power and profit? In what ways are transnational criminal networks redefining the nature of contemporary violence and the meaning of peace? "
528,ColgateUni,P GEOG 306 - The Geography of Happiness ,"P Achieving some degree of happiness is a primary goal for most people. Certainly, a huge industry has emerged in recent years to feed the public's desire for ways to improve their happiness. There is also a rapidly growing amount of research on the subject. This course starts with an overview of the diverse, multidisciplinary scholarship on factors that may contribute to happiness. But the main goal of the course is to consider themes central to the discipline of geography: how do environmental changes, efforts to achieve sustainable development, and culture affect the geography of happiness? Do people achieve a greater sense of well-being when interacting with wilderness or by exploring nature in their backyards? Does environmental stewardship improve happiness? What roles do attitudes about food and leisure play in how happy people are? Students explore these questions via out-of-class excursions, films, diverse mix of scholarly and popular press readings, guest speakers, and individual research projects. "
529,ColgateUni,P GEOG 308 - Authoritarian Capital Cities of Eurasia (Extended Study) ,"P Certain spatial and temporal patterns of urban growth characterize post-socialist Eurasia, due to the distinct mark that authoritarianism has left on past and present capital cities throughout this region. This course focuses on understanding authoritarianism in the past and present capital cities of Russia (St. Petersburg and Moscow) and Kazakhstan (Almaty and Astana). While remnants of the Tsarist and Soviet built environments still strongly shape urban character, new urban development and demographic change, alongside other economic and geopolitical transformations, have transformed them since 1991. Rapid and changing patterns and styles of urbanization create a multitude of perspectives and experiences within post-socialist cities as our globalizing world blurs the boundaries between urban spaces, individual lives, and abstract conceptualizations of the East, West, or even ""post-"" socialist places. This course uses a phenomenological methodology to examine post-socialist cities as sites of socio-cultural and political-economic transformations. Using this framework, students analyze their experiences in photographs, videos, and journals/blogs related to the encounters with spaces and places in post-socialist cities. "
530,ColgateUni,P GEOG 309 - Latin America: Critical Landscapes of Development ,"P Explores the development experience of Latin America through examination of pressing environmental, economic, political, and social issues that currently face the region as a whole and play out differently across the region. The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries, and Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region. "
531,ColgateUni,P GEOG 310 - Geopolitics ,"P Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of ""the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation."" As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the ""closed system"" we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified "
532,ColgateUni,P GEOG 311 - Global Urban ,"P An exploration of contemporary urban geography and academic writing about the city. It introduces students to the ways in which urban geography has played a role, along with other disciplines that focus on the urban, in understanding cities and the issues that surround them. This includes an examination of how cities are conceived, lived, and represented. The course investigates the following topics: What are the various ways that people create, and attempt to materialize, their geographical imaginations of what they want the city to be? What are the ways in which different social groups make claims on space and place, and how does the scale at which these activities occur have effects? What are the critical questions to ask about urban landscapes today? How would you formulate a research proposal on such topics? The course offers a theoretical and practical framework within which to examine the city as a site of socio-cultural and political-economic transformation. In this framework, students analyze how the state, market, and civil society intersect, and how this has changed over the 20th century in the U.S. and other parts of the world. "
533,ColgateUni,P GEOG 312 - The American City ,"P Focuses on the historical development and contemporary spatial patterns and processes of American cities. Topics emphasized include the decentralization of people and jobs within urban areas, metropolitan political fragmentation, racial residential segregation, inner-city gentrification, urban public service provision issues, the role of new immigrant groups, and feminist perspectives on urban geography, plus international and interregional comparisons to elicit distinctive characteristics of urbanization in the US. "
534,ColgateUni,P GEOG 313 - Geographical Political Economy: Asia in Globalization ,"P Contemporary sociocultural and environmental issues cannot be understood without a good grasp of globalizing, yet place-specific political economic contexts in which these issues are embedded. The course aims to prepare students with conceptual and analytical foundations of economic geography with a particular attention to the roles of states, firms, and workers in the increasingly interconnected world. A strong empirical emphasis is given to Asia, although other world regions are addressed throughout the course for comparative and integrative purposes. Questions asked in this course include: what causes territorial economic growth and decline? How do place-specific economic structures influence policies? How are ""the economy"" and environment interrelated? Does advanced technology make geography irrelevant? Does economic growth produce socio-spatial inequality? In answering these questions, Asia offers a critical empirical arena to test theories and hypotheses, many of which have been developed primarily in the Euro-American contexts. "
535,ColgateUni,P GEOG 315 - Sustainable Livelihoods in Asia ,"P We are living in the world of growing uncertainty filled with various ""shocks"" such as natural disasters, financial crises, and development projects, and more insidious ""distress"" via resource depletion, excessive industrial specialization, and demographic transitions. This course focuses on how households and communities cope with, resist, adapt to, and challenge these large structural ""disturbances"" in locally specific and ingenious ways in order to take control and enhance their livelihood opportunities and cultural identities. Case studies are drawn from various parts of Asia, with a particular focus on Japan. Although theoretical foundations of this course are grounded in the literature on sustainable livelihood and community resilience in geography and neighboring fields, it is designed for students with various disciplinary backgrounds and interest in Asia. Students are expected to apply their disciplinary skills and regional knowledge to the course project. "
536,ColgateUni,P GEOG 316 - Environmental and Public Health Geographies ,"P Considers patterns of spatial and social distribution of disease and of health and medical resources. Alternative analytical approaches to describing and explaining these patterns of distribution are demonstrated. Selected topics include disease systems and disease ecology, the population analysis of mortality and morbidity, environmental influences on health, and the distribution and accessibility of health resources. Examples are drawn from both contemporary and historical societies throughout the world. "
537,ColgateUni,"P GEOG 318 - International Migration, U.S. Immigration, and Immigrants ","P Introduces students to approaches to the study of international migration, immigrant assimilation and adjustment, ethnic social and economic stratification, and immigration policy formation and analysis. These topics are explored within the historical and contemporary context of the United States and New York. The class considers theoretical perspectives that have been applied to the study of migration as well as approaches used by sociologists and geographers in empirical analyses of US immigration, immigrant populations, and ethnic relations. These analytical issues are considered in detail for immigrant and ethnic groups within New York State and the New York metropolitan community. Finally, students consider the relationships among patterns of immigration and ethnic relations, cultural change, international relations and transnational linkages, and US immigration policy reform. "
538,ColgateUni,P GEOG 322 - Ecologies of the City ,"P With half of the world's population living in and around cities, the needs of urban-based populations and economies dominate non-urban peoples, places, and habitats worldwide. This course begins with an introduction to political ecology, a body of knowledge combining political economy and cultural ecology. Political economy is the study of how different societies are connected globally, and cultural ecology is the study of the relationship between a society and its natural environment. Although political ecology largely focuses on places and cultures of ""pristine"" or ""native"" nature in ""other"" countries, this course turns to urban settings to explore how people understand urban areas and what their relationship to the environment in these areas is. Case studies of specific places (from small cities in upstate New York to global cities in distant countries) are used to learn about urban political ecological issues through readings, assignments, discussion, and interaction with local/regional experts on urban environmental problems. Students apply their knowledge about urban political ecology both collaboratively, in a final project conducted in a workshop-type setting, and individually, in a final term paper. "
539,ColgateUni,P GEOG 324 - International Environmental Policy ,"P As awareness of global environmental problems grows, questions arise as to how social, cultural, and biophysical contexts define how humans use and manage natural resources, on both community and national scales of analysis. This course uses geographic perspectives on nature-society interactions to consider the decision-making processes of natural resource managers, from local farmers to policy actors at the national and international levels. Case studies in Africa and Latin America are used to explore the environmental (biophysical) and political constraints on the management of natural resources. "
540,ColgateUni,P GEOG 325 - Water and Society ,"P No natural substance is more vital to human existence or used in more different ways than fresh water. This course considers the natural and social processes (with primary focus on the latter) that shape water use both within and outside of the United States, including physical factors, technology, economics, culture, law, and political systems and ideologies. The focus is on the services that water provides, the causes and consequences of water scarcity, and the ways in which water's services might be obtained in more sustainable ways. "
541,ColgateUni,P GEOG 326 - Environmental Hazards ,"P Environmental hazards are threats to people and the things they value. Hazards are a complex mix of natural processes and human actions; thus, they do not just happen, but are caused. This course emphasizes the role of institutions, technology, and human behavior in hazard creation, as well as ways in which society responds to hazards of multiple origins: case studies center on earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfire (natural hazards); toxic pollution (technological hazards); and malaria and invasive species (biological hazards). A key theme explores ways in which society may mitigate the risk of environmental hazards and manage them more effectively. "
542,ColgateUni,P GEOG 327 - Australia's Stolen Generations: The Legacies of Carrolup (Extended Study) ,"P The intellectual goal of this extended study is to address issues of both population vulnerabilities and cultural resilience by considering Aborigines in Australia, and specifically engaging the historical geography and the contemporary experience of the Noongar community in Western Australia. Three themes form the curricular program of the extended study. (1) Students study the historical geography of Aborigines in Australia within the context of European colonization and settlement, federation and nation-building. These issues are framed using concepts of population vulnerability, environmental impact, and cultural heritage and identity at the national, regional and local geographic scales. (2) Students study the impacts of national, regional and local policies directed toward indigenous peoples on Aboriginal families and children, given particular focus to programs concerning part-Aboriginal children, Australia's ""Stolen Generations."" (3) Students learn the ways in which Aboriginal culture and 'care for country' has remained resilient across time, space, and generations. "
543,ColgateUni,P GEOG 328 - Sustainability and Natural Resources ,"P Uses social science perspectives on sustainability and sustainable development to analyze the production and consumption of major natural resources. Addresses the following questions: What are natural resources, and how do their geographies combine with those of wealth and poverty, of political power and technological and institutional capacity, to affect the potential for actions towards sustainable development? How is our understanding of sustainable resource development enriched by critical perspectives from the social sciences about the meaning of such contested concepts as sustainability and development, and about issues of equity, power, participation, property rights, and unequal impacts (of both resource depletion and environmental policies)? How can the three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) of sustainability better guide the production and consumption of natural resources, renewable or nonrenewable, in different places and by different actors? The topical and regional focus of the course varies from year to year; it may, for example, focus on oil (or energy more generally), on minerals, or on biological and genetic resources; and on specific geographic areas, such as central New York, Latin America, or the Arctic. "

Included in the first segment is a thorough examination of issues associated with mapping and referencing the non-spherical earth, conceptual models for representing spatial phenomena, and data-quality issues. The second segment focuses on a select set of spatial analytical issues that can be addressed using GIS. These issues include analysis of continuous spatial phenomena (e.g., terrain), model building using multiple sources of spatial data, network analysis, and the integration of remotely sensed data in a GIS. "
550,ColgateUni,P GEOG 347 - Satellite Image Analysis ,"P Image analysis is a method used in geography to analyze remotely sensed data, including both satellite images and data collected from aircraft, in order to obtain information about earth's surface phenomena from afar. The primary objective is to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. Most typically, image analysis involves generating landcover maps using multi-spectral data collected by satellites. This course begins by focusing on the physical principles upon which image analysis is based, including the principles of acquiring and interpreting electromagnetic data collected by non-photographic sensors. Students then explore the basic tools of digital image processing (e.g., image enhancement, contract manipulation, etc.). This leads to a consideration of the process of image classification. Lastly, students discuss accuracy assessment as it applies to landcover classification, and spend a significant amount of time in the geography department computer lab performing analysis on remote sensing data.

Course taught in English with an optional FLAC section in German. "
588,ColgateUni,P GERM 330 - Kafka ,"P Kafka may be the most dizzyingly overdetermined proper name in world literature. Not only does it stand for the author, it has come to signify a host of political, institutional, existential, and aesthetic conditions. One refers to ""Kafkaesque"" experiences, sensibilities, or bureaucracies; situations, movies, the 20th century, and modern life are all regularly dubbed ""Kafkan"" or ""Kafkaish."" The name seems to have a life of its own; but to understand what it means, students must animate Kafka by reading him. Students read, discuss, and think about a range of Kafka's writing, from novels and short stories to diary entries and legal brief, paying close attention not only to the texts and their various obsessions, but to their emergence in his creative process and their afterlives in translation and the works of other artists. Students explore the multicultural Central European milieu that Kafka inhabited and examine the global transmission and remediation of his work in its critical reception, multiple translations, and adaptations; its transmutation into a style; and its metastasis in popular culture. Taught in English. Participation in the accompanying FLAC section is mandatory for students wishing to earn GERM major/minor credit for this course. "

595,ColgateUni,P GERM 461 - Goethe ,"P Introduces Goethe's writing and thought through selected plays, narrative fiction, critical writings, and poems. Topics include Goethe's interest and influence in various cultural spheres, such as the visual arts, the scientific fields of his time, and politics in the age of revolutions. Students explore his comparative approach to world languages and literatures, his changing aesthetic positions during his lifetime, and his literary explorations of gender and love. The seminar interprets Goethe in the context of his time and also examines his dominant and debated position in the German cultural tradition. "
596,ColgateUni,P GERM 465 - Genius and Madness ,"P Since Plato, artists and philosophers have recognized the close connection between genius and madness (Wahnsinn). But how exactly does one distinguish between inspiration and mania? Why is it so many geniuses are also mad? And how do changing definitions of mental illness affect how one perceives the relationship between madness and genius across history? These questions are central to the study of literature, philosophy, and the history of social institutions. In this course, students delve deeper into these questions by examining a series of literary, philosophical, and visual works from the German tradition that foreground the relationship between madness and genius, as well as works by geniuses that may also have been ""mad."" Authors may include Plato, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Hlderlin, Immanuel Kant, Heinrich von Kleist, Georg Bchner, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Walser, and Thomas Mann. This course emphasizes reading, speaking, listening, and writing German, as well as discipline-specific research skills. "
597,ColgateUni,P GERM 475 - Romanticism/Junges Deutschland ,"P German Romanticism and the movement known as Young Germany evolved in the years between the French Revolution to the ""March Revolution"" of 1848 and circled around the aspirations and disappointments of the revolutionary spirit. The literature of these years follows shifts in the intellectual debates of the times: the proclamation of individual rights, the crumbling of traditional social structures and the rise of new social forms, the plight of the lone individual detached from traditional moorings. Works we will read include folk fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers, the poetry of Novalis and Eichendorff, fantastic tales by E.T.A. Hoffmann, and the socially critical poetry of Heinrich Heine. "
598,ColgateUni,P GERM 477 - Literature at the Turn of the Century ,"P At the dawn of the 20th-century, central Europeans lived, debated, and created amidst great doubts that their world had any future. At the heart of a conflicted and paradoxical modernity arose a keen sense of the unreality and futility of human affairs. Yet modernity's seemingly unresolvable challenges—including questions about the political arrangements of diverse and multilingual societies, the constitution of the human psyche, the chances of human survival on the eve of World War I, as well as class, inter-ethnic and gender relations—spawned a furor of pioneering responses in the urban centers of Germanophone Europe. Exploring the resources of this rich period (1890-1924), this course investigates the cultural, literary, philosophical, artistic, and musical activity abounding in Vienna, Prague, and other sites of central European modernity. Readings include works by Zweig, Roth, Hofmannsthal, Schnitzler, Freud, Musil, Kraus, and Kafka. Focus is on reading and writing about central Europe will be supplemented by visual works of art, architecture and cinema relevant to the period. "
599,ColgateUni,P GERM 479 - 20th-Century Literature ,"P Examines the literature and cultures of German-speaking Europe in the 20th century. Because of the wealth of the material, selections vary from semester to semester.

602,ColgateUni,P GERM 485 - Drama ,"P Examines the history, theory, and practice of German drama with a focus on a selection of major dramatic works from the 18th century to the present. As theater continues to thrive as a unique aesthetic and social institution of German-speaking Europe, students conduct a performance-oriented study of theater as a medium of cultural and transcultural communication. Canonical playwrights to be studied may include Lessing, Schiller, Goethe, Kleist, Bhner, Ibsen, Brecht, Peter Weiss, and Heiner Mler. Contemporary playwrights may include Elfriede Jelinek, Falk Richter, Sibylle Berg, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Nurkan Erpulat and Dea Loher. Investigating the genre of the bgerliches Trauerspiel, the Volksstuck, epic theater, postdrama, and postmigratory theater, students also undertake experiments in drama pedagogy. "
603,ColgateUni,P GERM 486 - What is German World Literature? ,"P What is German World Literature? This question highlights the relationship between the idea of a national literary tradition and a broader concept of literature that crosses linguistic, cultural, or national boundaries. This seminar focuses on theories of ""world literature/s"" and on primary literary texts written in German as examples of works that circulate through and reflect multiple cultural and linguistic contexts. How are the Grimm fairy tales mediated by Disney? What do we understand by the term ""Kafkaesque""? Why did Goethe emulate the Persian poet Hafis? Do Senoçak's readers in America contribute to a new idea of German or German-Turkish literature? Topics include the roles of translation, migration, economic and media globalization, nationalisms, and contemporary and historical transnational identities in shaping world literature written originally in German. This course is taught in German, and all written work is to be completed in German. "

658,ColgateUni,P HIST 241 - Tudor - Stuart Britain (EU) ,"P In 1485, Henry Tudor became king of England. A second-rate power in Europe, his kingdom had been torn apart by dynastic struggles and civil war. By 1714, when the last of the Stuart monarchs died, everything had changed. England was now part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which included Scotland and Wales, and whose king also ruled over the neighboring island of Ireland. The medieval feudal kingship had been replaced by a well-established parliamentary monarchy, with many stops along the way. Britain was now a world power, at the center of a far-flung empire, and competing with France for dominance in Europe and beyond.

661,ColgateUni,P HIST 251 - The Politics of History (TR) ,"P While the discipline of history is often approached as a collection of static, undisputed facts, the past is constantly re-interpreted and re-written to suit the needs of those living in the present. Far from being an apolitical exercise or a straightforward empirical investigation, history is contested and hijacked by individuals and groups who seek to use it to advance their interests and promote their agendas. History is not only subject to intense and divisive public debates, it frequently appears at the center of both latent and active inter-group conflicts. Through close readings of key texts and hands-on engagement with contemporary case studies, this course aims to provide a broad overview of the politics of history. The scope of the course is global, and the methodological approach is multi-disciplinary, spanning such fields as history, political science, public and international affairs, memory studies, museum studies, and peace and conflict studies.

664,ColgateUni,P HIST 261 - Modern Irish History (EU) ,"P Few Western European countries have had as turbulent a recent history as Ireland, nor one whose legacy remains as persistent.

668,ColgateUni,P HIST 271 - The First World War (TR) ,"P Was the First World War a ""tragic and unnecessary conflict,"" as one of its leading historians has recently suggested? Why did men continue to fight amid horror and misery? And how did total war rend the fabric of society, politics, and everyday life? To answer these and other questions, this course examines the First World War from a variety of perspectives. Attention will be paid to its origins and outbreak, its conduct by generals and common soldiers, its effect on women and workers, and its wide ranging consequences, both on individuals and empires. The course concludes with a discussion of how the First World War has shaped the world in which we live today. (TR) "

670,ColgateUni,P HIST 273 - The Century of Camps (TR) ,"P A little more than a hundred years ago, a new kind of structure appeared: the detention camp for civilians. Originally termed a 'concentration camp' (because it 'concentrated' the inhabitants of an area into a small confined space) and intended to be a shortterm expedient, the camp quickly became an archetype of the modern age, a tool relied upon by democratic no less than dictatorial states-and even by humanitarian organizations seeking to deliver aid. This course will examine, from a comparative perspective, the role, structure and meaning of the camp in its extraordinary variety of forms during the past century; its creation of a 'parallel universe' within which new dystopian kinds of social organization become possible; and the human experience of those whose lives it has impacted, distorted or terminated. (TR) "

770,ColgateUni,P JAPN 455 - Advanced Grammar in Japanese ,"P Focuses on a systematic study of advanced grammar necessary for oral and written communication in Japanese at the native speaker level. At this level of advanced study, possibilities of one-on-one correspondences between Japanese and English are few, and simply consulting dictionaries could easily result in insufficient or misleading information. Grammar structures that appear beyond JAPN 402 are covered and extended so that students understand systematic and comprehensive usages. Students concentrate on these kinds of advanced grammar patterns through textbooks and authentic reading materials, and learn to use them actively, accurately, and systematically in context. In addition, the study of kanji characters and vocabulary accompanies the study of grammar in order to reach the native-level fluency. "
771,ColgateUni,P JAPN 481 - Topics in Japanese Culture (Study Group) ,"P Offered in a field of the study group director's expertise.

774,ColgateUni,P JAPN 499 - Special Studies for Honors ,P Students pursuing honors research enroll in this course. 
775,ColgateUni,P JWST 181 - The Many Faces of Israel ,"P Introduction to the rich tapestry of cultures and peoples who live in contemporary Israel. Looking at the experiences of immigrant communities-Jews from Poland, Morocco, India, Russia, Ethiopia, etc., this course will discuss ethnicity, acculturation, and mobility in Israel. A consideration of film, literature, and scholarly accounts from a range of disciplines will allow students to explore both those who are at the center and at the periphery of Israeli society. "
776,ColgateUni,P JWST 204 - Jewish Fiction since the Holocaust ,"P Covers representative works of fiction by Italian, French, English, Russian, Hungarian, American, Canadian, and Israeli Jewish writers. Not all nationalities are covered in the syllabus for any given year. Discussion centers on a close analysis of the novels, comparing individual and national responses to the Jewish 20thcentury experience. By including fiction written across Europe, North America, and Israel, while limiting the time frame to the years following World War II, the question of whether there exists one or more approaches to fiction that are characteristically Jewish is addressed. All readings are in English translation. "
777,ColgateUni,P JWST 205 - Yiddish Fiction in Translation ,"P As European Jews began to develop a modern culture in the middle of the 19th century, an important set of writers began using Yiddish for fiction and poetry. All these writers were at least trilingual: They chose Yiddish--always the lowest status of the languages they knew--because they loved it and because it was the language their audience could really read. This course looks at Yiddish fiction and poetry written in both Eastern Europe and the United States. Students study these texts both as singular works of art and as ways of mirroring the Jewish experience for Jewish readers. Students examine both texts and the multiple contexts (historical, cultural, religious, linguistic) that give them shape. "
778,ColgateUni,P JWST 213 - The Bible as/and Literature ,"P What role does literary art play in the shaping of biblical narrative? How does the construction of the sacred text reflect its theological meaning? The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. "
779,ColgateUni,P JWST 222 - Comparative Scripture ,"P Comparative scriptural analysis or what is now called ""Scriptural Reasoning."" The focus will be on close readings of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Qur'an with an eye to common themes and differences. Students will engage in a comparison of interpretive traditions in Judaism, Christianity and Islam to see how particular scriptural passages are understood in the religious traditions. The course will also spend time studying the ways in which scriptural reasoning has been used as a form of religious conflict resolution and peace-building in situations of conflict in the UK and Middle East. "
780,ColgateUni,P JWST 228 - Jerusalem: City of Gods ,"P An introduction to the religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In learning about the three Abrahamic religions and their sacred spaces, students are exposed to key themes in the study of religion (scripture and interpretation, feasting and fasting, pilgrimage, sanctuary and sacred space, ritual and worship) and to the particular theme of each religion's conceptions of Jerusalem. The course foregrounds the ways that each tradition understands the city as a symbol--as a holy city, a city of God, a centre of the cosmos. As importantly, it explores how religion is lived within the city's sacred geography, investigating the religious practices and sacred sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in Jerusalem. "
781,ColgateUni,P JWST 251 - Faith after the Holocaust ,"P The death of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis in the Second World War represents a radical challenge to faith in Judaism, in Christianity, and in humanism. The course begins with a historical overview of the Holocaust and uses accounts of Holocaust survivors to articulate the challenge of the Holocaust to faith. It then reviews philosophical and theological responses to this challenge by Jewish and Christian authors. The weak as well as the heroic human figures in the Holocaust are studied. Those Jews who survived with their humanity intact and those non-Jews who helped them are the most important witnesses to the resiliency of the human spirit which we now have. "
782,ColgateUni,P JWST 283 - Experiencing Judaism ,"P Judaism is a dynamic religious tradition that has developed many forms during a more than 3000-year history that has spanned nearly the entire globe. Students in this course consider how Jewish communities from the biblical period to the present day have shaped their practices and beliefs within their own specific historical circumstances. Students read primary sources such as the Bible, the Talmud, the Zohar, midrashim, prayers, response literature, and philosophical and theological discussions. In an effort to understand the ways in which Jews have lived their lives religiously, students explore how Jewish self-identity, textual traditions, and religious practices combine to define ""Judaism."" "
783,ColgateUni,P JWST 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
784,ColgateUni,P JWST 303 - Jewish Fiction before the War ,"P Focused on the great novels and short stories written by European Jews before the Holocaust. All of the writers--even Kafka, whose fictional world is non-Jewish--reflect a Jewish consciousness and a Jewish confrontation with modernity. Modernity in these works takes different and often conflicting forms. In some works it is revolution (the promise of communism as a solution to the Jewish question); in other work, emigration, Zionism, or radical assimilation to the surrounding culture, what that happens to be. Several books--most prominently those of Sholem Aleichem, Agnon, and Kafka--take up the question of God's justice. Several books deal with the loss of identity. A variety of 20th-century themes (political radicalism, bourgeois desires and bourgeois impurity, a desire to uproot and a search for roots) run through the texts, always in different combinations. All readings are in English translation. "
785,ColgateUni,P JWST 308 - End of the World ,"P An examination of the origins and development of apocalyptic literature, much of which deals with the end of the world, during the Second Temple and early Christian periods. This course focuses on primary source texts in translation as well as the theoretical and methodological problems surrounding the analysis of ancient texts for the development of the worldview known as apolcalpyticism. Modern case studies are analyzed as comparative examples throughout the course. "
786,ColgateUni,P JWST 339 - Modern Jewish Philosophy ,"P A course on European and American Jewish thought, covering a spectrum of liberal and traditional figures. The course studies the ways in which Jewish thinkers have responded to the challenges of modern philosophy, religious pluralism, and feminism. Modern reformulations of traditional Jewish ideas and religious practices are discussed as well as contemporary theological exchanges between Jews and Christians. Readings are taken from such figures as Mendelssohn, Buber, Rosenzweig, Heschel, Fackenheim, and Plaskow. "
787,ColgateUni,P JWST 343 - Gender and Judaism ,"P Focused on the creation and conception of gender within Judaism. Students explore the ways in which gender is built into the scriptures, structures, institutions, and ideologies of Judaism, into Jewish religious, cultural and social life. According to Genesis, from the beginning there were male and female. To what degree are these two categories essential? To what degree artificial? How do religion and tradition enforce the gender divide, and in what ways can they be used to blur the distinctions between male and female? "
788,ColgateUni,P JWST 354 - On Tyranny ,"P Examines life under tyranny – Soviet and Nazi – as distilled through the fiction of Russian/East European and Jewish writers who experienced it firsthand. An intertwining of political and private life from the inception of a new regime, with many people exuberantly hopeful, through the various stages of acquiescence, resistance, escape, and sometimes death. Readings include Timothy Snyder's essay On Tyranny, stories, novels, and poems by Chekhov, Mayakovsky, Babel, Vasily Grossman, Kundera, and Nabokov. "

795,ColgateUni,P LATN 202 - Intermediate Latin: Poetry ,P Introduction to Latin poetry through close reading of selections from Vergil's Aeneid. Students gain a wider appreciation of the technical and literary aspects of Latin poetry through their acquaintance with Rome's great epic poet. 
796,ColgateUni,P LATN 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "

800,ColgateUni,P LATN 410 - Tacitus ,P Close reading and analysis of selections from the Annals of Tacitus and other works. Particular attention is paid to the historiographical method of Tacitus as well as to the Roman imperial period that is the subject of the bulk of his work. Selections from other Roman historians may be examined for comparison. 
801,ColgateUni,P LATN 420 - Lucretius ,"P Close reading and analysis of the poet's sole work, the epic poem De Rerum Natura, which presents the philosophy of Epicurus on the nature of the world. Students focus on the philosophical content of the work, on Lucretius's accomplishments in and development of the Roman epic genre, and on the debt later Latin poets owe him. "
802,ColgateUni,P LATN 430 - Lyric Poetry ,"P Close reading and analysis of selections from Horace's Odes. Students will study all aspects of the poems, including the poet's accomplishments in metrics and poetics, his thematic concerns, and the relationship between poem and poetic book. "
803,ColgateUni,P LATN 440 - Vergil's Eclogues and Georgics ,"P Close reading and analysis of selections from Vergil's two earlier works, the genres to which they belong (bucolic and didactic), and their relationship to his Aeneid. Students focus on questions of genre, the relationship between the poet and his Greek and Roman predecessors, and the thematic and poetic development of the author. "
804,ColgateUni,P LATN 450 - Cicero's Letters ,"P Close reading and analysis of a selection of Cicero's correspondence (from the collection of more than 900 letters) with such figures as Marcus Brutus and Julius Caesar, as well as with close friends and family. Students not only focus on the broad variations in style evident throughout the corpus but also examine the tumultuous world of the late Republic, in which Cicero himself played a leading role and for which his letters remain one of history's most revealing testimonies. "
805,ColgateUni,P LATN 460 - Roman Satire ,"P Close reading of selected satires written by Lucilius, Horace, Persius, and Juvenal. The course examines the origins of satire (the only genre native to Rome and largely free of Greek influence), the function of satire in Roman society, and the influence of satire on later European literature and thought. "
806,ColgateUni,P LATN 490 - Honors ,"P Independent study, open to candidates for honors. "
807,ColgateUni,P LATN 491 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
808,ColgateUni,P LGBT 227 - Machismo & the Latin Lover ,"P Interrogates the intersection of sexuality and gender in Latin American and Iberian literature and film. Beginning with representations of Don Juan in 16th- through 19th-century Spain, students see how during that period of imperial expansion a particular brand of masculinity spread throughout the new world. The second part of the course focuses on writings and films from artists whose works draw on and questions myths of Hispanic masculinity by looking at non-white, female, and queer versions of the Don Juan archetype in Latin America. Lastly, students examines how the figure of the Latin Lover has been appropriated and critiqued by writers and directors in non-Hispanic contexts. These are analyzed together with critical works on masculinity, gender theory, and cultural studies. "
809,ColgateUni,P LGBT 241 - Queering Education ,"P LGBTQ youth have traditionally been marginalized in schools. K-12 education offers few curricular and institutional spaces where queer identities are affirmed and queer voices are heard. From sex education to the prom, most schools and educators operate under the ahistorical guise of heteronormativity--a term used to describe ideologies and practices that organize and privilege opposite-sex gender relations and normative gender and sexual identities. Using critical lenses developed by queer and feminist theorists and critical pedagogues, this course seeks both to explore how heteronormativity operates in a variety of educational spaces and how students and educators are confronting these processes by using schools as sites of resistance. "
810,ColgateUni,P LGBT 303 - Queer Identities and Global Discourses ,"P Queer identities are -- and have long been -- enmeshed within large-scale circuits of exchange engendered by the movement of people, ideologies, markets, and capital. This course considers transnational conceptualizations and circulations associated with gender or sexual nonconformity. In doing so, it emphasizes ways of interrogating queer citizenship that purposefully attend to dynamics exemplifying complex interactions on global and local scales. Rather than assuming a particular narrative, the course examines the way by which queer identities are variously constructed and contested. "
811,ColgateUni,"P LGBT 350 - Sexuality, Gender, and the Law ","P The course examines the effects of the U.S. legal system on the lives of the LGBTQ communities; the influence of religion, science, and culture on the laws affecting LGBTQ individuals; and the processes by which LGBTQ citizens may advance their legal rights. Constitutional theories such as equal protection, privacy, due process, liberty interests, and states' rights are applied to issues such as consensual sodomy, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ parenting, employment rights, military policy, and freedoms of public school students. The power of the U.S. Supreme Court to shape laws concerning LGBTQ issues not only for the present society but for future generations is also examined. Cases studied are supplemented with secondary works. These works include writings by traditional legal scholars as well as works by feminists, race-based scholars, and queer theorists to create a fuller perspective. Through this exploration into the legal reality of a marginalized group, students see how the U.S. legal system continues to evolve in its struggle to provide equality for all of its citizens. "
812,ColgateUni,P LGBT 355 - Partners and Crime: Queer Outlaws in Literature and Film ,"P An intersection of sexuality and legality in literature and film. Beginning with topics of LGBTQ activism, homosociality and homonormativity, students will analyze how certain bodies and sexualities come to be on the right or wrong side of the law and how these sexual norms are quite literally policed. Focus will shift to literary writings and films from artists whose queer protagonists choose not to seek acceptance but rather to move outside of the law. Through bank robbery, border crossing, terrorism and homicide, these figures threaten not only the sexual order but also structures of class, race, and national security. Students will inquire into the true nature of these crimes, and determine how their crimes are sexualized and their sexualities criminalized. These will be analyzed together with critical works on queer and dissident genders and sexualities. The course may vary between semesters to focus on different regions or periods. "
813,ColgateUni,P LGBT 391 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "

815,ColgateUni,P CORE 164C - Argentina ,"P From gauchos in the Pampa, to immigrants in Buenos Aires, to oil workers in Patagonia, Argentina offers a fascinating place to examine the creation, transformation and contestation of identities and communities. This course introduces students to some of the events, institutions, people and sites that have been important for the development of Argentina, from before the land's European colonization, to the rise of populism, dictatorship and resistance in the 20th century, to neoliberal globalization in the current moment. In the process, students gain new ways to understand identity, community, nation, and culture, which they can use wherever they encounter people different from themselves. The course is interdisciplinary and draws from anthropology, history, geography, literature, film, and related disciplines. "
816,ColgateUni,P CORE 197C - Tibet ,"P Examines the formation of a Tibetan identity. This is largely a recent phenomenon brought about unwittingly by the ethnocentric policies imposed throughout the Tibetan Plateau by the modern Chinese state. However, earlier processes were already under way before the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in the 1950s, which made the transition from a constellation of feudal polities to a nation possible. These included a common written language, common subsistence patterns (farming, pastoralism, and trade), Buddhism, participation in common rituals and festival (especially religious pilgrimage), a certain respect for the authority of the Dalai Lamas, and so on. Students examine these processes as well as the consequences of China's political and economic incorporation of Tibetan areas into its nascent nation-state. Specific topics to be explored include ""the Tibet Problem"" (i.e. contemporary Sino-Tibetan relations and conflict), the historic colonial and religious ties between China Proper and Tibet, religious life and everyday Tibetans, ""nomadism"" (or pastoralism), polyandry and women in Tibet, and Tibetans' encounter with modernity and the West. "
817,ColgateUni,P CORE 152 - Challenges of Modernity ,"P Modernity is a crucial element of the intellectual legacy to which we are heirs. A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course.

818,ColgateUni,P CORE 400 - Core Distinction Seminar ,"P The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student's departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways: 1) by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project; 2) by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or 3) by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental projects. To enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental honors with the completion of the department honors project, and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation.

What ""authenticates"" ""Indian art"" and why does it ""need"" such authentication? How do the older divisions separating ""craft"" and ""art"" intersect with the current issues facing individuals whose life work is now linked to the marketing of the arts? Where do definitions of ""traditional"" and ""contemporary"" compete with each other, and where do they prove complementary? Over the semester, students consider a wide range of media: traditional pottery, contemporary clay sculpture, metalsmithing, drum making, weaving, dance, music, painting, and theater. "
907,ColgateUni,P NAST 320 - Native Peoples and Modern Law ,"P Explores the role of native peoples in the creation and ongoing development of modern law. It begins with an investigation of the use of native peoples as a representation of human savagery within early modern European political thought — a representation that allowed political theorists to depict law as a solution to such savagery. More recently, and more positively, it explores the important role that indigenous peoples have played in the propagation of religious free exercise rights and international human rights law. Focusing particularly on the legal negotiation of Native religious practices in the US, this course encourages students to think critically about some of the most basic tenets and mechanisms of modern secular law.

920,ColgateUni,P NEUR 353 - Visual Perception and Cognition ,"P Focuses on the visual sensory and cognitive processes that enable humans to elaborate a mental model of the physical world. The course examines the ways humans internally represent external objects and how events in turn influence their perceptions. Readings focus on the behavioral and neurophysiological aspects of low-level vision and face recognition, visual awareness and attention, and mental imagery. "
921,ColgateUni,P NEUR 355 - Language and Thought ,"P Language is a distinctive human ability that distances humans from the rest of the animal kingdom - including chimpanzees, with whom people share 98 percent of the same genetic inheritance. Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition. "
922,ColgateUni,"P NEUR 373 - Brain, Physiology, and Behavior ","P What is the relationship among brain, physiology, and behavior in humans and animals? What can we learn about the relationship of brain and behavior that can be useful for understanding and treating psychological and behavioral disorders in humans? This course examines a wide variety of research strategies used in the contemporary study of brain, physiology, and behavior. "
923,ColgateUni,P NEUR 375 - Cognitive Neuroscience ,"P Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field - drawing from chemistry, biology, medicine, neuroscience, psychology and philosophy - that explores the relationship between the mind and the brain. The scope of this course is broad, focusing on brain mechanisms for such diverse processes as sensation and perception, attention, memory, emotion, language, and consciousness. Students read primary journal articles on case studies from the clinical literature of patients with localized brain damage and reports from the experimental and neuroimaging literature on the effects of invasive and noninvasive manipulations in normal subjects. Mind-brain relationships are considered in the context of cognitive theories, evolutionary comparisons, and human development. "
924,ColgateUni,P NEUR 376 - Functional Neuroanatomy and Neural Development ,"P The first quarter of the course focuses on mechanisms of neural development including proliferation of stem cells, migration, differentiation, and synapse formation. The latter portion of the course examines the function of neuroanatomical regions and their relationship to the variety of symptoms associated with schizophrenia. As the more overt symptoms of schizophrenia do not appear until late adolescence, knowing how and when various regions of the brain develop is essential for understanding the emergence of various neurological deficits in this disease. "
925,ColgateUni,P NEUR 377 - Psychopharmacology ,"P Discussion of the effects of drugs upon psychological processes and behavior in humans. Readings in the textbook treat the mechanisms of action (physiological and neurochemical) of various classes of drugs used in therapy or ""on the street."" Readings in professional journals illustrate the experimental study of drug effects in humans and in animals. "
926,ColgateUni,P NEUR 378 - Topics in Neuroscience ,P Courses in specific neuroscience topics offered by various staff members. Inquiries about the topics offered any given term should be directed to the coordinator of the Neuroscience Program. 
927,ColgateUni,P NEUR 381 - Behavioral Genetics ,"P An introduction which demonstrates that nature and nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of behavioral traits; and how genes interact with environment to shape the development of various behavioral traits. The course will use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the studies in genetics, neuroscience, and behavior; with a comparative approach to explore human and other animal models; and cover the traditional behavioral genetic methodologies as well as modern molecular genetic techniques. "
928,ColgateUni,P NEUR 384 - Fundamentals of Neurophysiology ,"P This seminar and laboratory course examines the physiology of the nervous system.

For students who wish to be considered for honors, two-term thesis projects are required; such students enroll in NEUR 498 in the fall and NEUR 499 in the spring. On occasion, students who are not pursuing honors or high honors may complete two semesters of senior research by taking NEUR 498 in the fall and NEUR 499 in the spring. With permission, PSYC 450, when appropriate, may be substituted for NEUR 498. "
933,ColgateUni,"P PCON 240 - Waging Nonviolence: Theory, Practice, and Critique ","P When people think about the social movements behind struggles for revolutionary change or territorial independence, they often imagine armed insurrections, guerrilla armies, and terrorist organizations. Yet nonviolent movements are far more likely to achieve revolution or independence than violent movements. Nonviolent movements are also more likely to install durable and democratic governments after the conflict is over. These nonviolent victories often take place when movements abandon violence and adopt civil resistance as their leading strategy. To understand these global trends, this course investigates the dynamics of violent and nonviolent conflicts using theories of social movements. This theoretical understanding is tested using comparative case study analysis, student research projects, computer game play, and real-world simulations. "
934,ColgateUni,P PCON 245 - Organizing War: Military ,"P Governments make war but the military fights them. How modern militaries are built impacts their world – and ours. Concentrating on the US armed forces, this class explores how mission, thought, culture, and politics shape the military and its functions. Part of our challenge is to understand the relationship among these factors. This course discusses major themes in modern military studies, with a focus on military organization. It explores why militaries change and adapt – or fail to – and asks what exactly they are meant to do in the first place. Students gain literacy in major topics and controversies in military studies and major issues in current military policymaking, as well as learn practical career skills through practice creating executive summaries. "
935,ColgateUni,P PCON 250 - Critical Peace Studies ,"P Examines human conflict and attempts to understand the worldwide decline in warfare since the end of the Cold War. This examination is framed in terms of the original debate within peace studies: the minimalist or negative peace school versus the maximalist or positive peace approach. Whereas the negative peace school focused on techniques to interrupt or preempt specific instances of mass violence (e.g., through mediation, conflict resolution, intervention, and peace-building/peace-enforcement), the positive peace school advanced a more ambitious scientific and political agenda to prevent wars from ever happening again by understanding and addressing violence in all its forms (physical, mental, structural, symbolic, etc.). Students interrogate both approaches vis-à-vis the historical and empirical record of armed conflict. "
936,ColgateUni,P PCON 260 - Gender in Conflict and Peace ,"P Aims to make a feminist sense of contemporary wars and conflicts. Students trace the gendered processes of defining citizenship, national identity and security, and examine the role of the military in the construction of femininity and masculinity. One of the most prominent social constructions of gender is that of the male provider/warrior and the female caregiver/peacemaker. The making of war depends in large part on the maintenance of this simplistic conceptualization. In addition, the inequalities and power imbalances that lead to situations of conflict, at both macro- and micro-levels, reflect and reinforce the structural and discursive inequality between men and women. The class is interdisciplinary and gives equal weight to theory and practice while drawing on writings by local and global theorist and activists. "
937,ColgateUni,P PCON 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
938,ColgateUni,P PCON 301 - International Human Rights and Advocacy ,"P The gap between the promise of international human rights law and its actual practice is vast. For many advocates and activists, the gap is a source of frustration as international human rights laws and norms rarely translate into basic protections at the level of the individual. This course is designed to make students aware of the contentious nature of human rights, both in theory and in practice. It is premised on the idea that human rights are constantly claimed and developed, if not made anew, by multiple actors--whether as rights-holders, advocates, or otherwise, and that this takes place in the context of intense struggle between state and non-state actors. Students examine both the international human rights regime and the struggle for human rights, and how they interact in practice. The course takes a purposeful right-based and victim-centered approach, with the goal of introducing students to the profession of human rights advocacy. "
939,ColgateUni,"P PCON 304 - Criminal Underworld: Drugs, Guns, Bodies ","P Examines the violent networks of the illicit global economy: from guns and drugs smuggling, to human trafficking and animal poaching among others. Drawing from multiple scholarly traditions, it compares the concrete geographical organization of these illicit networks - that is, where and how they become grounded - and asks the following questions: What are the relationships of these illegal activities to legal circuits of power and profit? In what ways are transnational criminal networks redefining the nature of contemporary violence and the meaning of peace? "
940,ColgateUni,P PCON 310 - Geopolitics ,"P Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of ""the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation."" As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the ""closed system"" we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified "
941,ColgateUni,P PCON 314 - Media War: Peace and Conflict in the Digital Age ,"P The first purpose of the course is to demonstrate the central importance of media in defining the reality of war, peace, and violence in modern culture. The second goal is to introduce, in a selective manner, film, art, and written works that shaped these definitions. The primary framework is chronological, beginning with a survey of images of war and peace in art, covering in detail World War I and World War II, and ending with current images of war and of preparations for nuclear war. The secondary framework distinguishes types or degrees of war: World War I and World War II, civil wars (Spain) and genocide (the Armenians, the Jews in Europe); struggles of national liberation (Vietnam and Algeria); and prospects of global holocaust, this last creating new imagery - both positive and negative - in art, poetry, fiction, and film. "
942,ColgateUni,P PCON 322 - Weapons and War: Interdisciplinary Perspectives ,"P Mustard gas, airpower, submarines, A-bombs, Agent Orange, landmines, terror wars, ""Star Wars"": weapons technology profoundly shaped the science, politics, and culture of the last century. This course explores the myriad effects of the production, deployment, and use of weapons. Specifically, the course considers how the horizons of science and technology have been shaped by the quest for ever-more-powerful or sophisticated weaponry; how the creation of new weapons changes the nature of war and peace; how new weapons may impact lives and the planet; terror as a weapon, and scientific and social responses to it; the role of media images in the public consciousness of weaponry and war; and impacts of the global arms trade. While critically theorizing the social, environmental, and philosophical impacts of war over the past century, the course also examines the place of global ethics in discussions about weapons and war. "
943,ColgateUni,P PCON 327 - Australia's Stolen Generations: The Legacies of Carrolup (Extended Study) ,"P The intellectual goal of this extended study course is to address issues of both population vulnerabilities and cultural resilience by considering Aborigines in Australia, and specifically engaging the historical geography and the contemporary experience of the Noongar community in Western Australia. Three themes form the curricular program of the extended study. (1) Students will study the historical geography of Aborigines in Australia within the context of European colonization and settlement, federation and nation-building. These issues will be framed using concepts of population vulnerability, environmental impact, and cultural heritage and identity at the national, regional and local geographic scales. (2) Students study the impacts of national, regional and local policies directed toward indigenous peoples on Aboriginal families and children, given particular focus to programs concerning part-Aboriginal children, Australia's Stolen Generations. (3) Students learn the ways in which Aboriginal culture and ""care for country"" has remained resilient across time, space, and generations. "
944,ColgateUni,P PCON 333 - Religious Faith and Social Ethics ,"P Social ethics pursues questions about how human societies ought to organize themselves and their relations to other communities in order to realize human values. For many people around the world, religious faith provides the ultimate framework for value decisions. Texts include works by earlier religious leaders of movements for social-political-economic justice (e.g., Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.) as well as very recent works addressing current issues such as ethnic/international/religious conflict, environmental devastation, globalization, and religious terrorism. In addition, one or two texts develop basic models for religious social ethics. "
945,ColgateUni,P PCON 340 - Terror and Counter - Terror: Histories and Logics of Asymmetric Warfare ,"P For as long as empires and states have been going to war, people have been fighting them with the tactics and technologies now known as terrorism and guerrilla warfare. Asymmetric warfare, however, is no mere historical artifact. It dominates headlines as much as it confounds leaders around the world. Central to this course are several in depth case studies of counter-insurgency and terrorism, including France in Algeria and Indochina; the British in Malaya, East Africa and Northern Ireland; state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War; and the United States in the Philippines, Vietnam, and, after September 11, 2001, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The evolution of non-state terrorism — from the violent acts of Anarchists in the late 19th Century to the potentially apocalyptic terrorism of radical religious groups the early 21st Century — also comes under scrutiny. From Clausewitz to General Petraeus, from Mao Zedong to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, this class explores how asymmetric war is lived and understood by various observers and participants. "
946,ColgateUni,P PCON 341 - War and the Shaping of American Politics ,"P Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the ""military-industrial complex;"" and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. "
947,ColgateUni,P PCON 345 - Transitional and Historical Justice ,"P In what ways and under what conditions do states pursue justice for past wrongs? Is democracy credible without confronting the abuses of previous regimes? This course examines the theories and practices of transitional and historical justice since 1945. It presents a global line-up of case studies, which students evaluate in a comparative framework. Specific topics include Post-WWII Germany, Latin America, South Africa, Rwanda, Eastern Europe after 1989, Cambodia, Australia, and the United States. "
948,ColgateUni,P PCON 351 - The Israel/Palestine Conflict ,"P Focuses on the longstanding struggle between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as on the history of the way the conflict has been defined (e.g., an Arab-Israeli conflict, a religious war between Jews and Muslims, etc.). The course profiles episodes in the history of the conflict--and of the efforts to resolve it--in light of contemporary developments across the globe. The war of 1948 is analyzed in light of decolonization struggles following WWII, just as the ""Six-Day War"" of 1967 is studied in light of Cold War politics. In addition to focusing on flashpoints in the history of the conflict, the course also examines international agendas for ending it. Repeated US efforts to broker a peace are analyzed in light of geopolitical developments elsewhere. Students will become well-versed in the historical and social developments of the conflict and study the various treaties, armistice agreements, and memoranda that have guided efforts to bring it to a conclusion. They also study outstanding issues in the contest between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as current peace and armistice proposals. "
949,ColgateUni,P PCON 355 - Rwanda since the 1994 Genocide ,"P Assesses the Rwandan experience of post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation to ask how sustainable is the country's post-genocide recovery? Principally concerned with understanding how to do field research in difficult settings such as post-genocide Rwanda. Using the 'do no harm' framework of doing research with individuals who have lived through mass violence, students are equipped to undertake research in foreign field settings beyond the Rwandan case. In particular, students learn to design a 'human subjects' research proposal, rooted in The Belmont Report of ethical research and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Using Rwanda since the 1994 genocide as a case study, these principles will be studied to highlight their shortcomings in the context of research in post-conflict societies, while highlighting the importance of ethical research methods. "
950,ColgateUni,P PCON 358 - Transnational Politics ,"P Examines the segment of world politics that includes interactions and transactions between actors who are not representatives of governments or intergovernmental institutions. Non-state actors as diverse as global social movements, multinational corporations, religious communities, and even terrorist networks are now recognized as playing crucial roles on the world's political stage. This course focuses on a variety of these transnational actors, as we seek to stretch the limits of state-based approaches, and emphasize the rich variety of relationships and interactions that characterizes contemporary world politics.

951,ColgateUni,P PCON 368 - After Genocide: Memory and Representation ,"P An investigation of the impact of genocide on the self and the imagination's representations in literature, film, and art. Primary texts include poetry, memoir, video testimony, film, and visual art. Scholarly methodology involves readings of literary criticism and theoretical work in the study of trauma, literary theory, and testimony. Among the questions the course asks are: How does trauma shape imagination and open up access to the site of disaster that is now carried in fragments which inform memory? How do representations of violence shape and inflect aesthetic orientations and literary and artistic forms? The course concerns itself with the aftermath of two 20th-century genocides--that of the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and of the Jews in Europe during World War II--both seminal events of the 20th century that, in various ways, became models for ensuing genocides.

956,ColgateUni,P PHIL 101 - Introduction to Philosophical Problems ,"P Acquaints students with the nature of philosophical problems and the means by which one might try to solve them. Readings and discussions are organized around perennial questions regarding the nature of morality and justice, free will, the existence of God, the meaning of life, the nature of knowledge, and the relation between mind and body. "
957,ColgateUni,P PHIL 111 - Ethics ,"P Explores central questions of morality. What makes a good life good? What makes some actions right and others wrong? Are there human rights that everyone has? What are our obligations to others? Are there good answers to these questions, or is it all relative? Among the philosophers explored are Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Bentham, Mill, and various significant contemporary thinkers. "
958,ColgateUni,P PHIL 121 - Political Philosophy ,"P Explores central questions in political philosophy, with an emphasis on the great figures in the tradition (including Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, and Marx). Among those questions are, what justifies the state? Is democracy the only legitimate form of government? How much freedom should be secured for individuals? How should we understand the ideal of equality? "
959,ColgateUni,P PHIL 214 - Medical Ethics ,"P Addresses urgent moral questions that arise in the field of medicine. Some of these are long standing. Is health strictly a biological concept, or do cultural and social norms in part determine what is good health? Should doctors act solely for the goal of improving their patients' health, or is their central obligation to respect patient autonomy? Other questions are more recent. When exactly is a person dead, such that withdrawing life-saving equipment is appropriate? Should parents and doctors take steps to see that their children are born with more desirable traits and characteristics? Students learn how philosophic argument can help illuminate these and related issues. "
960,ColgateUni,P PHIL 216 - Existentialism ,"P Designed to introduce students to existentialist thought via an examination of its 19th-century origins and 20th-century manifestations. Among the authors to be discussed are Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Beauvoir, Camus, and Marcel. Among the topics to be considered are existence, freedom, subjectivity, and absurdity. "
961,ColgateUni,P PHIL 226 - Philosophy of Religion ,"P Can the existence of God be proven? Can it be disproven? What is the relationship between faith and reason? Does evil provide strong evidence against the existence of God? How should we think about the relationship between creation and evolution -- and about the relationship between science and religion generally? Does the Christian notion of the Trinity make any sense? What about the idea of Original Sin or the Atonement? Students seek reasoned answers to many of these questions by evaluating the work of philosophers who address them. Students encounter both classical and contemporary authors, though the class focuses more on perspicacious presentations of these issues rather than on their historical development. "
962,ColgateUni,P PHIL 228 - Philosophy of Science ,"P An introduction to the philosophy of science and explores issues of general philosophical interest to the sciences, rather than those germane to any particular discipline. Focus is on the issues of scientific laws, induction, theory confirmation and choice, falsificationism, reductionism, realism, explanation, prediction, and problems relevant to the special sciences. "
963,ColgateUni,P PHIL 229 - The Philosophy of Law ,"P Examines some central ideas of jurisprudence and the philosophy of law. Readings concentrate on general theories of law, justice, legal rights, liability, and legal responsibility, and on the nature of judicial reasoning and legal principles. Some broader methodological questions pertaining to causation and the law and the relation of law and morality are discussed and related to the readings. "
964,ColgateUni,P PHIL 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
965,ColgateUni,P PHIL 301 - Ancient Philosophy (MF) ,"P Surveys some of the central figures and ideas of classical Greek and Roman philosophy, with particular emphasis on Plato, Aristotle and the main Hellenistic schools. Topics to be considered include the aim and method of Socratic inquiry; Plato's epistemology, theory of forms and defense of justice; Aristotle's logic, ontology and ethical theory; Stoic and Epicurean cosmology and ethics. "
966,ColgateUni,P PHIL 302 - Modern Philosophy (MF) ,"P The rise of modern science together with the Reformation's challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church created an era of intense intellectual and cultural ferment in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The philosophy of this period is called 'modern' because it made a distinct break with older traditions and because the questions it asked remain the central issues for philosophers today. Studying modern philosophy will help students think creatively about what there is, what we are, and what we can know. Readings will be selected from classic works by Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Hume, and Kant. "
967,ColgateUni,P PHIL 303 - Medieval Philosophy (MF) ,"P Medieval philosophy involved the absorption and transformation of Greek and Hellenistic thought by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers, often in relations of mutual influence. The period is crucial not only for its project of reconciling reason and faith but also for philosophical insights, arguments, and formulations that have remained influential in several of the main areas of philosophy. The course focuses on questions concerning freedom of the will, the nature of moral requirements and obligation, the role of rational considerations in morality, the virtues, and ideals of human excellence. Students read figures from the three faith traditions and explore their interactions and mutual influences, as well as their differences. Coverage of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers is roughly equal, and students look at the Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Aristotelian background to their thought as well as the new directions in which they took philosophy. "
968,ColgateUni,P PHIL 304 - Kant and German Idealism (MF) ,"P German Idealism continues to be one of the most influential movements in philosophy, leaving its mark on many different fields of thought and experience, including epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and religion. Designed as an overview of the thought of the major representatives of German Idealism: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Students will examine the problems that motivated the emergence and development of this philosophical tradition, and the new forms of philosophical argument that each of these thinkers employed in order to address these problems. In doing so, students will see that there is a sense in which Kant can be considered the father of Existentialism. The topics discussed include the doctrine of transcendental idealism, the nature and possibility of knowledge, the ground of moral obligation, human freedom, and religious belief. No prior familiarity with these issues or thinkers will be assumed. "
969,ColgateUni,P PHIL 306 - Recent Continental Philosophy ,"P A study of some of the major movements in recent continental philosophy. Among the movements to be considered are phenomenology, existentialism, philosophical hermeneutics, poststructuralism, and postmodernism. Among the thinkers to be considered are Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, Sartre, Foucault, and Derrida. Movements and thinkers may vary from year to year. "
970,ColgateUni,P PHIL 310 - Philosophy and the Social Sciences ,"P Considers philosophical questions about the nature of the social sciences as well as philosophical questions prompted by the results and methods of the social sciences. These questions include: Do the natural sciences offer an appropriate model for the social sciences, or is there something distinctive about human phenomena that requires a fundamentally different mode of inquiry and style of explanation? Are the reasons for which we act also the causes of our actions, or are reason-based and cause-based explanations of human behavior fundamentally distinct? Are economists correct in their assumptions about the rationality of economic agents? Is it possible, or desirable, to conduct social scientific research in a value-neutral fashion? If not, what are the consequences for the objectivity of the social sciences? Are our values and moral attitudes themselves merely the effects of natural selection, as evolutionary psychologists maintain? Readings are drawn not only from philosophy, but also from sociology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociobiology. "
971,ColgateUni,P PHIL 312 - Contemporary Political Philosophy (VT) ,"P Offers a critical engagement with the rich work in political philosophy that has appeared since the landmark publication of John Rawls' A Theory of Justice. After a close examination of Rawls' egalitarian liberalism, students take up the range of alternative positions that dominate contemporary political theory: conservatism, libertarianism, communitarianism, feminism, Marxism, and multi-culturalism. "
972,ColgateUni,P PHIL 313 - International Ethics (VT) ,"P Nations increasingly come into contact with one another in a common international arena, and these encounters raise a host of important moral questions: Are there moral standards that apply across all human communities, and if so, how specific are they? Do all human beings have rights, and if they do, what are they? What duties do wealthy countries have to aid poor ones? Are there moral constraints on how war must be conducted, and if so, what are they? In this course students engage with the work of contemporary theorists exploring these and related questions. "
973,ColgateUni,P PHIL 320 - 20th-Century Analytic Philosophy (M&E) ,"P Employs the tools of analytic philosophy to address the large topic of the mind, the world, and the relation between them; students also explore the closely related topics of how our concepts get their content and how our language gets its meaning. By analyzing both our concepts and our experience, students will try to answer questions like: What is the relation between experience and the world beyond the mind? Do beliefs about the world amount to knowledge? Is the content of experience conceptual – and so fully expressible in language – or does experience have a richness that always surpasses the expressive power of language? Where do concepts come from? What fixes their content, and what fixes the meaning of the words that express them? If the content of language is based in part on experience, can one understand the language of someone whose experience is different? Course readings will include works by Russell, Carnap, Quine, Sellars, Davidson, and McDowell. "
974,ColgateUni,P PHIL 325 - Logic II ,"P Covers a selection of advanced topics in logic: computability, Turing machines, soundness and completeness theorems, undecidability of predicate logic, Skolem-Lweheim theorems, nonstandard models, and Gel's incompleteness theorems. "

Readings include Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche, etc., as well as contemporary essays. "
976,ColgateUni,P PHIL 332 - Philosophy of Race and Racism ,"P Serves as a sustained investigation into the concepts of race and racism through an examination of metaphysical, psychological, ethical, linguistic, and political problems associated with race. Topics to be discussed include the nature of race (are races real and if so what are they?), the formation of racial identities, individual and institutional racism, and notions of distributive and compensatory justice and how they are used to address issues of racial injustice. Readings include Appiah, Boxill, DuBois, Fanon, Garcia, Hacking, Lycan, Taylor, and others. "
977,ColgateUni,P PHIL 333 - Topics in Environmental Philosophy ,"P Involves a critical examination of selected fundamental issues and theories in environmental philosophy. Precise issues and themes vary from year to year, but may include sustainability and moral obligations to future generations; the nature of the good life for humans; the status of environmental values; recent work in environmental ethics theories including deep ecology, social ecology, and ecofeminism; the moral and metaphysical status of human modifications to the world, including environmental restoration and genetic engineering; and aesthetics of the natural world. An emphasis is placed on exploring the connections between philosophical theory and environmental policy and practice. "
978,ColgateUni,P PHIL 341 - Philosophy of Mind (M&E) ,P Examines the historical and contemporary debates about the nature of the mind. These questions are considered: How do minds (or their states or products) manage to be about things? Are all minds conscious? How serious is the difference between first-person and third-person perspectives on mental activity? What beyond consciousness is required for self-hood? What grounds our concept of mental health? What kind of mind makes individuals responsible for their behavior? 
979,ColgateUni,P PHIL 342 - Philosophy of Language (M&E) ,"P Examines major topics and insights in the philosophy of language from its modern inception in the late 19th century to the present. Core questions include: How does linguistic meaning relate to how people use language to communicate? What is meaning's relationship to concepts like reference, truth, verification and use? Is there a systematic theory that can generate the meaning of every sentence in a language? In answering the above questions, students master the logical and conceptual tools for analyzing particular parts of language, which may include names, definite descriptions, demonstratives, metaphors, slurs, and other interesting linguistic expressions. Among the thinkers discussed are Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Grice, Quine, Searle, Davidson, and Kripke. "
980,ColgateUni,P PHIL 343 - Topics in Moral Theory (VT) ,"P Moral theory concerns what makes acts right or wrong, what makes people good or bad. In addressing these issues, the course also considers the following questions: Do moral standards apply universally, or are they relative to one's culture, religion, or other moral framework? Can we reconcile the impartiality of morality with the partiality we feel toward certain people, such as parents, spouses, or children? Are there ethical principles that apply in all circumstances, or is morality fundamentally a case-by-case affair? This course centers primarily on contemporary approaches to these questions, with the aim of enabling students to address these questions critically and rigorously. "
981,ColgateUni,P PHIL 345 - Topics in African-American Philosophy (VT) ,"P An introduction to issues in African-American philosophy. In particular, it explores the political and ideological goals of leading intellectuals from the 19th century to the present. From DuBois and Delany to the black power movement of the 1960s, analysis of African-American experiences has produced divergent strategies intended to better the condition of black communities in America. The course investigates nationalist strategies and their roots in notions of black identity as they have been developed through the writings of intellectuals, artists, and political figures. It also addresses challenges as to whether or not nonintegrationist strategies can be used to achieve social equality. Authors include Elizabeth Anderson, Anthony Appiah, Countée Cullen, Martin Delany, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Alain Locke, Claude McKay, Tommie Shelby, Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. "
982,ColgateUni,P PHIL 360 - Feminist Philosophy ,"P Explores questions at the intersection of feminist philosophy and the theory of knowledge (epistemology). How have gendered assumptions influenced philosophical views about what knowledge is and how knowledge is best pursued?  What roles, if any, should considerations of gender play in our theories of knowledge? In addition to these general questions, students address issues in feminist philosophy of science, specifically issues concerning the scientific study of sexual differences in behavior and brain structure. The role of testimony in the transmission of knowledge is also considered. Feminist epistemologists and philosophers of language have explored ways in which gender affects the assessment of testimony as trustworthy. Patterns of acceptance of testimony matter for how the claims people make—in law courts and elsewhere—are heard (or not) by others. Concludes by considering what this means for the proper philosophical treatment of testimony about personal experience. "
983,ColgateUni,P PHIL 371 - Scottish Philosophy and the Fact-Value Distinction (Study Group) ,"P The distinctions between fact and value, reason and emotion, and objectivity and subjectivity, have long and varied histories. This course examines the role those distinctions played in two thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment: David Hume and Adam Smith. The motivations for and benefits of these distinctions are explored, with special attention paid to Hume's concerns about religious ""enthusiasm."" Rigid versions of these distinctions have, however been criticized for their serious costs in both epistemology and ethics. The course engages recent major criticisms, and then considers whether Hume or Smith might have had a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions they worked with than their many followers did. "
984,ColgateUni,P PHIL 380 - Issues in Epistemology and Metaphysics (M&E) ,"P This is an umbrella course designed to allow students to delve into specific topics in epistemology or metaphysics. The study will situate each problem in its appropriate historical context thus allowing student access to the approaches to a given issue offered in Ancient, Medieval, Modern, and recent works.

1013,ColgateUni,P POSC 151 - Politics and Moral Vision (TH) ,"P This introduction to political theory addresses the ways in which personal morality and ideas of human flourishing determine one's perceptions and responses to political institutions that shape the life and culture of one's nation. Using a wide variety of texts, the moral underpinnings of different political systems are discussed in terms of fundamental normative concepts such as right, duty, virtue, liberty, and equality. Other essential terms, basic to building a foundational political vocabulary, such as liberalism, conservatism, individualism, communalism, and modernity are also explored. This introduction to normative political theory gives special emphasis to the genesis and development of liberal democracy and the tensions between its component parts, particularly as they relate to visions of a well-lived, moral life. This course is designed to enrich one's perceptions of the evening news and the political discourse of our times. (TH) "
1014,ColgateUni,P POSC 153 - Introduction to Comparative Politics (CO) ,"P Nearly 200 independent states coexist in the world today. Although they are all unique, political scientists study them in systematic ways, comparing them to discover fundamental political patterns that can help produce broadly applicable generalizations across different cultures and geographies. Themes such as democratic or authoritarian regime type, models of economic development, state institutions, civil society, and issues of national and ethnic identity all form important realms of inquiry for researchers engaged in the practice of comparative politics. This course introduces students to the principle themes and basic theories of comparative politics using examples from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including both authoritarian and unstable democratic countries. (CO) "
1015,ColgateUni,P POSC 208 - Comparative Democracies (CO) ,"P Offers a comparative examination of the social bases of democracy and of different forms of constitutional government and competitive politics in both advanced industrial and developing countries in regions including Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Students explore questions about the causes of democratic stability and instability across countries and the effectiveness of their democratic government in delivering goods to their citizens. Students examine key conditions that appeared conducive to producing democratic transitions across the three ""waves"" of democratization. Finally, students consider the process of democratic consolidations, considering topics such as civil society, civil-military relations, institutional design, and international influences. (CO) "
1016,ColgateUni,P POSC 210 - Congress (AM) ,"P Analyzes the legislative process with a special emphasis on the relationship between Congress and the presidency.

Course materials include classics of congressional scholarship as well as results from some of the latest research in the field. (AM) "
1017,ColgateUni,P POSC 211 - The Presidency and Executive Leadership (AM) ,"P An examination of the complex and controversial role the presidency plays in the American political system. The course begins with the founders and with the creation of the presidency at the Constitutional Convention. This is followed by an examination of the powers vested in the office and the ways in which they check and are checked by Congress. Discussion then turns to what has come to be called the ""managerial presidency."" Descriptive and analytical treatment of the ways in which the country elects presidents is a major topic. At many points the American presidency is compared to executive power in other democracies. (AM) "
1018,ColgateUni,P POSC 212 - The Politics of Race and Ethnicity (AM) ,"P Examines the political dynamics of race in American society, focusing primarily on the experience of blacks as a socio-political group and to a lesser degree on that of other racial and ethnic minorities. The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue - racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics. (AM) "
1019,ColgateUni,P POSC 213 - Comparative Politics: The Third World (CO) ,"P What is the Third World? Should countries as diverse as India and Cuba be included in its description? Why is democracy so fragile in Latin America? How can women contribute to development? This course tries to answer these questions by examining the historical origins, political evolution, and economic development of Third World countries from Thailand to Tanzania. Using the tools and methods of comparative inquiry, students explore the states, societies, and economies of different regions included under the rubric of the ""Third World"" such as the Caribbean, South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The role of women, health, population, migration, and democratization issues in these regions are discussed, as well as the theories and methods used by comparativists in order to explain political systems and economic changes in the ""Third World."" (CO) "
1020,ColgateUni,P POSC 214 - Comparative Politics: East and Southeast Asia (CO) ,"P Introduces students to the politics of East and Southeast Asia. Students compare and contrast the diverse political and economic evolution of countries across the region by examining the historical development of state structures, regime types, and the development of institutions and organizations such as parties and civil society groups. Students focus on the experiences of the East Asian ""early developers"" (Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the transition to democracy across the region, and consider the emergence of China as an economic and political power.

1021,ColgateUni,P POSC 216 - Comparative Politics: Latin America (CO) ,"P Today Latin America is one of the most democratic regions of the developing world, although it faces problems of inequality, gridlock, and economic growth. Latin America's 20th-century experiences of coups, revolutions, and instability also present important lessons for comparative politics. This course introduces students to the countries of Latin America and the important patterns of similarity and difference that can help them understand political development and elucidate comparative trends. Regime type is one prism through which students examine the region's countries, including democracy, semi-democracy, and various authoritarian regimes, especially bureaucratic authoritarianism. Another important topic is the United States' relationship with the region's polities, on issues like the Cold War, drug wars, and economic policies. In addition to big countries like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, the course also focuses on countries of particular student interest. (CO) "

Covers a variety of topics: the relationship between the state and the market in economic development, the interaction between growth and the development of political institutions, and the political repercussions of developmental outcomes such as demographic change and rapid urbanization. Students explore the interplay of state capacity, market development, and democratic institution building. "
1026,ColgateUni,P POSC 307 - China's Foreign Relations ,"P Examines China's complex relations with the world mainly since the 1990s. It begins with a brief consideration of traditional Chinese understandings of international relations, historical legacies, geopolitical predicaments, and China's foreign policymaking process. Students examine the recent reorientation of Chinese foreign policy as a result of China's post-Mao economic reforms. Students assess China's grand strategy of ""Peaceful Development,"" Chinese integration into ""international institutions,"" and China's partial participation in an emergent Asian regionalism. Geographically, students examine China's relations with its Pacific neighbors, other developing countries (especially in Africa), and with advanced countries (Europe and the USA).

Students investigate China's foreign policies on major international issues in an age of globalization. Specifically, with regard to the global economy, climate change and international human rights are examined. Concludes by assessing the prospects for Chinese foreign policy in the 21st Century. "
1027,ColgateUni,P POSC 313 - Political Corruption ,"P Like it or not, corruption is a significant form of political influence, as much a part of politics as voting or writing a member of Congress. Indeed, in some parts of the world, corruption is not the exception, but the norm. This course examines the limits of privately interested political action in a variety of societies and considers possible explanations for corruption, examines case studies drawn from American politics and from other nations, and identifies the consequences of corruption, both for whole societies and for important groups within them. Reforms are a concern as well. Finally, the class considers the ways people in a variety of cultures judge right and wrong, and how they respond to the wrongdoing they perceive around them. "
1028,ColgateUni,P POSC 314 - American Political Development ,"P An introduction the political science subfield of American Political Development, which traces the historical development of political institutions and the evolution of state/society relations in this country. How ""exceptional"" is the trajectory of state-building in the United States compared with other long-term democracies? What is the role of culture in shaping American politics and explaining change over time? How has race figured historically in the articulation of state power? Course readings tackle these and other questions from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain spanning several centuries. "
1029,ColgateUni,P POSC 315 - Government and the Economy ,"P The course examines the inevitable intrusion of politics into economic policy making, with examples drawn from a variety of policy areas including traditional economic regulation, the new social regulation, energy and environmental policies, and recent trends toward deregulation. The course begins with elementary economic theory: the case for free markets, a review of the various ways unregulated markets break down, and rational prescriptions for remedying market failures. The bulk of the course then examines the factors operating to make these market failures more complex than at first they appear, producing policies that depart from economic ideals. "
1030,ColgateUni,P POSC 317 - Identity Politics ,"P Examines the politics of identity in comparative perspectives. Introduces students to a variety of theoretical approaches concerning the origin, transformation, and mobilization of national, ethnic, and other forms of collective identity. Students consider empirical applications of these theories: students identify processes through which identity becomes politicized, explore why some identity conflicts manifest as violence, and analyze the various ways - ranging from electoral solutions to genocide - in which states manage difference. Case studies are drawn from Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa, the Asian sub-continent, and the United States. "
1031,ColgateUni,"P POSC 320 - States, Markets, and Global Change ","P Do states intervene in the economy too much as conservatives and libertarians claim, or should they intervene more as many liberals and progressives argue? Does business have too much power or have the critics of ""big business"" and multinationals been too alarmist? Is the role of the government diminishing as the world becomes more global? This course discusses contemporary controversies regarding the relationship between government and the economy. It evaluates and examines the extent and kinds of state intervention into markets and the private sector, the influence and impact of corporations and business leaders on government institutions and policy from the United States to Latin America. "
1032,ColgateUni,P POSC 321 - Political Parties and Electoral Process ,"P Political parties are some of the most influential entities in politics, and this course examines them as they pursue pork, policy, and power in the arenas of elections and elected institutions. After providing a strong background in party theory and the American party system, the remainder of the course highlights important commonalities by comparing party activity and party system development in other countries that straddle the developed and developing world. "
1033,ColgateUni,P POSC 322 - The Politics of Privatization ,"P The adoption of neoliberal economic policies has been one of the most significant reforms undertaken around the world in the last two decades. Privatization, in particular, has been so popular and so widespread that one writer has remarked that even the United States, the quintessential free market economy, was ""looking for something to sell."" This course examines political and economic explanations for the global adoption of privatization and economic restructuring in the 1980s and 1990s. It looks at the conditions under which governments enacted policies and compares the outcome of privatization measures in selected countries and sectors in East and Central Europe, Latin America, and Africa. It analyzes the claims of critics of privatization and the responses of privatization's winners and losers. Students examine recent changes in the approach to the distribution of public goods and explore innovative public-private partnerships such as that between the development agency, CARE, and the coffee company, Starbucks, to provide water, sanitation, or micro-credit in developing countries. "
1034,ColgateUni,P POSC 323 - American Elections and Party Power ,"P Focuses closely on the US party system and the electoral area in which the parties struggle for power. In order to develop a strong conception of American parties, students combine scrutiny of the day-to-day media representations of political parties with important comparative perspectives to understand how American parties and elections fit into broader political science frameworks, as well as their long-term and global implications. Students compare the current US party system in three directions: back through history (especially the 20th century) to understand the roots of today's parties; out to the rest of the world, comparing party systems in other highly democratic countries; and also down to the state level, where students examine to what degree New York State parties and elections reflect national trends. Important topics covered include the effects of redistricting and campaign finance. Students also investigate the importance of issue-framing with units on contrasting party strategies of presenting a ""war on women"" and President Obama's ""socialism."" "
1035,ColgateUni,P POSC 328 - Religion and Politics ,P Religion and politics influence each other--pervasively and controversially--in almost every political system across the globe. This course examines this fundamentally important relationship in a variety of national settings through a comparative assessment of issues and controversies such as constitutional relations between religious institutions and the state; the appropriate role of religious beliefs in a democracy; the challenges posed to contemporary governments by the expansion of religious pluralism; the role that religious interests and religious leaders can play in elections and policy making; and the many ways that religion and religious mobilization are shaping the very nature of political life in the modern world. 
1036,ColgateUni,P POSC 330 - Post-Mao China and World Development ,"P Examines post-Mao China's socioeconomic development and post-socialist transition in an age of economic globalization. It analyzes the evolution of Chinese economic market reforms and China's uneven integration into the Liberal World Order since 1978. This two-pronged developmental trajectory, however, encounters major challenges such as socioeconomic problems, ecological degradations, political dysfunctions, ideational crises, and international impediments. With varying efficacy, the Chinese government has attempted to redress these daunting problems through administrative reforms, economic rebalancing, anti-corruption campaigns, and international institutions. These major challenges and their attempted ameliorations are analyzed in-depth. The course concludes by examining the practical and discursive ramifications of China's development model for Chinese society, world politics, and the philosophical search for alternative modernities. "
1037,ColgateUni,P POSC 331 - Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa ,"P Provides an understanding of politics in 48 countries that constitute sub-Saharan Africa. Following the independence era of the early 1960s and 1970s, much of the sub-continent exploded into a seemingly endless cycle of violence underscored by military coups d'état and civil wars. Over the last decade, various conflicts subsided enough for some states to institute political and market reforms. Others remained stuck in the throes of economic stagnation, on the verge of disintegration and vulnerable to terrorist groups and drug runners who exploit their vast ungovernable territories. What explains the various transitions that some states have experienced in sub-Saharan Africa? Why did most states disintegrate in violence following the end of colonial rule? Drawing upon pre-colonial accounts and histories of state formation and the theoretical, methodological, and conceptual tools that various Africanists have used to analyze key events, this course offers answers to these and other important questions about political and socio-economic developments on the continent of Africa. "
1038,ColgateUni,P POSC 332 - African Political Economy ,"P This course examines the wide array of processes, actors, and institutions that shape the collective formation of the political economy of African states. In particular, the course is designed to take into account international and domestic processes, actors, and institutions, and how they interact. These include cultural, institutional, soci-economic, and broadly defined economic structures and processes, forces that create opportunities and constraints that shape economic policy making. "
1039,ColgateUni,P POSC 335 - U.S. Environmental Politics ,"P Public policies to protect the environment are among the most important and controversial issues in local, state, and national government. This course analyzes the politics of environmental protection in the United States through the use of social science theory and a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods. The course introduces frameworks for understanding environmental policy problems and reviews several important American environmental laws. Readings include social science ""classics"" on the environment, as well as recent scholarship on environmental politics and emerging environmental issues. Topics covered in the course include the politics of environmental science, environmentalism as a social movement, environmental lawmaking in Congress, bureaucracy and environmental regulation, federalism, environmental law, and environmental justice. "
1040,ColgateUni,P POSC 336 - Campaigns & Voting Behavior ,"P Examines political campaigns and voting behavior in American elections.

1041,ColgateUni,P POSC 337 - Law and Order ,"P In the American criminal justice policy process the people are represented by two separate, but equally important groups: the politicians who enact anti-crime laws and criminal justice officials who are empowered to enforce them. This course investigates ""Law & Order"" politics and policymaking in the U.S. by way of probing the extent to which the adoption of criminal justice policies by lawmakers and the administration of criminal law are driven and chiefly so by democratic pressures. "
1042,ColgateUni,"P POSC 338 - Sex, Law, and the American Culture Wars ","P Explores the American church-state debate through the lens of abortion and same-sex marriage. These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's ""culture wars"" in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. "
1043,ColgateUni,P POSC 340 - Politics of the American Metropolis ,"P The United States is an urban society: today nearly 80 percent of Americans live in urbanized, metropolitan areas. These urban areas are governed by a dizzying array of local, state, and federal institutions whose policies affect citizens' lives enormously and in myriad ways. This course explores the politics of urban America in the context of the contemporary metropolis. The legal and philosophical origins of local American government are discussed, along with the political economy of the city and classic theories of urban politics. The course traces the history of urbanization and the accompanying growth of government institutions, and addresses issues of suburbanization, regional balkanization, and federalism. Other issues addressed in the course include land use, segregation, housing, economic development, and poverty. "
1044,ColgateUni,P POSC 341 - War and the Shaping of American Politics ,"P Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the ""military-industrial complex;"" and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. "
1045,ColgateUni,P POSC 342 - The Politics of Nuclear Proliferation ,"P Why do states want to have nuclear weapons? How do specific motivations differ from Iran to North Korea to Israel, to India, to Pakistan? Some scholars and politicians argue that the world will be safer as more countries possess functional nuclear arsenals; are they right? This course examines the available data and the analyses of authors from a variety of countries in order to derive the best answers we can to the questions. "
1046,ColgateUni,P POSC 344 - Politics of Poverty ,"P Examines the nature and extent of poverty in the United States, with particular emphasis on public policies designed to alleviate poverty and recent proposals for reform. Political factors affecting the formulation and implementation of poverty policies are examined, drawing on case studies of selected issues such as the war on poverty, Medicare, food stamps, aid to families with dependent children, and negative income tax proposals. "
1047,ColgateUni,P POSC 345 - The News Media and the Political Process ,"P Politics is a distant and dimly understood process for most people; still, they must somehow come to terms with the threats and reassurances it offers, and reach assessments of personalities and policies about which they often know little. This course is an analysis of politics and the media from the inside out, beginning with the ways people receive, interpret, or ignore the media messages directed at them. News reporting and questions of bias are treated in the context of a group analysis of important stories. The class also considers the evolution and refinement of media campaigning techniques. Those who cannot purchase time or space in the mass media may resort to protest, terror, and violence in order to air their views. The class discusses these cases along with the ethical issues they pose. (PG) "
1048,ColgateUni,P POSC 346 - Beneath the Black Robes: Courts as Political Institutions ,"P Focuses on the causal dynamics of judicial behavior. Introduces students to the study of courts as political institutions and, in doing so, provides some understanding of the political nature of the role of courts in American society. Departs from the view that landmark national decisions such as Roe v. Wade, Baker v. Carr, and Brown v. Bd. of Education, along with their more recent conservative corollaries, are solely the product of adherence to constitutional standards of interpretation. Instead, it posits that these controversial rulings and judicial policy in general can be explained through careful examination of certain political factors. In short, the course is based on the premise that the judiciary is a permeable structure that is responsive to democratic processes and that, in turn, exerts influence upon those processes. Two major theoretical concerns integrate the lectures and materials covered: 1) the dynamic relationship between court decision-making processes and major features of the larger American political arena, and 2) the inherent tensions between judicial independence and democratic politics. "
1049,ColgateUni,P POSC 348 - The Rise and Fall of Communism ,"P Examines the spread of political and economic ideas and practices in the shocking advent and demise of state socialism and subsequent transitions to market capitalism. Students study the ideological struggles with Nazism, Fascism, and Capitalism, focusing mainly on the countries of East Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, but addressing an entire system of states where such transformative processes occurred in the 20th century. Students explore the politics, implementation, and impact of radical economic and social ideas. Students devote particular attention to the relationship between personal and cultural influences of ideologies, local polities and economies, and processes of global ideological development. "
1050,ColgateUni,P POSC 349 - The International Political Economy ,"P Looks at the historical and theoretical development of the international political economy. Some of the major topics include the interaction between politics and economics in trade and protectionism, capital flows, exchange rates, debt, globalization, and problems in development. (IR) "
1051,ColgateUni,P POSC 350 - Africa in World Politics ,"P Examines relations between African states and between African and foreign states. Major topics include the effects of the international system on economic and political development, African states' use of foreign policy to achieve development goals, the role of the major outside powers, intra-African conflicts, African organization, the role of African thought in foreign policies, and the international relations of southern Africa. "
1052,ColgateUni,"P POSC 354 - Capitalism, the State, and Development in Latin America ","P The developmental trajectories of Latin American countries contain a double conundrum: first, in spite of being a region endowed with a considerable amount of natural resources and having enjoyed privileged access to Western European and North American markets, the overall economic performance of the region during the 20th century lagged considerably behind that of the rest of the Western world. Second, even when these countries all share a past of colonial rule and a ""peripheral"" location in the international system, the economic differences within the countries of the region are staggering. Seeking to shed light on this puzzle, this course surveys existing theories on the relationship between political institutions and economic outcomes and explores the historical co-evolution of states, regimes, and markets in the region. "
1053,ColgateUni,P POSC 357 - International Institutions ,"P This analysis of the role of international institutions in international politics emphasizes both the United Nations and the major international economic institutions (WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank). "
1054,ColgateUni,P POSC 358 - Transnational Politics ,"P Examines the segment of world politics that includes interactions and transactions between actors who are not representatives of governments or intergovernmental institutions. Non-state actors as diverse as global social movements, multinational corporations, religious communities, and even terrorist networks are now recognized as playing crucial roles on the world's political stage. This course focuses on a variety of these transnational actors to stretch the limits of state-based approaches, and emphasize the rich variety of relationships and interactions that characterizes contemporary world politics. "
1055,ColgateUni,P POSC 360 - Domestic Sources of American Foreign Policy ,"P To the extent that the U.S. sets its own course in international affairs, domestic sources of American foreign policy become a crucial consideration. This course examines the role of domestic politics in formulating US foreign policy. Special emphasis is placed on the function of representative institutions, bureaucracies, and public opinion in determining and implementing American foreign policy. Students are presented with a comprehensive framework of analysis that permits them to describe and perhaps predict actions taken by the US government. "
1056,ColgateUni,P POSC 361 - Humanitarian Interventions ,"P Peace operations have been widely deployed to contain and promote resolution of conflicts. This course focuses primarily on humanitarian intervention and probes the different contexts in which peacekeepers have been introduced: interstate conflicts, civil conflicts, and humanitarian emergencies. Students consider how humanitarian interventions differ in practical terms from other types of peace operations, considering questions of strategy, mandates, and political will. Students also analyze the ethical implications of humanitarian intervention, particularly questions of responsibility, legitimacy, sovereignty, and unintended consequences. Theoretical readings are combined with comparative case studies are drawn from Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, and elsewhere. "
1057,ColgateUni,P POSC 365 - Just War in Comparative Perspective ,"P Introduce students to a wide variety of ways of thinking about justice and warfare, across time, space, and religion. Using political science--rather than theology or philosophy--as the lens for inquiry emphasizes the role played by political power in the creation and transmission of these systems of value. Beginning with an exploration of the roots of Western Just War thinking in the ancient world (Greece, Rome, and Israel), the course explores traditional just war thinking in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Students delve into source texts, examining the evolution of just war thought in a historical and comparative context, and the course illustrates the ways in which concepts of justice may be contingent on both a society's religious/ethnical beliefs and its military capabilities. Finally, the course turns to contemporary scholarship to ask, is just war theory still relevant today? Modern just war responses to weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and counter-insurgency warfare provide students the opportunity to apply these ancient theories to the modern world. "
1058,ColgateUni,P POSC 366 - Contemporary American Foreign Policy ,"P Focuses on the theoretical traditions underlying American foreign policy, key concepts in the conduct of foreign policy, and the application of these theories and concepts to historical and contemporary events. Students examine how policymakers determine the national interest, the tools used to conduct foreign policy, and how policymakers have responded to foreign policy problems in the 21st century. Students focus on both theory and application to understand how decisions are made and executed, as well as which policy problems are most critical today. "
1059,ColgateUni,P POSC 367 - The European Union ,"P Examines the development and consequences of European unification after World War II. Major topics include the nature and history of integration, concepts of sovereignty and the nation-state, the role of international organizations in world politics, the institutional structure of the EU, major initiatives such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Market, the meaning and repercussions of the Maastrict Treaty, and the development of a single currency. Includes the opportunity to participate in a model European Union with American and European students. "
1060,ColgateUni,P POSC 368 - American Foreign Relations with China ,"P Examines the major sources, dominant theories, and primary policy options in American foreign relations with China. Begins by examining some key determinants of this bilateral relationship and proceeds to investigate ""realist,"" ""liberal,"" and ""cultural"" approaches to understanding international relations in general and US China policy in particular. Particular attention is paid to the so-called ""Thucydides Trap"" and the actual consequences of a potential US-China war. Concludes by examining the effects of ""American Exceptionalism"" and the ""China threat"" on US foreign policy towards China. "
1061,ColgateUni,P POSC 369 - European Security (Geneva Study group) ,"P Focus on contemporary European security problems and the 'European' perspective on new security issues. Topics include: NATO enlargement, European security institutions and 'societal security' in Europe, intervention and democracy promotion, state formation, foreign aid and development issues, and human rights of refugees and others. "
1062,ColgateUni,P POSC 370 - International Relations in the Post-Cold War Environment ,"P The end of the Cold War and the introduction of a large number of non-traditional issues (environmental, economic, and normative) to the international agenda have raised very serious questions about the discipline of international relations itself. How new or old will the new international relations be? What conceptual framework should be used to explore these issues? What issues should be the focus? The course begins with a reassessment of the grand tradition in international relations and of how the order, upon which it was based, fell. The emerging world order and the agenda of new issues with which it confronts us, the likely new patterns of cooperation and conflict those issues will foster, and the possibilities for a new consensus are considered. "
1063,ColgateUni,P POSC 371 - West European Politics ,"P Looks at the history and political development of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. Students study these countries within the context of not only their distinct histories but also examine a comparison of how these histories impacted the development of diverging domestic interests, the creation of societal cleavages, and consequently the construction of political institutions to mediate and regulate internal conflict. Major policies within the countries are considered, including their involvement with NATO and the European Union. "
1064,ColgateUni,P POSC 373 - The Public Policy Process ,"P Examines how the executive and legislative branches of government interact to formulate public policies. The influence of political parties, interest groups, business organizations, and public opinion on these institutions is explored in depth. Also highlights the impact of federalism within the American political system, pointing both to intergovernmental implementation of national policies and to policy innovation at the state level. An overarching theme is the inevitable tension between oligarchy and democracy in a system where only a few actors wield direct influence over policy decisions. "
1065,ColgateUni,P POSC 374 - International Law ,"P Introduces students to public international law through an examination of the key concepts and principles that underlie the foundations of international law, as well as through the legal norms that regulate relations between states. Although states are considered the central actors in international law, the involvement of nonstate actors, intergovernmental organizations, and other participants is also examined. Substantive areas of international law, humanitarian law, and international law and the environment are also analyzed. Concludes with a discussion of the future role of international law in world politics. "
1066,ColgateUni,P POSC 377 - Political Psychology ,"P How do the forces that shape personality and motivation affect the political behavior of individuals? What role do factors such as schooling, religion, social class, mass media, race, and gender have upon individual beliefs and attitudes? How does the use of stereotypes and political symbols shape the popular understanding of politics and affect the relationship between the rulers and the ruled? By employing an individualistic perspective, this course investigates the formation of public opinion and the structure of political beliefs, values, and attitudes. "
1067,ColgateUni,P POSC 379 - The Development of the Modern State ,"P Though the state is now the standard form of political organization, this was not always the case. For centuries, political organization was dominated by city-states, feudal relations, and tribal or clan organizations. This course examines the emergence of the modern state as the predominant form of political organization. It explores various arguments for state sovereignty and examines several challenges to it as well. Finally, it considers the state of the state in today's globalized world. "
1068,ColgateUni,"P POSC 380 - Reason, Faith, and Politics ","P Examines the claims of reason and revelation as sources of ultimate truth and as guides for the political world. Readings are from the great theologians of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. "
1069,ColgateUni,P POSC 382 - American Political Thought ,P This study of the principles of American government as articulated by leading statesmen and political thinkers gives particular attention to the founding period and the Constitution and to their relationship to later periods of reform. 
1070,ColgateUni,P POSC 383 - National Security (Extended Study) ,"P The extended study in New York City explores four topics covered in POSC 353: conflict in the Middle East, conflict in the Balkans, NATO and European security, and the UN peacekeeping system. The class meets with academics and representatives of roughly a dozen countries who deal with these issues. The study includes panels of military scholars from the US Army War College and the United States Military Academy at West Point. "
1071,ColgateUni,P POSC 385 - Modernity and its Conservative Critics ,"P What is wrong with the modern world, especially with the political culture of liberal and progressive intellectual elites? Such questions are explored by studying the radical critique of modernity offered by philosophical, classical, and Christian conservatives. "
1072,ColgateUni,P POSC 386 - Enlightenment Political and Social Thought ,"P Important Enlightenment-era political treatises are explored in this course. The bourgeois sensibilities of Montesquieu, Hume, Smith, and Voltaire are compared — culminating in the tenets of classical liberalism — to the more radical and perfectionist aspirations of Rousseau, Diderot, and Condorcet. For both schools of thought, the focus is on those aspects and ideas that cast light on matters of continuing concern and that help explain the 19th–century emergence of liberalism, romanticism, and radicalism. "
1073,ColgateUni,P POSC 387 - Reason and Relativism in Social and Political Thought ,"P How can one understand human beings when they seem to have such a complicated variety of interests and motives? Not only does behavior vary dramatically across cultures and over time, but so do conceptions of truth, God, religion, morality, justice, and the good. Differences abound. The intent of this course is to look at the controversies that divide social and political theorists in their effort to understand human beings and the human condition. In the process students discover that beneath conflicting theories are recurring themes concerning subjectivity and objectivity, the nature of human beings, theories of self and other, as well as a debate over rationality, irrationality, truth, and knowledge. By better understanding these controversies students gain new insights into human nature, human knowledge, and the human condition. "
1074,ColgateUni,P POSC 388 - Constitutional Law: Civil Rights and Liberties ,"P Students examine the nature of civil rights and liberties under the Constitution; such include freedom of speech and the press, religious freedom, equal protection (with major attention to race and gender), due process, property, and privacy/autonomy (abortion, right to die, sexual orientation). Students also explore the role of the Supreme Court in the definition and protection of these rights and engage the several controversies surrounding the larger enterprise of constitutional interpretation, such as originalism v. nonoriginalism, natural law v. positivism, judicial activism v. judicial restraint, and so forth. "
1075,ColgateUni,P POSC 389 - Constitutional Law: Structures and Powers ,"P The focus of this course is what Aristotle identified as the central question of political science, the character of regime--the organization of offices and the distribution of power that is designed to achieve an understanding of justice and the human good. More specifically, students focus on the structural characteristics of the American regime, or Constitution--separation of powers, federalism, emergency powers, property rights; but students are equally concerned with the politics of interpretation itself--the complex process by which people determine what is the Constitution, how it is to be understood, and who has authority to interpret it. The responsibility for constitutional interpretation is broadly distributed, but it is also obvious that the preeminent voice for interpreting the Constitution has become the Supreme Court. Accordingly, students spend the greater portion of the course with the analysis of cases, that is, the Court's opinion of what the Constitution means. "
1076,ColgateUni,P POSC 390 - Silent Warfare: Intelligence Analysis and Statecraft ,"P Introduces students to the complex and crucial process of obtaining, analyzing, and producing intelligence in the making of American foreign policy. Subjects covered include problems with the structure of the intelligence community, covert action, psychological and bureaucratic constraints on analysts and policymakers, and how the intelligence community has responded to key threats. Students also explore ethical issues raised with intelligence gathering such as the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, the role of whistleblowers, and accountability of the intelligence community. By addressing these issues, students tackle critical problems associated with the collection, analysis, and use of intelligence to meet the American national interest. "
1077,ColgateUni,P POSC 391 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1078,ColgateUni,P POSC 410 - Our Constitutional Order: Continuity and Change (Study Group) ,"P An inquiry into the enduring principles and changing features of our constitutional order. Topics include the design of the founders (their underlying propositions about human nature and the common good, expectations for institutional performance, and hopes for the way of life fostered by this constitutional order), significant changes within this order (as marked by shifts in the underlying premises of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution and parallel realignments of the political party system), and contemporary features of institutions and political mores. The class meets as a daily seminar for the first two weeks of the program, then in weekly seminars for the following six weeks. Taught on the Washington DC study group. "
1079,ColgateUni,P POSC 412 - Readings and Research on American Government (Study Group) ,"P Combines common readings pertaining to the internship (focusing on organization theory) and individualized readings on an independent research project. For the latter, students are encouraged to select topics that further enhance and complement the experiential learning of their internships. Taught on the Washington DC study group. "
1080,ColgateUni,P POSC 414 - Seminar: Contemporary Policy Process (Study Group) ,"P An inquiry into the contemporary process by which policy is developed and enacted, with special attention to a case study of a subject currently under consideration in Washington. Previous topics have included reforms of welfare, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, and campaign finance. Questions include a) the role of interest groups, parties, political action committees, and the press; b) the impact of constitutional and contemporary structures and processes of decision making; and c) the desirability of reform of the constitutional system itself. This class meets as a daily seminar for the first two weeks after the term break, then in semi-weekly seminars for the next five weeks. Taught on the Washington DC study group. "
1081,ColgateUni,P POSC 415 - Seminar: Social Justice Politics and Policy ,"P Focuses on the issues and problems confronting certain socially and politically marginalized groups in contemporary American society. Such groups include racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, women, and gays and lesbians. Of particular concern is how well these groups have fared in the American political arena, the sources of and constraints upon their political clout, and the political system's response to their concerns and demands. Students examine both the political process as it pertains to marginalized groups and also the major public policy developments affecting these groups. More specifically, students utilize traditional political science tools and methodologies in an attempt to disentangle the dynamic interplay between American political process, public policy, and the politics of social justice. "
1082,ColgateUni,P POSC 416 - Seminar: Democratic Transitions and Consolidation ,"P What are the chances that the new democracies established around the world in the past century will survive? Most have had relatively free and honest elections; some have even had peaceful transfers of power later on; most are somewhere in the process of changing to market economies. But in many places, the quality of life has deteriorated in important respects, and democratization is stale-mated by economic crises, ethnic and religious conflicts, low levels of political participation, crime, and other problems. This seminar explores democratic transitions - the removal of repressive regimes and the establishment of new democratic institutions - and democratic consolidation - the process of ""deepening"" democracy and making it sustainable. Major topics include the role of civil society, relationships between wealth and power, ethnic conflicts and national identity, political participation and accountability, building democratic cultures, and models of democracy appropriate for different societies. "
1083,ColgateUni,P POSC 418 - Seminar: Urbanism and Civil Society: Decline and ...? ,"P In this seminar, students consider both the life cycles of American industrial cities and the rise and fall of ""urbanism""--informal, interpersonal processes of leadership, problem solving, and street-level self-government that took root as such cities developed and then eroded as they declined. Urbanism is one important variety of ""social capital"" and ""civil society,"" and helps students understand such concepts in detail. With strong urbanism in place, an unambitious local government can succeed; without it, even the best ideas backed by generous funding are likely to fail. The class focuses on the city of New Haven, Connecticut, and close reading of several classic texts. Students use the ""Sim City 4"" urban simulator to explore the processes outlined in the readings, and build and analyze simulated cities of their own. More recent readings on urban trends and styles of development round out the class's consideration of the ways in which cities once governed themselves and of the problems they face in the future. "
1084,ColgateUni,P POSC 420 - Seminar: Street-Level Bureaucracy ,"P We live in an age of bureaucratic organization. Bureaucracies defend us, educate us, collect our taxes, provide us with basic services, protect our health and safety, and occasionally kill us. Effective bureaucratic agencies are necessary for the creation and sustenance of modern, democratic government. At the same time, bureaucratic power can be a threat to democracy. Legislatures may pass laws, executives may issue orders, and courts may judge, but real governance happens when a soldier fires a gun, a teacher grades a paper, an inspector certifies an aircraft, and a police officer writes a speeding ticket. The difference between effective and dysfunctional bureaucracy at the street level--where governments and people interact--can make the difference between flourishing and failing democracy. This seminar offers an introduction to organizational theory and the politics of bureaucracy, with discussions and analysis centered on the HBO series ""The Wire."" Students learn classic theories and emerging research on human organization and bureaucratic politics by applying them to the characters and stories of the acclaimed television series. "
1085,ColgateUni,P POSC 425 - Seminar: The Challenge of Nationalism (Study Group) ,"P Examines the development of European nationalism, the challenge nationalism has posed to the international community in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the challenge world–wide nationalism continues to pose to international relations in the 21st century and beyond. "
1086,ColgateUni,P POSC 430 - Seminar: Problems and Issues in Post-Mao China ,"P This seminar examines a selected set of problems and issues in the post-Mao reform of China's political system, including the role of ideology, mechanisms of control, the personnel and economic planning systems, the decision-making process, the character and role of the Communist Party, economic development strategies, and the succession of leadership. "
1087,ColgateUni,P POSC 433 - Seminar: Topics in Globalization ,"P The seminar analyzes the political implications of economic trends and developments that affect the operation of the international system and its constituent parts: North-North, North-South, and South-South relations. "
1088,ColgateUni,"P POSC 434 - Seminar: Immigrants, Refugees, and the Politics of Borders ","P This seminar examines themes in migration, citizenship, and belonging, in the context of South Asian migration world-wide, with special emphasis on the United States. The liberalization of American immigration law in the 1960s provides the basis for the discussion of push-pull factors of migration of South Asians from various states in the subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal). Today South Asians are deemed to be a model minority, a label that at the same time extols and dehumanizes South Asians depending on their class position and their country of origin. To counter the stereotypical narratives of doctors and engineers on the one hand and cab drivers and convenience-store clerks on the other, students are encouraged to engage with various texts to recognize ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity of South Asian migrants, and to consider the challenges of acculturation and assimilation as immigrants become citizens. "
1089,ColgateUni,P POSC 436 - Seminar: Continuity and Change in International Politics ,P An analysis of contemporary conceptual approaches to international politics and of the trends and developments that are altering some traditional assumptions about the nature of the international arena. 
1090,ColgateUni,P POSC 437 - Seminar: Democratization and Prospects for Peace and Prosperity ,"P This seminar examines the politics of democratic transition and the political and economic performance of existing democracies, with a focus on the developing world. The class pays particular attention to the distinctive challenges of democratizing amidst globalization and resurgent nationalism, and analyzes the effects of democratization on international and internal conflict, economic development, equity, and political stability. Students evaluate the current debate over how the US can aid democratization. Countries studied include Russia, Mexico, Turkey, and South Korea. "
1091,ColgateUni,P POSC 441 - Seminar: Theories of State ,"P Due to the lingering legacy of colonialism, the economic effects of globalization, and the growth of transnational movements, the dominance of the state as the only form of political organization is in question today. The course will examine the revival of the theory of the state that has followed these developments and has yielded a rich and sophisticated literature. Topics may include: sovereignty, legitimation, and power. "
1092,ColgateUni,P POSC 451 - Seminar: Africa in World Politics ,"P More than 50 years after formal independence, what is the contemporary condition of African countries? What has been the impact of economic and political reforms and the changing world order? What is the influence of foreign powers on African politics and development? This seminar discusses how Africa has featured in world politics since the advent of colonialism to the present. Topics include: slave trade, European exploration of Africa, and the establishment of the colonial trade. The majority of the course, however, focuses on the post-colonial period. Students examine the phenomenon of neo-colonialism, the involvement of Western and Asian powers in Africa, and the international aid regime. The course also focuses on some of the most important conflicts that took place on the continent, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Ivory Coast, and Mali. "
1093,ColgateUni,P POSC 454 - Seminar: The Cold War and After ,"P This seminar considers the interrelationships between two great land-based nations, the US and Russia, which expanded territorially, developed economically, and emerged to strategic dominance at much the same time. It examines the competition between those two states, looks at the prospects for their cooperation, and how the end of the Cold War has created new opportunities and problems for each of them. "
1094,ColgateUni,P POSC 455 - Seminar: American Foreign Policy ,"P The course focuses on theorists, thinkers, and critics of American foreign policy. Emphasis is on the values, strategies, and doctrines that have been the basis for our foreign relations, and on the perennial themes of isolationism, interventionism, realism, and idealism. "
1095,ColgateUni,P POSC 456 - Seminar: War - Theories and Practices ,"P Theories of warfare and explanations of the outbreak of war are the focus of this course. Explanations of warfare as a general characteristic of the international system and case studies are examined, as is the evidence on the economic, political, and social consequences of war. The course deals both with general patterns and with particular 20th-century wars. "
1096,ColgateUni,P POSC 464 - Seminar: Freedom and Authority in Modern Political Philosophy ,"P What is freedom and how much freedom is good for society? What kind of justification do political theorists offer in defense of freedom? The course will examine the great debates about the nature of freedom and the conditions of a free society. Students will also discuss the relation between freedom or liberty and other competing values, such as equality, security, and virtue to understand the balance of ideals in practical political life. Readings will be selected from liberal thinkers such as Mill, Kant, Adam Smith, and Isaiah Berlin as well as from critics of classical liberalism such as Marx and Nietzsche. "
1097,ColgateUni,P POSC 466 - Seminar: Towards 1789: The Historical Development of American Constitutionalism ,"P In this seminar, the development of constitutional and political thought in the Founding era is explored through two principal foci: the constitutional crisis in the British Empire that led to the issuance of the Declaration of Independence, and the debates in the Philadelphia Convention that framed The Constitution of 1789. The seminar's reading will, therefore, emphasize the Journals of the Continental Congress and the Records of the Federal Convention of 1787. Seminar participants will come to understand, through an intimate familiarity with what was actually written or said in the two most important bodies that shaped American constitutionalism and political institutions, how the Founders themselves actually understood what they hoped to achieve. "
1098,ColgateUni,P POSC 467 - Seminar: Modern Theories of Justice ,"P Develops an appreciation of conflicting and alternative approaches to these questions: What is ""just?"" What do differences in theories reveal about contemporary understanding of justice and the possibility of rational resolution of controversies concerning the nature of rights, economic distribution, civil rights, and political obligations? "
1099,ColgateUni,P POSC 469 - Seminar: Constitutional Theory ,"P Using the Constitution of the United States as its central case, the seminar examines the theory and practice of constitutions and constitutionalism. Students consider such questions as: What is a constitution? Why have one? What does it mean to ""have"" a constitution (what are the possible relations between the text and practice)? What are the distinct forms of constitutional government and what are their advantages and disadvantages? To what extent should we consider a constitution a cause or effect of political culture? How should one interpret a constitution; to what extent are the terms of American debate—such as originalism v. nonoriginalism—found in other countries? As the form of government to which most countries aspire today (or the form they claim to be), liberal democracy seems to have pride of place, but why? Is it the right answer to the ancient question of the ""best regime""? Or perhaps the best practicable regime? Do the forces of history favor its existence, or does this depend more fundamentally on acts of statesmanship? "
1100,ColgateUni,P POSC 472 - Seminar: Post Cold War Conflict Resolution ,"P This seminar aims to better understand the phenomenon of international conflicts and wars as well as of their ending by peaceful means. The course begins with reviewing the theoretical literature explaining the causes of war and the conditions determining the forms and patterns of their management and settlement, with an emphasis on the complex shift from protracted conflict to diplomacy, stabilization of coexistence and peace in domestic, regional and international contexts. This part also includes a critical approach to theories of ripeness, international mediation and incentives; cultural gaps and social and psychological obstacles in the process of conflict settlement. Empirically, the course focuses on the case of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the American involvement in the efforts to bring about its settlement. This part assumes a regional approach which examines the ability of individual Arab and Muslim states to act as autonomously of compelling pan-Arab and pan-Islamic ideologies. "
1101,ColgateUni,P POSC 475 - Seminar: Philosophies of Law: Theory and Practice ,"P Introduces students to philosophies of law as found in theories of natural law, international law, and positive law. Students examine the question of whether there are universal norms of morality and justice that transcend the diversity of cultures and the claims of multiculturalism. Students also examine the 'higher law' background of constitutions, legal systems, social movements, and international organizations. Readings will be selected from writings of classical Greek and Roman philosophers, medieval scholastics, modern creators of international law, the American founders, and contemporary philosophers of human rights and cultural relativism. "
1102,ColgateUni,P POSC 491 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1103,ColgateUni,P POSC 499 - Honors Seminar ,P This course sequence is designed to provide the training and supervision for a select group of students to write honors theses in political science. 
1104,ColgateUni,P PSYC 109 - Contemporary Issues in Psychological Science ,P A course in specific topics offered by various staff members. Students should contact the department regarding the topics offered during any given term. This course does not fulfill the prerequisite for PSYC 
1105,ColgateUni,P PSYC 261 - Personality Psychology ,"P Explores approaches to understanding the emotional, social, and behavioral functioning of the individual person. This course traces the study of personality from classic theories based on clinical observations to contemporary theories based on empirical research. Students learn about the field's major debates and research findings, and analyze individual cases as a means of illustrating and applying each theory. The ultimate goal of the course is to have students integrate the knowledge they have gained to form a coherent understanding of the person. "
1106,ColgateUni,P PSYC 262 - Psychopathology ,"P Our understanding of mental health issues and disorders is continually expanding. This course aims to broaden students' understanding of psychopathology and current mental health disorders, to strengthen students' abilities to recognize problematic behaviors and to determine what to do in the face of them, and to encourage critical interpretation of current theories and findings in psychopathology. Students will consider multicultural issues and current empirical research on mental health disorders. "
1107,ColgateUni,P PSYC 263 - Social Psychology ,"P A survey of social psychology, the scientific study of human feeling, thinking, and behavior in social contexts. The course considers both proximate (immediate) influences on behavior, such as the immediate social situation as well as distal (more remote) influences on behavior, such as human evolution. Topics include social attitudes, judgment and decision making, persuasion, conformity, close relationships, altruism, aggression, prejudice, and intergroup conflict. The application of social psychology to education, health, and economics is also examined. "
1108,ColgateUni,P PSYC 264 - Child Psychology ,"P How do humans grow and change from the prenatal period through adolescence? What factors influence development, and how do the contexts in which children spend their time help to determine development? These are the major questions considered in this survey of the various domains of development--primarily social, emotional, and cognitive--and the settings in which development occurs--with family, with peers, in schools, for example. Students learn about theory and empirical research on human development, and they also consider how this research can be applied when working with children. "
1109,ColgateUni,P PSYC 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1110,ColgateUni,P PSYC 341 - Psychological Criminology ,"P An introduction to concepts of psychological criminology. The primary aim is to understand the factors that make a person a criminal. A number of factors are examined, including evolutionary, biological, personality, developmental, environmental, cognitive, and behavioral perspectives. Interactions between individual differences and environmental influences are also examined. Related topics, such as psychopathology and substance use, are discussed. The course includes the analysis of individual cases, and special consideration is given to prevention and treatment initiatives. "
1111,ColgateUni,P PSYC 342 - Close Relationships ,"P Relationships can be a source of great joy when they go well and great sorrow when they go wrong. Although scholars and everyday people have always been interested in understanding relationships, only in the past 30 years or so have behavioral researchers turned their attention to understanding the processes that regulate behavior in meaningful relationships with friends, family, and romantic partners. This course will explore leading theories and empirical studies in the literature on adult relationships. "
1112,ColgateUni,P PSYC 351 - Attention and Memory ,"P Attention and memory are at the core of how humans come to know and act on the world as well as forming the basis of who they are as individuals. This course is not a survey as it focuses on a few areas within attention and memory and studies these areas in depth, exploring seminal and current theories and empirical findings in human attention and memory from a cognitive perspective. Examples of problems which may be addressed include bottom-up vs. top-down attention allocation, dual-task performance, inhibition and attention control, attention and working memory, memory for skills, auto-biographical and emotional memories, memory impairments, and memory in everyday life (e.g., memory loss with age, Alzheimer's dementia, alcoholic dementia). "
1113,ColgateUni,P PSYC 352 - Origins of Human Thought ,"P Studies the origins of human thought from a variety of perspectives, including developmental, cross-cultural, and comparative. Each of these perspectives provides unique evidence concerning ""origins."" Developmental psychology examines the origins of thought within the lifespan of the individual within a particular culture; cross-cultural psychology examines the degree to which ways of thinking originate culturally; comparative psychology studies the evolutionary origins of thinking by making comparisons among species. These different approaches to studying ""origins"" are applied to a few focused topics in human cognition, such as origins of speech, concepts and categories, perception of objects, and perception of music. "
1114,ColgateUni,P PSYC 353 - Visual Perception and Cognition ,"P Focuses on the visual sensory and cognitive processes that enable humans to elaborate a mental model of the physical world. The course examines the ways humans internally represent external objects and how events in turn influence their perceptions. Readings focus on the behavioral and neurophysiological aspects of low-level vision and face recognition, visual awareness and attention, and mental imagery. "
1115,ColgateUni,P PSYC 355 - Language and Thought ,"P Language is a distinctive human ability that distances humans from the rest of the animal kingdom - including chimpanzees, with whom people share 98 percent of the same genetic inheritance. Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition. "
1116,ColgateUni,P PSYC 360 - Bonding across Boundaries: A Service Learning Experience ,"P This course explores relationship and group process among school-aged children with and without disabilities. First, students review normative and atypical social development and examine the ways in which children typically include and exclude one another in their social groups. Students then review interventions that have been used to encourage cooperation and facilitate positive relationships among children from different backgrounds. Finally, the class explores the use of music and drama to facilitate the development of social connection in children. With this background, students participate in an extensive service-learning project where they are directly responsible for the development and implementation of a 6-week drama and music workshop for local children with and without disabilities. The final weeks of the seminar are devoted to evaluating the project both empirically and qualitatively. "
1117,ColgateUni,P PSYC 361 - Psychotherapy and Behavior Change ,"P Explores the major models of psychological treatment in adults and children. Each treatment model is examined in terms of its perspective on human behavior and psychopathology, its mechanisms and techniques of therapeutic change, and its empirical evidence. Also addressed are some of the recurring controversies in the field of clinical psychology: Should clinical research and practice inform each other and, if so, how? Can the disparate treatment models and their implicit world-views be integrated? To what extent is lasting behavior change possible? "
1118,ColgateUni,P PSYC 362 - Social Bonds ,"P Explores the ontogenetic (developmental) and phylogenetic (evolutionary) roots underlying human social relationships. Social bonds are traced through the lifespan, beginning with parent-infant attachments, moving next to peer relationships, and ending with pair bonds. Students examine the interplay of social cognition, social perception, emotion, and communication in human sociability. Patterns underlying human social bonds are deciphered using research from child, social, cross-cultural, evolutionary, biological, and comparative psychology. "
1119,ColgateUni,P PSYC 363 - Developmental Psychopathology ,"P Introduces the study of psychological problems in the context of human development. Using a broad, integrative framework, the course examines childhood psychological problems from a variety of perspectives (genetic, biological, temperament, socioemotional, family, and cultural). Syndromes that often first appear in childhood and adolescence are discussed, including autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder and youth violence, depression and suicide, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. The course also examines developmental resilience, environments that place children at risk for poor outcomes, and prevention. "
1120,ColgateUni,P PSYC 364 - Human Motivation ,"P Motivation is the energy behind human actions. Can people control their own desires? How do emotions energize behavior? What satisfactions contribute to a happy life? These questions are of interest to psychologists studying human motivation. This course begins by examining basic biological motives, such as hunger and aggression, and progresses toward the study of more complex motivational phenomena such as curiosity, striving for success, and falling in love. By drawing from physiological, cognitive, social, and personality psychology, this course provides a unique opportunity to examine some of the most interesting questions in psychology from a variety of perspectives. "
1121,ColgateUni,P PSYC 365 - Cross-Cultural Human Development ,"P To what degree does culture shape and constrain the development of human ability, thought, and behavior? What features of human behavior lie beyond culture's reach? In pursuing these questions, students study how sensorimotor, perceptual, emotional, cognitive, social, and personality development proceed in diverse cultural contexts. Theories of human development and the cross-cultural methodologies used to test them are critiqued in detail. Inquiry is framed by an understanding of cultural and biological evolution and incorporates readings from developmental and cross-cultural psychological science, and from anthropology and sociology. "
1122,ColgateUni,P PSYC 366 - Psychology of Leadership ,"P An exploration of the psychological forces that give root to human dominance, hierarchy, and leadership. Guided by evolutionary, developmental, and cross-cultural perspectives, questions about social power and leadership are addressed using empirical literature: To what degree are motives for social dominance--and social docility--embedded in human nature and traceable through primate evolution? What traits and competencies distinguish leaders from followers, how early do these differences develop, and is the pattern the same for girls and boys, and for men and women, across the globe? How do some leaders and groups cultivate followers so devoted that they adhere to destructive directives? Contemporary problems in leadership provide illustrations. "
1123,ColgateUni,P PSYC 367 - Advanced Social Psychology ,"P Perhaps more than anything else, people think about other people- the people with whom they are close, those who shape conceptions of the self, motivate behavior, and produce strong emotional reactions. The field of social psychology is devoted to understanding how people feel about, think about, and interact with others. This advanced social psychology seminar offers a contemporary, in-depth exploration of different topic areas within the field of social psychology. Students investigate primary literature on some of the most vexing, provocative, and important issues of our time. "
1124,ColgateUni,P PSYC 368 - Prejudice and Racism ,"P Provides a survey of the psychology of prejudice and racism, the scientific study of human feeling, thinking, and behavior in situations involving conflict between groups. More broadly, the course examines the psychological factors that contribute to the perpetuation of inequality and discrimination. Students consider both proximate (immediate) influences on behavior, such as the immediate social situation, as well as distal (more remote) influences on behavior, such as human evolution. Both motivational approaches to understanding prejudice (e.g., explaining prejudice as a consequence of the desire for social dominance) as well as cognitive approaches (e.g., explaining prejudice as a byproduct of automatic associations people learn) are examined. "
1125,ColgateUni,P PSYC 369 - Industrial/Organizational Psychology ,"P Most adults spend the majority of their waking hours working. This is a greater investment of time and energy than is made into any other single endeavor. Thus, understanding the reasons why people work, the psychological dynamics of the workplace, and the potential benefits and costs of various work situations is of considerable practical importance. This course introduces students to the field of industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology, with an emphasis on studying the workplace as an important context for human interaction, the realization of personal goals, and the development of competencies. Students also discuss the role that I/O psychologists play in organizations. "
1126,ColgateUni,P PSYC 372 - Health Psychology ,"P Health psychologists seek to understand the relationships among psychological factors, behavior, and physical health. Topics covered in this course include the effects of stress, depression, and personality characteristics on people's susceptibility to and recovery from illness; the role of psychotherapy, social support, and meditation in helping people with chronic illnesses survive longer; and the significance of psychological factors in alternative medical treatments such as acupuncture. The course also considers in detail how the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems interact to mediate the relationship between psychological processes and physical health. "
1127,ColgateUni,"P PSYC 373 - Brain, Physiology, and Behavior ","P What is the relationship among brain, physiology, and behavior in humans and animals? What can we learn about the relationship of brain and behavior that can be useful for understanding and treating psychological and behavioral disorders in humans? This course examines a wide variety of research strategies used in the contemporary study of brain, physiology, and behavior. "
1128,ColgateUni,P PSYC 375 - Cognitive Neuroscience ,"P Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field - drawing from chemistry, biology, medicine, neuroscience, psychology and philosophy - that explores the relationship between the mind and the brain. The scope of this course is broad, focusing on brain mechanisms for such diverse processes as sensation and perception, attention, memory, emotion, language, and consciousness. Students read primary journal articles on case studies from the clinical literature of patients with localized brain damage and reports from the experimental and neuroimaging literature on the effects of invasive and noninvasive manipulations in normal subjects. Mind-brain relationships are considered in the context of cognitive theories, evolutionary comparisons, and human development. "
1129,ColgateUni,P PSYC 376 - Functional Neuroanatomy and Neural Development ,"P The first quarter of the course focuses on mechanisms of neural development including proliferation of stem cells, migration, differentiation, and synapse formation. The latter portion of the class examines the function of neuroanatomical regions and their relationship to the variety of symptoms associated with schizophrenia. As the more overt symptoms of schizophrenia do not appear until late adolescence, knowing how and when various regions of the brain develop is essential for understanding the emergence of various neurological deficits in this disease. "
1130,ColgateUni,P PSYC 377 - Psychopharmacology ,"P Discussion on the effects of drugs upon psychological processes and behavior in humans. Readings in the textbook treat the mechanisms of action (physiological and neurochemical) of various classes of drugs used in therapy or ""on the street."" Readings in professional journals illustrate the experimental study of drug effects in humans and in animals. "
1131,ColgateUni,P PSYC 381 - Behavioral Genetics ,"P Nature and nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of behavioral traits; how genes interact with environments shape the development of various behavioral traits. The course takes an interdisciplinary approach that integrates studies in genetics, neuroscience, and behavior with a comparative approach to explore human and other animal models; and the traditional behavioral genetic methodologies as well as modern molecular genetic techniques. "
1132,ColgateUni,P PSYC 384 - Fundamentals of Neurophysiology ,"P This seminar and laboratory course examines the physiology of the nervous system. Topics include ion channel structure and function, synaptic transmission, second messenger systems, neuromodulation, the neurophysiological basis of behavior in ""simple"" animals, the evolution of neural circuits, the cellular basis of learning and memory, and the cellular basis of selected human nervous system diseases. "
1133,ColgateUni,P PSYC 391 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1134,ColgateUni,P PSYC 491 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1135,ColgateUni,P RELG 101 - The World's Religions ,"P An introduction to the variety of the world's religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and the indigenous faiths of Africa and America. The course explores and compares religious beliefs, values, practices, rituals, texts, images, and stories, in their historical, cultural, and political contexts. It examines diversity and concordance within each tradition, encouraging students to reflect thoughtfully on the nature of religion and the ways it shapes communities and individuals through the world. "
1136,ColgateUni,P RELG 203 - Comparative Religious Ethics ,"P Examines the ethical dimensions of a variety of religious traditions and considers them in light of one another. As a comparative course in the study of religion it aims to give students a better sense of what role religious traditions play in cultivating forms of moral thought and behavior, and how specific traditions might begin to think about ethical issues. That is, students investigate how these traditions envision morality as such but also how they think concretely about violence, gender, poverty, and the value of human life. This comparative approach to the study of religion ultimately hopes to prompt students toward a consideration of what is, as well as what is not, ethical about these traditions. "
1137,ColgateUni,P RELG 204 - Hindu Mythology ,"P An exploration of the Hindu gods and goddesses of India through their myths. For centuries Indians have been telling stories about the gods through sacred scripture, folklore, and pilgrimage traditions, and more recently in comic books, television series, and films. Through close readings of India's mythic and epic texts communicated through diverse media, students gain an introduction to Hinduism as a dynamic, living religious tradition. Anyone attempting to understand the complexities of Indian culture, politics, and society soon encounters the gods and goddesses of the Hindu tradition. Besides introducing student to these fascinating figures and their stories, the course seeks to explore broader questions in the study of religion including the politics of gendered visions of the divine, and the effects of the medium on the transmission of religious messages. "
1138,ColgateUni,P RELG 207 - Chinese Ways of Thought ,"P Provides an introduction to the Chinese worldview, examining Chinese philosophical and religious thought from the Warring States period (453-221 BCE), Neo-Confucian thought from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and later periods. Classical Chinese thought was defined by the violence of the times and was therefore directed toward the question of how social harmony might be established and maintained. Later Confucian thought, under the influence of Buddhism, introduced additional questions about ethics and the human relationship to the cosmos. These intellectual traditions influenced generations of Chinese scholars and officials, and they also give insight into some of the unique aspects of Chinese society today. The course considers attempts by modern-day scholars (""New Confucians"") to apply Chinese thought to contemporary ethical and political problems. "
1139,ColgateUni,P RELG 209 - Jesus and Justice: Ancient and Modern Debates ,"P What has Jesus to do with justice? This course explores contemporary uses of Christian scriptures by social justice movements and their critics. Students will focus on texts written by early followers of Jesus, including those that became part of the ""New Testament,"" as well as works banned from that collection. Students will also consider the legacy of these ancient writings for current debates about the structures underlying racial, gender, LGBTQ, interfaith, class, and environmental justice movements. This introductory discussion-based course is open to all students, whether or not you identify as ""Christian."" "
1140,ColgateUni,P RELG 213 - The Bible as/and Literature ,"P What role does literary art play in the shaping of biblical narrative? How does the construction of the sacred text reflect its theological meaning? The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. "
1141,ColgateUni,P RELG 214 - Introduction to the Qur'an ,"P Designed to introduce the various ways in which the Qur'an has been received in history and continues to be received today. Students examine the theological, legal, literary, historical, mystical, and modern approaches to the Qur'an in an attempt to understand holistically various methods of exegesis and their ramifications. The class engages in the debates that have historically surrounded the Qur'an and explore methods of interpretation both classical and modern, especially those of fundamentalists, reformists, and feminists. "
1142,ColgateUni,P RELG 216 - Life of Muhammad ,"P A historical study of the life of Muhammad, from his birth in 570 CE to his death in 632 CE. The course includes (1) an in-depth introduction to the genres of hadith and sira literature, as well as the major works in those genres, the history of their compilation, and an evaluation of various authors and their works, from the perspectives of both Islamic and Western scholarship; (2) a biographical study of the life of Muhammad and his position in Muslim thought as the ideal exemplar: and (3) an examination of the lives of the women around Muhammad. "
1143,ColgateUni,P RELG 222 - Comparative Scripture ,"P Based on comparative scriptural analysis or what is now called ""Scriptural Reasoning."" The focus will be on close readings of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Qur'an with an eye to common themes and differences. Students will engage in a comparison of interpretive traditions in Judaism, Christianity and Islam to see how particular scriptural passages are understood in the religious traditions. The course will also spend time studying the ways in which scriptural reasoning has been used as a form of religious conflict resolution and peace-building in situations of conflict in the UK and Middle East. "
1144,ColgateUni,"P RELG 226 - Reason, Religion, and God ","P Examines the similarities and differences between rational and religious understandings of God. By pursuing close readings of classic texts in the field of philosophy of religion, this course considers how both philosophical and religious ideas are often developed together. Students explore various arguments about the rationality of God as responses to wider intellectual, cultural, and historical contexts in which they are made and to the specific shape and needs of a particular religious tradition (e.g., Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism). Students also explore the ""rationality"" of religious forms such as scripture, symbol, ritual, and prayer. In different semesters, select themes such as revelation, theodicy (the justification of God in the face of human suffering), providence and free will, or the theism/atheism debate are investigated. "
1145,ColgateUni,P RELG 228 - Jerusalem: City of Gods ,"P An introduction to the religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In learning about the three Abrahamic religions and their sacred spaces, students are exposed to key themes in the study of religion (scripture and interpretation, feasting and fasting, pilgrimage, sanctuary and sacred space, ritual and worship) and to the particular theme of each religion's conceptions of Jerusalem. The course foregrounds the ways that each tradition understands the city as a symbol--as a holy city, a city of God, a centre of the cosmos. As importantly, it explores how religion is lived within the city's sacred geography, investigating the religious practices and sacred sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in Jerusalem. "
1146,ColgateUni,P RELG 230 - Feasting and Fasting: Religion and Food ,"P Examines a range of religious and cultural attitudes about food. What foods are celebrated? What foods forbidden? Who can eat what and when? Through a comparative approach to food restrictions and injunctions, feasts and fasts, and food-based rituals and liturgies in Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu traditions, students investigate the role food plays in defining religious boundaries and identities. "
1147,ColgateUni,P RELG 232 - Health and Healing in Asian Religions ,"P A look at how illness, health, and healing are understood and experienced in parts of Asia where illness is not defined merely as a physiological problem, but is also seen to have important spiritual, aesthetic, social, and political causes and effects. Similarly, while biomedicine defines health as the absence of disease, in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, health is about achieving balance between different elements in the body, such as wind, water, and fire. Students will develop an appreciation for the culturally and historically patterned ways in which people come to identify and treat bodily, psychological, and social distress. For instance, students will examine spirit possession in a variety of contexts as both a form of affliction and as a mode of healing. Students will look at the role of traditional healers; how cultures vary in what they consider to be the causes of illness; who gets sick; what forms illness takes; and how the social, political, and aesthetic dimensions of health and healing affect treatment outcomes. Readings will be drawn from the fields of ethnomedicine, medical anthropology, and the anthropology of religion, to explore how illness and health are conceptualized and experienced in different cultures and across different sites of healing. "
1148,ColgateUni,P RELG 234 - Women and Religious Traditions ,"P Examines autobiographical, biographical, descriptive, and historical materials that present and analyze the lives of women in the context of various religious traditions. In a given term, students focus upon specific geographical areas, historical periods, and/or religious traditions. "
1149,ColgateUni,"P RELG 235 - Religion, War, Peace, and Reconciliation ","P This is a course on the role and function of religion toward peace and reconciliation. Students examine the scriptural, theological, and ethical teachings of various religions on justice, conflict resolution, peace, and reconciliation. Students also examine the theological writings on justice, war, and peace by Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, and Schleiermacher. Using concrete case studies of conflict and reconciliation, students explore the teachings of African religion, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam on nonviolence, peace making, relationship of peace and justice, as well as evaluate the negative and positive contributions of these religions toward conflict. Students examine religious and interreligious conflicts (Northern Ireland, India/Pakistan), religious language and symbols (Rwanda), current attempts at peace reconciliations (Bosnia, Liberia), and the role of religions and the causes of situations of conflict (the Middle East). Of particular interest is an examination of situations in which the political process was shaped and defined to a greater degree by religious leaders and their communities (South Africa). "
1150,ColgateUni,"P RELG 236 - Religion, Science, and the Environment ","P In the 17th century, religion lost its claim to the cosmos; the religious knowledge of the order of nature ceased to possess any legitimacy in the new paradigm of science that came to dominate the West. Until the 1960s, Christian thinkers considered it the great glory of Christianity that it alone among the world's religions had permitted purely secular science to develop in a civilization in which it was dominant. After several centuries of an ever-increasing eclipse of the religious significance of nature in the West and neglect of the order of nature, humans are now experiencing environmental crisis: global warming; the destruction of the ozone layer; climatic and weather pattern changes; soil erosion; death of animals, birds, and marine life; and the disappearance of some plant species. Today the very fabric of life is threatened and the future of our world hangs in the balance as nature is threatened by destruction caused by an environmental crisis that has gone unchecked for several centuries. What can be learned from religions of the world that will save humanity and nature? What is the relationship between religion, nature, science, and technology? Discussions include views from various religious traditions concerning nature, concept of the human, notions of progress and destiny, faith and science, ecological theology, ecofeminism, justice and sustainability, and spirituality. "
1151,ColgateUni,P RELG 240 - Religion and Terrorism ,"P Terrorists are often driven by extremist beliefs staunchly rooted in religious, racial, and ethical rationales for torture, violence, and genocide. The course provides a theoretical and empirical understanding, and explanation of terrorism. While tracing the history of terrorism to the ancient West, students will also identify various analytical approaches to the study of terrorism, recognize terrorist groups, and review terrorist tactics. Students will examine the ways that states counter terror, and the choices and the tradeoffs states face when confronting terrorism. Students will examine terrorist individuals and groups in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Sikhism such as the Ku Klux Klan, Timothy Mc Veigh, Republican Army in Ireland, Orthodox Rabbi Meir Kahane, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, Osama bin Laden, Boko Haram, Islamic State, and Shoko Asahara in Japan. "
1152,ColgateUni,P RELG 244 - African American Religious Experience ,"P This historical, theological, and contextual course examines the African American religious experience, including slavery in America, the struggle for freedom and identify, the development of the Black Church, Black Muslims, the Civil Rights movement, the emergence of Black and Womanist theologies, and other expressions of African American spirituality. Course readings include writings of such historical and contemporary authors as Frederick Douglass, W. E. Du B. DuBois, Martin Luther King, Jr. Malcom X, James Cone, Albert Raboteau, Jacquelyn Grant, and Lewis Baldwin. "
1153,ColgateUni,P RELG 245 - Religion in Contemporary America ,"P Religion continues to exert major influences upon the shape of American life at the beginning of the 21st century. This course studies themes and controversies in American culture for the past few decades, focusing upon the study of religious diversity and the changing religious landscape of America; issues of church and state; religion and politics; and religious ideas and values as they have shaped, and been expressed in, popular culture. Special attention is paid to the aftershocks of 9/11 on American religious dynamics. "
1154,ColgateUni,P RELG 247 - Death and Afterlife ,"P This course examines the many ways humans have attempted to anticipate, accept, deny, defeat, or transcend death. Does one have a soul and does it survive? Is immortality possible? What techniques have people used in efforts to achieve it? Is there a ""good"" way to die? The focus is on scriptures and rituals of Buddhists, Hindus, ancient Greeks, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and their legacies for contemporary America. Topics include body and soul, heaven and hell, spiritism, ghosts, reincarnation, resurrection, near-death experiences, relics, funerals, cremation, and cemeteries. "
1155,ColgateUni,"P RELG 248 - Christianity, Islam, and Political Change in Africa ","P The course explores how Christianity and Islam have caused or influenced conflict and division or greater political and social freedoms in Africa. Select countries are examined as case studies: Nigeria and Sudan for conflict and division; South Africa and Malawi for democratization of society. The course covers the spread of Christianity and Islam, colonial (British, French, and German) policy and Christian missionaries' attitude toward Islam, separation of religion and state (the debate over Islamic Law, Shar'ia), and religion and politics. Movements within Islam (Islamic brotherhoods, Madhist movement) and Christianity (liberation, black, womanist/feminist theologies) are also studied. "
1156,ColgateUni,P RELG 251 - Faith after the Holocaust ,"P The death of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis in the Second World War represents a radical challenge to faith in Judaism, in Christianity, and in humanism. The course begins with a historical overview of the Holocaust and uses accounts of Holocaust survivors to articulate the challenge of the Holocaust to faith. It then reviews philosophical and theological responses to this challenge by Jewish and Christian authors. The weak as well as the heroic human figures in the Holocaust are studied. Those Jews who survived with their humanity intact and those non-Jews who helped them are the most important witnesses to the resiliency of the human spirit which we now have. "
1157,ColgateUni,"P RELG 253 - Sex, Love, and God: Religion and Queer Studies ","P A cross-cultural and multi-disciplinary approach to the questions of how the social and cultural significance of sexuality has been shaped by religious discourse, myth, doctrine, and ritual. How have various forms of sexual expression come to be seen as normal, while others are seen as deviant? How has passionate love served as metaphor for the expression of religious experiences, such as the union of the soul with God? How have people thought to ""channel"" sexual energy to pursue spiritual projects, as in tantra and religious celibacy? Topics of study may include marriage, different- and same-sex love, virginity, celibacy, sacred prostitution, ecstasy and mysticism, and the role of transvestites, transsexuals, androgynes, and third-gender people in religious myth and ritual in contexts such as Christianity, Hinduism, Native American religion, and Islam. "
1158,ColgateUni,"P RELG 255 - Church, State, and Law in America ","P What do we mean when we talk about ""the separation of church and state""? Where does this principle originate? Are there exceptions? This course explores the relationship between religion and law in the United States. Students consider the question of what Americans mean when they speak of the separation of church and state, and explore the ways in which the U.S. Supreme Court has attempted to implement this principle within American law. Students examine a variety of influential theories of church-state separation, and read some of the most important First Amendment cases of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Ultimately, this course familiarizes students with some of the most significant voices within today's church-state debate, and provides them with the tools for an ongoing understanding of religion and law in the United States. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of American religion or American law. "
1159,ColgateUni,P RELG 265 - Global Bioethics and Religion ,"P The revolution in biotechnology has given humanity powers unimaginable a few decades ago. Bioethics within the Western cultural tradition examines moral and ethical dilemmas arising from the interface of human experience and advances in biology, medicine, and technology (human embryonic stem cell applications, cloning, genetic engineering, euthanasia, etc.). Global bioethical inquiry places moral and ethical bioethics deliberations on the international stage, with a focused exploration of diverse and competing transnational theoretical debates. The course undertakes a critical study of comparative religious ethics and global bioethics issues within Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity. "
1160,ColgateUni,P RELG 276 - Psychology of Religion ,"P Examines the ways in which religion has been understood from a variety of psychological perspectives, and inquiries into the merit of these various approaches. By surveying a wide range of psychological literature on the subject, students strive to get a better sense of the ways psychology has understood religion, humanity, and the ways in which people find meaning in the world. Ultimately students consider why human beings are religious and what psychology has to offer in answering this question. "
1161,ColgateUni,P RELG 281 - Experiencing Hinduism ,"P As one of the world's most ancient, complex, and fascinating religious traditions, the study of Hinduism provides an ideal arena for examining central questions in the study of religion. Through close readings of primary texts in translation, this course focuses on the history of Hindu traditions from their origins to the development of devotional movements in medieval and early modern India. Following a chronological order, these texts include the hymns of the ancient Vedas, the investigations into salvific reality in the Upanishads, the religious epics, devotional poems in praise of gods, religious philosophy (Yoga and Advaita Vedanta), and classical mythology. While exploring the variety of forms Hinduism has taken, the class engages broader questions in the study of religions such as the construction of religious authority, the definition of the good life, conceptions of the soul, differences between elite and non-elite styles of religiosity, and the significance of gender in conceptualizations of the divine. "
1162,ColgateUni,P RELG 283 - Experiencing Judaism ,"P As a minority culture, throughout history, Jews and Judaism have always been subject to the influence of the majority cultures in which Jews have found themselves. In response to the shocks of modernity, ruptures, scientific advancements, and philosophical ideas and challenges, Jewish thinkers, culture, and individuals formulated responses—religious and otherwise. In Experiencing Judaism, students will explore how Judaism has responded to modernity, the ""age of secularism."" To wit, students will focus on distinctively modern expressions of Judaism: the range of denominations, their historical origins, ideologies, and attitudes to Jewish law and its development, secularism, religious and secular Zionism. Students will explore these developments through primary texts within their historical contexts to better understand contemporary Judaism as it is expressed and practiced, mainly in North America and Israel, as a religion and also as a culture. "
1163,ColgateUni,P RELG 284 - Christian Traditions ,"P This historical study of the development of the central Christian beliefs examines the development of the early creeds, the emerging of ecumenical consensus, and philosophical elaborations. The course highlights African contributions and involvement in the ecumenical councils (the first 500 years) that made major decisions concerning the central elements of the Christian tradition. "
1164,ColgateUni,P RELG 285 - Buddhist Traditions ,"P Students will explore the many faces of Buddhism across time and space and seek to understand what has made Buddhism so successful. Some of the major themes running through Buddhism in various times and places include the allure of the motif of renunciation, the roles of scripture and literature in orienting devotion and community, an economy of merit wherein material goods and respect are offered to the Buddha and his community of monks and nuns in exchange for better rebirth and, ultimately, salvation, and Buddhism's confrontation with modernity, the West, and science. "
1165,ColgateUni,P RELG 286 - Catholic Traditions ,"P Central to this study is the understanding of Roman Catholicism as a living, dynamic, multi-faceted set of religious traditions. The focus may change each term. The time frame is usually from the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) to the present, although the full panoply of Catholic history, doctrine, and liturgy is under review, especially during the Catholic Reformation of the 1500s. Topics may include the Church's self-understanding, the historical context of American Catholicism, cultural pluralism within global Catholicism, and contemporary issues such as war and peace, social and economic justice, sexuality and reproduction, grassroots liberation efforts, and environmental concerns. "
1166,ColgateUni,P RELG 287 - Protestant Traditions: Revolutions and Reformations ,"P Considers the Protestant tradition in Europe and the United States. The great theological doctrines of the Reformation of 16th-century Europe are examined: salvation by grace, the authority of scripture as opposed to ecclesiastical edicts, freedom of conscience, the priesthood of all believers, and separation of church and state. The great themes articulated by Luther, Calvin, and others constituted a challenge to established authority that involved the Church, the monarchies, and the dissenters. The Protestant tradition that emerged gave rise to new conceptions of political order that profoundly impacted the ideological, social, and political foundations of the United States. Protestant vision contributed heavily to biblical metaphors shaping American self-understanding. Protestant vision and Protestant thinkers gave rise to various forms of Christian communities, such as the Society of Shakers, and provided the impetus for reform movements such as abolition of slavery, the Social Gospel, Prohibition, and the Civil Rights movement. "
1167,ColgateUni,P RELG 288 - American Indian Religions ,"P The course introduces students to the variety of American Indian traditional religions and historical religious movements. After an evaluation of the methods used in understanding Indian religions and a survey of culture areas, students look at American Indian concepts of the supernatural, mythology, ceremonialism, dreams and visions, medicine, witchcraft, shamanism, nature-relations, and conceptions of the soul. Navajo, Lakota, Skagit, Inuit, Hopi, and Ojibwa religions are described in some detail, in order to show how the individual characteristics are integrated; then the class examines the effects of Christian missions and the most important religious movements among American Indians since white contact: Handsome Lake's Religion, Ghost Dance, Peyote Religion, and others. "
1168,ColgateUni,P RELG 289 - African Religious Traditions ,"P This course is an exploration of the nature and varieties of indigenous African religions. Issues examined include cosmology; concepts of divinity; ancestors; person; meaning of sacrifice; symbols and ritual practice; the relationships among art and religion, politics, and religious institutions; and the challenge of social change, Christianity, and Islam to indigenous religions. In addition, students examine the different methods used in studying African religions. "
1169,ColgateUni,P RELG 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1170,ColgateUni,P RELG 295 - Tibetan Buddhism ,"P What accounts for the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism among certain Hollywood elite as well as a growing number of Chinese in the world today? Why did Tibet give rise to the unique institution of the reincarnating lama, best known in the West through the figure of the Dalai Lama? What goes on in Tibetan monasteries, the largest monasteries in world history? Understanding the answers to these questions requires that one examine the place and privilege of religion and Buddhism in particular in Tibetan culture. Through the close reading of the autobiography of a Tibetan saint, Buddhist myth, ethnographic descriptions, and philosophical treatises, as well as Buddhist art and other media, student will come to understand the centrality of religion to many aspects of life in Tibet, and gain a basic understanding of Buddhist philosophy, ritual/contemplative practices, pilgrimage, popular practices, monastic life, and other facets of religion and life in Tibet. "
1171,ColgateUni,P RELG 306 - Dying for God: Martyrdom and Noble Death in Judaism and Christianity ,"P Examines the intrinsically-linked discourses and practices of martyrdom and noble death from the 8th century BCE to modernity. Theorizing the social constructions of martyrdom and noble death requires focused attention to the politics of sociopolitical and religious persecution within discrete historical contexts, and a sustained analysis of those heroic men, women, and children willing to challenge, resist, and face the public or private spectacle of persecution and death with resolute determination and certitude. Close analyses of the developing mythic frameworks, rhetoric, artistic and iconographical representations, and other textual records that coalesced to render suffering redemptive - and even salvific - will receive particular scrutiny (including translations of selected primary and secondary source documents and modern scholarly reconstructions). "
1172,ColgateUni,P RELG 308 - End of the World: Apocalyptic Thought and Movements in Historical Perspective ,"P Investigates the origin and evolution of apocalyptic literature and movements from antiquity to the present, beginning with the Second Temple and early Christian periods. What existential and ideological factors give rise to convictions of the world's cataclysmic destruction, or civilization-altering fate? Why do apocalyptic movements forecast the inevitability of such life-threatening catastrophes as national or global revolution and warfare, plagues, ecological catastrophes, or profound existential threats from bioengineering or artificial intelligence menaces gone awry? Particular attention is focused on the sociohistorical factors that fuel and heighten apocalyptic fervor within discrete historical periods, inclusive of contemporary post-apocalyptic reconstructions of new world orders that inspire allegiance, hope, and notions of paradisal tranquility. "
1173,ColgateUni,P RELG 309 - Religion and Medical Practice ,"P Explores the strategic and multifaceted ways in which cultural and religious values impact physicians and other healthcare professionals relative to patients and their families, both within, and across, national and global communities. Students examine ethical conundrums inevitably arising from such conventional and contested topics in health care ethics as autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-malfeasance, and confidentiality, and assess and deconstruct emerging issues rooted in the nexus of modern scientific and technological advances and traditional understandings of the meaning of the sacred nature of the human, and the integrity of human personhood (prayer and healing, euthanasia and do-not-resuscitate decisions and euthanasia, fertilization and abortion). Students explore how to preserve human dignity which is threatened by 1) those with compassion and seeking to relieve human suffering, 2) rationalists, and 3) rights advocates without regard to the mystery of life and the sacred nature of the human. "
1174,ColgateUni,P RELG 310 - Islamic Jurisprudence ,"P Addresses Islamic jurisprudence from the historical background of Islamic law, known as Shari'ah, namely the five Sunni and Shiite Schools of Law, the concept of ""Ijtihad,"" and Islamic criminal law. Students also study the relationship between Islamic and other systems of jurisprudence. Consideration of Muslim theology offers an important context for understanding Islamic law. "
1175,ColgateUni,"P RELG 313 - The ""Word"" in the World: The Bible in Global Perspective ","P Using a form of biblical interpretation called contextual interpretation, this course explores how the Bible is read and interpreted by people around the world. Contextual interpretation takes the context or social location of the interpreter (their gender, class, race, nationality, etc.) as the starting point in the hermeneutical (interpretive) process. De-centering the predominantly male, patriarchal, and first-world orientation of more traditional biblical scholarship, the readings for this course foreground the perspectives and commitments of the interpreters as well as issues of identity, ethnicity, gender, class, location, and power. "
1176,ColgateUni,P RELG 320 - Native Peoples and Modern Law ,"P Explores the role of Native peoples in the creation and ongoing development of modern law. It begins with an investigation of the use of Native peoples as a representation of human savagery within early modern European political thought — a representation that allowed political theorists to depict law as a solution to such savagery. More recently, and more positively, it explores the important role that indigenous peoples have played in the propagation of religious free exercise rights and international human rights law. Focusing particularly on the legal negotiation of Native religious practices in the US, this course encourages students to think critically about some of the most basic tenets and mechanisms of modern secular law. "
1177,ColgateUni,P RELG 321 - Religion in Modern India ,"P What does Mahatma Gandhi's reading of the Bhagavad Gita have to do with shamanic healing practices in the Himalayas or statues of Jesus painted blue in South India? They are some examples of the diverse sets of beliefs, practices, institutions, and communities that constitute religious life in modern India and that students will encounter in this course. Rather than view religion as an unchanging, closed, and monolithic assemblage of texts and concepts, students shall focus on how religious traditions are lived, practiced, and reconfigured by individuals and communities across this region. In so doing, we will explore how religion in India continues to engage, in vital ways, changing historical realities since the decline of the Mughal empire through the advent of British colonialism into the postcolonial present. Students will read historical and ethnographic writings not only about Hinduism but also Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Sikhism, and Christianity, while becoming familiar with significant theoretical and methodological currents within the broader academic study of religion. "
1178,ColgateUni,P RELG 329 - Global Islam in the Modern World ,"P Examines the key issues with which Muslim thinkers in the modern period (defined here as the colonial and post-colonial periods) have been concerned. Muslim responses to modernity in the US, East and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Turkey represent the core focus of the course. A significant portion of the class is spent examining intellectual responses that have taken the engagement with modernity seriously. Students critically examine some Muslim responses to post-colonialism, feminist and womanist constructions, democratization of politics, pluralism, religious violence, extremism, and authoritarianism. Consists of close reading and discussion of texts, as well as exposure to multimedia resources that have played a key role in recent events, such as the Arab Spring. "
1179,ColgateUni,P RELG 331 - The Problem of Evil ,"P Why do bad things happen to good people? Why does a benevolent, all-powerful God permit evil? This course explores historical, philosophical, and religious perspectives on the etiology, manifestations, and functions of human suffering and evil within global human communities. "
1180,ColgateUni,P RELG 332 - Contemporary Religious Thought ,"P Selected historical perspectives on the connections among religion, violence, and power as a context for contemporary studies of the role of religion in society. Most of the course focuses on liberation theologies, with their emphasis on hope, empowerment, and right relationships. Voices of liberation theologians may be drawn from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, as well as marginalized people in the United States. The latter include womanist, mujerista, Latino/a, Asian-American, African-American, Jewish, homosexual, and feminist groups; most integrate personal experience with theological reflection. "
1181,ColgateUni,P RELG 335 - Religion in the Genetic Age ,"P Twenty-first century genetic technologies present humanity with unprecedented possibilities for re-engineering human life and experience: genetic tailoring to treat and eradicate diseases, the creation of designer children, cyberconsciousness and unlimited physical prowess, radical life-extension technologies, and the development of virtual human beings. Scientific tinkering with food DNA heightens interest in ""Frankenfoods,"" while genetic tinkering with animals has raised the spectre of ""Frankenbeasts."" The course foregrounds issues in the science of genetics and genethics—the social, ethical, legal, and, in this course, the notably religious implications of modern genomic and technological development - with an assessment of the promise and perils of these achievements for the future of humankind. "
1182,ColgateUni,P RELG 336 - Religion and Capitalism ,"P ""Christianity is freedom. Freedom is free enterprise; hence capitalism is Christianity in action."" Following contemporary research, students will explore the relation from the high medieval monasteries to the present, highlighting the 17th and 18th-century Christian and Jewish farmers and traders, 19th-century British industrialists, and the 21st-century consumers, financiers and traders in commodities and various financial instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, equities, derivatives, and securities, etc.). The course will investigate how worldviews and religious teachings order a lifestyle and a value system that inform and influence a particular economic activity. The course includes: what capitalism is (i.e., its elements and types, and the classical theories of capitalism); investigate the religious views, the cultural and social history that gave rise to capitalism, and the intellectual and economic innovations that turned capitalism into a system. Topics of discussions will include: capitalism and the environment, poverty and the Puritan work ethic, culture and global capitalism, capitalism and moral values, and the relation between contemporary spirituality and capitalism. "
1183,ColgateUni,"P RELG 338 - Sex, Law, and the American Culture Wars ","P Explores the American church-state debate through the lens of abortion, contraception, and same-sex marriage. These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's ""culture wars"" in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. "
1184,ColgateUni,P RELG 339 - Modern Jewish Philosophy ,"P A course on European and American Jewish thought, covering a spectrum of liberal and traditional figures. The course studies the ways in which Jewish thinkers have responded to the challenges of modern philosophy, religious pluralism, and feminism. Modern reformulations of traditional Jewish ideas and religious practices are discussed as well as contemporary theological exchanges between Jews and Christians. Readings are taken from such figures as Mendelssohn, Buber, Rosenzweig, Heschel, Fackenheim, and Plaskow. "
1185,ColgateUni,P RELG 342 - Our Secular Age ,"P Do we live in a secular age? Most of us would assert that we do, but what do we mean when we make this claim? Are we referring to the political separation of church and state, to a decline in religious beliefs and practices, or to something else? These questions have recently come to occupy a central place within the study of religion. This course explores the topic of secularism from a variety of angles, including differing notions of what is meant by the term ""secular""; an examination of the historical development of secular ideas and institutions; a comparison of different secular political projects; and a series of important critiques of secularism. This course encourages students to think critically and creatively about the relationship between ""the religious"" and ""the secular,"" and it thus enhances students' understanding of religion, secularism, and modernity more broadly. "
1186,ColgateUni,P RELG 343 - Gender and Judaism ,"P Focused on the creation and conception of gender within Judaism. Students explore the ways in which gender is built into the scriptures, structures, institutions, and ideologies of Judaism, into Jewish religious, cultural and social life. According to Genesis, from the beginning there were male and female. To what degree are these two categories essential? To what degree artificial? How do religion and tradition enforce the gender divide, and in what ways can they be used to blur the distinctions between male and female? "
1187,ColgateUni,P RELG 346 - Cognitive Science of Religion ,"P Central to much research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is the question of how the human brain and its evolved capacities inform and constrain the transmission of religious beliefs and ritual practices. The cognitive science of religion also seeks to answer why it is that certain beliefs and specific practices appear to outperform and outlive others. More generally, the CSR seeks to explain the persistence and pervasiveness of religious beliefs and practices throughout human history by drawing on the theories and methodologies of a range of disciplines, including cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, behavioral ecology, and several others, as well as disciplines more traditionally associated with the study of religion. Scholars in CSR embrace a variety of methods, including textual analysis, quantification of historical and archaeological data, statistical analysis of ethnographic data, controlled laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling. This course is a survey of the most influential of the CSR theories and methods in the field. "
1188,ColgateUni,P RELG 355 - Religion and Human Rights ,"P What is the relationship between religion and human rights? Do human rights stem from particular religious ideals, and, if so, can such rights be universalized? What happens when human rights conflict with longstanding religious beliefs and practices? This course explores the complex relationship between religion and human rights from a variety of perspectives: theological, philosophical, sociological, and legal-political. Students will examine some of today's most prominent voices on this topic, and will explore a variety of case studies involving both positive and negative interactions between religion and human rights. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of religion or human rights law. "
1189,ColgateUni,P RELG 391 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1190,ColgateUni,P RELG 411 - Senior Seminar in Religion ,"P Presents students with the opportunity to explore their own research interests and expand upon work that they have undertaken in previous religion courses.

1199,ColgateUni,P REST 205 - Yiddish Fiction in Translation ,"P As European Jews began to develop a modern culture in the middle of the 19th century, an important set of writers began using Yiddish for fiction and poetry. All these writers were at least trilingual: They chose Yiddish--always the lowest status of the languages they knew--because they loved it and because it was the language their audience could really read. This course looks at Yiddish fiction and poetry written in both Eastern Europe and the United States. Students study these texts both as singular works of art and as ways of mirroring the Jewish experience for Jewish readers. Students examine both texts and the multiple contexts (historical, cultural, religious, linguistic) that give them shape. "
1200,ColgateUni,"P REST 250 - Cyborgs of the World, Unite! Science Fiction from Russia and Beyond (PO) ","P Introduces students to a wide range of science fiction literature and film from the 20th century to the present day, with a strong emphasis on works from Russia, the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe. This region offers some of the most sophisticated works of science fiction, owing to the radical ""otherness"" of its philosophical and political traditions and the challenges it offers to dominant Western constructions of self, nature, and society. Focusing on philosophical, ethical, and environmental questions, students will discuss such topics as human-machine interfaces and ethics, life-extension and transhumanism, space travel and colonization, and the prospects and perils of the rationally-planned society. Course readings are in English. No prior experience in Russian studies required. (PO) "
1201,ColgateUni,"P REST 253 - Lust, Murder, Redemption (PR) ","P Written by an educated elite, eerily self-conscious because of czarist censorship and political repression, 19th-century Russian literature nevertheless confronts many of the crucial concerns of human existence. It often focuses upon characters who are at an existential breaking point because of ideological, spiritual, sexual, or economic pressures. Students read a combination of short stories and novels, concentrating upon canonical ""greats"" (Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov) but also sampling lesser-known writers, including neglected female authors. By examining literary depictions of such social institutions as warfare, dueling and gambling, courtship and marriage, adultery and spousal abuse, work and leisure, the course emphasizes the relationship between literary text and cultural context. Particular attention is paid to the cultural construction of gender, as well as the relationship between humans and nature. A range of theoretical and critical texts informs discussions, as do film adaptations of certain works. All works are read in translation, but a FLAC section of the course may be offered for advanced Russian language students who are interested in trying to read selections in the original Russian. (PR) "
1202,ColgateUni,P REST 258 - Reading the Russian Revolution (SO) ,"P This interdisciplinary course examines and re-examines the Russian revolution(s) through a close study of histories, cultural products, historical roots, later interpretations, and re-imaginings. Beginning with the idealists, nihilists, and terrorists determined to bring the Russian monarchy to an end in the 19th century, the course explores history, politics, and culture through a range of genres and media--from the 19th-century Russian realist novel, the political manifesto, the avant-garde film, revolutionary poetry, to the works of seminal historians who have shaped how we ""read"" the Russian revolution today. Is the revolution over, so to speak? Are we ever finished with an historical event of such monumental consequence? Course requirements include readings, film screenings, local Colgate events, and an excursion to New York City's Museum of Modern Art. (SO) "

1207,ColgateUni,P REST 308 - Authoritarian Capital Cities of Eurasia (Extended Study) (PO) ,"P Certain spatial and temporal patterns of urban growth characterize post-socialist Eurasia, due to the distinct mark that authoritarianism has left on past and present capital cities throughout this region. This course focuses on understanding authoritarianism in the past and present capital cities of Russia (St. Petersburg and Moscow) and Kazakhstan (Almaty and Astana). While remnants of the Tsarist and Soviet built environments still strongly shape urban character, new urban development and demographic change, alongside other economic and geopolitical transformations, have transformed them since 1991. Rapid and changing patterns and styles of urbanization create a multitude of perspectives and experiences within post-socialist cities as our globalizing world blurs the boundaries between urban spaces, individual lives, and abstract conceptualizations of the East, West, or even ""post-"" socialist places. This course uses a phenomenological methodology to examine post-socialist cities as sites of socio-cultural and political-economic transformations. Using this framework, students analyze their experiences in photographs, videos, and journals/blogs related to the encounters with spaces and places in post-socialist cities. "
1208,ColgateUni,P REST 314 - Dostoevsky and His World (PR) ,"P Reading Dostoevsky's novels is tiring, exhilarating, exasperating, and unsettling. One of the greatest writers of the 19th century, Dostoevsky was obsessed both with the social injustice he saw in czarist Russia and with humanity's eternal struggle between good and evil, religious faith and atheism, rationality and irrationality, sexual lust and purity. One of the characters in The Brothers Karamazov exclaims, ""God and Satan are at war and the battleground is the human soul,"" and Dostoevsky seems to have shared this conviction. In this course students read a variety of Dostoevsky's fictional works, as well as selections from his diaries and journalism in a shared quest to unravel his complexity as a man and as a writer. All works will be read in translation, but a FLAC section may be offered for advanced Russian language students with a primary emphasis on the development of advanced language skills. (PR) "

"
1223,ColgateUni,P SOCI 213 - Coming of Age in Unequal World ,"P Critically investigates how power, privilege, and oppression influence the coming of age experiences of young people from diverse backgrounds. Using sociological theories and intergroup dialogue (IGD) techniques, students grapple with the causes and consequences of inequality in early life. IGD blends theory and experiential learning to promote understanding, communication, and alliance building across differences. Culminates with a portfolio assignment that asks students to develop and co-facilitate an IGD workshop with community members. "
1224,ColgateUni,P SOCI 216 - Sociology of War ,"P In the modern world, war has usually been thought of as a clash between rival states. But, especially since WWII, much armed conflict has taken place between states and other kinds of entities — national liberation movements, criminal syndicates, warlords, terrorist groups. In an extreme case such as Somalia, states have totally disintegrated. This course asks what the consequences of this change are for our sociological understanding of the nature of warfare. It examines case studies of armed conflict in the present and recent past — Afghanistan, Kashmir, warlordism in West Africa, Northern Ireland, armed leftist movements in Western Europe during the 1970s; and in late colonial period and its aftermath, the Mau-Mau Rebellion, the Algerian war of independence, the Rhodesian War. A particular focus is on treating war as a cultural phenomenon, and to ask questions about the self-understandings of formal and informal military organizations and their consequences. "
1225,ColgateUni,P SOCI 222 - Media and Modern Society ,"P Introduction to concepts, theories, and issues related to mass media and society. Over the last 200 years tremendous changes have revolutionized the nature of mass communication in modern societies. Designed to provide a basic understanding of the nature of mass media and its social significance. It addresses the impact of different types of communication from information exchange, to news, to entertainment, to advertising. Students are introduced to a wide range of media including print, telegraphy, film, recorded sound, radio, television, and digital. This course is about analyzing how media texts are produced; why some messages enter mass media channels and others do not; how these messages affect audiences and how audiences receive them; and the general impact of mass media on contemporary society, culture, and politics. "
1226,ColgateUni,P SOCI 228 - Immigration ,"P An introduction to international migration, with a focus on post-World War II migration. Geographically, students focus on immigration to the United States from Latin America, where the bulk of post-1965 immigrants come from. Begins by introducing students to basic concepts and approaches related to migration studies. Students further examine different stages in the migration process, including the processes of migration, the adaption/incorporation of immigrants in U.S. society, and the future ""assimilation"" of their children. "
1227,ColgateUni,"P SOCI 245 - Nature, Culture, and Politics ","P The words ""nature"" and ""the environment"" conjure up visions of wild animals and open landscapes, but are people part of nature, too? This course shows how nature and human culture are intertwined, both in terms of how we shape our environment as well as how it shapes us. Through a series of case studies, students explore this relationship, focusing especially on the way that nature and culture are ""political"": inequalities, social problems and movements, and power relations all flow from the way that we interact with our environment. The course takes a global, comparative, and historical view of this process, and includes the following special topics: the rise of environmental awareness and environmental social movements; globalization and environmental values; consumption and the environment; environmental inequalities and justice; risk, technology, and environmental politics; and public policy and the environment. "
1228,ColgateUni,P SOCI 250 - Sociological Research Design and Methods ,"P Introduces students to both the dominant areas of inquiry in sociology and the methods that have been devised to investigate them.

This is a research-intensive course that requires students to conduct original empirical research related to inequality in higher education. (RI) "
1232,ColgateUni,P SOCI 305 - Urban Sociology ,"P Urban structures and problems are examined with an emphasis on the ways in which cities are embedded in a broader social and cultural milieu. The traditional concern of the impact of urban development on behavior is juxtaposed to an analysis of current fiscal problems and the potential for cities to grow, stagnate, or collapse. "
1233,ColgateUni,P SOCI 306 - Sociology of the Family ,"P The family is a personal, social, and political institution. Students critically consider how a range of historical, cultural, economic, legal and social factors shape our notions of family. Students examine recent family demographic trends and changes in gender roles and ideologies, and in doing so, investigate how and why family forms and decisions are differentiated by social class, race-ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. In addition, students examine the implications of different family formation trends for individual and child-wellbeing. Finally, students draw on sociological research and perspectives to evaluate how social policies impact families, including same-sex families, poverty and welfare, work-family balance, marriage promotion and father involvement, and sex education and contraception. "
1234,ColgateUni,P SOCI 311 - Sociology of Identity ,"P Instead of viewing identities as natural, true or inherent in individuals, this course examines the ways that identities are socially produced. The course explores classical and contemporary sociological theorizing about the question of identity, power and privilege in relation to gender, race, class, and sexual identities, and the intersections between these identity categories. This course will also examine the role that social institutions (families, schools, religion, media, workplaces, etc.) play in shaping individual identities.

These topics are explored within the historical and contemporary context of the United States and New York. The class considers theoretical perspectives that have been applied to the study of migration as well as approaches used by sociologists and geographers in empirical analyses of US immigration, immigrant populations, and ethnic relations. These analytical issues are considered in detail for immigrant and ethnic groups within New York State and the New York metropolitan community. Finally, students consider the relationships among patterns of immigration and ethnic relations, cultural change, international relations and transnational linkages, and US immigration policy reform. "
1237,ColgateUni,P SOCI 319 - Food (CB) ,"P Food is fundamental — it sustains us and is essential for our survival — but food is more than just what we eat. Food is also a commodity with complex global markets and ecological impacts; it is highly regulated through our political processes and institutions; and it forms a key part of our culture and the social rhythms of everyday life. This course explores these many dimensions of food, focusing especially on key questions about where it comes from, how it is produced, and how it is embedded in our economic, political, and cultural institutions. Students participate in a service learning internship at Common Thread Community Farm in Madison, NY. The course also involves field trips to and guest speakers from local food and farming communities. (CB) "
1238,ColgateUni,P SOCI 320 - Social Deviance ,"P Examines the nature and consequences of deviant behavior in modern society.

"
1240,ColgateUni,P SOCI 324 - Medical Sociology ,"P Introduces students to the uniqueness of sociological perspectives in understanding health care, and the social factors that influence health care. Students employ several levels of analysis: social history, social interaction, work roles, organizations, organizational relationships, and social policy. The framework for this course is that of social organization to show that the social organization of a society influences, to some degree, the type and distribution of disease, illness, and death found in that society. The social organization of a society also influences, to a significant degree, how the system of medical care responds. The values and assumptions underlying the medical definition of health are not necessarily the same as those underlying the sociological definition of health. A focus of the course is to examine race, class, and gender issues that influence the delivery of healthcare in this country. Attention is given to such topics as social epidemiology, the social demography of health, social stress, and illness behavior. Students also review the sick role, doctor-patient interaction, medical health professionals, hospitals and other health care agencies, and the healthcare delivery system in the United States and other countries. "
1241,ColgateUni,P SOCI 326 - Nations and Nationalism ,"P Nationalism is on the rise in the United Kingdom and the United States again, as well as in China, Russia, and elsewhere. But what exactly is nationalism? Why does it arise? And what are its effects on society? Students explore nationalism through case studies, both from history and in today's news. Students investigate the relationship between nationalism and other social constructions of identity, such as language, religion, ethnicity, and gender. The course also examines contemporary phenomenon undermining nationalism: transnationalism, multinationalism, and globalization. "
1242,ColgateUni,P SOCI 327 - Sociology of Sports ,"P Draws on a wide range of theoretical perspectives to understand the enduring appeal of sporting practices, as well as the various processes of conflict, control, and power in and around sport institutions. Students examine major theoretical and empirical work in the sociology of sports in order to better understand the complex relationship between sport and society. Guiding questions include the following: Why do people play sports? Do all people play the same sports in the same ways? Is sport a microcosm of society? To what extent do sports matter in our daily lives? Are sports and politics separate or interrelated? Students examine various topics and issues such as gender and representation, violence and deviancy, sexuality and homophobia, commercialization and college sport, race and inequality, and sport and the media. "
1243,ColgateUni,P SOCI 328 - Criminology ,"P Designed to introduce students to the field of criminology, the concept(s) of crime, the dilemmas modern criminologists encounter in conducting research, and the major theoretical perspectives on crime and criminal behavior.

Students explore the effects of corporate strategies and decisions on industrial structure, employment, and social welfare. "
1246,ColgateUni,P SOCI 333 - Sociology of the Life Course ,"P Takes the human life span as the primary unit of analysis. Individuals live their lives within contexts supplied by an existing social framework. It is this framework that orders transitions between the various stages of life, constructs the various roles that individuals occupy over the course of their lives, and provides the set of historical conditions, ideas, and institutions by which individuals give meaning to their existence. Human lives are characterized by both continuity and change, and each human must negotiate the path of his or her life through a web of institutional networks. These pre-existing frameworks through which individuals travel are subject to the constraints of the past but are also open to possibilities created by each new generation. Understanding this complex relationship can not only broaden our notion of what it means to be human, but take our humanity to new heights as well. "
1247,ColgateUni,P SOCI 333L - Sociology of the Life Course Field Component/Lab ,"P This community-based learning ""field"" component, offered on an irregular basis, is an add-on to SOCI 333. It entails a minimum of 20 hours in the ""field,"" conducting interviews, attending workshops, fulfilling assignments, and constructing a final project in the form of a podcast in partnership with a community-dwelling elder. "
1248,ColgateUni,P SOCI 337 - Globalization and Culture ,"P What does ""globalization"" mean, and what does it mean for societies and people facing the onslaught of global corporations? This course examines the phenomenon of globalization from a variety of theoretical perspectives, ranging from neo-liberal economics to cultural anthropology. It analyzes how each of these works defines the causes of globalization and its effects on traditional cultures, community relationships, economic wealth and justice, and political institutions.

This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed.

1334,ColgateUni,P UNST 106E - In the Footsteps of Galileo (Extended Study) ,"P An extended study course that follows a semester-long exploration of the development of modern scientific inquiry and knowledge, the conflict between science and religion, and the Galileo Affair in Saving the Appearances: Galileo, the Church, and the Scientific Endeavor and of Italian language and culture in Elementary Italian. The extended study course synthesizes a historical narrative that entangles the evolution of Catholic Church doctrine, the foundations of the epistemology of modern science, and Italian firebrand whose work left a lasting imprint on both endeavors and the language and the culture of the region he inhabited. "
1335,ColgateUni,P UNST 210 - Innovation in the Digital Age ,"P Recent technological developments have changed the way that people create ideas and goods, interact with each other, and approach everyday tasks. This course investigates the rapid pace of disruptive innovation that is grounded in principles exemplified by advances in, and uses of, digital computing and communication networks. Such principles included discretization, modularity and reusability, resource sharing, automation, peer production, network effects, and the wisdom and fallacy of crowds. Scientific underpinnings and broad societal and economic effects of these principles will be studied. Special attention will be paid to the global reach of these principles, highlighting Israel and Brazil as examples of international contexts in which to deeply explore a culture of digital innovation. Open to Class of 2019 Benton Scholars only. "

1337,ColgateUni,P UNST 313 - Darwin and the Victorian Age of Discovery ,"P Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species precipitated a scientific and philosophical revolution that continues to reverberate in contemporary society. This course is a vehicle for exploring the extent to which Darwin's theory of natural selection - the single most important, unifying scientific idea ever proposed - reflected and transformed the scientific, social, political, economic, religious, as well as literary and artistic, contexts of Britain in the Victorian age of discovery (1830s-1900). An appreciation for Victorian society reveals how Darwin's travels, career choices, scientific activities, domestic life, fragile health, and delayed publication of his evolutionary theory were shaped by the culture of the time. Examining the diverse and intense reactions to Darwin's ""dangerous idea"" shows how his theory has been extended far beyond biology to a broad range of intellectual disciplines. Seminar discussions are based on multidisciplinary assignments, student presentations, and interactions with invited speakers. These are enhanced by field trips to classic localities of geologic interest and to a natural history museum. "
1338,ColgateUni,"P UNST 324 - Technology, Science, and Culture in the History of Manchester (Study Group) ","P This Manchester study group course is an experiential look at the evidence of how technology and science changed Manchester, the first industrial city in the world, and my extension, changed the way we all live in the industrialized modern age. The study group visits an operating textile mill at Helmshore; the site of the first commercially smelted iron in the world at Ironbridge; the Leeds Liverpool Canal and its system of canal locks; the Albert Dock, at Liverpool, a primary 19th-century port for cotton and emigration; North Wales and its early 19th-century bridges and aqueducts; and a slate mine near Mt. Snowdon that provided Victorian Britain with its roof tiles. "
1339,ColgateUni,P UNST 325 - The City on Water (Venice Study Group) ,"P Focuses on the exceptional character of Venice as a city built on water. An examination of the environmental setting of the Lagoon of Venice and traces the long history of the city's development from its origins to the present day. Special attention is paid to the on-going give-and-take between the city and the sea, which has resulted in the complete transformation of the lagoon over the centuries, and the challenge of 'saving' a city at sea level from flooding in the 21st century. "
1340,ColgateUni,P UNST 326 - Workshop of the World: Britain's Industrial Revolution in Regional Perspective (Study Group) ,"P A survey of key themes in the economic and social history of Britain during the classic period of the industrial revolution (c. 1740-1850) and later economic transformation (1851-c. 1939). The aims of the course are to encourage students to reflect upon debates that historians have engaged in relation to these themes, as well as to relate these broad themes to regional perspectives (e.g., emergence of the railway networks vis-a-vis regional specialization of industrial activity, the regional impact of the loss of export markets for British goods following the First World War, etc.). At the end of the course, students are able to identify interactions between the social, economic, and political processes that shape an industrial society, how historians often deal with conflicting evidence about the scope and extent of change, and reflect upon how the study of history can inform our understanding of social and economic change. "
1341,ColgateUni,P UNST 330 - Health and Healing Practices (Wales Study Group) ,"P Humans have always been concerned with their health and have used various healing methods since ancient times. Focusing on Wales and beginning with an examination of the healing traditions of ancient Celtic people, the impact of successive conquerors and of contact with merchants on medical practices in Wales will be explored. New diseases which arose as human population increased and cities grew and industries developed will be examined. Also numerous scientific discoveries and inventions have changed healing practices. This course will examine changes in the concept of health and in the practice of medicine over time, ending with a consideration of the state of the current health care system in Wales, comparing it to the US health care system, and of future prospects for health care systems.

Students develop vocabulary and tools to speak and think critically about oppression, patriarchy, social change, and common assumptions about the world and people around us. A primary goal is to explore both the forces that feed into inequality and discrimination, and ways to resist, challenge, and overcome those forces. Students explores issues ranging from bodies, work, families, identity, politics, medicine, history, and the media, as well as the ways in which feminist movements around the world have addressed these topics. "
1345,ColgateUni,"P WMST 205 - Queer Latina Visualities: Art, Theory, and Resistance ","P An introduction to queer Latina art as a field of interdisciplinary feminist inquiry, with a focus on art by Chicana, Xicana, Indigenous, Central American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban artists. This course examines the synergetic relation between queer Latina feminist art, theory, and resistance. Students will learn how queer Latina visualities are shaped by historical, social, and political forces - like colonialism, racism, and globalization - and how queer Latina artists, in turn, act upon and shape the social world. Students investigate queer Chicana/Latina feminist texts, asking how artists challenge existing power dynamics, embody decolonial knowledge. "

How do feminist and decolonial methodologies challenge - or complement - conventional research methodologies? This course provides a framework for thinking about methods and forms of knowledge production from a feminist decolonial perspective. The course examines how feminist scholars challenge dominant theories of knowledge through a lens that recognizes multiple, interrelated axes of inequality. "
1348,ColgateUni,P WMST 302 - Women's Lives: Biography and Autobiography ,"P ""What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? The World would split open."" So wrote the poet Muriel Rukeyser. In this seminar students read autobiography and biography in order to understand the woman and her culture.

1353,ColgateUni,P WRIT 102 - Introduction to Rhetoric in the Liberal Arts Tradition ,"P Artes liberales--the liberal arts--those arts that are proper for a free citizen, according to Cicero. These arts numbered seven in the medieval curriculum, the language arts--grammar, logic, and rhetoric--constituting the first three or trivium. While the trivium has all but disappeared in today's college curriculum, increasingly scholars across the disciplines are discovering the integral role rhetoric plays in equipping citizens for effective participation in a democracy. Drawing upon the liberal arts tradition, the aim is to cultivate students' capacity for eloquence through inquiry. To foster this human impulse to inquire, students will engage in a number of inquiry projects that will ask them to reflect on their personal experiences, to analyze the forces that shaped those experiences, and to look critically at the way that social and cultural identity is formed. In conjunction with the three inquiry projects, students engage in an intense amount of work on rhetorical invention (the discovery of ideas for writing), composing a workable draft, reading and revising the draft, and rereading and editing it for fluency in grammar, punctuation, and style. The course fulfills the writing requirement. "
1354,ColgateUni,P WRIT 103 - Rhetoric and Writing ,"P Teaches the basic elements of college writing, strategies for reading and effective note-taking, the discovery and development of ideas, thesis development, organization and coherence, and editing skills. This course meets the writing requirement. "
1355,ColgateUni,P WRIT 105 - Colgate Talk ,"P Consider those who write for Colgate. A number of students, and many more professionals, hold jobs here that require speaking and writing on behalf of Colgate University. This course samples these writings as both theme and organizing principle, forming a textbook of practical rhetoric. It trains students in the analysis of texts through traditional rhetorical questions: What intellectual claims are made? What values are attributed to Colgate? What audiences are addressed? In writing their own texts about Colgate's current issues, students learn important speaking, writing, and reading strategies. In a sequence of expository essays, students develop new powers of persuasion by studying the interaction of language, point of view, and local cultural knowledge. The course meets the writing requirement. "
1356,ColgateUni,"P WRIT 110 - Academic Persuasions: An Introduction to Rhetoric, Research, and the Academic Essay ","P By taking a rhetorical approach to academic writing, this course asks students to cultivate sustained and reasoned understandings of the relations between writer, audience, subject/text, and disciplinary contexts. Students engage in analytic essays and research projects within the discipline of rhetoric, developing facility with analytic habits of mind, discursive moves typical in academic writing, and the construction of clear, complex, and logical arguments about civic discourse. The course focuses on several essential elements of college writing and research: strategies for active analytic reading and effective note taking; compiling and critical reading of research sources; the discovery and development of a strong thesis supported by persuasive evidence; the skills of summary, definition, analysis, interpretation, and synthesis; organization and coherence; revision processes; and editing skills. This course meets the writing requirement. "
1357,ColgateUni,P WRIT 203 - Argumentation ,"P Students in this course learn critical techniques for argumentation by analyzing the arguments of other writers and applying these techniques to their own writing. Both academic and popular sources are analyzed for their use of evidence, the presence of logical appeals, and their use of rhetorical devices. Special attention is paid to problems arising from more complex critical analysis, such as appropriate ways to treat conflicting sources, detecting the biases in both primary and secondary source material, and examining the biases of the student's own arguments. "
1358,ColgateUni,P WRIT 205 - Writers and Readers ,"P Focuses on one of the most important characteristics of a successful writer: the ability to, first, imagine a reader's point of view, and second, to establish an imaginary dialogue with that reader. The more the imagined reader anticipates the response of a real reader, the more power the writer can command. Students consider the following topics in depth: the split in the writer's self - creator and editor; automatic language - the clichéd medium of conscious life; the practice of self-paraphrase to get beyond the automatic; the development of the writer's potential voices; control over real readers; the imagined reader in the writer's head; and alienation and authority in college-level writing. To accomplish the goal of developing awareness and control of the relationship between writer and reader, students establish a writing community that works primarily with rough drafts in a workshop format. Principles of helpful feedback/response are taught explicitly, and learning to be a supportive but critical reader improves the students' editing skills at the same time that it models the realities of a reader's difficulties in the hands of an unskilled but developing writer. "
1359,ColgateUni,P WRIT 210 - The Rhetoric of Style ,"P In ancient Greece and Rome, teachers of rhetoric taught style (elocutio) as one of five essential canons, or rules, for effective and persuasive communication. By this rule, an effective communicator reaches an audience not just through the content of speech, but also through its artful expression. This course studies how writers' stylistic choices can profoundly influence the reception and interpretation of texts. With the goal of practicing new stylistic techniques in their own writing, students closely analyze published authors' diction, sentence structure, punctuation, and figures of speech. Readings for the course include short sample pieces from a variety of genres, written by a variety of authors, as models. Because an understanding of prescriptive English grammar is essential to experiments in style, students review the parts of speech and study the parts of sentences, principles of syntax, and punctuation conventions. This course does not meet the writing requirement. "
1360,ColgateUni,P WRIT 215 - Public Speaking ,"P Since the origins of western democracy, rhetoricians have taught the study and practice of public speaking as an essential art of public life and civic responsibility. This course fuses theory to praxis in introducing students to basic public speaking skills, including researching, organization, and writing effective oral presentations; developing skills of critical listening and audience analysis; surveying key examples of public address; and providing students the opportunity to work in different speech situations. Students develop poise and self-confidence in public speaking as they deepen their understanding of the evolving aesthetics of public discourse in the context of new media and global cultures. This course does not meet the writing requirement. "
1361,ColgateUni,P WRIT 225 - Visual Rhetorics ,"P Approaches the study of rhetoric by foregrounding the dynamic relationship of text and image. How does a writer's combination of verbal and visual elements communicate different arguments when circulated among different audiences? How do verbal/visual texts imitate, represent, and/or constitute cultural identities, norms, values, or practices? With the goal of becoming effective rhetorical critics, as well as incisive consumers and producers of visual culture, students in this course study a variety of visual texts in print and electronic form and examine these texts' complex powers of persuasion. The primary work is to develop and strengthen fluency in rhetorical discourse and visual literacy, as students work to perceive and analyze, as well as design and create, verbal-visual texts. "
1362,ColgateUni,P WRIT 231 - Ethos and the Personal Essay ,"P By exploring the boundary between private and public writing, students examine how personal reflection intersects with critical analysis to develop a disciplined expository essay. Drawing on examples from a variety of publications, it develops skills in autobiographical and biographical essay writing, journal writing, and expository writing, and then shows how these skills can enrich the expository essay without sacrificing its academic tone and structure. "
1363,ColgateUni,P WRIT 242 - Stand and Speak: Feminist Rhetorics and Social Change ,"P As an introduction to rhetoric, rhetorical history and criticism, and feminist rhetorics, this course fore-grounds the study of how 19th-century women used both pen and voice with rhetorical precision to ""stand and speak"" to issues that marked their personal lives and their times. By studying women who composed and embodied what is now understood as the early years of the first wave of U.S. feminism, students access a genealogy of women rhectors who serve as exemplars - and cautions - for later waves and for their own contemporary visions of social change. By positioning the study of rhetoric as the study of language as it constitutes social relations, power, and knowledge, students become more acutely aware of and fluent in the composition, circulation, and criticism of private and public discourses, the verbal material through which they construct social worlds. The work for this course requires close reading and active discussion of course texts through a rhetorical lens and through the category of gender. This course does not meet the writing requirement. "
1364,ColgateUni,P WRIT 250 - Kairos: The Art of Rhetoric from Ancient to Modern Times ,"P Rhetoric--the effective use of language to persuade a given audience--is as old as human speech itself. Yet attuned as they were to ""kairos,"" the opportune time of a fledgling democracy in Athens, the ancient Greeks were perhaps the first to codify rhetorical practice as an art. This is a course about time, about the art of rhetoric as a most effective medium of change at the right time. Students see this when rhetoric served as a vehicle for change in 5th-century Greece, when it equipped individuals to write and preach to effect change in the so-called dark ages, and when it gave women and former slaves the voice to change attitudes and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students survey the entire history of western rhetoric from the earliest treatises to the most recent theories. In addition to examining this history through a close reading of canonical texts, students come to know the rhetorical tradition through experience, by engaging in the very practices (e.g., medieval preaching and letter writing, and 18th-century exercises in elocution) associated with rhetoric in a particular historical period. The many rhetorical terms, concepts, principles, and practices covered in the course provide students the proper background for further study in the more specialized areas of rhetoric. "
1365,ColgateUni,P WRIT 260 - Biblical Rhetoric ,"P Examines the various ways that writers and speakers draw on the Bible for rhetorical force. Many of the works that call on the Bible for inspiration are not of a religious nature at all, raising questions about the nature of biblical style. Readings range from the Venerable Bede and Queen Elizabeth I to Bob Marley and Douglas Rushkoff, in addition to source material from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. No previous knowledge of the Bible is needed. "
1366,ColgateUni,P WRIT 270 - The Rhetoric of Comics ,"P Focuses on the ways that comics - often defined as the interplay of words and images - convey specific messages, whether instructional, narrative, persuasive, or other. Close analyses draw on principles of visual rhetoric, comics scholarship, photography, and related disciplines. Readings cover the theory, history, terminology, and genres of graphic narratives. "
1367,ColgateUni,"P WRIT 280 - Rhetorical ""Borderlands"": Introduction to Comparative Intercultural Rhetoric ","P By taking a transnational comparative perspective, this course introduces students to several key questions in comparative and intercultural rhetoric, from the most basic question of ""How does culture shape language, and how does language, in turn, shape culture?"" to more complicated questions: How do cross-border and cross-cultural engagements constrain and influence rhetorical practices and interactions? How do cultural logics, values, and assumptions hierarchically govern different geo-political spaces? In what ways have individuals and groups both conformed to and resisted discursive structures of power and privilege? And finally, in what ways can comparative and intercultural study sharpen our own critical insights about and rhetorical agency within such dominant structures? This course will address these questions and others as students work to develop and strengthen skills in critical analysis, research, and reflective practices through the lens of transnational comparative intercultural rhetoric. "
1368,ColgateUni,P WRIT 291 - Independent Study ,"P Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty. "
1369,ColgateUni,P WRIT 303 - The Rhetoric of Data Visualization & Infographics ,P Our world is increasingly visual; more and more of the information we consume and produce is presented in images. This course focuses on the visual presentation of numerical information - everything from box-andwhisker plots to flashy infographics - and specifically how such information can effectively persuade its readers. Emphasis will be on both analyzing and making visualizations; there will be no attention to data collection or analysis. Students can expect to improve their visual literacy skills; no facility with statistics or software packages is required. 
1370,ColgateUni,P WRIT 315 - Public Address ,"P The study of public address has long been considered the cornerstone of a liberal arts education - meant to prepare graduates for success in public life as citizens, community members, and professionals. Students will examine public discourse on a relevant theme while familiarizing themselves with key debates regarding the theory and criticism of public address. Following that, students will engage in their own rhetorical criticism, as well as participating in speech and dialogue exercises that draw on rhetorical principles. As students immerse themselves in the history, criticism, and performance of public address, they will also consider how rhetorical dynamics inform issues of democracy and citizenship, especially as those issues relate to differences of ethnicity, race, class, and gender. "
1371,ColgateUni,P WRIT 325 - The Narrative in New Media ,"P Students will explore the ways in which innovations in media have changed the shape of narrative and textuality. People often assume that new media is a 20th-century development, but this course will be a more historicized view; the printing press, after all, changed media more fundamentally than anything since. Starting with a foundation of media theory and narrative theory, the course will then work through the ages: printing; newspapers; color printing; radio; television; electronic fiction; fan fiction; hypertext; remix aesthetics; and videogames. "
1372,ColgateUni,P WRIT 342 - Rhetoric in Black and White: Communication and Culture in Conflict ,"P In the nearly 400-year history of social relations between Blacks and Whites in America, rhetoric has often failed. Civil war, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, and Black Power were all actions or movements that ensued largely because words fell short of persuading persons of good will to submit to reasoned arguments. Arguably a pillar of American democracy (as in the freedom to speak and to dissent), why has rhetoric been so seemingly ineffective in securing mutual respect and understanding between America's Black and White citizens? This course seeks to answer this question by closely examining the styles of communication that historically have shaped the cultural identities and public personas of the two groups. From slave speech to the languages of protest in the 1960s to verbal expression in rap music and social media today, the course considers why communication or dialogue involving race is often doomed to fail. "
1373,ColgateUni,"P WRIT 345 - Crafting Bodies: Movement, Gender, and Performance ","P The primary focus will be the body as viewed through the rhetorical lens of techné, defined by Aristotle as crafted knowledge and application. It engages with recent developments in the field of rhetoric, which has expanded to consider how persuasion and meaning making are impacted by movement, gender, and performance. To this end, the course will center on theories for studying bodies, introducing students to the dominant conversations within rhetoric and related fields. Students will apply these frameworks to texts from popular, political, and artistic performances to better understand how dominant narratives about the body constrain or enable certain types of behavior and what they signify. Through this theoretical and practical study, students will become critically aware of the intersections of bodies and their representations and how these intersections influence our capacity for engaged deliberation and social action. "
1374,ColgateUni,"P WRIT 346 - Hip Hop: Race, Sex, and the Struggle in Urban America ","P Examines the ways in which language has reinforced racial and ethnic identities and divisions in post-civil rights America. It explores the conceptual origins of race, ethnicity, and other categories of difference, particularly those produced through legal, political, socioeconomic, and humanistic discourses. Recognizing that the United States is not just a multicultural society but a multilingual one, the course investigates how urban American youth have ""talked back"" to power and seized the power to name. It focuses in particular on uses of the Hip Hop vernacular by urban Latin Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and white Americans to give voice to their reality and the urban struggle. The course also traces the causes and consequences of historical silences, as suggested by Martin Luther King's dictum: ""A riot is the language of the unheard."" "
1375,ColgateUni,P WRIT 348 - Discourses of Whiteness ,"P Claims that whiteness--white racial identity--is more about language than biology. Whiteness is a rhetorical construct that exists only in discourse, yet its concrete effects impact societies all over the globe. Drawing on texts from around the world, students trace the evolution of this construct from its inception up to the present day, examining the rhetorical strategies whereby whiteness is both hidden and revealed in a variety of genres: personal memoirs, philosophical essays, scientific investigations, political writings, legal documents, critical analyses, historical essays, and such mass media as television, film, newspapers, and magazines. By engaging in the rhetorical analysis of these texts, students examine how the discourses of whiteness continue to frame reality and mediate power relations. A required evening film series accompanying the class has students viewing, discussing, and analyzing feature films, documentary films, and television shows. "
1376,ColgateUni,P WRIT 350 - Rhetoric & Citizenship ,"P To engage students in both the analysis and production of public discourse through examining the rhetoric of citizenship. It is through the language and symbols of citizenship that individuals come to understand themselves as political subjectivities and engage with others as democratic agents. Students will examine how the meaning of citizenship is shaped and contested through public discourse. Students will analyze debates over citizenship, mainly in the context of immigration debates in the US and in other parts of the world. "
1377,ColgateUni,P WRIT 354 - Dialogue and Deliberation in Democratic Life ,"P Public communication is a vital part of democratic life. It is through the circulation and exchange of public speech that citizens shape the contours of public life, build community, and determine their core civic values. More importantly, it is through the work of democratic dialogue that citizens struggle with their inevitable differences and seek to find ways of working together despite those differences. The purpose of this class is to examine both the theory and practice of deliberative democracy, with the aim of better understanding how communities might use dialogue and deliberation to effectively engage across different perspectives. Students are asked to think critically about the possibilities and challenges of democratic dialogue. Students are also trained in facilitation techniques, with the major project for this class providing students an opportunity to facilitate an open forum on a campus-related issue. "
