In any case, Siddhartha Gautham was born and taught in the shadow of the lower Himalayas, where Buddhism emerged inthe 4th century BCE. Many specific mountains, lakes andrivers, as well as the broader geography ofthe Himalayas' most notably sacredrivers ' define the landscape ofHindu mythology, pilgrimage and ritual. The practice of yoga asa metaphysical philosophy is intimately linked to the idea of mystical Himalayan masters. The Western watershed of the Punjab, including theiponymous five rivers ' Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, RAVI and Sutlej ' is the heartland of Sikh cultural and religious identity. In addition to being a center of medieval Hindu literary learning, Kashmir and the Western Himalayas, extending through the Hindu Kush, have defined routes of exchange, communication, conversion and confrontation between Greeks, Persians, Buddhist monks, and Mongol armies. More recently ' in terms of centuries ' Tibetan Buddhism has emerged out of a history of development in Lhasa ' relocated to McLeod Ganj in the early 1960s '-that combines elements of tantra from the southeastern Brahmaputra region with transmutations of Buddhism that have taken shape in greater china. Although not inspired by the Himalayas per se, Islam inSouth Asia has been shaped by geography and the environment in specific ways, and the development ofa particular interpretationof the Koran inasmall center of learning in the town of Deobandi ' close to where the epic battle of the Bhargava Gita is said to have been waged in Kurukshetra ' implicates the geography and geopolitics of the Himalayas inthe emergence of reform oriented, Orthodox Islam.

1343,PittsburghSUPERTRIMMED,ENGR 1716 - THE ART OF MAKING: AN INTRODUCTION TO HANDS-ON SYSTEM DESIGN AND ENGINEERING ,"Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 Engineering is fundamentally a creative process in which ideas are generated and transformed intonew systems and devices in the world tomeet human needs. The termengineer shares its origins with ingenious: one definition of engineer is 'a skillful inventor.' In this course, we will explore tools and techniques for inventing, designing andprototyping systems. This course is basedon experiential learning: throughinteractive discussions, small-team exercises, maker assignments, workshops and hands-on projects, students will obtainan introduction to design thinking, 'maker culture' and systems engineering. ENGR 1716 is an upperdivision version of freshman honors ENGR 0716. It is for sophomore, junior and senior level students. We will explore user-centric design principles, low-resolution prototyping and experience prototyping, basic buildingelements for systems such as sensors, computer controllers,actuators and displays, materials and methods for prototyping, and ways to analyze and troubleshoot systems. Students will gain an introduction to 'smart systems': automatedsystems that can sense the world and automatically respond in useful ways. We will also focus on the user interface: how to createcontrol and display interfaces that enhance users' ability tooperate systems effectively and efficiently.

Thisisa lecture course about the engineering aspects of music, including the following general topics: the physics of sound and the mathematics of harmony; the means of creation through mechanical musical instruments, including the human voice, as well as electronic instruments; recording, reproduction, and enhancement though signal processing; interaction withhuman perceptual, cognitive, and motor systems. Assuming knowledge of differential and integral calculus,the course will develop (or review) a basic understanding of convolutionandFourier Analysis through examples in the engineering aspects of music. Starting with anhistorical perspective on technology, we will extrapolate a look into the future ofmusic engineering. Students will be able to describe engineeringaspectsof musical instruments, reproduction, and processing and apply the mathematical and physical basisfor sound and the theory of harmony in understanding the system of interaction between human andmachine that constitutes music. Topics covered include: convolution and FourierAnalysis; physics of sound; mathematics ofharmony;physics of mechanicalinstruments; recording andreproductionof music; electronic processing of sound; electronic synthesis of music; psychophysics of music.

1856,PittsburghSUPERTRIMMED,HIST 1157 - HISTORY OF MAPS AND SPATIAL REPRESENTATION ,"Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 It has been famously been observed that themap is not the territory. Any usefulmap must omit a great deal of information about the territory it represents,andmust generalize information about the real worldinto a small number of highly schematized categories.

Humans think visually about space, and almost every society, past and present, has developed some form of map making. However, theappearance ofmaps, the information that they include, and the purposes to which they have been put have all varied dramatically. Moreover, people often reject mapsaltogetherin favor oftravel guides, gazetteers and itineraries. Once written on paper, these now take the form of apps inour cars and on our phones. Inspite of theirdiversity, all spatial representations encode some imagination about the world.

2107,PittsburghSUPERTRIMMED,HAA 1407 - ARCHITECTURE AND ENLIGHTENMENT ,"Minimum Credits: 3 Maximum Credits: 3 This course will examine architecture, city planning, interior design, and gardening in eighteenth-century Europe as the product ofsocial, industrial, administrative, and intellectual transformations that began to radically challenge traditionalspatialconfigurations and conventional approaches to building. Incosmopolitan centers like London and Paris, an unprecedented explosion of print media, rapid risesin literacy,and the development of a public sphere outside official power structures opened debate in the arts to previously marginal figures. A range of new voices thus emerged that impacted policydecisions in the urban realm andproffered advice and guidance inthinking about aesthetics and artistic production. The rise of science held out the possibility that cities and institutions could be reshaped to improve human welfare through better hygiene and the expansion of commerce. Influential new classesdefined by wealth or specialized knowledge generated the creation of buildingtypes for a rangeof new activities. Elite domestic space inparticular reflects a wholesale transformation of social prioritiesmotivated by the novel conceptof privacy. Narrowly defined Renaissance discourses on the arts founded exclusively on the model ofancient Rome collapsed under anavalanche of datagatheredin remote sites around the Mediterranean and through contact with more far-flungcivilizations around the world. New intellectual paradigms reconfigured the relationship between individual and nature, between modern present and historical past. Consequently, the purpose of architecture mutated in the course ofthe eighteenth century as a bewilderingrange of newpossibilities for shaping building and reshapingsocial relations were explored. Well before political revolutionrocked European governments and toppled traditional hierarchies, the built environmentserved as a laboratory for experimentationand as a forum for reimagining society.

Students will become more sophisticated readers of biblical texts in the process. The sources of the HebrewBible reflect not a homogeneous monotheism, but rather a diverse set of belief systems tending toward henotheism or even polytheism. By appropriating and reinterpretingthe religious myths of their neighbors, the Israelites arrived at a character of the divine that has provenproblematic tomany contemporary theologians, particularly on issues of LGBT rights, women's rights, and theenvironment.
