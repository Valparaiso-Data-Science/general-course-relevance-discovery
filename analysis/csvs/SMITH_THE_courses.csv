0,SmithSUPERTRIMMED,CSC 390 Unsupervised Machine Learning ,This begins with a brief history of artificial intelligence AI and a roadmap of how the material in this fits into the overall field of AI During the first few weeks we cover some classical AI material such as rulebased expert systems Then we move on to a discussion of supervised vs unsupervised machine learning focusing on the latter Unsupervised learning seeks to uncover underlying structure in a dataset or system without the use of labeled data We explore unsupervised learning methods from a variety of angles including theory implementation application existing software and recent literature Throughout the we investigate a variety of datasets with an emphasis on “big data” ie natural language and biological datasets,machine learning
