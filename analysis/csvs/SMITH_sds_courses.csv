0,sds 136 communicating data,The world is growing increasingly reliant on collecting and analyzing information to help people make decisions Because of this the ability to communicate effectively about data is an important component of future job prospects across nearly all disciplines In this learn the foundations of information visualization and sharpen their skills in communicating using data Throughout the semester we explore concepts in decisionmaking human perception color theory and storytelling as they apply to datadriven communication Whether you’re an aspiring data scientist or you just want to learn new ways of presenting information this helps you build a strong foundation in how to talk to people about data E M 4
1,sds 192 data science,An introduction to data science using Python R and SQL learn how to scrape process and clean data from the web manipulate data in a variety of formats contextualize variation in data construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques visualize multidimensional data design accurate clear and appropriate data graphics create data maps and perform basic spatial analysis and query large relational databases No prerequisites but a willingness to write code is necessary Enrollment limit of 30 E M 4 Benjamin S Baumer Albert Y Kim Normally both and semesters
5,sds 201 statistical methods,Formerly MTHPSY 201 and MTHPSY 190 An overview of the statistical methods needed for undergraduate research emphasizing methods for data collection data description and statistical inference including an introduction to study design confidence intervals testing hypotheses analysis of variance and regression analysis Techniques for analyzing both quantitative and categorical data are discussed Applications are emphasized and use R for data analysis Classes meet for lecturediscussion and a required laboratory that emphasizes the analysis of real data This satisfies the basic requirement for the psychology major who have taken MTH 111 or the equivalent should take MTH 220 which also satisfies the basic requirement Normally receive for only one of the following introductory statistics courses MTH 201PSY 201 ECO 220 GOV 190 MTH 219 MTH 220 or SOC 201
6,sds 235 visual analytics,Visual analytics techniques can help people to derive insight from massive dynamic ambiguous and often conflicting data During this learn the foundations of the emerging multidisciplinary field of visual analytics and apply these techniques toward a focused research problem in a domain of personal interest may elect to take SDS 235 as a programming intensive prerequisite CSC 212 In this track learn to use R Python and HTML5JavaScript to develop custom visual analytic tools preferring a nonprogramming intensive track may elect to use existing visual analytic software such as Tableau and Plotly Prerequisite CSC 111 or permission of instructor E M 4
7,sds 236 data journalism,Data journalism is the practice of telling stories with data This will focus on journalistic practices interviewing data as a source and interpreting results in context We will discuss the importance of audience in a journalistic context and will focus on statistical ideas of variation and bias The will include handson work with data using appropriate computational tools such as R Python and data APIs In addition we will explore the use of visualization and storytelling tools such as Tableau plotly and D3 No prior experience with programming or journalism is required Prerequisites An introductory statistics including MTH 220 SDS 220 SOC 201 GOV 203 ECO 220 SOC 201 PSY 201 Enrollment limit of 20 E WI M 4
8,sds 293 machine learning,In the era of “big data” statistical models are becoming increasingly sophisticated This begins with linear regression models and introduces to a variety of techniques for learning from data as well as principled methods for assessing and comparing models Topics include biasvariance tradeoff resampling and crossvalidation linear model selection and regularization classification and regression trees bagging boosting random forests support vector machines generalized additive models principal component analysis unsupervised learning and kmeans clustering Emphasis is placed on statistical computing in a highlevel language eg R or Python
9,sds 364 research intergroup relationships,Research on intergroup relationships and an exploration of theoretical and statistical models used to study mixed interpersonal interactions Example research projects include examining the consequences of sexual objectification for both women and men empathetic accuracy in interracial interactions and gender inequality in household labor A variety of skills including but not limited to literature review research design data collection measurement evaluation advanced data analysis and scientific writing will be developed Prerequisites PSY 201 SDS 201 SDS 220 or equivalent and PSY 202
10,sds 390 statistical data sciences,Topics in statistics and data science Statistical methods for analyzing data must be chosen appropriately based on the type and structure of the data being analyzed The particular methods and types of data studied this in this vary but topics may include categorical data analysis time series analysis survival analysis structural equation modeling survey methodology Bayesian methods resampling methods spatial statistics missing data methods advanced linear models statisticalmachine learning network science relational databases web scraping and text mining This may be repeated for with different topics Prerequisites MTHSDS 290 or MTH SDS 291 or MTHSDS 292 E 4
11,sds 400,Admission by permission of the program normally for juniors and seniors 1–4
12,sds 410 statistical data sciences,This onesemester leverages students’ previous coursework to address a realworld data analysis problem collaborate in teams on projects sponsored by academia government andor industry Professional skills developed include ethics project management collaborative software development documentation and consulting Regular team meetings weekly progress reports interim and final reports and multiple presentations are required Open only to majors Prerequisites SDS 192 SDS 291 and CSC 111
