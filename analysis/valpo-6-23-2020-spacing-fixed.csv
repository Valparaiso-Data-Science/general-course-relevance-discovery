The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers two degree programs: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. These two degrees share a fundamental theoretical background that is reflected by many common courses and shared laboratory facilities. In the sophomore year students take foundation courses in analog circuits, digital circuits, and programming. Computer-aided design tools and laboratories supplement the material taught in the classroom. During their junior year, students build on their foundation by studying electronics, linear systems, and embedded microcontrollers. Students also participate in group design projects and are introduced to a variety of realistic design constraints including engineering ethics, safety, and economics. The senior year is anchored by an interdisciplinary capstone project where students begin a systematic study of the design process and apply the knowledge acquired in earlier courses. Projects require the consideration of realistic constraints and standards, formal project management, the building and testing of a prototype, and thorough documentation. The department supports a diverse set of laboratory facilities. The electronics laboratory supports work in digital and analog systems including power electronics. The digital systems laboratory is used for logic design, embedded microcontrollers and digital filtering systems. The scientific visualization laboratory serves as a research center for all engineering departments to develop applications for virtual reality to augment undergraduate education.

,Valpo,"PSJ 201 Principles of Peace and Social Justice 3 Cr "," This course focuses on social responsibility by examining the means of establishing justice, achieving peace, and resolving conflicts nonviolently. The causes, nature, and processes of conflict are reviewed. That conflicts are frequently rooted in injustice requires an understanding of the nature of social justice. These injustices may arise from economic, political, sociological, religious, and/or psychological sources. The nature and methods of nonviolent conflict resolution and reconciliation are also considered. This course is intended to introduce students to the peace and social justice minor as a foundation for studying these issues as they are treated in the other courses included in this program.

Prerequisite: Approval of the advising instructor and consent of the program coordinator. Philanthropic Leadership and Service Administrative Committee: Professor Buinicki (English, coordinator); Clinical Assistant Professor Sheets (Nursing). Objectives There are currently over one million registered non-profit organizations in the United States. While each organization may attract individuals with particular interests and expertise, these agencies also need leaders with consistent abilities in oral and written communication, critical thinking, problem solving, organization, and public advocacy within the corporate and governmental spheres. The minor in Leadership and Service further develops these core competencies while introducing students to the range of issues facing our communities. Students working in the minor will demonstrate that they have gone beyond volunteering at local organizations to thinking about how they can best continue contributing to these organizations in a long-term and professional capacity. Finally, the minor gives students seeking degrees in other fields an opportunity to develop and to pursue their passion for service in a thoughtful and rigorous fashion. "

Military Leadership - Army Valparaiso University has an enrollment agreement with the University of Notre Dame enabling Valparaiso University students to participate in their Army ROTC program. As one of the premier Army ROTC programs in the country, the mission is to educate, train, develop, and inspire participants to become officers and leaders of character for the U.S. Army and the nation. The program does this through a combination of classroom instruction, leadership labs, and experiential learning opportunities focused on developing the mind, body, and spirit of participants. These opportunities are designed specifically to enhance character and leadership ability in the students/cadets and to allow them to practice the essential components of leadership: influencing, acting, and improving. Participants become members of the Fightin' Irish Cadet Battalion and complete a planned and managed sequence of classroom courses and practical exercises intended to develop each participant into what an officer must be – a leader of character, a leader with presence, and a leader of intelligence – to enable them to reach their full potential as an individual and as an effective leader of groups. The program affords students an excellent opportunity to serve and focuses on the role of Army officers in the preservation of peace and national security, with particular emphasis placed on ethical conduct and the officer's responsibility to society to lead, develop themselves and others, and achieve success. The experience culminates ideally with participants earning commissions as Second Lieutenants in the Active Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard. As an organization committed to lifelong learning, participants may elect to pursue one of the Army's numerous opportunities for follow-on postgraduate study as well. Course numbers ending in an odd number are taught during the fall semester; course numbers ending in an even number are taught during the spring semester.
