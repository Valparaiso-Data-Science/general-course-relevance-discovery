<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Credit</head><p>The semester course is the unit of credit. This is defined as a course taken for the duration of one semester and, for purposes of evaluation, may be considered the approximate equivalent of four semester hours.</p><p>Brown follows the Federal standard that defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than: (1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for each semester, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time (i.e. Summer/Winter Sessions); or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Additionally, transfer credit must equate to the four semester hour standard except for three credit courses taken at the Rhode Island School of Design.</p><p>course. When, in the instructor's opinion, a student is abusing the privilege of voluntary attendance, the appropriate dean's office should be notified so that appropriate action may be taken.</p><p>A student is always fully responsible for any course work missed because of absences and will be assigned failing grades in final examinations missed without excuse from the dean's office.</p><p>No student organization shall make any appointment for undergraduates which conflicts with college exercises unless permission has been obtained from the dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System</head><p>At the end of each semester final grades are given in semester courses. In all courses, except those designated by the instructor as Mandatory Satisfactory/No Credit, a student may, in consultation with the advisor, elect to be graded on a basis of either Satisfactory/No Credit or A, B, C/ No Credit. A student must for every course taken indicate by the end of the fourth week of the semester which basis for grading is elected.</p><p>Any student regularly enrolled in a course, no matter whether for A, B, C/No Credit or for Satisfactory/No Credit, may request from the instructor a more detailed written evaluation of his or her work. (See Course Performance Report below.) Such supplemental evaluations are intended primarily for the information of the student and do not replace departmental evaluations.</p><p>No Credit. This grade is given when courses are not satisfactorily completed. The notation No Credit, and the description of the course in which it is given, are not entered on the official academic transcript.</p><p>1. Courses may be designated to be graded on a Mandatory Satisfactory/No Credit basis for all students enrolled on the initiative of the instructor. The designation of a course by an instructor to be graded S/NC only must be announced no later than the first day of classes and entails the responsibility for providing Course Performance Report forms to all students who request them. An asterisk shall accompany the listing on the transcript of any course that has been designated by the instructor to be graded on the basis of S/NC only, with an appropriate explanation of the symbol provided. 2. In exceptional circumstances, a course may be left incomplete (except for a regularly scheduled final examination-see paragraph 3 below), with the instructor's consent. In such cases, a grade of INC will be assigned provided that the student has filed a request for extension of time to complete the work of the course and the instructor has consented to such a request. Unless an earlier date is specified by the instructor, grades of INC must be made up as follows: for Semester I, by midsemester of Semester II; for Semester II or the for-credit 7 week Summer Session, by the first day of Fall semester. Extensions beyond semester in which the course left incomplete was taken may be granted by the instructor who will indicate this in writing to the registrar. A course not completed by the designated time will be assigned a grade of NC unless the instructor indicates that sufficient work has been completed to justify course credit by submitting, as appropriate, a grade change from INC to A, B, C, or S. A grade of NC assigned in accordance with these procedures may be changed subsequently, but no later than one calendar year after the end of the semester in which the course was taken. 3. If a student is absent from a regularly scheduled final examination for a course, the instructor should submit either an INC or an NC . If the absence from the examination is excused by the dean, the student will be permitted to take a Special Examination and the original grade will be made into an ABS temporarily. The Special Examination will be administered by the Office of the Registrar in accordance with the provisions in the Faculty Rules for such examinations, unless other arrangements are agreed to by the instructor and the student, and communicated to the registrar. If the absence from the final examination is not excused by the dean, the student will receive no credit for the course.</p><p>Year Courses: A year course is one in which both halves must be passed in order to get credit for the entire year. The grade at the end of the first semester is normally a temporary one. Neither semester may be elected independently without special permission. The final grade submitted at the end of the course covers the work of the entire year and is recorded as the final grade for both semesters. It is normally expected that the second half of a year course will be completed in the second semester of the same academic year in which the first half was taken. If the second half of the year course is not completed at the end of that academic year, the grade for the first semester will become a No Credit. If the student completes the second part of the year course during a later academic year, he or she may need to notify the Registrar's Office, in order to reactivate the first part of the course.</p><p>In registering for the second half of a year course, students must register for credit if the first half was taken for credit. Similarly, if registered for audit in the first half, the second half of the course registration must also be as an audit. Exceptions must be approved by both the academic department and the Committee on Academic Standing.</p><p>Repeating Courses: Unless a course is explicitly approved by either the College Curriculum Council or Graduate Council as being able to be repeated for credit, Once course credit has been earned with an initial passing grade A,B,C, or Satisfactory (S) or through Transfer Credit it cannot be officially registered for again for in an effort to improve one's initial grade.</p><p>Grade Requirements for Advanced Degrees: A minimum grade of either Satisfactory or C in a 1000 or 2000 level course carries credit toward all advanced degrees. Individual departments may, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council, set higher grade requirements.</p><p>(i) the ways different forms of power and privilege construct racial and identity formations in the U.S. and/or globally; the cultural, political, and intellectual responses to this racialization; (ii) the production of categories of ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, class, religion, ability, citizenship status, and geography (and their intersections); (iii) the structures, institutions, practices, and attitudes that enable, maintain, or mitigate domestic and/or global disparities in health, income, education outcomes, media representations, etc.; and/or (iv) the production of knowledge and difference in the context of discourses on race, power, and privilege A complete list of each semester's DIAP courses may be viewed in Courses@Brown by choosing "DIAP Courses: Race, Gender, Inequality" in the Curricular Programs field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Year Seminars</head><p>First-year seminars ensure close contact between first-year students and faculty members while simultaneously offering a rigorous introduction to the concepts and methods of a particular subject area or department. Seminars have few if any prerequisites and are offered in all areas of the curriculum, from anthropology to physics to literary arts. Students receive regular feedback on the work they produce for the seminars, and seminar faculty often serve as informal mentors for their students long after the class has ended. More than simply a tissue within our bodies, the human skeleton is a gateway into narratives of the past--from the evolution of our species to the biography of individual past lives. Through lecture and handson laboratory, students will learn the complete anatomy of the human skeleton, with an emphasis on the human skeleton in functional and evolutionary perspective. We'll also explore forensic and bioarchaeological approaches to the skeleton. By the course conclusion, students will be able to conduct basic skeletal analysis and will be prepared for more advanced studies of the skeleton from medical, forensic, archaeological, and evolutionary perspectives.</p></div>

Ethnography + Social Critique. This class will study classic and contemporary anthropological ethnographies -as well as studies from sociology, journalism, and history -that achieve ethnographic results, but will require discussion to determine what they "are." We will examine the methods involved in research for the books and articles and how the ethnographies were written. Ethnographies will be chosen for their importance in anthropology and other fields, and will cover a broad range of topical and geographic contexts. This class is to study ethnographies more than to make them.

It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span -the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease -has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of "geroscience" -the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases.

GREK 1090. Athenian.</p><p>In the fourth century BCE, Athenians already looked back with nostalgia on a fifth-century "Golden Age"--on the age of "Periclean Athens." The third quarter of the fourth century did nevertheless see the rise of a statesman, Lycurgus, who rivaled Pericles in reputation and influence. The "Lycurgan Era" was a time of cultural efflorescence in Athens, but also one in which the city lived increasingly under the threatening shadow of Macedon. In this course we read, in Greek, one or more texts from the Lycurgan Era, Athens' "Silver Age. This graduate level course promotes the acquisition and further refinement of the necessary translingual and transcultural skills to prepare students in the fields of Classics and Archaeology to carry out research in Greece and Cyprus. In addition, it involves training in linguistic skills that will enable students to study closely a range of texts of relevance to these disciplines. Primary emphasis will be on the development of reading, oral and aural skills using a variety of text and web based materials, of discipline specific content but also in professional and other communicative contexts of cultural currency.

Visualizing Information.</head><p>There has been an explosion of interest in how to present information in a visual way rather than as a bunch of boring numbers. Visualizations can be outstanding at conveying information, but there have also been colossal failures. We will explore the good, the bad, and the ugly and harness knowledge of visual perception to understand why some are more successful than others. Someone interested in how to create effective visual displays (posters, infographics) would benefit from this course. Some background in visual perception is recommended such as a CLPS or NEUR course about vision or familiarity with graphic design. </p></div>

Blame and Punishment.</head><p>This hybrid lecture/seminar course provides a scientific investigation of two related but distinct forms of human moral regulation: blame and punishment. Students will be exposed to the interdisciplinary literature on moral judgment and moral sanctions, drawing on psychology, cognitive science, behavioral economics, sociology, history, law, and anthropology. Students will learn about the cognitive, social, and affective differences between blame and punishment, about their distinct cultural history and institutional dynamics, and about their functional and dysfunctional uses. Students will critically examine core research articles on the topics, and they will present, discuss, and write about their responses to the work.</p><p>Fall CLPS1750 S01 17041 TTh 2:30-3:50(12) (B. Malle) CLPS 1760. The Moral Brain. How do we learn to cooperate, help others in need, and appropriately respond after being treated unfairly? The human mind strives to resolve the competing pressures of self-interest against the greater good. By drawing upon many disciplines including philosophy, social and affective neuroscience, abnormal psychology, law, and experimental economics, this course covers topics from 18th-century philosophy to modern-day neuroscience. We will examine 1) the philosophical and epistemological foundations of moral thought, 2) the influence of emotion and contextual framing on moral action, 3) the psychopathology of immoral choice, and 4) the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that guide moral decision-making. This seminar focuses on empirical research ranging across several topics in the psychology of prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and social stigma. We will read, interpret, and discuss quantitative research in social psychology (i.e., studies that contain statistics in their results) and the implications of these scholarly contributions to our knowledge of the inner workings of intergroup behavior. This includes understanding individual differences and contexts related to exhibiting prejudicial behaviors (prejudice/bias), the implications of this behavior for targets of discrimination (stigma), and contributions of each of these to how groups and group members interact with one another in society (intergroup relations).</p><p>Spr CLPS1770 S01 25360 TTh 1:00-2:20(08) (M.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLPS 1880F. Logic in Language and Thought.</head><p>The best theories of how language conveys meaning propose that word meanings have an abstract and formal logical structure. But how could young children figure this out? This course is going to look at the most abstract and logical words words as case studies: e.g. not, and, or, every, some, if… then. In each case, we will first try to understand the relationship between these word meanings and the corresponding logical operators. We will then ask, how could these words be learned? We'll draw on existing research across the cognitive sciences, and come up with next steps of our own. Basic infrastructure -e.g., electricity grids, water supply systems, roads, railroads, and the Internet -is commonly seen as a foundational requirement for and visible manifestation of modern human life. Yet inequalities in infrastructure are both causes and consequences of the profound disparities that characterize the contemporary world. This course aims at deciphering the complex interaction between infrastructure, society, politics, and human experience. Taking a comparative ethnographic approach, students will ask whether technology has produced a better world, and for whom. From economics and governance to ethics and sociality, students will explore humans' relationship to infrastructure.</p><p>Spr HMAN1974TS01 24657 M 10:00-12:30 (D. Smith) HMAN 1974U. The Cultures of Roman Imperialism. "The Cultures of Roman Imperialism" explores the cultural feedback loops between capital and provinces in the ancient Roman world, studying the literature (and some material culture) not only of expansionist Rome, but of the populations subject to Rome (including Greek, Egyptian, and Judaic). How did Rome appropriate local cultural forms to legitimize its own power? How did local cultures push back with their own appropriations? We will find new ways to study an ancient empire that has subsequently been a model not only for governance, whether enlightened or oppressive, but also for dialogue and interchange, however fraught. What is the relationship between first-person narrative and truth, and between authorship and authority? How does the form of a first-person text --a religious confession, a personal journal, a political denunciation, a collective memoir --affect the telling? Must the reader of such an account be "you" to the teller's "I", and how does the intimacy of this relationship shape the experience of reading? In this course, we test the limits of self-narration against ethical and physical limits, reading firstperson narratives that purport to be non-fictional. We will read accounts of different experiences --social and sexual transgression, suffering and perpetrating violence, slavery --and explore both the possibilities and duplicities of writing as "I". This course addresses the relationship among language, war and the arts from the mid-twentieth century on. Even as armies engage in combat around the globe, the term "war" legitimates a much broader spectrum of situations, lending them the structure of organized hostility and the moral opposition of right to wrong. From the "Cold War" to the "War on Terror", to Argentina's "Dirty War" and Cuba's "War on Imperialism", literature, cinema, visual arts and community-based projects have responded to real and rhetorical declarations of "war." Drawing from U.S. and Latin American contexts, we will explore a range of responses and challenges. An introduction to computing and programming that focuses on understanding and manipulating data. Students will learn to write programs to process both tabular and structured data, to assess programs both experimentally and theoretically, to apply basic data science concepts, and to discuss big ideas around the communication and use of digital information. Designed for both concentrators and non-concentrators, this is the first in an eventual three-course introductory sequence leading into advanced CS courses. Programming assignments will be smaller scale than in CSCI 0150/0170, thus allowing students time to practice programming and discuss computational ideas in a broader context. CSCI 0170. Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction. CSCI0170/0180 is an introductory sequence that helps students begin to develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to solve computational problems elegantly, correctly, efficiently, and with ease. The sequence is unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programming paradigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170; the second through Java in CSCI0180. The sequence requires no previous programming experience. Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education.</p><p>Although students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming! All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures.</p><p>Fall CSCI0170 S01 16582 MWF 10:00-10:50 <ref type="formula">(14</ref> </p></div>

Prerequisite: KREA 0400 or equivalent or permission of instructor. This course covers the history of modern (20th century) economics and economic thinking from the marginal revolution through the first half of the 20th century. The aim will be to develop an understanding of the origin and evolution of central concepts in economic theory, including subjective utility, marginal analysis, competitive markets, examine methodological disputes over positivism and formalism, and the development of general competitive equilibrium. We will consider the emergence of certain subfields in modern economics, and end with a discussion of the relevance of these ideas for economics in the 21st century. This course equips students with theoretical and empirical tools to analyze environmental issues from the perspective of economics. First, we review when and why the markets fail, competing policy solutions (e.g., capand-trade), and cost-benefit analysis. Second, we survey methods to quantify the benefits of environmental regulations, including revealed and stated preference methods, a primer on climate-economy modeling, and a real-world application in a class research project. Third, we study the costs of environmental regulations. We conclude with advanced policy considerations (e.g., trans-boundary pollutants), private market solutions/ corporate social responsibility, and select special topics (e.g., resources and economic development). We examine racial inequality in the United States, focusing on economic, political, social and historical aspects.

It discusses the measurement of poverty and inequality; growth; population change; health and education; resource allocation and gender; land and agriculture; and credit, insurance, and savings. The course provides a theoretical framework for the economic analysis of specific problems associated with developing economies, and introduces empirical methods used to evaluate policies aimed at solving these problems. By the end of the class, students will be able to discuss some of the "hot topics" in development, like microfinance, family planning, or the problem of "missing women" in South-East Asia. This class will cover the basics of applied research in economics. We will cover how we use economic theory to formulate a hypothesis to test and how we use data to test our hypothesis. As part of the coursework, students will be exposed to topics across multiple fields of applied economic research (eg, health, labor, political economy, urban economics, development, etc) that can be explored in greater detail in more advanced classes. Students will read and discuss papers published in professional journals and perform data analysis. The spread of information technology has lead to the generation of vast amounts of data on human behavior. This course explores ways to use this data to better understand the societies in which we live. The course weaves together methods from machine learning (OLS, LASSO, trees) and economics (reduced form causal inference, economic theory, structural modeling) to answer real world questions in a sequence of projects. We will use these projects as a backdrop to weigh the importance of causality, precision, and computational efficiency. Knowledge of basic econometrics and programming is assumed.

For different choice domains, we start by analyzing the behavior implied by benchmark models used by economists (e.g. rational choice, expected utility, exponential discounting). Experimental and empirical evidence is then used to highlight some limitations of these models, and to motivate new models that have been introduced to account for these violations. We will cover, for instance, models of limited attention, non-expected utility, and hyperbolic discounting. </p></div>

From the outset of "The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies," Marcel Mauss underscores the value of the gift in economic terms that the notion of giving, taken apart, would have to exceed. Any given phenomenon that happens to appear, for example, no longer belongs to a scheme of reciprocity and surpasses what anyone can grasp: otherwise, there could be no different takes on it. Throughout this course, literary, anthropological, and theoretical texts will be examined to address the problems that present themselves when giving is at stake.

Re-writing Realities: A Non-Fiction Creative Writing Workshop.</head><p>This course focuses on the basic elements of creative non-fiction writing in Spanish. By writing our own pieces, we will discover how artistic uses of Spanish language can help us view our 'reality' under a new light. We will be reading texts from the Spanish language tradition of non-fiction produced through hybrid texts-that is, narrative and essayistic pieces that are not investigative journalism. Our readings will range from influential writers such as Rubén Darío, Jorge Luis Borges, and Alfonso Reyes to contemporary authors including Javier Cercas, Juan Villoro, and Eduardo Halfon.  .</p><p>The end of the Spanish Civil War inaugurated one of the longest dictatorships of the twentieth century. This course will examine the literature and popular culture produced in the peninsula during that period--both the "official" culture allowed and sponsored by the Franco regime, and the voices of resistance that attempted to present alternative political views against a background of repression and censorship. Jorge Luis Borges devoted several essays during his youth to developing his philosophical understanding of concepts like "personality," "memory," "reality," "narrative" and "style." At some point later in his literary career, he attempted to erase the memory of those years from his public existence, to the extent that most of the books published during the 1920s were never reprinted during Borges' lifetime. Nevertheless, it was in those years that he developed the entire philosophical grounding of his future literary work. We will work to decipher Borges' philosophy through the reading and interpretation of his essays, narratives and poems, including several key texts from his first three suppressed prose volumes (Inquisiciones, El tamaño de mi esperanza, and El idioma de los argentinos). In English, with some Spanish readings.

Alongside novels and a play dealing with dictatorship and its aftermath, we will read theoretical texts that offer varied approaches to history, literature, aesthetics, and politics. Throughout, we will examine the complex relationship between authority, authoritarianism, and authorship in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, asking how dictatorship is (not) narrated and how we can read narratives emerging from contexts of repression and state terror.

Lectures and readings will address the collapse of the Tokugawa regime, the Meiji Restoration, the construction of empire, and the emergence of new forms of cultural and political expression. Students will also learn how ideas about gender, race, and tradition were understood and made use of in Imperial Japan. Open to all students. HIST 1571. The Intellectual History of Black Women. This course will introduce students to the intellectual productions and theoretical traditions of African American women. Focused on the canonical texts of African American women, this class gestures toward diaspora as well. Moving chronologically from the history of slavery to the present will require that we simultaneously confront the question of what counts as "intellectual" history. Thus even as we will read the written words of black feminists across time, we will also call into question what Barbara Christian calls "the race for theory," turning also to resistance practices, material culture, and bodily performance as sites of black feminist theorization.</p><p>Fall HIST1571 S01 15864 MWF 10:00-10:50 <ref type="formula">(14)</ref>  This seminar examines the major themes and events in the history of the Middle East in the 20th century through a close reading of literary texts and, in some cases, films.

HIST 2930. Colloquium. "The Theory and Practice of History" encourages critical thinking about some of the different ways in which historians approach thinking and writing about the past. In particular, we will explore some of the major theoretical stances that have influenced the discipline of history. Our focus throughout will be the interplay between theory and practice. By examining how historians have grappled with questions posed by influential thinkers (often working within other fields of knowledge), we will chart the trajectory of the discipline and assess its working methods.

We will explore a variety of public monuments to reveal how they codify essential aspects of Roman culture. Topics include the architecture of entertainment spaces such as theaters, amphitheaters, and circuses, as well as the social functions of spectacles such as gladiatorial games and triumphal processions. We will look at expressions of imperial propaganda in monuments such as tombs and honorific arches. The class also considers how these ideas entered the private realm in the form of domestic wall paintings, mosaics, and sculpture gardens. A This course examines the impact of gender as a category of analysis, focusing upon its varied repercussions on the study of history, with Italian history serving as one field of focus. Participants interested in other geographical, chronological, and disciplinary areas will have ample time to purse their interests. The study of gender has profoundly shaped the practice of history in the last half century, and the course outlines its impact and its transformations. The course places in conversation diverse but overlapping historical developments: the impact of the study of gender on history; influences from beyond history that have shared or shaped historians' approach to gender and sexuality; the particular inflections of the study of gender in the case of Italy (1400-1800); the impact of the turn to the study of sexuality and queer studies. The course explores and critiques the limits of our gender constructs (theoretical, methodological, and modern) for explaining the culture of people in the premodern world and beyond the western hemisphere, fields of scholarship where the universality of contemporary notions of gender have been challenged.

Race, Religion, and the Secular.</p><p>The most "secular" presidential election in American history saw the language of Christian America apparently yield to a rhetoric of racism, misogyny, and white identity. But racialization and secularization are very much intertwined. In an effort to understand how "whiteness" is tied to the history of Christianity and secular, liberal democracies, this class will trace the figure of the "Jew" in the Christian imagination, and examine the racial and religious othering of Judaism as an entry point for reflecting upon contemporary American social and political struggles surrounding religious and racial identities. An immersive approach using authentic communication inside and outside of the classroom will be used to develop introductory communicative skills in American Sign Language.

Queer Theories.</head><p>This course will engage with possibilities and problems of queer theorizing, from the emergence of queer theory, through its (precarious) institutionalization, to its multiplied interventions. Rather than understanding queer theory as a unified approach, we will consider a range of queer theoretical work as well as challenges within queer analysis itself. Issues to be explored include formations of gender and sexuality, race and nation, epistemology and ethics, politics and communities, subjectivities and socialities, identifications and disidentifications, bodies and pleasures, publics and privates, and the temporalities and locations of our world. Preference given to graduate students; all others seek instructor permission. </p></div>

Media Regionalism: Between Empires and Territories.</head><p>This graduate seminar sets out to rethink media theory and history from the perspective of regionalism, and to confront the dominant model of a distributive, deterritorialized media unfolding with a regional approach that is tethered to particular territories, milieus, geo-environments, and ecological surroundings. What happens when the presumed geography and topology of media formation, as a distributed global network, is called into question? What might the regional models developed within area studies and postcolonial theories have to contribute to media studies?</p><p>The purpose is to explore multitudes of theories and methods that help us reconsider "where" and "what" media is. </p></div>

The student today may encounter concepts from semiotics, linguistics, cultural studies, literary theory, political economy, sociology, cognitive psychology, media studies, sound studies, science and technology studies, organizational studies, and material culture studies, and other disciplines as well. We will examine some of the key concepts of these fields and consider their possible uses in the study of the performing arts. From 'affordances' to the 'type/token distinction,' from 'actor-network theory' to the 'third-person effect,' we will learn to apply (and criticize) concepts presupposed by much current socio-cultural theorizing. A production seminar designed for students to create a single, large project in Multimedia, Video, Performance and/or Electronic Music.

We will have two related ends: historical and critical. On the one hand, we will get clear so far as we are able what it is that these thinkers thought; on the other, it is important to evaluate their arguments.

Topics include: naive realist versus representational theories of sensory experience, the possibility that sensory experience is massively illusory (so that we already occupy a kind of "virtual reality"), the role of the brain in shaping sensory experience, and the alleged foundational role of sensory experience in knowledge. The focus will be on vision but we will also discuss other sense-modalities. Suggested prerequisite: at least one course in philosophy (2 or more preferred). This course provides an introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. We will discuss the nature of mathematical objects: Are they mental constructions, do they inhabit some Platonic realm, or are there no mathematical objects at all? We will also discuss the status of our knowledge of mathematics: How is that we are justified in reasoning as we do in mathematics? The first part of the course will be devoted to discussing the history of the philosophy of mathematics. The second part of the course will focus on contemporary debates in the philosophy of mathematics.</p><p>Fall <ref type="formula">PHIL1300</ref>  This course provides a rigorous introduction to the metatheory of classical first-order predicate logic.

Specific topics will include, besides some classic analyses of the concept, the relevance of mortality to meaningfulness, the role of love in a meaningful life, and the relation between meaningfulness and a number of other goods, such as happiness, well-being, and morality. We will read works from philosophers including Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick, Harry Frankfurt, Susan Wolf, Jay Wallace, and Kieran Setyia, among others. Physics has had a dramatic impact on our conception of the universe, our ideas concerning the nature of knowledge, and our view of ourselves. Philosophy, sometimes inspired by developments in physics, considers the impact of such developments on our lives. In this seminar, students will explore how classical and modern physical theory have affected our view of the cosmos, of ourselves as human beings, as well as our view of the relation of mathematical or physical structures to 'truth' or 'reality.' Through a study of physics as well as selected philosophical readings, we will consider how we can know anything, from seemingly simple facts to whether a machine is conscious.

He was and remained Jewish. We must therefore reexamine his writings within his Jewish context, not apart from it. We also need to see how the earliest "Christians" talked about Paul within the context of an emerging "Christianity." In this course, we will first dive into both the authentic and spurious letters of Paul in the New Testament. We will then turn to the figure of Paul in later Christian texts, both canonical and non-canonical.</p><p>Fall RELS1330A S01 17134 TTh 2:30-3:50(12) (J. Han)</p></div>

In a multicultural and globalized world, such conflicts often provoke contestation over the very possibility of universal definitions of either "religion" or "law," let alone their proper relationship. Our interdisciplinary inquiries on these questions will include concrete legal disputes in domestic and international courts; theoretical debates over the construction of "religion" in fields such as anthropology, religious studies, and philosophy; and historiographical controversies about the relationship between "secularization" and sovereignty, particularly in light of the legacy of colonialism.</p><p>Fall RELS1380C S01 16354 TTh 10:30-11:50(13) (N.

Tracking the insights and blindnesses of Adorno, Horkheimer, Habermas and Benjamin (among others), we will consider how technological developments in the 'culture-industry', late-modern capitalist forms of socialization, and post-Enlightenment philosophical claims regarding religion and theology bear on the ways we talk about autonomy, power and authority. Covering topics such as negative theology, the non-secular critique of religion, communicative praxis, and divine violence, our inquiry will emphasize the social features of theology, the aesthetic content of belief, and the communal aspects of religion. They often come to symbolize the perennial clash between the religious and the secular, the sacred and the political, tradition and modernity. We will discuss a diverse array of specific disputes and ask whether one may even speak of "sacred sites" cross-culturally. Can legal frameworks embrace different notions of the sacred? We will also examine the historical contexts that provoke such disputes, particularly the aftermath of colonialism.</p><p>Spr RELS1610 S01 25010 W 3:00-5:30(10) (N. Berman) RELS 1612.

We will study human mortality from a variety of perspectives, highlighting the powerful implications of death for the living.

As a practice of the mind, body, and spirit, yoga has taken many forms-meditation, chanting, breath control, postures-in order to achieve a range of goals: liberation from rebirth, supernatural powers, strength, pleasure, peace, wellness. As its reputation and commodification have increased, yoga has attracted deep interest, debate, and even controversy. In this course we will study yoga from its earliest texts to its status in the modern world, addressing its historical, religious, social, and political ramifications in many different contexts. the Russian literary angels are in many respects related to their Western counterparts, the apocalyptic character of Russian spiritual culture makes them in many respects unique. Examining these images, the course addresses the important questions concerning the human condition in general. Angels as one critic said, "represent something that was ours and that we have the potential to become again"; their essence is otherness. Consequently, their literary representations explore the possibilities of human existence as well as its central paradigms like, love, rebirth, mortality, or 'fallenness.' The course will analyze the images of angels and fallen angels (devils) in the works of the nineteenth and the twentieth-century Russian prose, visual art, and film -from romanticism to 'postmodernism' -in the context of the world literature and culture. Authors to be studied: Byron, Lermontov, Balzac, Dostoevskii, Sologub, Bulgakov, Nabokov, Erofeev. We will also discuss films by Tarkovskii and Wenders, Russian icons, and paintings by Vrubel.

Central to the work of students and faculty in the concentration is the close collaboration of artists, scholars, and writers in examining relationships between academic and artistic knowledge about the world and human experience. Concentrators work closely with faculty members in developing new knowledge about the world and human existence through the critical and comprehensive study of the peoples and cultures of Africa and the African Diaspora.</p><p>Concentrators are encouraged to study abroad in Africa, the Caribbean, and/or Latin America and to acquire language competency in a language other than English spoken in Africa and the diaspora. Africana Studies presents a different conceptual paradigm that connects the global black experience. Africana Studies engages issues about historical and contemporary responses to local and global crises. It engages with how people of color create their own knowledge culturally and politically. It is oftentimes a critique of how forms of knowledge are produced. Concentrators acquire a host of interdisciplinary skills that allow them to ask questions about the world around them, and forms of knowledge production while developing critical analytical skills. Our concentrators deploy these skills in other classes, enriching their own general intellectual development.</p><p>In order to develop requisite competency in the discipline of Africana Studies, concentrators must complete eight (8) semester-long courses offered by or cross-listed with the Department. Six (6) courses must have an AFRI prefix or be offered by Africana Studies core faculty. Two (2) courses can be cross-listed. In some cases, Concentrators may petition the Department to accept other appropriate courses. Of these 8 courses, the following Africana Studies courses are required:</p><p>• AFRI 0090 An Introduction to Africana Studies • AFRI 1360 Africana Studies: Knowledge, Texts and Methodology-Senior Capstone Seminar (Spring ONLY)</p><p>Please note: Beginning with the class of 2021, the concentration will be comprised of a total of 9 courses, which will include a required junior seminar to be offered during the second semester. Students studying abroad during the second semester of their junior year will be required to take the seminar during their senior year. If there is a documented conflict with another concentration's senior seminar, students should consult with the DUS.</p><p>The Department strongly encourages foreign study in Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, during the student's junior year of concentration. Although the Africana Studies Department actively supports programs in South Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Brazil, and the English-Speaking Caribbean, at least six (6) courses must be completed in the department and taught by core faculty.</p><p>The Department also encourages the acquisition of language competencies, in addition to English, which are spoken in Africa and the diaspora. Since no continental African language is currently offered at Brown, concentrators who study abroad and acquire certified competency in any African language are welcome to petition the department for competency credit.</p><p>For more information about the concentration, please contact Professor Françoise Hamlin (Francoise_Hamlin@brown.edu), Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Africana Studies</head><p>Africana Studies' concentrators with outstanding academic records (demonstration of excellent research and writing skills from course selections to grades) may be admitted to the department's Honors Program.</p><p>Students interested in pursuing honors should identify a faculty sponsor in Africana Studies (chosen from Core Faculty or affiliated faculty after Chair agreement) in their 6th semester and begin working on their thesis project during the summer before their senior year. By the end of the sixth semester, while working in consultation with a faculty advisor, the student must submit a rough draft of the project proposal. Please visit the department website for proposal guidelines. This preliminary plan should include a timeline for completion of the thesis and is not to exceed one (1) typewritten page. This plan should also include a bibliography that students have developed with their thesis advisor to guide their summer reading.</p><p>By the end of the summer, the Honor's candidate should be familiar with the secondary works in the field. (Secondary readings should be extensive and be incorporated into the final proposal, due Monday, September 14, 2020.) The student should also identify a second reader at this point. The final work plan/proposal, not to exceed three (3) typewritten pages, should incorporate the summer research findings and updates to the completion deadline. The final proposal must be approved and signed by a committee, comprised of the faculty advisor who is to direct the Honor's thesis, the second reader, and the concentration advisor. By the end of week three of the first senior semester, the thesis advisor should inform the Director of Undergraduate Studies by email that the proposal has been approved.</p><p>The Honor's candidate should complete at least one chapter of distinguished quality while enrolled in an independent study with their faculty advisor during the first semester of the senior year. Students must enroll in at least one, preferably two, semesters of independent study to work on their thesis. at a time to be determined. After this presentation, a department committee will make recommendations for honors to the Director of Undergraduate Studies and students will receive notification of the recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies</head><p>The concentration in American Studies seeks to understand American society and cultures as emerging from historical and contemporary processes at work in local, national, and global contexts. Concentrators study four broad themes: social structure and the practices of identity, space and place, production and consumption of culture, and science, technology, and everyday life. The concentration is predicated on the ideal of scholarly engagement with the public, so students take junior seminars that engage some aspect of the public humanities such as public policy, memorialization, community studies or civic engagement. Study abroad is supported and encouraged.</p><p>Interested students may contact the director of undergraduate studies.</p><p>A concentrator in American Studies will be able to:</p><p>• Analyze texts, contexts, and data from multiple disciplinary and historical perspectives • Synthesize research as verbal, visual and/or digital presentations • Explore the theory and/or practice of the engagement of scholarship with a broader public • Understand how American society and cultures have been and are being shaped by global flows of people, goods and ideas • Experiment with new media as critical tools for scholarship For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>Concentrators have gone on to a vast variety of careers, including law, public humanities, politics, public service, academics, business, creative arts, and medicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements:</head><p>Each concentrator will take 10 upper-level courses, four of which must be seminars, including a Junior Seminar (an AMST 1700 level course) and a Senior Seminar (AMST 1900 level course). Students may take as many AMST 1900 level courses as they wish, however for the course to count as a senior seminar it must be taken during the senior year.</p><p>Each concentrator will create an individual FOCUS consisting of at least three courses in consultation with the Concentration Advisor. The focus is the flexible core of the concentration. Here each student builds a coherent and dynamic interdisciplinary structure of related courses that develops his or her compelling interest in some aspect of American experience. Courses from outside of AMST and ETHN can be counted for credit within the concentration if they relate to the concentrator's focus area.</p><p>All seniors are required to do a capstone electronic portfolio.</p><p>Some concentrators may elect to do an Honors Thesis and are encouraged to take AMST 1800, the Honors Seminar, in the Spring of their Junior year. Students pursuing honors are required to take two independent study courses <ref type="bibr">(AMST 1970)</ref> in their senior year, in addition to the regular concentration requirements (for a total of 12 credits), in order to write their honors thesis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the American Studies Concentration</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOW we study</head><p>American Studies at Brown emphasizes four intersecting approaches that are critical tools for understanding these themes:</p><p>• Cultural and Social Analysis: Reading and analyzing different kinds of texts, including literary, visual, aural, oral, material objects and landscapes. Examining ethnic and racial groups, institutions, organizations and social movements. • Global/International Contextualization: Comprehending the United States as a society and culture that has been shaped by the historical and contemporary flows of people, goods and ideas from around the world and in turn, learning about the various ways in which America has shaped the world. • New Media Understandings: Understanding the creation of new forms of discourse, new ways of knowing and new modes of social organization made possible by succeeding media revolutions. Using new media as a critical tool for scholarship. • Publicly Engaged Scholarship: Connecting the theory and the practice of publicly-engaged research, understanding and presentation, from community-based scholarship to ethnography, oral history, and museum exhibits. Civic engagement might include structured and reflective participation in a local community or communities or the application of general theoretical knowledge to understanding social issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropology</head><p>Anthropology is the study of human beings from all times and all places, offering holistic, comparative, international, and humanistic perspective.</p><p>In studying and interpreting the vast range of similarities and differences in human societies and cultures, anthropologists also seek to understand how people themselves make sense of the world in which they live. The Department of Anthropology at Brown is a vibrant, award-winning group of scholars working primarily in the subfields of cultural anthropology, archaeology, and anthropological linguistics. The concentration provides students with a broad introduction to the discipline and includes the major subdisciplines of the field: sociocultural anthropology, archaeology, anthropological linguistics, and biological anthropology. The department also allows students to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program (https:// www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/public-service/ engaged-scholars-program). ESP is for students with an interest in making deeper connections between their concentration curriculum and long-term engaged activities such as internships, public service, humanitarian and development work, archaeological excavations, and many other possible forms of community involvement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engaged Scholars Program</head><p>The Engaged Scholars Program in Anthropology is geared for anthropology concentrators who are especially interested in making deeper connections between their concentration curriculum and longterm engagement with local communities in Providence and beyond. Engaged scholars combine hands-on experiences such as internships, public service, humanitarian and development work with their academic learning in order to develop a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, social engagement. While most anthropology courses have some sort of 'engaged' element, being an Engaged Scholar in Anthropology means making a commitment to engaging more actively and intensively with the communities in which a student is living. Concentrators are urged to complete their introductory programming course before the end of their sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Mathematics-Biology</head><p>The Applied Math -Biology concentration recognizes that mathematics is essential to address many modern biological problems in the post genomic era. Specifically, high throughput technologies have rendered vast new biological data sets that require novel analytical skills for the most basic analyses. These technologies are spawning a new "datadriven" paradigm in the biological sciences and the fields of bioinformatics and systems biology. The foundations of these new fields are inherently mathematical, with a focus on probability, statistical inference, and systems dynamics. These mathematical methods apply very broadly in many biological fields including some like population growth, spread of disease, that predate the genomics revolution. Nevertheless, the application of these methods in areas of biology from molecular genetics to evolutionary biology has grown very rapidly in with the availability of vast amounts of genomic sequence data. Required coursework in this program aims at ensuring expertise in mathematical and statistical sciences, and their application in biology. The students will focus in particular areas of biology. The program culminates in a senior capstone experience that pairs student and faculty in creative research collaborations.</p></div>

Those who do can use it as their second Applied Math or Biology course. Four classes in the biological sciences agreed upon by the student and advisor. These four courses should form a cohesive grouping ina specific area of emphasis, at least two of which should be at the 1000-level. Some example groupings are below: 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Areas of Emphasis and Suggested Courses:</head><p>Some areas of possible emphasis for focusing of elective courses are listed below. Given the large number of course offerings in the biosciences and neuroscience, students are free to explore classes in these areas that are not listed below. However, all classes must be approved by the concentration advisor. APMA 1910 cannot be used as an elective.</p><p>Biochemistry Students whose independent study is expected to be in an experimental field are strongly encouraged to take APMA 1660, which covers experimental design and the analysis of variance (ANOVA), a method commonly used in the analysis of experimental data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>Requirements and Process: Honors in the Applied Math-Biology concentration is based primarily upon an in-depth, original research project carried out under the guidance of a Brown (and usually Applied Math or BioMed) affiliated faculty advisor. Projects must be conducted for no less than two full semesters, and student smust register for credit for the project via APMA 1970 or BIOL 1950/BIOL 1960 or similar independent study courses. The project culminates in the writing of a thesis which is reviewed by the thesis advisor and a second reader. It is essential that the student have one advisor from the biological sciences and one in Applied Mathematics. The thesis work must be presented in the form of an oral presentation (arranged with the primary thesis advisor) or posted at the annual Undergraduate Research Day in either Applied Mathematics or Biology. For information on registering for BIOL 1950/BIOL 1960, please see https://www.brown.edu/academics/biology/undergraduate-education/ undergraduate-research Excellence in grades within the concentration as well as a satisfactory evaluation by the advsors are also required for Honors. The student's grades must place them within the upper 20% of their cohort, in accordance with the university policy on honors. Honors recipients typically maintain a Grade Point Average of 3.4 or higher in the concentration. However, in the case of outstanding independent research as demonstrated in the thesis and supported by the Thesis Committee, candidates with a GPA between 3.0 an 3.4 will be considered and are encouraged to apply.</p><p>The deadline for applying to graduate with honors in the concentration are the same as those of the biology concentrations. However, students in the joint concentration must inform the undergraduate chair in Applied Mathematics of their intention to apply for honors by these dates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Mathematics-Computer Science</head><p>The Sc.B. concentration in Applied Math-Computer Science provides a foundation of basic concepts and methodology of mathematical analysis and computation and prepares students for advanced work in computer science, applied mathematics, and scientific computation. Concentrators must complete courses in mathematics, applied math, computer science, and an approved English writing course. While the concentration in Applied Math-Computer Science allows students to develop the use of quantitative methods in thinking about and solving problems, knowledge that is valuable in all walks of life, students who have completed the concentration have pursued graduate study, computer consulting and information industries, and scientific and statistical analysis careers in industry or government.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Archaeology and the Ancient World</head><p>The concentration in Archaeology and the Ancient World provides an opportunity to explore the multi-faceted discipline of archaeology while examining the critical early civilizations of the so-called 'Old World'-that is, the complex societies of the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East. Students will learn about the art, architecture, and material culture of the ancient world, exploring things of beauty and power, as well as the world of the everyday. Concentrators will also learn "how to do" archaeology -the techniques of locating, retrieving, and analyzing ancient remainsand consider how material culture shapes our understanding of the past.</p><p>Concentrators are encouraged to pursue research opportunities through summer fieldwork, museum experience, or independent study projects.</p><p>The undergraduate concentration in Archaeology and the Ancient World provides students with an opportunity to explore the multifaceted discipline of archaeology, and encourages an interdisciplinary approach to engaging with the ancient world. While the core focus of Archaeology and the Ancient World at Brown University is archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East, this concentration encourages students to reach beyond this geographic area, to engage with Brown's many strengths in history, epigraphy, art, ethics, engineering, religious studies, and the sciences -to name just a few. The concentration, with its three distinct but overlapping tracks, is intended to allow students flexibility in structuring their own path through this diverse field of study. All three tracks begin with the same foundation. Students are then expected to experiment with and define their own areas of specialty, establishing expertise in topics such as cultural heritage, archaeological theory, or materials analysis, or in particular regions or time periods. The concentration is also designed to allow students to build progressively upon what they have learned, moving from introductory courses to upperlevel seminars.</p><p>It is expected that, in completing the requirements for this concentration, students will incorporate courses that offer new perspectives on the complex dynamics of social inequity, exclusion, and difference, and which encourage engagement with the community -both by enrolling in classes designated as Diverse Perspectives in Liberal Learning (DPLL) and through non-DPLL classes that explore similar themes. Research opportunities, through summer fieldwork, internships, museum experience, or independent study projects, are strongly encouraged.</p><p>Within this concentration, the three tracks are:</p><p>• Archaeology and the Ancient World: the most flexible of the concentration tracks, allowing students to explore any region or time period, and to develop their own areas of focus, such as museum studies, ethics and politics of the past, engineering and materials analysis, cultural heritage, or environmental studies. • Classical Archaeology: for those interested chiefly in the 'classic' civilizations of the Mediterranean (especially Greece and Rome), as well as for those interested in both earlier (prehistoric) and later (medieval) periods in that geographic region. • Egyptian and Near Eastern Archaeology: for those interested chiefly in the cultures of Egypt and the ancient 'Near East' -Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia -from prehistoric through Islamic times.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieldwork, Study Abroad, and Capstone Experiences</head><p>Students are strongly encouraged to consider participating in a field project, most typically after sophomore or junior year. The Joukowsky Institute's Assistant Director and other faculty members can provide suggestions about how to explore and fund possible field projects. For each of the tracks, a capstone experience may be substituted for one of these required courses. With the permission of the Assistant Director or the Director of Undergraduate Studies, up to three successfully completed courses, from relevant and accredited study abroad programs, may be counted towards the concentration requirements. Field school courses that provide formal university transfer credit, and official transcripts, may also be used to fulfill concentration requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Concentrations</head><p>An Honors concentration in any of these tracks requires the successful completion of all the standard requirements with the addition of an Honors thesis. For the preparation of this thesis, students will ordinarily enroll in ARCH 1970 during the first semester of the senior year and ARCH 1990 during the second semester of the senior year (these courses may not be taken S/NC, nor may they be used to satisfy the standard requirements of the concentration). In order to qualify for honors, students must have received more A's than B's in concentration courses completed.</p><p>Honors concentrations are recommended for students considering graduate work in the discipline of archaeology. Any student interested in a course of graduate study should speak to the Joukowsky Institute's Assistant Director and faculty members as soon as possible,, not least for advice about additional forms of preparation. Graduate work in the archaeology of the ancient world, for example, requires knowledge of appropriate ancient, as well as modern, languages. Students should start work on acquiring these skills as early as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Thesis</head><p>The Honors thesis is an extended essay, usually of between 40 and 60 pages in length, researched and written under the supervision of a faculty advisor and second reader during the senior year (during which the student must be enrolled in ARCH 1970 in the Fall and ARCH 1990 in the Spring semester).</p><p>Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both of them, may be in a unit other than the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. The specific topic and approach of the thesis are worked out between the student and the thesis advisor, with assistance from the For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu). student's second reader. This process should begin in the latter part of the student's junior year.</p><p>A preliminary title and one page outline of the proposed Honors thesis is due to the Joukowsky Institute's Assistant Director and the thesis advisor by May 15th of the junior year.</p><p>The deadlines for thesis drafts, and for final thesis submission, will be agreed between the student and the faculty advisors. It is expected that students will have submitted at least one full chapter to their primary advisor by the end of the student's penultimate semester. The deadline for final thesis submission typically should be on or before April 15th, and must be no later than the first day of Reading Period in the final semester of senior year. Both a bound and an electronic version of the final thesis must be submitted to the Joukowsky Institute by May 1, via email to joukowsky_institute@brown.edu.</p><p>The completed thesis will be evaluated by the advisor and second reader, who will discuss its strengths and weaknesses in a joint meeting with the student; they will then make a recommendation concerning Honors, and also agree a grade for ARCH 1990.</p><p>The Honors concentrators will be asked to make a short public presentation about their work; this event will be organized by the Joukowsky Institute's Assistant Director, and usually occurs during or shortly after Reading Period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation</head><p>The Director of Undergraduate Studies will review the student's overall record, in addition to the thesis evaluations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology</head><p>How does life work at the molecular level? This question is at the core of the concentration program Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In earlier years of this discipline, the focus was on structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates and small molecules such as vitamins. Today the logical approach and tools of biochemical science are being expanded to new areas in neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology, pharmacology and synthetic biology (the design of analogs of biological systems). Training in biochemistry begins with a foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Some courses offered in other departments, including engineering, geology and computer science, are also useful. A key component of this program is the year of hands-on research carried out in collaboration with a faculty member here at Brown. Faculty sponsors are drawn from both the Chemistry Department and the Division of Biology and Medicine, and include basic science and clinical faculty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemistry</head><p>The Chemistry concentration offers courses and research opportunities that range from fundamental studies involving the characterization and preparation of synthetic and naturally occurring molecules, to interdisciplinary studies at the interfaces of chemistry with biology, medicine, physics, engineering, and nanoscience. As early as their first year, undergraduates are able to work one-on-one or in small groups with faculty members on cutting edge research projects. The Sc.B. degree provides a thorough foundation for further graduate study or for entrylevel technical positions in each area. Students seeking the Sc.B. may either pursue the standard Chemistry concentration or one of the two optional tracks: Chemical Biology or Materials Chemistry. Students may also pursue the A.B. degree in Chemistry, which provides a core education in the discipline. At least one must be a chemistry course. BIOL 0280 is credited as a chemistry elective for chemistry concentration purposes. Non CHEM electives are upper level science/math courses with a significant molecular focus or those that cover tools/techniques that are of utility to a chemist.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classics</head><p>The study of Classics focuses on the languages, literature, history, culture, and legacy of Greco-Roman antiquity. An undergraduate concentration in Classics furnishes students with a broad liberal education, and provides specialized training for those students intending to enter graduate school. Students may choose to study Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and/or Modern Greek, and to explore courses in literature, mythology, history, philosophy, and religion. Students may either pursue the standard Classics concentration -the most popular choice -or one of several optional tracks: Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, South Asian Classics, Sanskrit, Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit. Concentrators who pursue an honors degree write a senior thesis, typically over the course of two semesters during their senior year.</p><p>Beginning with declarations submitted after September 1, 2018, all tracks except "Greek and Latin," "Greek and Sanskrit," and "Latin and Sanskrit" require the satisfactory completion of nine courses as described below. The introductory courses in Greek and Latin may not usually be counted toward a concentration, but those in Sanskrit may be counted toward the concentration requirement in some of the tracks. Students should always consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies regarding their path toward fulfilling requirements and choosing electives.</p></div>

In order to qualify, the candidate for honors in the Department of Classics ordinarily will be entering his/her seventh semester of study and must have an "A" average (3.50 or higher on a 4.00 scale) in the concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Neuroscience</head><p>Cognitive neuroscience is the study of higher cognitive functions in humans and their underlying neural bases. It is an integrative area of study drawing primarily from cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics. There are two broad directions that can be taken in this concentration -one is behavioral/experimental and the other is computational/modeling. In both, the goal is to understand the nature of cognition from a neural perspective. The standard concentration for the Sc.B. degree requires courses on the foundations, systems level, and integrative aspects of cognitive neuroscience as well as laboratory and elective courses that fit within a particular theme or category such as general cognition, perception, language development or computational/ modeling. Concentrators must also complete a senior seminar course or an independent research course. Students may also participate in the work of the Brown Institute for Brain Science, an interdisciplinary program that unites ninety faculty from eleven departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Program for the AB degree (Effective Class of 2019)</head><p>The A.B. concentration requires 12 courses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Core</head><p>The introductory course, "CLPS 0010 Mind, Brain, and Behavior," surveys the broad territory of the scientific study of the mind, as uniquely represented by our department. The course maps the breadth of the science of the mind, focusing on fascinating questions, garnered insights, common commitments, and successful techniques and approaches. The course could be taken by students interested in the CLPS concentrations or as an introductory survey course at the beginning of one's college career. AP Psychology is not an acceptable equivalent for CLPS 0010.</p><p>Careers in Cognitive Neuroscience and related fields requires familiarity with statistics. Therefore, the Cognitive Neuroscience concentration requires a course in Quantitative Methods (CLPS 0900). CLPS 0900 is a prerequisite for most of the laboratory courses, so concentrators should plan to take this course by their fourth semester. The department does not grant concentration credit of AP Statistics, regardless of score. Students who feel that CLPS 0900 is too elementary can complete an approved alternative course (e.g., APMA 1650, CLPS 2906, PHP 1501, ECON 1629, APMA 1660).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foundation</head><p>To provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge in their area of concentration and to minimize redundancy, the Cognitive Neuroscience concentration requires four foundation courses in Neuroscience, Cognitive Neuroscience, Cognitive Neuropsychology, and Computational Methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>Each concentrator will take four additional courses that allow the student to go into depth in some of the relevant topics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Science</head><p>The field of Cognitive Science uses scientific methods of experimentation, computational modeling, and brain imaging to study mental abilities such as perception, action, memory, cognition, speech, and language, as well as the development and evolution of those processes. Students must become knowledgeable in four areas of emphasis: perception, cognition, language, and computational methods, as well as a set of methods relevant to Cognitive Science research. Students then create their own focus area of study, potentially integrating coursework from the Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences department with a diverse subset of fields including Computer Science, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Anthropology, Applied Math and Education. The A.B. program is primarily for students interested in studying human mental processes and acquiring a research orientation to the study of the mind. The Sc.B. program is designed for students who wish to develop a stronger background in Cognitive Science and requires students to engage in a specific research project in the focus area of their choosing. We recommend that prospective concentrators register for one of the gateway courses and at least one other core course in their first or second year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentration Requirements (Effective, Class of 2019)</head><p>The A.B. concentration requires 12 courses. The Sc.B concentration additionally requires 1 laboratory course and 4 approved science courses, totaling to a total of 17 required courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Core</head><p>The introductory course, "CLPS 0010 Mind, Brain, and Behavior," surveys the broad territory of the scientific study of the mind, as uniquely represented by our department. The course maps the breadth of the science of the mind, focusing on fascinating questions, garnered insights, common commitments, and successful techniques and approaches. The course could be taken by students interested in the CLPS concentrations or as an introduction at the beginning of one's college career or as an integration after having completed a number of specialized courses in a particular concentration.</p><p>For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>Careers in Cognitive Science and related fields requires familiarity with statistics. Therefore, the Cognitive Science concentration requires a course in Quantitative Methods (CLPS 0900). CLPS 0900 is a prerequisite for most of the laboratory courses, so concentrators should plan to take this course by their fourth semester. The department does not grant concentration credit of AP Statistics, regardless of score. Students who feel that CLPS 0900 is too elementary can complete an approved alternative course (e.g., APMA 1650, CLPS 2906).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foundation</head><p>To provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge in their area of concentration and to minimize redundancy, the Cognitive Science concentration requires four foundation courses in Human Cognition, Perception, Language, and Computational Methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>Each concentrator will take four additional courses that allow the student to go into depth in some of the relevant topics. These electives must include at least two courses in one of the four foundation topics (i.e., Human Cognition, Perception, Language, and Computational Methods).</p><p>The courses designed to count as electives will often have foundation courses as prerequisites and may include laboratory courses, content courses, or seminars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Requirement</head><p>The Honors Program in Cognitive Science gives undergraduates a special opportunity to carry out a research project under the direction of a faculty member. The program also provides the opportunity for outstanding senior concentrators to receive their undergraduate degree with Honors. Participation in the program allows students to develop an understanding of research and acquire research skills and background.</p><p>Candidates for Honors in Cognitive Science must meet all of the requirements of the concentration as described above. Candidates submit their application for the program in semester 7. We encourage students to seek out a faculty mentor prior to semester 7 as well as complete certain course requirements before semester 7. Normally a 3.5 gradepoint average in the concentration is required for admission to the Honors program. Please refer to the CLPS Honors Program page for specific requirements for the honors program in Cognitive Science. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative Literature</head><p>The concentration in Comparative Literature enables students to study literature in cross-cultural perspectives. The aim of the program is to encourage students to study a varied and illustrative range of literary topics rather than the total development of a single literary tradition. True to the spirit of Brown's New Curriculum, a concentration in Comparative Literature affords great academic freedom. For example: advanced courses in any literature department at Brown count for concentration credit; although English is commonly one of the languages that students apply to their Comparative Literature studies, basically any language-ancient or modern--supported at Brown may form part of a Comparative Literature concentration program. In essence, concentrators study a generous range of literary works--from Western cultures, both ancient and modern, to Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic--and develop a focused critical understanding of how cultures differ from one another. Comparative Literature differs from other literature concentrations largely through its international focus and its broad-gauged view of art and culture in which the study of languages is combined with the analysis of literature and literary theory. All students take a course in literary theory and have the opportunity to complete a senior essay.</p><p>Please contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, listed below, with questions.</p><p>There are three concentration tracks in Comparative Literature, as follows: A substantial work in translation (length will vary depending upon language and genre);</p><p>A critical introduction outlining the method used and specific problems encountered, and commenting on the history of the original work together with other translations, if any. For thesis, the student may register for COLT 1990, which will be taken in addition to the ten required courses listed above. Successful completion of the thesis constitutes Honors. (See Guidelines for Honors Theses).</p><p>Examples of courses that may fulfill the requirements, above, include but are not limited to the following courses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Biology</head><p>Computational biology involves the analysis and discovery of biological phenomena using computational tools, and the algorithmic design and analysis of such tools. The field is widely defined and includes foundations in computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, anatomy, neuroscience, and visualization. As part of Brown's writing requirement, all students must demonstrate that they have worked on their writing both in their general studies and their concentration. There are a number of ways for Computational Biology concentrators to fulfill these requirements:</p><p>• Enrolling in an independent study: <ref type="bibr">CSCI 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">, BIOL 1950</ref><ref type="bibr">, APMA 1970</ref> • Writing an Honors Thesis • Taking a "WRIT" course in the final two years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone Experience</head><p>Students enrolled in the computational biology concentration will complete a research project in their senior year under faculty supervision. The themes of such projects evolve with the field and the technology, but should represent a synthesis of the various specialties of the program. The requirements are either one semester of reading and research with a CCMB Faculty member or approved advisor, or a 2000-level Computational Biology course. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Science</head><p>Computer science is now a critical tool for pursuing an ever-broadening range of topics, from outer space to the workings of the human mind. In most areas of science and in many liberal arts fields, cutting-edge work depends increasingly on computational approaches. The undergraduate program at Brown is designed to combine breadth in practical and theoretical computer science with depth in specialized areas. These areas range from traditional topics, such as analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, databases, distributed systems, graphics, mobile computing, networks, operating systems, programming languages, robotics and security, to novel areas including games and scientific visualization.</p><p>Our requirements are built on a collection of pathways, each representing a well defined area within computer science. Concentrators interested in particular areas can choose the courses included in particular pathways. Conversely, concentrators who are unsure of their area of interest but who have particularly enjoyed certain courses can choose pathways that include these concentrations. Students may not use more than two CSCI 1970 courses to complete the requirements for the Sc.B. and one CSCI 1970 course for the A.B. requirements. Students electing this pathway must write a proposal for their pathway and have it approved by an advisor and the director of undergraduate studies. The proposal must meet the breadth and overall course requirements. This must be done by the end of shopping period of the student's seventh semester.</p></div>

Students pursue a "third person" academic approach drawn from the humanities and sciences to analyze the cultural, historical, and scientific underpinnings of contemplative experiences in religion, art, music, and literature. This is developed in combination with a "critical firstperson" approach based in practical experience of contemplative techniques and methods to provide an integrated understanding of the role of contemplative thought and experience in societies and on the individuals who constitute them.</p></div>

Students will be taught how to critique current research as well as how to develop, operationalize, and test hypotheses related to contemplative practice. Students will become well-versed in how to study first-person reports related to the phenomenology of contemplative experience as a foundation for formulating third-person tests of the effects of practice on brain function and behavior. The Contemplative Studies Science Track trains students to investigate these types of questions not only for academic scholarship, but also to provide a method of self-inquiry that can be used to augment any area of life.</p></div>

The concentration is grounded in the social sciences -anthropology, sociology, political science, and economics -but it also heavily draws from history, art, and other disciplines in the humanities. The requirements are designed with three goals in mind: first, provide concentrators a solid foundation in the question of development; second, allow concentrators to develop expertise in a specific region that is of interest to them; third, give concentrators access to a wide range of courses in a large number of disciplines of interest to them. Concentrators are encouraged to do their own original field research. During the senior year, concentrators complete a capstone experience tailored to their interests (http://brown.edu/academics/ development-studies/about/what-ds-capstone) in some aspect of international development. Towards this end, they benefit from extensive faculty and peer support. The Development Studies concentration will only accept new declarations through the class of 2023. Students in any class year can learn more about the new concentration (https:// watson.brown.edu/iapa/about/faqs) in International and Public Affairs: Development Track.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>East Asian Studies</head><p>East Asian Studies is a multidisciplinary concentration designed for students wishing to attain reasonable fluency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean with specialized exposure to selected East Asian subjects. It serves students with two types of interests: those who aim to pursue active professional careers related to the East Asian region; and those who want to pursue graduate study in the humanities or social sciences with particular emphasis on China, Japan or Korea. Students in East Asian Studies will gain language proficiency and familiarity with East Asia through advanced courses in a variety of disciplines. Concentrators are strongly encouraged, but not required, to study in East Asia for one or two semesters. The concentration requires students to demonstrate a basic proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language Requirement</head><p>The concentration requires students to demonstrate a basic proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. For the purposes of the concentration, proficiency is determined to be consistent with successful completion of the Department's third-year course sequence in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (0500-0600), or its equivalent. Native speakers of these languages may, for example, demonstrate competency such that language courses may be unnecessary. Department language instructors may also determine that course work completed at one of the language-intensive study abroad programs attended by our undergraduates is comparable to courses offered at Brown. Up to three upper level (700-999) may count as electives for concentration credit.</p><p>Note that we do not equate completion of third-year Chinese, Japanese, or Korean with fluency in these languages. Rather, we believe that students who have demonstrated the skills associated with third-year Chinese, Japanese, or Korean have acquired a foundational understanding of the languages' grammar, vocabularies, and conversational patterns, such that they are able to make themselves understood in everyday situations, and to understand both spoken and written communication.</p><p>For the purposes of the concentration, language courses through the thirdyear are treated as an accompanying requirement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>The concentration requires that students complete a total of eight electives tied to their course of study, which may be defined in linguistic, chronological, thematic, or cultural terms. Students should choose their courses with the following three requirements in mind.</p><p>• EAST Requirement: At least three of the eight electives must be East Asian Studies (EAST) courses at any level; Chinese (CHIN), Japanese (JAPN), or Korean (KREA) courses at the 1000-level and above may also count toward this requirement. • Breadth Requirement: At least one of the eight electives must focus on an East Asian country or culture other than those associated with the language the student is using to satisfy the concentration's language requirement. A concentrator studying Chinese, for example, must choose at least one course that focuses on Korea and/or Japan. • Senior Seminar Requirement: At least one of the eight elective courses must be an advanced research seminar, taken in the senior year.</p><p>As is common for interdisciplinary concentrations, a wide range of courses, including many taught by faculty in other departments, may be counted toward the concentration. These include courses offered by East Asian Studies faculty, faculty with courtesy appointments in the Department, and courses with a significant focus on East Asia offered in such disciplines as American Studies, Art History, Economics, International Relations, and many others. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Research Seminars</head><p>At least one of the eight elective courses must be an advanced research seminar, taken in the senior year. The research seminar will normally provide students with the opportunity to develop a project or paper focusing on one or more of their areas of inquiry within the concentration. Students are strongly encouraged to find ways to incorporate the use of Chinese, Japanese or Korean language materials in their research and learning in these courses. Courses falling into this category include the East Asian Studies 1950 series as well as designated seminars offered by faculty in such departments as History, Religious Studies, and Comparative Literature among others. The Department will provide a list of pre-approved advanced seminars every semester. Students wishing to add courses to that list must submit their requests in writing to the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the start of the semester. </p></div>

To enroll in the Honors Program, the student must be a senior East Asian Studies concentrator, with at least a high B average in concentration courses. Candidates for Honors are required to have developed a competence in an East Asian language sufficient to allow them to use East Asian language materials in carrying out their research. Students must also successfully obtain the support of at least two faculty members who will agree to serve as primary and secondary advisors for the thesis. Prospective writers submit a thesis prospectus, brief bibliography, and completed application forms (with signatures), ordinarily late in the student's six semester, to the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who provides the final permission to proceed. Synopses of successful thesis proposals will be distributed to Department faculty.</p><p>Thesis writers enroll in advisor-specific sections of the thesis-writing course <ref type="bibr">EAST 1930 (Fall) and</ref><ref type="bibr">EAST 1940 (Spring)</ref>, meet regularly with their advisors over the course of both semesters, and submit final versions of their theses to the Department in mid-April. Advisors and students are required to provide updates of their progress to the Director of Undergraduate Studies at regular intervals.</p><p>The completed thesis is evaluated for Honors by the thesis director and by a second reader. In case of a difference of judgment between the two readers, a third opinion may be sought. The awarding of Honors in East Asian Studies will occur only if the Honors Thesis receives a final grade of A. If an A is not received, the student will still receive academic credit for <ref type="bibr">EAST 1930</ref><ref type="bibr">EAST -1940</ref>. Students are notified in mid-May whether the Department has recommended the awarding of Honors. Copies of readers' comments are provided to the student.</p><p>All graduating concentrators will present the results of their senior theses in the department's Senior Project Forum. The Forum will usually take place at the end of the spring semester, but may also occur at the end of the fall semester to accommodate mid-year graduates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Concentrations</head><p>Students who are interested in developing a double concentration, including East Asian Studies as one of the two concentrations, should bear in mind that normally no more than two courses may be doublecounted toward satisfying the course requirements of either of the two concentration programs involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>Concentrators are strongly encouraged, but not required, to study in East Asia for one or two semesters during their undergraduate years. Course credits earned abroad are generally transferable to Brown. However, a maximum of three courses taken abroad, of genuine intellectual substance and significantly related to East Asian Studies, may be considered for concentration credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of requirements:</head><p>• Language study through the level of 0600 or the equivalent of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean • Eight elective courses</p><p>• At least three of the eight must be East Asian Studies (EAST) courses at any level or Chinese (CHIN), Japanese (JAPN), or Korean (KREA) courses at the 1000-level and above • At least one of the eight electives must focus on an East Asian country or culture other than those associated with the language the student is using to satisfy the concentration's language requirement. A concentrator studying China, for example, would choose at least one course that focuses on Korea and/or Japan. • At least one of the eight must be an advanced research seminar, taken in the senior year. • EAST 1930 (Senior Thesis, Semester 1)-EAST 1940 ( Senior Thesis, Semester 2) for Honors candidates only</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Economics</head><p>Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments allocate resources to satisfy their objectives. The study of economics helps students understand markets, firms, financial organizations, and public debate about economic policy, including taxation, government expenditure, trade, globalization, health, and welfare. The concentration in Economics prepares students for graduate study in fields such as business and law, for graduate study leading to teaching and research in economics, and can be a steppingstone to employment in business, finance, non-profit, and government organizations. Students may choose either the standard or the professional track.</p><p>Students are required to begin with ECON 0110, an introductory course that stresses the economic problems of our society, and the vocabulary and principles of economic analysis. Intermediate level courses in microeconomics <ref type="bibr">(ECON 1110</ref><ref type="bibr">or ECON 1130</ref>, macroeconomics (ECON 1210), and econometrics (ECON 1620 followed by ECON 1629 or ECON 1630 ) round out the list of foundation courses for the concentration. Economics students must also fulfill a calculus requirement.</p><p>The economics department sponsors a number of concentration options. The most popular is the standard economics concentration, described below. Three additional concentration options are administered jointly with other departments and are described separately under their respective titles. They are the concentrations in applied mathematicseconomics,mathematical-economics , and in computer scienceeconomics. The first two are especially recommended for students interested in graduate study in economics.</p><p>The department offers many of the required courses in an interdepartmental concentration called Business, Entrepreneurship and Organizations (BEO). BEO is jointly run by the departments of economics and sociology, and the school of engineering. BEO has three possible "tracks," of which the business economics track is most closely related to economics. The BEO concentration and all of its current BEO track offerings remain in place through the class of 2023, after which it will be discontinued. Please contact the BEO administrator for more details, including information about advising in that concentration. A new Business Economics track within the economics concentration is now available to classes of 2020 and beyond. Please see the requirements for this track listed below. Students who place out of ECON 0110 on the basis of qualifying scores on the AP, IB, or A level exams must take an additional 1000level course (6 instead of 5).</p><p>2 Students can satisfy the mathematics requirement with qualifying scores on the AP, IB, or A-levels exams (but not the math department's self placement exam). Note the certain advanced economics courses may impose additional math prerequisites.</p><p>All concentrators in economics programs are encouraged to consult their concentration advisors regularly. Economics concentrators who wish to study abroad should consult first with the department transfer credit advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>Students who wish to pursue honors in economics should consult the department's undergraduate web site to obtain a complete description of the requirements. See the description of Capstone Projects there, as well.</p><p>For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>Courses taken to prepare an honors thesis are in addition to the regular concentration requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Track 1</head><p>Students wishing to complete the Professional Track for either the standard concentration or the Business Economics track will complete the requirements for the standard/Business Economics track, as well as the following:</p><p>Students must complete two two-to-four month full-time professional experiences, doing work that is related to their concentration programs. Such work is normally done at a company, but may also be at a university under the supervision of a faculty member.</p><p>On completion of each professional experience, the student must write and upload to ASK a reflective essay about the experience, to be approved by the student's concentration advisor:</p><p>1 International students must declare the professional track of their concentration in order for U.S. based internships to qualify for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). In addition to their other concentration requirements, students must complete two two-to-four month full time professional experiences, doing work that is related to their concentration program. Such work is normally done at a company or a non profit, but may also be at a university under the supervision of a faculty member. Upon completion of each profession experience, the student must write a reflective essay on ASK, to be approved by their concentration advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Education Studies</head><p>Welcome to Education Studies! Undergraduate concentrators study education in a rigorous, multi-dimensional way that allows them to investigate thorny questions of opportunity and equity in real-world settings. Our ever-expanding array of education courses allows undergraduates to explore fundamental issues of race, class, power, privilege, equity and identity through the lens of education. From introductory courses to advanced seminars, our classes examine how to teach for social justice, how students learn and develop, and how education policies promote or limit opportunity and equity.</p><p>Our faculty includes experts in teaching and learning, human development, education policy, and the history of education. We take a multi-disciplinary approach to the field, offering courses from perspectives in anthropology, economics, history, human development, political science, social work, and sociology, among others.</p><p>For more information, please visit our website (https:// education.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate) or contact John Papay (john_papay@brown.edu?subject=Education concentration), Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentration Requirements</head><p>Redesigned for the 2020-2021 academic year, the concentration in Education Studies requires a total of 10 credit-bearing courses and 1 noncredit-bearing experiential component, allowing students to develop a personalized plan of study to structure their Education experiences. The new Education Studies coursework is as follows:</p><p>• 3 Core Courses: 2 introductory courses (EDUC 0300 and EDUC 0750) will provide students with a broad-based introduction to the field of education and empirical methods used in the field, while 1 Senior Seminar, EDUC 1900, offers a culmination of students' experiences in the concentration. • 4 Specialization Courses: Students must take 4 courses total in their chosen area of emphasis (Education Policy Analysis; Human Development; Education and Inequality; Education for Social Justice; Adolescence; Immigrant Families, Communities &amp; Education; Child Development; Teaching and Learning; Education and Economics; or any related topic of interest) within the education field. • 3 Elective courses related to the field of education and the student's field of study. Only 1 independent study can count towards concentration requirements. No more than 3 courses in an Education Studies concentration can come from other departments outside of Education, and all courses should be approved by the student's advisor and meaningfully tied to education. • 1 Experiential Component: By the end of fall semester of senior year, students must complete an Experiential Component designed to promote practice-based engagement with the field of education and reflect on their experiences, tying them into their academic learning in the Education Studies concentration. Students can satisfy this requirement in one of three ways: a. By completing an existing Community-Based Learning and Research (CBLR) in the Department.</p><p>b. By writing a paper reflecting on their experience through the lens of their coursework in the Department. The student's academic advisor will assess the paper. It is to be completed independently of coursework and is not credit bearing (although students may do it as an additional assignment associated with a class they are taking).</p><p>c. By completing the reflection in an independent study-like course "Reflecting on Fieldwork." </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Education Studies Concentration Plan of Study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone</head><p>Capstones are voluntary, student-initiated projects or experiences outside the classroom that build on and contribute to students' Education Studies concentration. They can take various forms, including a research project, website design, curriculum design, policy analysis, or scholarly paper. Capstones can be designed and executed in the senior year, or can be based on a previous experience that the student wants to explore further in some way, such as an internship or teaching experience. While capstones do not confer academic credit or departmental honors, students who complete capstones will be recognized at the department graduation ceremony and will have the opportunity to present their work at a conference in the spring of their senior year. Through capstones, students have the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member in an area of their interest and are able to reflect on and extend their learning in the concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Baccalaureate/Master of Arts in Teaching Degree</head><p>Beginning in 2020-2021, the Education Department offers a concurrent degree program in which Brown undergraduates can apply to earn a B.A. or B.S. in a subject field (English, history, math, biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and allied concentrations) and MAT degree in 5 years.</p><p>Brown undergraduates can apply through the Education Department during their junior year. During their first four years, candidates must complete all baccalaureate requirements and may take up to two of the required graduate courses. In their fifth year, they will complete the remaining required graduate courses, including the one-year teaching residency. The minimum requirements to complete both degrees are 36 credits, of which a maximum of two may count toward the concurrent baccalaureate/MAT degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engaged Scholars Program</head><p>The Engaged Scholars Program (http://brown.edu/go/ engagedscholars) (ESP) in Education is intended for Education Studies concentrators interested in making connections between their concentration curriculum and long-term engagement, including internships, public service, humanitarian and development work, school-based education work, social service in education, or other forms of community and clinical involvement. The program combines preparation, experience, and reflection to provide students with opportunities to integrate academic learning and social engagement. (Note: This program is separate from the department's required experiential component. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Egyptology and Assyriology</head><p>The concentration in Egyptology and Assyriology offers students a choice of two tracks: Assyriology or Egyptology. The department promotes collaborations with other academic units at Brown devoted to the study of antiquity including Archaeology, Classics, Judaic Studies, and Religious Studies. Egyptology and Assyriology also collaborates with Brown's Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assyriology Track</head><p>Also known as the Near East or Middle East, Western Asia includes present-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and other neighboring states, a broad geographic area that was connected in antiquity with the wider worldthe Mediterranean, North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, and the Asian subcontinent. Students will be exposed to the critical study of the ancient cultures of this region (ca. 3400 B.C.E.-100 C.E.) using the tools of archaeology, epigraphy, and historical inquiry. A variety of interdisciplinary, comparative, and theoretical approaches will be introduced to give students the tools and methods to explore this region's ancient languages and literatures, political and socio-economic modes of organization, art and architecture, religious traditions and other systems of knowledge, such as early science.</p><p>The Assyriology (ASYR) track requires a total of at least ten (10) courses that are determined in the following way: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Egyptology Track</head><p>The Egyptology track requires a total of at least ten courses. Six of these must be taken by all concentrators, but the remaining four can be chosen from a fairly broad range of courses, to suit individual interests. Or an EGYT or ARCH course in material culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone</head><p>All concentrators in Egyptology and Assyriology are required to complete a capstone project. The project can take many forms, but the common feature shared among all possible projects will be a public presentation. Typically in the final semester before graduating, the concentrator will give this capstone presentation before faculty, fellow students, and other interested audiences. If the concentrator is writing an undergraduate honors thesis, the procedure for which is detailed below, this work should provide the content for the capstone presentation. Students not writing an honors thesis will base their presentation on a research project more in depth than a class project, though the topic may stem from a course project or paper. The format of the presentation may vary; suggestions range from an illustrated lecture to a video or an installation presented with discussion. Both the content and the format of the capstone project should be discussed with and agreed upon by the concentration advisor no later than the end of the first semester of the senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Egyptology and Assyriology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Becoming an honors candidate</head><p>Students who wish to consider pursuing honors should meet with the Undergraduate Concentration Advisor in the first half of their sixth semester. Eligibility is dependent on:</p><p>• Being in good standing • Having completed at least two thirds of the concentration requirements by the end of the sixth semester. • Having earned two-thirds "quality grades" in courses counted towards the concentration. A "quality grade" is defined as a grade of "A" or a grade of "S" accompanied by a course performance report indicating a performance at the "A" standard.</p><p>To pursue honors candidacy, eligible students must:</p><p>• Secure a faculty advisor and discuss plans for the proposed thesis project well before the established deadline; this can be done by email when a student is abroad. • Prepare a thesis prospectus (see below). • Submit the prospectus to the advisor, one other proposed faculty reader (at least one of the readers must be in the department) and the department chair no later than the first week of the seventh semester.</p><p>The structure of a thesis prospectus: An honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is a substantial piece of research with some degree of originality that demonstrates the student's ability to frame an appropriate question and deal critically with the range of original and secondary sources. A thesis prospectus is a short analytical document consisting of several parts. It will normally include a concise and focused research question; a justification for that question that demonstrates familiarity with previous research on the topic; a project description that includes a discussion of the types of evidence available and appropriate to answering the proposed question; a discussion of methods of collecting and analyzing that evidence; a conclusion that returns to the research question and assures the reader that the project will add value to our understanding of the topic; and a bibliography. The prospectus will ordinarily be in the range of 5-7 pages in length, exclusive of bibliography. The prospectus will include proper citations throughout.</p><p>Determination of whether or not a student may pursue the proposed project will be made on review of the prospectus by the readers and department chair. Prospectuses will be evaluated on the following scale:</p><p>1. No concerns about the viability of the project.</p><p>2. No concerns about the viability of the project, but minor weaknesses in the execution of the prospectus. 3. Concerns about the viability of the project, but willingness to reevaluate a revised prospectus submitted within two weeks of receipt of evaluation. 4. Reservations that the prospectus does not describe an honors-worthy project. 5. Poorly conceived and shoddy work.</p><p>Prospectuses will be returned to the student with this numerical evaluation and comments one week after submission of the prospectus. A prospectus must receive an evaluation of 1 or 2 prior to the third week of the seventh semester for a student to be admitted to the honors track. Students who submit an original prospectus that is graded 4 or 5 will not be permitted to rework the prospectus for the second submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Developing, completing and submitting the honors project</head><p>Once accepted as honors candidates, students will pursue a course of study that goes beyond what is expected of a regular concentrator. This includes:</p><p>• Enrollment in two semesters of independent study in Egyptology or Assyriology (these do not fulfill course requirements towards the concentration). • Twice-monthly meetings with the thesis advisor and once-monthly meetings with the second reader. These meetings will be scheduled at the beginning of each term. • Submission of a comprehensive outline to both readers no later than October 15 (for May graduates) • Regular submission of drafts. A partial draft including a complete version of at least one chapter or section is due before Reading Period of the seventh semester. • A complete draft is due to both readers no later than March 15 (for May graduates). • The revised final thesis is due in both electronic and physical form to both readers and department chair April 5 (for May graduates).</p><p>Failure to meet any deadline will result in automatic termination of the honors process. No extensions will be granted. If a thesis is turned in late but before the end of the term, credit and grade for the Independent Study may still be granted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evaluating the submitted work of honors candidates</head><p>In order to receive honors a student must be found to have:</p><p>• Remained in good academic standing throughout the academic year.</p><p>• Not violated the Academic Code of Conduct during honors candidacy.</p><p>• Complete or be about to complete all concentration requirements.</p><p>• Produced a thesis that is judged by the readers to meet the department's expectations for honors work (see below), and turned it in by the established deadlines. • Successfully defended the thesis during a half hour public presentation held during the final exam period of the eighth semester.</p><p>Students who submit theses that are deemed to fall short of the expectations will graduate without honors. In that case, the theses will count as a capstone project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Expectations for honors theses:</head><p>Originality: An honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is expected to add to existing scholarship. The thesis must be based on close work with primary sources (usually in publication rather than in person), supplemented by critical engagement with a substantial amount of relevant secondary literature. While the resulting study is not necessarily expected to be ground-breakingly original, and may engage with a well-studied topic, it will usually include a new insight into or interpretation of the material considered.</p><p>Scope: An honors thesis is not a book or dissertation. It is, however, a very serious piece of research and writing for which two dedicated study courses have provided substantial time to the honors student. The question upon which the honors thesis is based should be focused enough to allow an in-depth treatment, generally in under 100 pages or 30,000 words (exclusive of bibliography and illustrations). Appropriate length will vary considerably depending on the topic itself and the nature of the primary sources being considered, particularly if substantial translation of ancient textual sources is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Argument:</head><p>The thesis should present a sustained analytic argument in answer to its structuring question. A thesis should not be primarily descriptive or narrative in nature. Each chapter should contain a sub-argument that is clearly related to the overall argument of the thesis. The significance of the argument and its relationship to prior scholarship should be clearly articulated. Honors theses are not expected to demonstrate comprehensive familiarity with the secondary literature, but they are expected to engage critically and maturely with important works on the defined topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>Egyptology and Assyriology are very broad fields, and the appropriate methods will be determined in conjunction with the thesis advisor on the basis of the questions and types of evidence -textual, archaeological, art historical -under consideration. With very few exceptions the methodology of the thesis is expected to be conventional rather than innovative, rooted in the accepted practices of the field in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organization and writing:</head><p>An honors thesis must be well organized and written. It should include an introduction and conclusion as well as well-considered chapters that allow the reader to follow the line of reasoning easily. The relationship of any section to the larger whole should be clear, and segues should help the reader move between sections. Writing should be grammatically correct, well copy-edited, professional, and consistent. Citations and bibliography must be in an accepted style as determined in consultation with the advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineering</head><p>The concentration in Engineering equips students with a solid foundation for careers in engineering, to advance the knowledge base for future technologies, and to merge teaching, scholarship, and practice in the pursuit of solutions to human needs. The concentration offers one standard Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) program and eight Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree programs. Of these, the Sc.B. programs in biomedical, chemical, computer, electrical, materials, and mechanical engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (http:// www.abet.org). The Sc.B. degree program in environmental engineering is not currently accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, but will seek accreditation during the 2020-21 academic year. The engineering physics program is also offered, butis not accredited by ABET.</p><p>Other programs leading to the Sc.B. or A.B. degrees in Engineering may be designed in consultation with a faculty advisor. These programs must meet the general requirements for concentration programs in the School of Engineering. Students interested in an individualized program should consult with an Engineering faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and obtain the approval of the Engineering Concentration Committee. Engineering students with a particular interest in using their technical skills for the public benefit might also consider the Engaged Scholars Program (https://www.brown.edu/academics/engineering/undergraduate-study/ engaged-scholars-program).</p><p>Please note that all student concentration forms must be approved by the Engineering Concentration Committee, which reviews them for compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics</head><p>Mathematics 0190, 0200 is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. Students who would prefer a more introductory </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>Students who have taken Advanced Placement courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through advanced placement examinations are often able to start at a higher level than suggested by the standard programs below. However, please note that Advanced Placement credit cannot be used to satisfy any concentration requirements. For example, our Sc.B. programs specify that students must take 4 semesters of math while enrolled here at Brown, beginning with MATH 0190 or MATH 0170. If a student comes in with advanced placement credit (e.g. placing out of MATH 0190 or MATH 0200), he/she is strongly recommended to take a higher level math course as a replacement. Examples of such courses are MATH 0520 (Linear Algebra), MATH 1260 (Complex Analysis), MATH 1610 (Probability), MATH 1620 (Statistics), APMA 1170 (Numerical Analysis), APMA 1210 (Operations Research), or APMA 1650 (Statistical Inference). However, the student with advanced placement credit for MATH 0190 orMATH 0200 also has the option of replacing the math course with an advanced-level science course, subject to the approval of the concentration advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the "Study Elsewhere" section of the University Bulletin for procedures, or contact the Dean of the College.) Transfer courses that are used to meet Engineering concentration requirements must be approved by the student's concentration advisor, and must be described briefly on the student's electronic concentration form. Transfer courses that are determined by the concentration advisor to be substantially equivalent to a required Brown course automatically fulfill concentration requirements. In rare cases, students may petition the concentration committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student's overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their concentration advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substitutions for Required Courses</head><p>A student may petition the Concentration Adviser to substitute a course in place of a requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration, and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Adviser. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Adviser for assistance with drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee, which may be approved by a majority vote.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Program for the A.B. degree:</head><p>Candidates for the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree with a concentration in Engineering must complete at least eight approved Engineering courses. The eight courses must include at least two 1000-level Engineering courses. Of these 1000-level courses, one must be a design or independent study course and the other an in-classroom experience. The set of Engineering courses must be chosen with careful attention to the prerequisites of the 1000-level courses. Please note that this A.B. degree program is not accredited by ABET.</p><p>Not all engineering courses may be used to satisfy the engineering course requirement for the A.B. degree. For example, the following courses cannot be used to satisfy the engineering course requirement for the A.B. degree: ENGN 0020, ENGN 0090, ENGN 0900, ENGN 0930A, ENGN 0930C, ENGN 1010. Therefore, the program of study must be developed through consultation with the concentration advisor.</p><p>The A.B. program also requires preparation in Mathematics equivalent to MATH 0200 and APMA 0330, as well as at least one college-level science course from the general areas of chemistry, life sciences, physics, or geological sciences. Remedial courses, such as CHEM 0100, cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. A programming course is also recommended, but not required. The entire program is subject to approval by an Engineering Concentration Advisor and the Chair of the Engineering Concentration Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard programs for the Sc.B. degree</head><p>All Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) program tracks build upon a common core of engineering knowledge and skills applicable across all engineering disciplines. The goal of this engineering core curriculum is to prepared to practice engineering in an age of rapidly changing technology. Twothirds of this four-year program consists of a core of basic mathematics, physical sciences and engineering sciences common to all branches of engineering, including a thorough grounding in programming and technical problem solving. This core provides our graduates with the basis of theory, design, and analysis that will enable them to adapt to whatever may come along during their careers.</p><p>At the same time, the core courses assist students in making informed choices in determining their areas of specialization, at the end of their sophomore year. To this end, first-year students are given an introduction to engineering -featuring case studies from different disciplines in engineering as well as guest speakers from industry. This aspect of the program is different from that at many other schools where students are expected to select a specific branch of engineering much earlier in their academic program.</p><p>In addition, all Sc.B. programs in Engineering must be complemented by at least four courses in humanities and social sciences.The minimum four-course humanities and social sciences requirement for the Sc.B. in Engineering cannot be met by advanced placement credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Concentrations</head><p>In addition to the standard programs described above, students may also petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to pursue a special engineering Sc.B. degree of their own design. Such special Sc.B. programs are not ABET-accredited. Students with a special concentration will receive an Sc.B. degree in engineering, but a specific area of specialization will not be noted on their transcript. A special Sc.B. concentration is intended to prepare graduates for advanced study in engineering or for professional practice, but in an area that is not covered by one of the existing Sc.B. programs. Accordingly, special concentration programs are expected to consist of a coherent set of courses with breadth, depth and rigor comparable to an accredited degree. A total of 21 engineering, mathematics, and basic science courses are required. The program must include at least 3 courses in mathematics, at least 2 courses in physical or life sciences; and at least 12 courses in engineering. At least five of the engineering courses must be upper level courses, and one must be a capstone design course or independent study, which must be advised or co-advised by a member of the regular engineering faculty. Note that not all engineering courses may be used to meet Sc.B. requirements: for example, the courses not allowed to count toward the A.B., will not qualify. Petitions should be prepared in consultation with an engineering faculty adviser, who will submit the petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Petitions must include: (i) a statement of the objectives of the degree program, and an explanation of how the courses in the program meet these objectives; (ii) course descriptions for any courses in the program that are not part of standard ScB engineering concentrations; (iii) a detailed description of any independent study courses used for concentration credit, signed by the faculty adviser for this course; and (iv) an up-to-date internal transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Tracks</head><p>While we do not give course credit for internships, we officially recognize their importance via the optional Professional Tracks. The requirements for the professional tracks include all those of the standard tracks, as well as the following: Students must complete two full-time professional experiences, lasting two to four months each (or two part-time experiences of equivalent total effort), doing work that is related to their concentration programs. Such work is normally done within an industrial organization, but may also be done at a university under the supervision of a faculty member. For the work to be considered related to a concentration program, the job responsibilities must make use of the material from one or more courses of the concentration (regardless of whether the student has taken those courses or not at the time of the internship). On completion of each professional experience, the student must write and upload to ASK a reflective essay about the experience addressing the following prompts:</p><p>• Describe the organization you worked in and the nature of your responsibilities.</p><p>• Which courses were put to use in your work? Which topics, in particular, were important?</p><p>• In retrospect, which courses should you have taken before embarking on your work experience?</p><p>• What are the topics from these courses that would have helped you if you had been more familiar with them?</p><p>• What topics would have been helpful in preparation for this work experience that you did not learn at Brown?</p><p>• What did you learn from the experience that probably could not have been picked up from course work?</p><p>• Is the sort of work you did something you would like to continue doing once you graduate? Explain.</p><p>• Would you recommend your work experience to other Brown students? Explain.</p><p>The reflective essays are subject to the approval of the student's concentration adviser.</p><p>Entry to the Professional Track requires a simple application form to be completed by the student and approved by the Concentration Advisor at the time of the concentration declaration. If the student has not yet declared a concentration, the form may be approved by the Chair of the Concentration Committee. The Concentration Advisor will certify that all Professional Track students have completed the necessary internships and will grant approval for the associated reflective essays. All other requirements remain identical to those in the standard tracks in the concentrations.</p></div>

The education objectives of the Chemical Engineering program are to prepare graduates:</p><p>(1) to pursue productive scientific and technical careers, beginning with entry-level engineering positions in industry, or graduate study in chemical engineering or related fields; or to successfully pursue other careers that benefit from the analytical or quantitative skills acquired through the Brown ChE Program;</p><p>(2) to effectively apply the principles of chemical engineering, problem-solving skills, and critical and independent thinking, to a broad range of complex, multidisciplinary technological and societal problems;</p><p>(3) to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to professionals and audiences of diverse backgrounds, and to pursue technical approaches and innovations that address the needs of society in an ethical, safe, sustainable, and environmentally responsible manner. The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1)-(7) Student Outcomes as defined by the "ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs" (available online at http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteriapolicies-documents/). Subject to approval by the concentration advisor, an independent study course <ref type="bibr">(ENGN 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">/ ENGN 1971</ref> may be used to fulfill the Engineering Capstone Design requirement. To qualify for such approval, the independent study project must: (1) contain a significant and definable design component;</p><p>(2) be based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work, (3) incorporate appropriate engineering standards; and (4) address multiple realistic constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Engineering Track:</head><p>Brown's Environmental Engineering program was launched in 2013. The first graduates completed the program with the Sc.B. degree in Environmental Engineering in Spring 2017. The program has graduated Sc.B. degree recipients every year since then. The program will seek accreditation from the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET during Brown's upcoming review period in 2020-2021 when the rest of the School of Engineering's existing accredited programs will be reviewed. The education objectives of the program are: (1) to prepare students to pursue scientific or technical careers, starting with entry-level positions in industry, or in graduate study in environmental engineering;</p><p>(2) to develop their ability to solve problems related to environmental pollution, protection, and sustainability. The student outcomes of this program are intended to be those enumerated in items (1) -(7) Student Outcomes as defined by the "ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs" (available online at http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteriapolicies-documents/). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials Engineering Track:</head><p>The Materials Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The education objectives of the Materials Engineering program are to prepare graduates:</p><p>(1) to pursue multidisciplinary scientific and technical careers beginning with entry-level engineering positions in industry or graduate study in materials science and engineering and related fields;</p><p>(2) to apply an engineering problem-solving approach combined with a broad appreciation for the liberal arts to inform and develop their understanding of current societal needs and values to achieve leadership positions in their chosen fields of endeavor. The student outcomes of this program are the (1) -(7) Student Outcomes as defined by the "ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs" (available online at http://www.abet.org/ accreditation-criteria-policies-documents/). We offer a wide array of courses in poetry, drama, fiction, creative nonfiction, film, digital media, and theory. All our courses emphasize the development of student skills in writing, textual analysis, and argument. The department's faculty members are deeply committed to undergraduate teaching and advising. You will find considerable diversity in our critical methods, including cross-disciplinary approaches that relate the study of literature to history, politics, science, as well as to other art forms. We encourage students in our classes likewise to forge their own new ways of understanding literature and culture.</p><p>In addition to the standard English concentration, we offer an English concentration track in the practice of Nonfiction Writing. The concentration in English and the English/Nonfiction track follow the same core requirements, and students in the English concentration may elect Nonfiction Writing courses as electives. We invite applications from qualified juniors to the honors programs in both English and Nonfiction.</p><p>One of the largest humanities concentrations at Brown, English provides a strong foundation for a liberal education and for employment in many sectors, especially those that centrally involve writing and working with texts (in any form). In addition to authorship, scholarship, and teaching, these include: journalism, publishing, advertising, visual media, consulting, public relations, public service, finance, government, corporate research, and administration. Our English concentrators routinely go on to law, medical, and professional schools as well as to graduate education in literature and the arts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the Concentration</head><p>We encourage students interested in concentrating in English to come into the department offices at 70 Brown Street and speak with a concentration advisor. Students in English courses who are considering an English concentration are welcome to make an appointment to speak with their instructor. Concentration programs must be approved by a concentration advisor. To declare a concentration, students must fill out an online Concentration form via ASK and enter their plan of study indicating the requirements that each course fulfills. 1 These courses, which center on Medieval and Renaissance literary works, cast light on periods that can come across to us as both familiar and strange. They focus our attention on how literatures from these periods depict concepts such as aesthetics, romance, gender, sexuality, race, power and politics in ways that are like and unlike how we tend to think of them today-on how pre-modern or early modern works can both defamiliarize the categories of experience and identity we tend to take for granted and also suggest something of their origins. Several courses under this rubric will also engage with recent literary and filmic adaptations of works from these eras, exploring how many such works continue to function as vibrant and at times ambivalent inspirations for the literary imaginings of later periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentration Requirements (10 courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">ONE course in Literatures of Modernity (Post-1700):</head><p>1 These courses explore the many strands of writing in English that have emerged from the eighteenth century through the present, shaping the contemporary world. These literatures reflect on political, economic, and intellectual history, from the idea of the nation and the structures of capital through the rise and dissolution of empire and the emergence of postcolonial states, including the forms of race, gender and sexuality that cut across them. Courses also examine how aesthetic works can shape and critique their moment: they look at genres like the novel and short story, poetry, drama, essays, and new, hybrid forms that have arisen with expanding digital media; they also take up a multitude of literary movements whose influences remain with us today, including <ref type="bibr">Romanticism,</ref><ref type="bibr">realism,</ref><ref type="bibr">naturalism,</ref><ref type="bibr">modernism,</ref>. ONE course in Literatures of the Color Line: 1 In 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois famously proclaimed in "The Souls of Black Folk" that "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,-the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea." Courses in this category explore the complex ways in which literary texts have addressed American histories of race, ethnicity, and empire. They may do so from the vantage point of ideas about difference and hierarchy that predate the modern conception of race and by engaging with earlier histories of conflict and contact. These courses explore issues of intersectionality as well, highlighting how race operates in relation to other structures of difference such as gender, sexuality and class. The late-twentieth century saw a revolution in the field of literary studies in the United States, as critics turned their attention to the contextual and historical nature of our categories of knowledge. This turn to theory was influenced by developments in psychoanalysis, linguistics, philosophy, political theory and sociology and by the emergence of social movements that challenged such structures as patriarchy, homophobia, racism, imperialism, economic inequality, and environmental violence. The avenues of inquiry opened up brought an increased awareness of the implication of literature in the operations of power and ideology; a sense of the potential for literary modes of presentation to challenge and displace such operations; and a new attention to the role of gender, race, empire, class, and sexuality in the formation of the literary work. Courses that satisfy the Literary Theory and Cultural Critique requirement explore some dimension of these issues -either directly, taking as their primary focus a set of theoretical questions or debates, or indirectly, by examining a compelling topical question of social and political significance through works of literature and literary theory. 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in English</head><p>The English Honors program is intended for students who have been highly successful in their English concentration coursework and who want the opportunity to pursue a research project in more depth than is possible in an undergraduate seminar. The program is intended for those students with a strong desire to conduct independent research under the supervision of a thesis advisor and culminates in the writing of a thesis during the senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>Students apply to the Honors Program early in the second semester of their junior year. December or mid-year graduates may apply in their 6th semester, but are encouraged to apply during their 5th semester and write their theses alongside May graduates. Interested concentrators should speak to the Honors Advisor early in their junior year to discuss their plans. Specific deadlines for admission are announced annually and are available on the department website. Students who are studying off campus are expected to meet the application submission deadline.</p><p>Admission to the English Honors Program depends on evidence of ability and promise in the study of literature. To be eligible for admission, students must have received more As than Bs (and no Cs or below) in concentration courses completed. Students must complete an application; supply a brief writing sample, and request two letters of recommendation from English faculty with whom they have taken courses. If necessary, letters may come from faculty in related departments. Letters from teaching assistants may only serve as supporting recommendations. Candidates must also submit a one-page project proposal signed by the faculty member who has agreed to serve as the thesis advisor.</p><p>See procedures and application (http://brown.edu/academics/english/ english-honors-procedures) for more details.</p><p>December or mid-year graduates who wish to apply to honors have two options, but the first is highly encouraged:</p><p>Option 1:</p><p>In their 5th semester (Spring), students apply to the honors program along with the other juniors. Accepted students will be incorporated into the regular honors cohort and must meet the same deadlines: i.e. they must complete their theses at the same time as the other honors students (though for mid-years this will be at the end of their 7th semester). They register for ENGL 1991 English Honors Seminar in the Fall, and ENGL 1992 Senior Honors Thesis in the Spring.</p><p>Option 2:</p><p>In the 7th semester (the Spring of their final year), students take an independent study with their thesis advisor, under whose direction they will begin to research and write their theses. This course must be taken S/NC. In the 8th semester (the Fall of their final year), as they complete their theses, students take ENGL 1992 for a grade. Mid-year graduates should consult with the Honors Director for information about deadlines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>The course requirements for the English Honors Program are the same as those for the regular concentration, with the following additions:</p><p>As part of regular coursework, and counting toward the concentration requirements, honors candidates must complete at least three upperlevel seminars or comparable small courses in which students have the opportunity to do independent research, take significant responsibility for discussion, and do extensive scholarly and critical writing. Students are encouraged to include at least one graduate seminar in their program.</p><p>(Permission to take a graduate course must be obtained from the instructor.) Honors candidates should discuss their proposed course of study with the Honors Advisor.</p><p>During the Fall and Spring of the senior year, honors candidates must complete two additional courses beyond the ten courses required by the regular concentration: ENGL 1991 and ENGL 1992. ENGL 1991 is the Senior Honors Seminar, in which students begin to research and write their theses, as well as meet to discuss their work. This is a mandatory S/NC course. ENGL 1992, the Senior Honors Thesis is an independent research course that must be taken for a grade.</p><p>Honors candidates must continue to receive more As than Bs in courses taken as part of the concentration. Courses completed with a grade of C will not count toward an Honors concentration. A student who receives such a grade and wishes to continue in the program must complete a comparable course with a grade higher than C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Thesis</head><p>The Honors thesis is an extended essay, usually between 50 and 80 pages, written under the supervision of a department faculty advisor and second reader. (Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both, may be in another department.) The thesis may be an interdisciplinary or creative project, but it is usually an essay on a scholarly or critical problem dealing with works of literature in English. The specific topic and approach of the thesis are worked out between the student and the thesis advisor, with assistance from the student's second reader. This process should begin in the latter part of the student's junior year. A good way to get an idea of what sorts of projects are possible is to visit the Hay Library, which stores theses from previous years, or to meet with the Honors Advisor.</p><p>A prospectus describing the project and endorsed by the faculty advisor must be submitted to the Honors Advisor at the beginning of the senior year. At the end of the senior year fall term, a student must submit approximately 25 pages of draft material toward the thesis. Full thesis drafts are due by mid-March; final bound copies of the thesis are due in mid-April. Late theses will not be accepted for honors after the April deadline; students who hand in theses after the deadline but before the end of the term will receive a grade for the thesis course, but they will not be eligible for departmental honors. The completed thesis will be evaluated by the student's advisor and a second reader, each of whom provides written commentary and suggests a grade for ENGL 1992.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation</head><p>The English Department reviews the academic record as well as the thesis evaluations for each senior completing the Honors Program.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Studies</head><p>Many of the most pressing challenges of the 21st Century are environmental ones. We must find ways to feed a growing human population while maintaining the natural life support system provided by the Earth's ecosystems; to make built environments more efficient as urban areas continue to grow dramatically in size; and to meet the challenges posed by rising sea-level and increasing global temperatures. These challenges are complex, multifaceted and can best be solved with expertise from multiple, relevant disciplines. To prepare students to meet these challenges, the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society (IBES) offers two undergraduate degrees: an A.B. in Environmental Studies and a Sc.B. in Environmental Science. The two degrees vary primarily in the number of course requirements; the Sc.B. is a more indepth treatment of a single field. Both degrees provide interdisciplinary exposure to the natural and social sciences, as well as public policy. Both degrees also develop depth in a primary field by requiring students to select one of five tracks of study. Concentrators might also consider pursuing the Engaged Scholars Program, which allows them to connect theory and practice and gain hands-on experience working with community partners.</p><p>Through a rigorous set of core courses, track requirements, and a course or project-based capstone experience, our students are primed to make meaningful contributions to environmental scholarship and outreach at local, national and global scales.</p><p>If you have administrative questions regarding theses concentrations or wish to be added to the email directory listing upcoming events, then please contact Jeanne Loewenstein (jeanne_loewenstein@brown.edu), the academic program manager.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethnic Studies</head><p>Ethnic Studies is an interdisciplinary, comparative concentration that examines the construction of race and ethnicity in social, cultural, historical, political, and economic contexts. Concentrators develop individual programs based on areas of focus in consultation with faculty advisors, drawing from courses in the humanities and social sciences. Typical areas of focus are social issues (such as inequality, education, or health), cultural production and the representation of racial groups, processes of racialization, the historical formation of transnational communities and of diaspora, and the history of particular ethnic or racial groups.</p><p>The Ethnic Studies concentration (https://www.brown.edu/academics/ american-studies/ethnic-studies) at Brown emphasizes the histories of diverse racial groups within and across the borders of the United States, including examining issues of diaspora, migration, social movements, and the political economies of social inequality and racial formation. Concentrators strive for intellectual fluency in a range of critical approaches to race and ethnicity across disciplines, and demonstrate this fluency through the composition or creation of a significant piece of original research or creative work. As an academic field, Ethnic Studies is rooted in the protests of the 1960s and 1970s, out which emerged the very first Latino/a Studies, Asian American Studies, African American Studies, and Native American studies programs. Organized around straightforward political goals -the enrichment through diversification of the curriculum and the systematic, multi-disciplinary, and the often comparative study of racial and ethnic inequality -Ethnic Studies has become an important feature of major research universities.</p><p>Faculty, both core and affiliated, create and participate in groundbreaking Ethnic Studies scholarship. Areas of faculty research include borderlands history, Latina/o literary studies and visual culture, indigenous movements, migration and African American cultural studies as well as the intersecting fields of gender and sexuality, queer theory and critical race theory. Students can focus their study on specific populations (e.r. Latina/os, Asian Americans) and choose a thematic interest including such current examples as : "social issued affecting radicalized groups" (students have looked at health disparities or educational inequality); "the study of cultural production or cultural representations;" "the theory of a particular racial or ethnic group;" and " the study of comparative processes of radicalization." Courses taken toward the fulfillment of concentration requirements must be at or above the 1000 level. At the advisor's discretion, a student may count a single course below the 1000 level towards their requirements. This class must be taught by a core faculty member listed on the department's website and may be offered through another department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors:</head><p>Admittance to the Ethnic Studies Honors and a likely second reader (who will need to confirm their participation at the beginning of your 7th semester). If a student wants to work with two professors, neither of whom is Ethnic Studies faculty, then they should have a third reader who will read the final draft or consult on the final project and approve it for honors in the field. Students deciding not to do an honors thesis after completing the Honors Seminar will receive credit for the course and still be able to count it as a seminar in the concentration.</p><p>Concentrators studying abroad during the second semester of the junior year, when the Honors Seminar is offered, may waive the Honors Seminar with permission of the DUS prior to the beginning of the senior year. Such a waiver of the Honors Seminar will be predicated on the submission of a detailed plan for the honors project approved by a faculty director with a confirmed second reader submitted to the DUS in the first two weeks of the senior year.</p><p>An updated thesis proposal, confirming a second thesis reader, will be due for all thesis writers within the first the first two weeks of the senior year.</p><p>In their seventh and eight semesters, students seeking honors will enroll in an independent study class <ref type="bibr">(ETHN 1910)</ref> with their director during which they will follow through on the plan devised in the spring of their junior year. Students and thesis directors should plan on at least a monthly meeting to discuss the research, writing and revision of sections of the thesis. In addition to meeting with their director, students should also plan to meet their second reader during this time. Guidelines for thesis directors and readers can be found here (https://www.brown.edu/academics/ american-studies/american-studies-honors-thesis-directors-and-readers).</p><p>In their eighth semester, the deadline for a finished full draft of their project is the third Friday in April (for May graduates) or the first Monday in December (for December graduates). Students should turn in a pdf of a completed (proofread, formatted, fully written) draft to their readers by that day.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender and Sexuality Studies</head><p>Gender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary concentration that examines the construction of gender and sexuality in social, cultural, political, economic, or scientific contexts. Each concentrator focuses on a well-defined topic or question and works closely with a concentration advisor to develop a program that investigates this focus area rigorously and supplements it with foundational courses in the relevant disciplines. Typical areas of focus include the acculturation of gender, sexuality and race in American politics or activism, the construction of sexual and gendered identities in educational institutions or in various forms of visual media, a contrast between different cultural understandings of sexual identity, a particular national literature and history. Such topics will frequently bring questions of gender and sexuality together; however students may also organize their concentrations to emphasize questions specifically related to gender or to sexuality. Introductory and methodology courses in the disciplines appropriate to students' focus will help them understand the principles grounding such practices as historical research, literary interpretation, and sociological analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>German Studies</head><p>German Studies exposes students to the language, literature, and culture of the German speaking areas of Central Europe. Concentrators combine intensive study of the German language with interdisciplinary studies by complementing courses from the German Studies core program with courses from other departments that deal with topics from the German cultural tradition. The quest for national identity that dominated German history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been augmented by contemporary Germany's efforts to come to terms with its past and create new ways of dealing with diversity. Our curriculum therefore looks back at the German literary, cultural, and historical tradition, examining figures from Goethe or Christa Wolf to Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, alongside the "texts" of contemporary German media, including television, film, and music. Most concentrators study abroad for one or two semesters. *In spring 2017, Professor Jane Sokolosky will serve as concentration advisor. Professor Kristina Mendicino will return as concentration advisor in fall 2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard program for the A.B. degree</head><p>Many students elect to complete a double concentration, combining German Studies with one of the above areas, or with fields such as International Relations or Economics, Comparative Literature or History of Art and Architecture.</p><p>Knowledge of the German language is not required for declaring a concentration in German Studies.

In our society, knowing Spanish is not just an asset; it is increasingly a necessity. The Spanish language program offers a sequence of courses ranging from basic to advanced. Students at all levels develop proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and writing while also studying the cultures and societies of the contemporary Spanish-speaking world. The Hispanic Literatures and Culture concentration enables students to develop advanced Spanish skills while acquiring a solid background in the complex history, literature, cultures, and intellectual traditions of Spain, Latin America, and the Latinx-U.S. The department offers a variety of courses on topics related to literary history and theory; multicultural contact; linguistics and the history of the language; visual culture, film, and performance studies. Interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of the department, and students in this concentration are encouraged to broaden their perspectives by taking relevant courses in other departments. Most choose to strengthen their academic preparation by participating in a study abroad program in Spain or Latin America and by engaging with Latin American and Latinx communities in the United States.</p><p>The concentration requires a minimum of ten courses. 700-level courses provide fundamental tools for critical analysis and opportunities for developing advanced skills in the Spanish language. In courses at the 1000 level, students explore particular authors, genres, periods, or special topics and continue to hone their skills in literary and cultural analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Thesis or Project</head><p>Students with an excellent record in their Hispanic Studies courses will be eligible to write an Honors Thesis or write and produce an Honors Project.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field of focus:</head><p>In History, concentrators choose or create their own "track," rather than having to select an existing track. The field of focus must include a minimum of four courses, and it may be: geographical (such as Latin America); geographical and chronological (such as Modern North America); or transnational (such as ancient world); or thematic (such as urban history). Students who choose North America or Europe must also choose a chronological focus (i.e. Early Modern Europe. Fields in Latin America, Africa, East Asia, or Middle East/South Asia do not require a chronological definition. All students should consult a concentration advisor early in the process about their potential field of focus. All fields are subject to approval by the concentration advisor. Chronological Distribution: All concentrators must complete at least two courses designated as "P" (for pre-modern).</p><p>For a listing of which courses count as "P" courses click here Capstone Seminar: All concentrators must complete at least one capstone seminar (HIST 1960s and HIST 1970s series and select HIST 1980s courses). These seminars are designed to serve as an intellectual culmination of the concentration. They provide students with an opportunity to delve deeply into a historical problem and to write a major research and/or analytical paper which serves as a capstone experience.</p><p>Ideally, they will be taken in the field of focus and during the student's junior or senior year.

Students may apply two courses taken in other departments/programs at Brown to the ten-course minimum for the History concentration. Students who spend one semester at another institution may apply to their concentration a maximum of two courses from other departments or institutions, and those who spend more than one semester at another institution may apply to their concentration a third course transferred from another institution.</p><p>Students wishing to apply such courses must present to their concentration advisor justification that those courses complement some aspect of their concentration. Courses from other Brown departments may not be applied toward the chronological distribution requirement. History courses taught by trained historians from other institutions (e.g., from study abroad or a previous institution) may be applied toward the chronological distribution requirement so long as at least 2/3 of the course content examine the "premodern" or "early modern" periods.</p><p>It is normally expected that students will have declared their intention to concentrate in History and have their concentration programs approved before undertaking study elsewhere. Students taking courses in Brownrun programs abroad automatically receive University transfer credit, but concentration credit is granted only with the approval of a concentration advisor.

In the Fall, students will meet regularly with the whole Honors group and HIAA faculty to discuss methodology and general research and writing questions. In the Spring, students will continue to meet to present their research in progress to each other for comment and feedback. They will also be meeting regularly with their advisors and second readers throughout the year. Finished drafts of the thesis (which will generally be no more than 30-35 pages in length (exceptions to be determined in consultation with the instructor), not counting bibliography and visual materials) will be due to the advisor and second reader on April 1 of the Spring semester. Comments will be returned to the students for final corrections at that point. There will be a public presentation of the Honors work at the end of the Spring semester.</p><p>Students wishing to write an honors thesis should have an 'A' average in the concentration. It is advisable for them to have taken at least one seminar in the department and written a research paper before choosing to undertake a thesis. While acceptance into the Honors program depends on the persuasiveness of the thesis topic as well as the number of students applying, students may refine their proposals by speaking in advance with potential advisors. No honors student may take more than four courses either semester of their senior year-with the honors seminar being considered one of the four courses. Students interested in honors who are expecting to graduate in the middle of the year should contact the concentration advisor no later than the beginning of their junior year.</p></div>

To be admitted to the Honors Program you should have produced consistently excellent work and maintained a high level of achievement in all your concentration course. You should have earned an A grade in most of your concentration courses. 2. The key project for honors is to write an honors thesis. When you apply for admission you will be asked to submit a proposal of no more than two double-spaced pages that states the topic (subject and argument) of the research to be undertaken as clearly as possible, and add a one-page bibliography of the most relevant books and major articles to be consulted for the project. This three page application should be submitted, along with a resumé and a printout of the student's most recent available transcript and submitted to the Department with a short cover letter stating who you feel the most appropriate advisor and second readers are for the thesis and why, and what your preparation is for this project. Clarity and brevity are considered persuasive virtues in this process. Applicants will be notified about the success of their applications at the end of the semester. 3. For admission to the Honor Program you must include with your proposal a letter of support from a faculty member of the History of Art and Architecture Department who has agreed to serve as your thesis advisor. You should discuss the thesis topic with your advisor before you submit your proposal. During the process of researching and writing you will meet regularly with your advisor to discuss your work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone Experiences in Italian Studies</head><p>A Capstone experiences in Italian Studies would consist of a course or project that a student, in consultation with the undergraduate advisor, feels would integrate the various intellectual engagements of this interdisciplinary concentration, and constitute a culminating experience in Italian Studies at Brown. Such experiences are strongly encouraged, and should be arrived at through conversations with the concentration advisor or a professor in the department. This could include the Brown Program in Bologna, typically taken in the Junior year, and/or the honors thesis in the senior year. However, students may also apply early in the Fall or Spring semester of their senior year for permission to designate one of their courses (1000-level or above) a Capstone course. In consultation with the professor, students in Capstone courses complete an independent research, writing, or multimedia project that is well beyond the required assignment for the course. ITAL 1920 (Independent Study) may also be designated a Capstone course with the permission of the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Judaic Studies</head><p>Jews have lived and flourished over thousands of years in a variety of social contexts, stretching from the Land of Israel and the eastern Mediterranean to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Concentrators will have the opportunity to study Jews in these contexts, getting to know their social structures, and what they have created. The subjects of study cover an astonishing range, including history and society, Jewish law and philosophy, and Jewish literature and ritual. Students will learn to unlock this wealth in both the ancient and the modern worlds through a number of academic disciplines -History, Religious Studies, and Literature. These also provide tools for studying and analyzing human societies and cultures in general, for which Jewish experiences provide an important perspective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Coursework</head><p>A concentration in Judaic Studies includes the following requirements:</p><p>1) All students are required to take a total of ten courses.</p><p>2) All students must take one full year of Hebrew (two of the ten required courses). Generally, this requirement will consist of two courses in Elementary Hebrew (HEBR 0100/HEBR 0200) or the equivalent as determined by a proficiency examination. Fulfillment of the Hebrew requirement through examination does not reduce the requirement to take ten courses for the concentration.</p><p>Students choosing to continue with Hebrew language study may apply up to two additional Hebrew language courses (HEBR 0300, HEBR 0400, or HEBR 0500) to the additional four required courses for the concentration.</p><p>3) Upon declaring a concentration in Judaic studies, each student must define his or her primary disciplinary track (History, Religious Studies, or Language/Literature). Concentrators will then be assigned a faculty mentor in that discipline (within the JS faculty) to help the students select courses and construct a coherent concentration plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4)</head><p>Of the courses required in the Program in Judaic Studies, at least one should focus on the ancient period and one should focus on the modern period.</p><p>5) Each student, in discussion with his/her mentor, is required to designate an advanced course (1000 level) in his/her senior year either within the Judaic Studies program or in the corresponding disciplinary department as the capstone for his/her concentration. Within the frame of this capstone course, the concentrator will write a final paper on a topic in Judaic Studies that displays in an appropriate way the theoretical and interpretive issues of the concentration focus. If students opt to fulfill this requirement in a course outside the Program in Judaic Studies, the student must get permission in advance both from his/her mentor and from the professor of the course in question since the student's final project will address a Judaic studies topic or theme. 6) Double concentrators may count up to two courses that deal with Jewish history, culture, or practice that they have used to complete their concentration requirements in another department towards their concentration in Judaic Studies.</p><p>The following are required for the completion of each track:</p></div>

One further course in Judaic Studies with a disciplinary focus upon Literature. 4. Two additional courses in the disciplinary focus, at least one of which must be outside the Program in Judaic Studies in a department of shared disciplinary focus (e.g. English or Comparative Literature). 5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad:</head><p>Students who study at other institutions, either in the United States or abroad, may apply a maximum of four courses (two topical and two language courses) to the concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Program</head><p>Any student who wishes to engage more deeply in research related to Judaic Studies in any of its disciplines or branches is invited to consider writing an Honors Thesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Thesis</head><p>The goal of the thesis is to add to the existing scholarship in the field of Judaic Studies. It should be based on original research, involving the close reading of primary sources. The honors thesis is expected to present an argument based on the student's own analysis and will engage an ongoing debate or discussion in the field, demonstrating an awareness of the major research done until now and clearly identifying its own contribution, however limited. Since it is the equivalent of two semesterlong courses, it should be a substantial piece of work (typically between 35,000-55,000 words) containing a sustained and consistently supported argument. To be successful, the student needs to adopt both a critical research methodology and a logical research strategy, both of which should be discussed in the thesis itself. In addition to being assessed in all these aspects, the thesis will also be graded on its organization (the way in which it is structured into separate and clearly defined chapters to support the main argument) as well as the quality and precision of its writing.</p><p>Work that simply describes and summarizes its sources along with previous research is not acceptable. The goal here is original research and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entering the Program</head><p>For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>In order to be considered a candidate for Honors, students will be expected to have maintained an outstanding record (at least A in Judaic Studies courses. The Honors thesis, which fulfills the capstone requirement, will normally be written as a two-semester individual study project <ref type="bibr">(numbered JUDS 1975</ref><ref type="bibr">/JUDS 1976</ref> during the senior year.</p><p>A student contemplating a thesis should approach the faculty member with whom he or she hopes to work during the sixth semester. Once he or she has agreed to be the advisor (or helped find another member of the program better suited to the project), the student begins a process of consultation in order to determine a topic for the thesis, its sources, and proposed methodology. The contours of the project should also be laid out so that the student can commence productive research at the very beginning of the seventh semester. After this, a second reader for the thesis should be chosen by the advisor in consultation with the student.</p><p>This may be a faculty member of the Judaic Studies program, one of the affiliate faculty, or, should the topic require it, a member of a different department. By the last week of the semester, the student should submit a thesis information form detailing the thesis topic with a short description of the proposed project, countersigned by advisor and second reader.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis Proposal</head><p>During the first three weeks of the seventh semester, the student should work with the faculty advisor to write a thesis proposal.</p><p>This should be a brief document (1,500-2,000 words) explaining the topic chosen for the thesis and its significance to the field of Judaic Studies, with reference to previous research on the subject. The proposal should detail the questions to be asked and the kind of argument that will be made as well as explaining the primary sources and research methodology that will be employed. The proposed research strategy (i.e. the stages by which research and writing will be done) and timetable should be appended together with a brief, one page bibliography of primary sources and major research to be consulted.</p><p>Once the advisor is satisfied with the proposal, the student will be considered fully accepted into the Honors program and can enroll in the required independent study course by the last day to add a course in the fourth week of the term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research and Writing</head><p>It is the responsibility of the student to carry out the research program outlined in the proposal, as well as to write the thesis in an organized and timely fashion. During the process of research and writing, the advisor will continue to work closely with the student, providing guidance on research methods and suggesting further secondary reading. A regular meeting schedule will be set up to help the student meet the short-and long-term deadlines he or she has set. The advisor will also evaluate the progress of the research, providing any necessary direction and detailed feedback on written drafts.</p><p>The second reader will also be available to provide a measure of input and guidance during the process of research and writing. This may be particularly important in those areas where the primary advisor has limited expertise. The second reader may also be willing to help with giving feedback on various sections of the thesis drafts. All these roles should be determine by a process of consultation involving the advisor, the student, and the second reader him/herself. The final thesis should have a complete scientific apparatus -citations and a full bibliography -in a form determined by the advisor.</p><p>It should be submitted no later than April 15 for May graduates and November 15 for December completers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment</head><p>The thesis will be assessed independently by the advisor and the second reader in written reports. In order to receive Honors, it should be deemed excellent according to the following standards: The two reports will be circulated to all faculty members in the program, who will review them before making the final determination at the next faculty meeting whether the thesis merits Honors. The meeting must be held, the decision reached, and the candidate informed before the Registrar's deadline for that semester.</p></div>

While human languages</p><p>For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>can differ greatly in certain respects, all are intricate, complex, rulegoverned systems. Linguistics is the scientific study of these systems, their use in communicative and other social settings, and their cognitive and neural underpinnings. The linguistics concentration at Brown gives students a background in the "core" aspects of the language system: phonetics/phonology (the study of speech sounds and their patterning), syntax (the study of combinatorics of words, phrases, and sentences), and semantics/pragmatics (the study of the meanings of words, sentences, and conversation). Beyond this, students may focus more heavily in one or more of these areas and/or explore related questions such as how children and adults learn language (language acquisition), how utterances are produced and understood in real time (psycholinguistics), or how speaking and understanding are anchored in underlying neural systems (neurolinguistics). Other areas such as historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and linguistic anthropology can also be pursued in conjunction with offerings in other departments. Laboratory in Psycholinguistics or any Topics Course in Language Acquisition or Language Processing 5 additional appropriate electives forming a thematically related set to be determined in consultation with the Concentration Advisor. At least one of these must be drawn from the list of advanced courses listed below, and we strongly recommend that at least one course be an appropriate methods and a topics course. No more than 2 of these courses may be drawn from below 1000 level courses. The electives can be drawn from any of the above courses, or any of the other linguistic/ language related courses in the CLPS department. Electives may also be drawn from courses in other in consultation with the Concentration Advisor; a list of courses which standardly count towards the Linguistics Concentration (provided they form part of the thematically related set) is appended below.

Six elective reading and research in literary arts courses, which must include:</p><p>• a course in literary theory or the history of literary criticism • a course that primarily covers readings and research in literary arts created before 1800 • a course that primarily covers readings and research in literary arts created before 1900 • a course that primarily covers readings and research in literary arts created after 1900</p><p>These courses, selected in consultation with a concentration advisor, may come from (but are not limited to) the following departments: Arts. With approval from the concentration advisor, courses covering pre-20th century time periods may be distributed in a variant manner, so long as they cover two distinct literary time periods that precede the 20th century 3. Among the ten required courses, at least four must be at the 1000-level or above. At least six classes (workshops and reading/research courses) that shall count toward the concentration must be taken at Brown through the Literary Arts Department; up to one of the six LITR courses may be a course taken in another department but cross-listed by Literary Arts. No more than two of the ten required courses for the concentration may also count toward fulfilling a second concentration.</p><p>4. During the senior year, all students must take at least one course within the Literary Arts course offerings (courses with LITR designation by the Registrar, or courses approved by the concentration advisor).</p><p>Honors in Creative Writing: Course requirements are the same as those for the regular concentration (four workshops, six elective literaturereading courses), with the following changes and additions: honors candidates must include two 1000-level workshops or independent studies among their courses; and complete a thesis. Students who are enrolled in or have completed at least one 1000-level workshop (or independent study) may submit honors applications to the Literary Arts Department from the first day of the fall semester to 25 September.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Middle East Studies</head><p>The concentration in Middle East Studies (MES) seeks to build a strong, interdisciplinary understanding of historical and contemporary issues within the Middle East, broadly defined. Requirements are intentionally flexible to accommodate the focused interests of students in understanding the diverse dynamics, histories, and societies of this region. A variety of courses from departments across the University, addressing subjects from antiquity to the present day, expose students to methods and materials of different disciplines and help them build a framework for understanding the Middle East in historical and contemporary context. Concentration requirements are structured around four major cornerstones: language, foundational knowledge and methods, multidisciplinary area studies, and research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Program for the AB Degree</head><p>Foundational Courses: All MES concentrators are expected to take both of the following foundational courses. It is recommended that students take the first foundational course (MES 0100: The Middle East: Cultures and Societies-offered every spring) before taking the second foundational course (MES 1968: Approaches to the Middle East-offered every fall). Foundational course requirements cannot be fulfilled via independent study, study abroad, or transfer credits. Jerusalem Since 1850: Religion, Politics, Cultural Heritage Language Semesters: Middle East Studies concentrators are expected to achieve competence in at least one of the modern Middle Eastern languages, such as Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, or Turkish. This entails the completion of at least six semesters of Brown language coursework in one of these languages, or the equivalent through transfer or study abroad credits. Students who have reached proficiency in a Middle Eastern language but have not received six credits at Brown (including transfer and/or study abroad credits) can fulfill this requirement: The Arab Renaissance COLT 1431B</p><p>Modern Arabic Poetry • Through taking courses in a second Middle Eastern language. • Or through courses in a non-Middle Eastern language to be used in a senior capstone project (for example, Spanish for the study of Andalucía or French for the study of North Africa).</p><p>Capstone/Honors Project: MES requires all concentrators to conduct a capstone project within their senior year (i.e., in their last two semesters before graduation). The purpose of the capstone is to synthesize and apply the skills and knowledge that MES concentrators have acquired through the MES curriculum-including disciplinary perspectives, methodological and theoretical approaches, background in the historical and contemporary dynamics of the region, and language competency -to particular interests developed through the concentration. Capstones offer students the opportunity to integrate and build upon their experiences within the concentration, while demonstrating intellectual creativity, research skills, and effective communication, and should serve in some sense as a culmination of or reflection on what one has gained in the concentration. All students are expected to present their capstone research in the final semester before graduation. Presentations of honors theses will be approximately twenty minutes long, and those of non-honors capstone projects will be approximately ten minutes long, both followed by a questionand-answer session. Capstone projects must fulfill the following requirements: 1 • Must be taken in the final two semesters before graduation (excluding summer and winter sessions) • Must incorporate research in a Middle Eastern language. • Must be taken for a letter grade. • Must be approved or overseen by a MES or MES-affiliated faculty member. • Must be presented in the final semester before graduation. Capstones can take one of three forms: a. A Middle East-focused research paper of at least 20 pages for an existing concentration-eligible (MES-coded or X-Listed) course, undertaken with the permission and supervision of the instructor.</p><p>b. An independent study or project (artistic, research, or otherwise), approved by the DUS and supervised by at least one faculty member for at least one semester under the MES 1970 -Independent Study designation. c. A two-semester honors thesis, completed under the supervision of a primary reader (who is an MES or MESaffiliated faculty member) and a secondary reader (who can be from other Brown departments and programs), and in coordination with the DUS. Concentrators are encouraged to discuss options for fulfilling language requirements with the DUS. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Two semesters of Independent Study <ref type="bibr">(MES 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">&amp; MES 1971</ref> are required for honors and will raise the number of required courses to 13. One of these Independent Study courses should take the form of a thesis writing workshop supervised by the DUS or other designated MES faculty during the first semester of thesis writing. Students must declare their intention to write an honors thesis and submit a thesis prospectus (to include a thesis proposal, research plan, proposed thesis outline, initial literature review, and initial bibliography) by April 25 th of their junior year (for May graduates) or November 20 th of their junior year (for December graduates).</p><p>For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>Concentrators may apply up to two courses per semester of study abroad toward their MES concentration requirements, with a maximum of four courses (for two semesters abroad). Students must meet with their advisors and have them sign off on their specific course selections prior to embarking upon their program. Study abroad transfer credits may only be applied toward fulfilling elective and language requirements. Study abroad transfer credit may not be used to fulfill foundational course requirements. ** Dual Concentrators</p><p>Middle East Studies concentrators may apply up to two courses that fulfill MES concentration requirements toward fulfilling the requirements of another concentration. Language courses do not count toward this two-course limit on overlapping courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>To be eligible for honors, students will have earned an "A" in the majority of courses for the concentration. Honors students will be required to have at least six semesters of language study (Advanced), two semesters of which may be counted toward the elective requirement. Two semesters of Independent Study <ref type="bibr">(MES 1970 and</ref><ref type="bibr">MES 1971)</ref> towards the Honors Thesis with the thesis advisor(s) are required. This is typically done during senior year and will raise the total number of required courses to 13.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modern Culture and Media</head><p>Modern Culture and Media (MCM) is an interdisciplinary concentration that explores the ties between media and broader cultural and social formations. We stress creative thinking and critical production: comparative analysis and theoretical reflection, as well as work that integrates practice and theory. We thus bring together aspects of modern culture that are normally separated by departmental structures such as film and media studies, fine art, literature, literary arts and philosophy. This concentration offers the student a range of possible specializations. A student might decide to focus on the critical study and production of a certain type or combination of media (print, photography, sound recording, cinema, video, television, and digital media); or they might focus on certain cultural, theoretical and/or social formations (for example, gender/sexuality in post-Cold war television, postcolonial theory and film, the changing form of the novel, theories of subjectivity and ideology, video games and theories of representation). These paths are united by a commitment to critical thinking/practice: rather than reproducing conventions, MCM concentrators learn how conventions emerge, what work they do, and explore ways to change them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Track I</head><p>Track I concentrators may choose to study a particular historical moment, a medium, or a mode of textual production, in combination with theoretical studies that examine the categories of cultural analysis: for example, the distinction between high and low culture. Examples of areas of interest include but are not limited to film, gender/sexuality, digital media, television, post-coloniality, the novel, modern thought, the modern arts, sound, and theories of ideology and subjectivity. Productive work in some modern medium or textual mode is encouraged for all concentrators. MCM's approach to production recognizes the inextricable link between theory and practice, and the possibility of a fruitful complicity between them. Production, in the sense defined here, is a theoretically informed sphere or practice, one within which acknowledged forms of cultural creation are tested and extended in close complementarity with the analyses conducted elsewhere in MCM.</p><p>Track I consists of 11 courses. The Theory of the Sign Additional courses 5 One must be an upper level course from the MCM 1200 series Two must be senior seminars from the MCM 1500 or MCM 1700 series Two must be at any level in MCM above MCM 0260 Three additional courses. These courses must be in MCM or in related departments. No more than three courses from this list may count for concentration requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>The specific courses must be approved by an MCM concentration advisor as part of a coherent program of study.</p><p>Other Requirements:</p><p>1. Focus Area: Of the 11 courses required for the concentration, at least 3 courses must be in a focus area approved by a concentration advisor. These courses may be MCM courses, related courses, or a combination of the two, and they must represent a focus on some aspect of modern literature, theory, media, art or culture. Examples of possible focus areas are: mass/popular culture, gender/sexuality, language/representation/subjectivity, narrative, digital media, film, modern thought, television, the modern arts, the novel, colonialism and post-colonialism. This is not an exhaustive list. Production courses may be in the focus area but must be in addition to the minimum 3 courses. 2. Production: Work in production is encouraged but not required for Track I concentrators. Of the 11 courses required for concentration, as many as 3 may be in production. These may be production courses offered by MCM (film, video, digital media) or courses in creative writing, painting, photography, journalism, etc., provided they do not bring the total number of concentration courses taken outside MCM to more than 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors:</head><p>The honors program in MCM is designed for students who wish to integrate their skills in a special project. Students who qualify for Honors in Track I are eligible to apply to do an Honors project or thesis. Students should submit a letter of intent in their 6 th semester, and a formal proposal by the first day of their 7 th semester. Applications will be screened by the MCM Honors Committee. (Application forms are available in the MCM office.) If approved, a student must then register for MCM 1980 (taken in the 7th semester), a one-credit course which can count towards their Focus Area requirements, and MCM 1990 (taken in the 8th semester), a one-credit thesis course in which they complete the Honors project/thesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Track II</head><p>Track II concentration combines production courses with the critical study of the cultural role of practice. It aims to engage students in the analysis of theories of production elaborated within philosophical, artistic, and technological traditions, while encouraging them to produce works that interrogate these traditions.</p><p>Track II consists of 11 courses: 1. An honors candidate must secure a faculty advisor and a second reader to serve as an honors committee for his or her project by the end of the year before graduation-typically, the end of the sixth semester. At the beginning of the penultimate semester the student will submit a proposal describing the project to the honors committee for approval. The proposal must receive committee approval and be given to Mary Rego for distribution to the full faculty by the first day of the first full week of classes of the semester. The department faculty will vote on the proposals at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Decisions will be based on the student's overall performance in music courses and on the quality of the proposal. The advisor will notify the student of the faculty's decision. 2. It is expected that honors projects will normally take two semesters to complete. Students pursuing honors may choose to register for MUSC 1970 in the Fall and/or in the Spring. In any case, they will establish a series of regular meetings with their advisor. By finals week of the penultimate semester, honors candidates must demonstrate substantial progress by submitting to the honors committee a partial draft of a paper or composition or, for performance projects, by playing a significant portion of the programmed repertoire. Failure to make sufficient progress may result in the termination of the honors project. 3. Last semester deadlines: Honors candidates must submit a complete draft to their honors committee by the first day of classes following the eighth week of the last semester. The committee will comment on the project and suggest revisions. Revisions must be completed, and the final project submitted to the honors committee by the first day of classes two weeks later. In the case of performance projects, this means that both the public performance and the scholarly component must have been completed by this date. In the case of research projects, all figures, notes, bibliography, and other critical apparatus must have been completed. Failure to make the deadline may result in the forfeiting of honors by the candidate, though the student may complete the project as a capstone project. 4. The honors committee will confer to determine their views on their projects. If the second reader is outside Music, the advisor may solicit a written recommendation about the merits of the project. 5. The advisor will deliver a copy of the completed thesis to the Mary Rego by the middle of the eleventh week of the last semester so that it may be made available for review by the full faculty. (Online, or hard copy on reserve in the Music Library.) 6. During the twelfth week of the last semester, the advisor will report on the project at a meeting of the Department faculty for a vote. The advisor will notify the student of the faculty's decision. 7. Honors recipients will present their projects at a Department of Music Convocation held once annually at noon on the first day of final examination period in Semester II.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuroscience</head><p>Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the functions and diseases of the nervous system. It draws on knowledge from neurobiology as well as elements of psychology and cognitive science, and mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems. Through the Neuroscience concentration, students develop foundational knowledge through courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics as well as three core courses in neuroscience. They are also required to develop facility with research methodologies (through courses in statistics and laboratory methods) before moving into specific topics in the field (e.g., visual physiology, neurochemistry and behavior, and synaptic transmission and plasticity). Members of the Neuroscience faculty are affiliated with the Brown Institute for Brain Science, a multidisciplinary program that promotes collaborative research about the brain. Prospective concentrators should contact Elyse_Netto@brown.edu in order to have a faculty advisor assigned to them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard program for the Sc.B. degree</head><p>The concentration combines a general science background with a number of specific courses devoted to the cellular, molecular, and integrative functions of the nervous system. The concentration allows considerable flexibility for students to tailor a program to their individual interests. Elective courses focus on a variety of areas including molecular mechanisms, cellular function, sensory and motor systems, neuropharmacology, learning and memory, animal behavior, cognitive function, bioengineering, theoretical neuroscience and computer modeling.</p><p>The concentration in neuroscience leads to an Sc.B. degree. The following background courses, or their equivalent, are required for the degree:  <ref type="bibr">(PHIL 2000-level)</ref>: seminars mainly aimed at graduate students, but also open to advanced undergraduates, requiring the completion of substantial research and writing. (A 0990-or 2000-level seminar taken as a Capstone also fulfills requirement (B, 1) for a seminar). d. Honors Thesis: a piece of work expected to be more substantial than the above-mentioned research papers, typically researched and written over the course of the entire senior year (with enrollment in PHIL 1995 Senior Thesis for two semesters) under the supervision of a thesis advisor (possibly, though not necessarily, the specialization advisor). See also Honors Requirements below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Total Credits 10</head><p>Notes:</p><p>• Up to two courses from departments other than the Philosophy department may be included among the ten courses required for the Concentration; no more than one of these two outside courses may count toward the three specialization requirements. • One course, but not more, may fulfill both an Area Requirement and a Specialization requirement. • The specialization and the courses that will fulfill it are standardly declared at some point in the course of the Junior year. Those making a Concentration Declaration at an earlier time (e.g. at the end of their Sophomore year) may make a provisional choice of courses which can be revised at a later date with the approval of the department's DUS (Director of Undergraduate Studies).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Requirements:</head><p>• Philosophy GPA must be greater than 3.5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physics</head><p>Physics is the scientific study of the fundamental principles governing the behavior of matter and the interaction of matter and energy. Mathematics is used to describe fundamental physical principles, the behavior of matter, and the interactions of matter and energy. As the most fundamental of sciences, physics provides a foundation for other scientific fields as well as the underpinnings of modern technology. The Physics department is unique because of the breadth of its faculty expertise and research, and the relatively intimate size of its classes above the introductory level. Physics concentrators may choose to pursue either the A.B. or the more intensive Sc.B. degree. Course work on either path covers a broad base of topics (for example, electricity and magnetism, classical and quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics). The Sc.B. degree requires additional advanced topics as well as a senior thesis project. In addition, courses in computer programming are recommended.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physics and Philosophy</head><p>The Physics and Philosophy concentration is for students with a deep interest in physics who do not need to acquire the laboratory and computational skills of a professional physicist. The concentration allows students to grapple with computational problems and deepen their investigation of conceptual and epistemological issues. By the end of the program, concentrators possess an excellent conceptual understanding of the most philosophically interesting physics, relativity and quantum mechanics.</p><p>This concentration should prepare a student either for graduate study, especially in a history and philosophy of science (HPS) program, or for employment in science education or journalism. Other professions such as law and medicine will look favorably on such concentrators for having versatile interests and being able to master difficult material. The concentration may serve as an excellent preparation for a law school since physics and philosophy both exercise a rigorous approach to problems of immediate relevance to life but at the same time assume two complimentary and sometimes competing viewpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising</head><p>Concentration advisors from the Departments of Physics and Philosophy will guide students working towards the A.B. degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curriculum</head><p>The curriculum builds around the fields of physics that have had the biggest impact on philosophy, especially Quantum Physics, and the fields of philosophy most relevant for physics, such as Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Physics. It is strongly recommended that students complete at least one relevant history course.</p><p>There are 11 required courses (5 in Physics, 5 in Philosophy or History, one course in mathematics) and a final project. The choice of the courses is dictated by the following considerations. The field of physics with both deepest philosophical implications and deepest influence on the rest of physics is Quantum Mechanics. Thus, a 1000-level course in Quantum Mechanics or a closely related field such as Statistical Mechanics is indispensable. The second field of physics most relevant for the concentration is Relativity. This field touches upon and serves as a foundation for a broad list of subjects with major philosophical implications of their own, for example: PHYS 1170, PHYS 1280, PHYS 1510, PHYS 1100. This requires another 1000-level physics course in the concentration. 1000level Physics courses cannot be taken without certain preliminary work, most importantly, PHYS 0470, which serves as a prerequisite for most higher-level physics courses and which relies in turn on PHYS 0160 or PHYS 0060. Another lower-level physics course is necessary for a student to develop familiarity with the tools which have been employed in producing the physics knowledge.</p><p>A natural introduction into philosophy of physics comes from a course in Early Modern Philosophy. To a large extent, Early Modern Philosophy was shaped by scholars who combined interest in philosophy and physics (e.g., Rene Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz). The influence of the XVII century physics revolution on other central figures such as Kant is unquestionable. Early Modern Philosophy sets an intellectual stage for many subsequent developments in the Philosophy of Physics and directly addresses some of the most perplexing issues like the connection (or lack thereof) between physics and religion. The core of the Philosophy requirement involves two courses in Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science. One course in this field would not be sufficient due to its very broad nature. Students are strongly advised to take a relevant History course. This requirement can be substituted by an additional philosophy course to reflect interests of those students</p><p>For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>who want a deeper background in Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science or have other related interests such as Ancient Natural Philosophy.</p><p>In addition to the above philosophy courses, PHIL 0210 (Science, Perception, and Reality) serves as a gateway into the concentration. It may be substituted by other relevant courses such as PHYS 0100 (Flat Earth to Quantum Uncertainty: On the Nature and Meaning of Scientific Explanation).</p><p>A course in calculus is a prerequisite for most physics and some philosophy classes.</p><p>Required courses for the A.B. degree are listed below:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>Seniors wishing to earn honors by presenting a senior honors thesis should consult their concentration advisor during their sixth semester or at the start of the seventh semester concerning procedures and requirements. Students may earn honors by presenting a senior thesis judged to be of honors quality by two readers. In addition to completing the usual nonhonors requirements, the student should also have a grade point average of over 3.4 in physics, philosophy and history of science courses (of which at least five must be taken for a letter grade). Honors theses are usually prepared over a period of two semesters with an advisor from the Department of Physics or the Department of Philosophy. Conducted in Portuguese, the seminar brings the concentrators together for an interdisciplinary consideration of key topics in the Portuguese-speaking world. A research paper written in Portuguese is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Project (optional)</head><p>In addition to taking a POBS 1800-series concentration seminar, students may choose to complete a senior project attached to any course in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies and related fields, including the Concentration Seminar, the latter possibility to be made at the discretion of the instructor. the advisor of the senior project is the professor of the course from which the project stems. Projects are not limited to papers, and may include short documentaries, a visual arts project, or an oral history project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology</head><p>Psychology encompasses a range of phenomena and levels of analysis in pursuit of three goals: to deepen understanding of cognitive and neural mechanisms of sensation, perception, learning, and emotion; to probe the biological and evolutionary foundations of behavior; and to clarify the social perception and assessment of individuals and groups. Students pursuing the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science take foundation courses in the field's major sub-disciplines, including perception, cognition, developmental, behavioral neuroscience, and social psychology. Students also take a course in quantitative methods, and select from an array of seminars on specialized topics and laboratory courses that focus on research design and state-of-the-art techniques. Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science must complete both a research methods and a laboratory course and four additional science courses related to the same intellectual theme as the elective courses. The concentration in Psychology prepares students for careers in research, teaching, clinical psychology, business, law, and education, among others.</p><p>The A.B. concentration requires 12 courses. The Sc.B. concentration additionally requires 1 laboratory course and 4 approved science courses, totaling to 17 required courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Core</head><p>The introductory course, "CLPS 0010 Mind, Brain, and Behavior," surveys the broad territory of the scientific study of the mind as uniquely represented by our department. The territory includes neural processes, perception, learning, memory, emotion, language, social development, social judgment, personality, and mental illness. The course could be taken by students interested in the CLPS concentrations, as an introduction at the beginning of one's college career or as an integration after having completed a number of specialized courses in a particular concentration. AP or IB Psychology credit cannot be used as a substitute for CLPS 0010.</p><p>Careers in Psychology and related fields requires familiarity with statistics. Therefore, the Psychology concentration requires a course in Quantitative Methods (CLPS 0900). CLPS 0900 is a prerequisite for most of the laboratory courses, so concentrators should plan to take this course by their fourth semester. Students may substitute APMA 1660, PHP 1501, or SOC 1100 with the approval of a concentration advisor. The department does not grant concentration credit for AP Statistics, regardless of score.</p><p>Another element in the Psychology concentration is a course on research methods. Research Methods and Design <ref type="bibr">(CLPS 1900</ref><ref type="bibr">or CLPS 1901</ref> For up-to-date course information please visit Courses@Brown.edu (https://cab.brown.edu).</p><p>is the preferred course for fulfilling this requirement. This course builds on the introductory statistics course and exposes students to a variety of topics in the psychological sciences: to empirical methods (e.g., surveys, chronometry, eye tracking, brain imaging), to common designs (e.g., factorial experimental, correlational, longitudinal), to research ethics, and to best practices of literature review. CLPS 1900/CLPS 1901 (or an approved alternative laboratory course; consult with the Psychology advisors for details) should be taken before the senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foundation</head><p>To provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge in their area of concentration, the Psychology concentration requires four foundation courses. Students select one course from each of the following areas: Social/Personality, Perception/Cognition, Development, and Learning/ Animal Behavior/Behavioral Neuroscience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>Concentrators will select four additional courses that examine in greater depth topics of special interest to them. The CLPS courses designed to count as electives will often have foundation courses as prerequisites and may include laboratory courses, or seminars. Students may choose up to two courses outside of CLPS as electives. Electives should fit into a coherent intellectual theme, and should be chosen in consultation with your Psychology advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone</head><p>Concentrators will additionally take either a seminar course or an independent research course <ref type="bibr">(CLPS 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">(CLPS , 1980</ref> to serve as their capstone experience. See the Psychology advisors for a list of approved seminars.</p><p>Additional requirements for Sc.B.</p><p>In line with university expectations, the Sc.B. requirements include a greater number of courses and especially science courses. The definition of "science" is flexible. Some of these courses will be outside of CLPS, but several CLPS courses might fit into a coherent package as well. In addition, the Sc.B. degree also requires a laboratory course (in addition to CLPS 1900/CLPS 1901 or its alternative) to provide these students with indepth exposure to research methods in a particular area of the science of the mind. Lists of approved laboratory courses can be obtained from the Psychology advisors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Requirement</head><p>The Honors Program in Psychology gives undergraduates a special opportunity to carry out a research project under the direction of a faculty member. The program also provides the opportunity for outstanding senior concentrators to receive their undergraduate degree with Honors. Participation in the program allows students to develop an understanding of research and acquire research skills and background.</p><p>Candidates for Honors in Psychology must meet all of the requirements of the concentration as described above. Candidates submit their application for the program in semester 7. We encourage students to seek out a faculty mentor prior to semester 7 as well as complete certain course requirements before semester 7. This includes completion of the statistics and laboratory requirements. A 3.5 grade-point average in the concentration is required for admission to the Honors program. Please refer to the CLPS Honors Program page for detailed information about the specific requirements for the Honors program in Psychology.  <ref type="bibr">(CLPS 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">or CLPS 1980</ref> or approved seminar semester of their senior year, but rather are required to enroll in <ref type="bibr">PHP 1980</ref><ref type="bibr">PHP 1980</ref><ref type="bibr">PHP 1980PHP 1980</ref> for both semesters of their senior year to conduct research and write the honors thesis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FOR DETAILED UPDATES</head><p>Study Abroad/Study Away: Up to four courses taken elsewhere (study abroad or other transfer) may be applied to non-core courses (up to two per semester abroad). Meet with a concentration adviser to discuss and provide a syllabus for each course to be considered for transfer to your concentration plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Policy</head><p>Housed in the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the concentration in public policy is organized around the interdisciplinary and comparative study of human societies, but with a particular focus on the rules and norms by which we govern ourselves. The concentration is grounded in the analysis of pressing social problems and the design, implementation, and evaluation of better policies and practices. This commitment to using knowledge to improve the life chances of people who occupy different positions of wealth and power, and who have competing and contentious ideas of about the common good, makes public policy a value-laden and political enterprise that is as much an art as it is a science. It is also a team sport that requires players with different skills and talents to work together across a wide variety of settings.</p><p>Students will learn how social, economic, and political issues become the object of public policy, how policy decisions are crafted, made and implemented, as well as different strategies for evaluating their impact. The concentration draws its instructors from a wide variety of disciplines and offers students opportunities for engaged scholarship at the local, national, and global levels. With the support of the advisory team, students develop their own curriculum of study, integrating core courses with electives, internships, independent research, and a capstone experience. The Public Policy concentration will only accept new declarations through the class of 2023. Students in any class year can learn more about the new concentration (https://watson.brown.edu/ iapa/about/faqs) in International and Public Affairs: Policy and Governance Track.</p><p>of community, the nature of the individual, suffering and death, notions of good and evil --students discover new ways of engaging the complex world in which they live. As students examine religious activity in the Americas, South and East Asia, the Middle East and West Asia, Africa, and Europe, they not only learn about the formation and transmission of beliefs, behaviors, values, rituals, and identities but also come to understand how diverse peoples have expressed religious understandings of themselves and others through politics, institutions, conflicts, and spaces commonly recognized as secular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Basic Requirement</head><p>A concentration in Religious Studies includes a minimum of nine semester-long courses. Those nine courses include RELS 1000 (a seminar in methods in the study of religion) and eight other courses, which must satisfy the concentration's distribution requirements. Students who transfer to Brown or study abroad must complete at least five courses in Religious Studies at Brown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Distribution of Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced courses:</head><p>in other departments can count toward the program (pending approval by the DUS). Students who transfer to Brown, study abroad, or otherwise petition to include Brown courses not cross-listed with Religious Studies must complete at least five courses in Religious Studies at Brown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Capstone Project</head><p>No later than the end of spring registration in the junior year, the concentrator will determine how they will complete a senior capstone project for this requirement -either by selecting a capstone course, or by undertaking an honors thesis. A capstone course will be selected in consultation with the concentration advisor and other faculty as appropriate. Within the frame of this capstone course and through work completed for the course, the concentrator will address the theoretical and interpretive issues of their particular focus in the Religious Studies concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Thesis (Optional)</head><p>A thesis is an opportunity for students to conduct extended independent research under the guidance of faculty. If a student chooses to write an honors thesis, in addition to completing the typical eight concentration courses (in addition to RELS 1000) the student will enroll in RELS 1999 during both semesters of the senior year. Whether or not a student receives honors, RELS 1999 will serve as the student's capstone course.</p><p>To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 (A=4, B=3, C=2) on courses that count toward the concentration. Additionally, to be eligible for honors, concentrators may take no more than two of the concentration courses with the "S/ NC" option, after declaring a Religious Studies concentration. (Note: if a student is philosophically committed to taking the majority of her or his courses at Brown as "S/NC," that student may petition the Department to waive this "S/NC" limit.) Writing the thesis is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for receiving Honors. In order to receive Honors, the student's thesis must earn an A from its two readers, and the student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 in the concentration and satisfied all other concentration requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Science, Technology, and Society</head><p>Science, Technology, and Society (STS, formerly Science and Society) is an interdisciplinary concentration that examines the processes of scientific discovery and the establishment of scientific policies and systems of belief from historical, philosophical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. Concentrators analyze the practices, norms, and values that reflect and shape our deepest convictions about what is considered "science." Students select courses in the physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics and choose a thematic track that may include the history and philosophy of science; gender and science; race, science and ethnicity; health and medicine; environment and society; or they may create their own independent focus. STS prepares students to follow, guide, and shape scientific knowledge as it travels from the laboratory into the public arena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>Consisting of 12 courses, the program of study outlined below will be developed by each student in consultation with the concentration advisor. Where appropriate, independent reading, lab courses or GISPS may count for up to three of the twelve total courses. Students will take a minimum of 7 intermediate to advanced courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Courses (2)</head><p>The concentration has two required courses.</p><p>• STS 1000 : Introduction to Science and Society: Theories and Controversies, or equivalent introductory course: usually taken in the second or third year. • STS 1900 : Senior Seminar in Science and Society, also open to nonmajors with the proper background, usually taken senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thematic Track (3)</head><p>Students will organize their course of study around the choice of a thematic track. The theme may be thought of as the applied content portion of the concentration. Students will take a minimum of three courses, at least one of which must be at an advanced level, in one of the thematic areas listed below:</p><p>• Students will take a minimum of four courses in one of the following scientific areas: physical sciences, life sciences, mathematics/computer science. The chosen area should provide appropriate background and support for the chosen concentration theme. The science courses will be sequenced such that a concentrator will move enough beyond the introductory level to gain some understanding of the world view of scientists within a chosen field. The particular sequence of courses which best meets the science requirement will be chosen in consultation with the concentration advisor. When necessary, the concentration advisor will seek guidance from faculty within the chosen scientific field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Science and Technology Studies Theory (3)</head><p>Students will take three Science and Technology Studies-related courses in the social sciences and humanities. These courses, which will provide critical theoretical background for the study of Science and Society, should address questions of historiography, epistemology and methodology in the field of science and technology studies. A full list of such courses and sample concentrations may be found at https://www.brown.edu/ academics/science-and-technology-studies/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>To qualify for Honors a student must:</p><p>• Be in good standing • Have completed at least two thirds of the concentration requirements by the application deadline • Have earned a majority of "A" grades in the concentration.</p><p>Classes taken S/NC will count as qualifying towards that majority if they are marked "S with distinction" or are accompanied by a Course Performance Report (https://ask.brown.edu/ performance_reports) indicating that had the student taken the course for a grade, the grade would have been an "A."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Slavic Studies</head><p>Slavic Studies is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the Slavic world. Built on sound knowledge of one or two Slavic languages (normally Russian or Czech) the program allows students to develop an in-depth appreciation and understanding of East European cultures and civilizations through a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary fields. Students take courses in literature, history, culture, theater, political science, economics, and international relations. Concentrators focusing on Russia learn one of the world's most commonly spoken languages and study some of the world's best-regarded authors and composers: Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Gogol and Bulgakov, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, and Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. Focusing on Czech allows students to explore, for example, how Czechs distinguished themselves by peacefully transitioning from communism to capitalism (the "Velvet Revolution") and separating peacefully with the Slovak Republic (the "Velvet Divorce"). Most concentrators study abroad in a Slavic country, either during the academic year or the summer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the AB Degree</head><p>Six semesters of one Slavic language or the equivalent (normally Czech or Russian), or a combined total of eight semesters of two Slavic languages or the equivalent. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Internship</head><p>A one semester or a summer research internship is required. The research internship is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in social research. Students will typically complete the research internship in their junior year or during the summer between their junior and senior years. Students need to submit an Internship Proposal Form to the Undergraduate Concentration Advisor for approval prior to starting the internship. Upon completion of the internship, students are required to submit to the Undergraduate Concentration Advisor a brief summary report of their experience, which must be signed by the supervisor of the student's internship.</p><p>Academic research internships involve work on a faculty member's research project. Activities may range from data collection, data entry, data file management, descriptive analyses, and more advanced model estimation. Students are encouraged to approach faculty about opportunities for working on their research projects. Off-campus research internships are arranged through the Sociology Department Students Affairs Coordinator or the Undergraduate Concentration Advisor. Academic and off-campus research internships will typically entail 5-10 hours of work per week and may or may not involve compensation.</p><p>Students may receive academic credit for academic research internships and off-campus internships completed during the academic year if they combine the internship experience with an academic component under the direction of a faculty advisor. Students taking an internship for credit should register for an Individual Research Project <ref type="bibr">(SOC 1970)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Senior Seminar</head><p>Social Analysis and Research requires all concentrators to complete a thesis or capstone project in their senior year. The purpose of the thesis or capstone project is to allow students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they acquired on a topic of their own interests. To fulfill this requirement students enroll in SOC 1950 (http://bulletin.brown.edu/ search/?P=SOC%201950) -Senior Seminar. Participation in this seminar allows each cohort of concentrators to discuss their diverse interests and expose them to the wide range of applications of Sociological knowledge.</p><p>An undergraduate thesis must ask an original research question, answer it with appropriate evidence, and place that work within relevant scholarly literature in sociology. The thesis is supervised by a faculty member who serves as the primary advisor, and one additional faculty member who serves as a reader. By the end of the sixth semester, students must submit a prospectus of the senior thesis to the Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies. At the start of the seventh semester students should submit to the Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies a proposal (not more than four pages) accompanied by the signature of one faculty member indicating that he or she is willing to serve as primary advisor on the thesis. Only a senior thesis qualifies the student for Honors.</p><p>A capstone project is an independent, student-initiated project or experience developed during the Senior Seminar <ref type="bibr">(SOC 1950</ref>) that connects in a meaningful way to the learning in the concentration. A capstone project differs from a thesis in its scholarly content and form, and it depends only on the evaluation of the senior seminar instructor. Whereas the senior thesis follows the form of a conventional research paper, the project allows a wider array of research and creative outputs, including but not limited to video documentaries, photographic exhibitions, and applied or policy related reports with an off-campus organization. Projects are complemented by a paper or report that situates the central subject matter of the project within the context of sociological scholarship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>In order to be considered for honors , students must receive a grade point average of at least 3.5 ( A=4, B-3, C=2) on all concentration courses taken, and no more than one (1) of the concentration courses with the "S/ NC" option. Honors also requires a senior thesis, with a recommendation of Honors by the advisor and reader, that demonstrates an understanding of empirical research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study</head><p>Students can use no more than one (1) Independent Study course (SOC 1970 (http://bulletin.brown.edu/search/?P=SOC%201970)) to meet the concentration course requirements. This course counts towards a 1000 level substantive requirement and will not serve as a substitute for any of the core concentration requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociology</head><p>The concentration in Sociology (leading to a Bachelor of Arts) provides a foundation in sociological theory and methods and the opportunity to cultivate more specialized knowledge in the discipline's substantive interests. Students develop that focus through their coursework, taking courses in diverse areas such as social inequality, family and gender, organizations, environmental sociology, race and ethnicity and globalization. Students refine their interests during the senior seminar and through their completion of a senior thesis or capstone project. The concentration also allows students to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program (https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/ public-service/engaged-scholars-program) (ESP). ESP is for students with an interest in making deeper connections between their concentration and long-term community-engaged activities such as internships, public service, and many other possible forms of community involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard program for the A.B. degree</head><p>Ten courses are required to complete the concentration. Senior Seminar 1 5 additional courses: 5 a) At least three of the optional courses have to be 1000 level and one of them must be a substantive seminar (1870/1871). b) Students can choose to take up to two (showcase) lower level (0100 level) courses. c) Students can petition to take two courses outside of the discipline (this will be allowed only when the proposed course makes sense given the insterests of the student, and there is no equivalent sociology course).</p></div>

Projects are complemented by a poster presentation, literature review, and report that situates the central subject matter of the project within the context of sociological scholarship. Prospective students will be able to obtain Advanced Placement credit for the requirements in mathematics. Students who have already completed an introductory course in statistics will be granted permission to proceed to Level II core courses if they meet the prerequisites in mathematics and computing.</p><p>PHP 0100: As part of the capstone course or thesis, students should complete an online course, PHP 0100, at their own pace. This course is a requirement and is meant to give a broad overview of public health and it allows students to see different areas in public health where statistics is being used. The course does not require any additional credit and is completed as part of the independent study, PHP 1970/1980. Students who are in a double concentration in public health are exempt from this course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Thesis:</head><p>A senior honors thesis is not a requirement for graduation, but concentrators who choose to write one are required to write a manuscript that describes a major project of statistical data analysis that they performed or a simulation study to evaluate the performance of a statistical method. Students that decide to write an honor thesis will generally integrate their capstone project into their thesis. Generally, writing a senior thesis includes two semesters of independent study <ref type="bibr">(PHP 1980)</ref>, the capstone project may serve as one of those.</p><p>Honors: Statistics requires the completion of a senior thesis and a superior record in the program.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theatre Arts and Performance Studies</head><p>The Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies (TAPS) is the intellectual and artistic center for the aesthetic, historical, literary, practical, and theoretical explorations of performance in global perspective -theatre, dance, speech, time-based art, and even performative "roles" in everyday life. The TAPS concentration offers three tracks with many points of overlap among them: Performance Studies, Theatre Arts, and Dance. Concentrators gain exposure to a broad spectrum of performance modes and methods --acting, directing, dance, and writing, and chose an avenue of focus among them. In addition, TAPS concentrators with an interest in socially engaged performance that tackles complex social issues may pursue the Engaged Scholars Program (https://www.brown.edu/ academics/theatre-arts-performance-studies/undergraduate-program/ engaged-scholars-program). Everyone graduates having studied craft, gained familiarity with history, and investigated the role of performance arts in culture.</p><p>Students who declared their concentration prior to fall 2019 can find their concentration requirements here: https://bulletin.brown.edu/ archive/2018-19/the-college/concentrations/taps/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theatre Arts Track</head><p>This concentration combines the study of dramatic literature, theatre history, performance theory, and studio work in the various theatre arts. All concentrators in Theatre Arts will gain practical experience through the study of acting and directing as well as in the technical production of plays, preparing students in the practical study of a cross-section of the vital aspects of theatre craft, including one class in either dance or speech. An essential aim of the concentration track is the engagement of students in performance procedures <ref type="bibr">(acting, dancing, directing, choreography, design, playwriting, dramaturgy, etc.)</ref> in order to experience the inter-relationships among social contexts, dramatic texts and theatrical enactments. Along with practical study in craft, concentrators will graduate having studied theatre history and performance theory in global perspective. The study of theatre history provides a Theatre Arts concentrator with the necessary background to understand a variety of dramatic and theatrical forms.</p><p>The study of performance theory enhances a student's ability to ask fundamental questions about the role of theatre in social, political, cultural and cross-cultural arenas. Students wishing to enroll as concentrators in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and take the Theatre Arts track should see the undergraduate Theatre Arts track advisor, in order to discuss options that will best serve their interests.</p><p>TAPS 0700 Introduction to Theatre, Dance and Performance </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance Studies Track</head><p>The Performance Studies track in the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies concentration offers a base for students interested in a variety of performance forms, performance media, or in intermedial art. A concentrator in this track will study the multiple modes in which live performance articulates culture, negotiates difference, constructs identity, and transmits collective historical traditions and memories. Because Performance Studies is not primarily invested in one performance mode over another (such as theatre or dance), a concentrator will gain exposure to a broad spectrum of performance modes. Studying ritual, play, game, festival, spectacle and a broad spectrum of "performance behaviors" under the umbrella of Performance Studies, a concentrator will graduate having investigated the role of performance in culture, including performative acts in everyday life, political enactment, ritual behavior, aesthetic or representational practices, and social role or the performance of subjectivity. The history of aesthetic performance practices (such as the histories of theatre and/or dance) will be an important part of this track, serving to ground inquiry into the broader spectrum of performance study. Students will craft their electives on this track from a wide selection of courses both within the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and across the university. The study of performance behavior across mediums such as dance, theatre, ritual, and orature allows for geographic and historical flexibility as not all cultures parse theatre from dance, nor, historically, genres of religious or political ritual from genres of entertainment, play, or game. At least one of the ten required classes must show geographic or cultural breadth, and be approved as such by the undergraduate concentration advisor. Participation in practical classes in modes of performance is also required.</p><p>Students wishing to enroll as concentrators in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and take the Performance Studies track should see the undergraduate Performance Studies track advisor, in order to discuss options that will best serve their interests.</p><p>TAPS 0700 Introduction to Theatre, Dance and Performance Revolution as a Work of Art Two full-credit courses based in performance craft in either Dance, Acting, Directing, Playwriting, Speech, Design, Literary Arts, Visual Arts, Music, or Africana Studies approved by the concentration advisor.</p><p>2 Two additional courses in the academic study of performance and performance culture(s) from either within TAPS or throughout the University in consultation with the advisor.</p><p>2 Total Credits 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance Track</head><p>The Dance track of the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies concentration engages students in the study of dance, movement, and other forms of kinesthetic performance. Emphasizing dance technique, choreography/composition, and theories and histories of global forms of dance practice, concentrators in this track will study how multiple global dance forms articulate culture, negotiate difference, construct identity, and transmit collective historical traditions. Concentrators will receive instruction in composition and technique, and engage with dance, theatre, and performance production within the department to understand dance within a network of performance practices. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For all concentrators, regardless of track:</head><p>In cases where dual concentrations are declared, the Department allows two courses to be counted toward both concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone</head><p>Each student will complete a capstone project by the second semester of the senior year. The purpose of this capstone is to synthesize the core tenets of theory and practice in our concentration learning objectives and to reflect on that synthesis. The following projects, completed in semesters 6, 7, and 8, qualify as a capstone:</p><p>• A senior slot production and a 5-page capstone reflection • An honors thesis • An engaged scholarship project and a 5-page capstone reflection • Extension of an existing curricular, co-curricular, or extra-curricular project from the junior year or first semester senior year and a 5-page capstone reflection.</p><p>• Revision or expansion of an existing final paper from any prior class and a 5-page capstone reflection. • Major participation in a non-departmental campus production, performance or academic event (i.e., student produced work at PW, etc., an event at the Granoff, etc.) and a 5-page capstone reflection • The 5-page reflection will contain the following:</p><p>• a brief description of the project completed, including details about who, when, and where the project took place (i.e., which class the paper was originally written for, where the show was produced, how you revised the paper, directed the production, etc.) • an examination of how you used knowledge acquired in the concentration conceptualize, do, and complete the project with a frank assessment of the project's success or ways in which it could have been improved. What new skills and research methods were gained and how will they be incorporated into your artistry. • The DUS will assess the paper, approving it if all of the criteria above are met. While this is not a formal research paper, the reflection will be assessed for clarity, honesty and depth of self-reflection, and reflection on your experience of the TAPS curriculum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>The standard pattern above, plus an honors thesis course taken in Semester VII <ref type="bibr">(TAPS 1990)</ref>, the topic of which would be determined before Semester VII. Candidates for the honors program should have an outstanding academic record and must apply to the Department by April 1 of Semester VI. Proposals can be submitted electronically. Honors are awarded for theses in all concentration tracks. All theses are substantive pieces of writing. Some these are strictly academic. Other honors theses may include a creative component (such as the directing of a play, a solo performance piece, the study and performance of a major role, or the design of a production) but the thesis itself will be a critical, written work based in research relative to that artwork. For plays submitted for honors, the essay should accompany the play, reporting on the research and the process of writing, though the play itself counts as the substantive written work. See the Honors Advisor for more information about proposal and thesis guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Urban Studies</head><p>The Urban Studies program teaches students to analyze the city, urban life, and urbanization through a variety of disciplinary lenses. Students learn where cities come from, how they grow, thrive, and decline, how they are organized, and how to construct meaningful, inclusive, secure, and sustainable places. The curriculum examines how urban problems arise, how they have been previously addressed, and how to plan cities of the future. Concentrators enjoy the breadth of courses in American Studies, economics, history, literature, history of art and architecture, political science, sociology, and planning as well as provide in-depth courses integrating those perspectives. We introduce the fundamentals of Urban Studies scholarship as well as intense examination of an urban problem in focused seminars. These advanced seminars offer opportunities to write extensive and synthetic interdisciplinary analyses that serve as capstones to the concentration. The program's 10-course curriculum provides sufficient flexibility to allow students to pursue specific urban interests or to take courses in urban focus areas of Built Environment; Humanities; Social Sciences; and Sustainable Urbanism. The Program insures that students master at least one basic research methodology and perform research or fieldwork projects, which may result in an honors thesis. Fieldwork training includes working with local agencies and nonprofit organizations on practical urban problems. Capstone projects entail original research papers in Urban Studies seminars; academically supervised video, artistic, or community service projects; and Honors Theses for eligible concentrators.</p><p>Concentrators who are especially interested in making deeper connections between their curriculum and long-term engaged activities such as internships, public service, humanitarian and development work, and many other possible forms of community involvement might consider the Engaged Scholar Program (https://www.brown.edu/academics/urbanstudies/curriculum/engaged-scholars-program) in US. The program combines preparation, experience, and reflection to offer students</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>Candidates for Honors must have above average grades and shall apply for this distinction in writing to the Director of the Program by the middle of the second semester of their junior year. They shall include a cover letter with a brief statement of the intended research proposal as well as the name of the member of the Urban Studies faculty who would serve as their advisor and with whom they must work closely. Twelve courses are required for Honors concentrator, two in addition to the ten courses required for a standard program. During the Fall and Spring of the senior year, honors candidates must complete two additional courses beyond the ten courses required by the regular concentration: URBN 1971 Senior Honors Thesis I in Urban Studies(S/NC) and URBN 1972 Senior Honors Thesis II in Urban Studies (grade). The candidate's final thesis must be of outstanding quality, in order to qualify for honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual Art</head><p>The Visual Art concentration engages in artistic practice across a wide range of media: painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, and digital imaging. Courses in art history combine with these to frame the direction of the concentrator's work and to develop his or her critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to cultivate an informed and thoughtful individual perspective. Students in the Visual Arts department enjoy cutting-edge facilities and a knowledgeable faculty. These two resources inspire creativity and pleasure in our concentrators while they explore the discipline. Students acquire the intellectual and practical tools to make art as well as to interpret and critique the world of images. Students also have the opportunity to take courses at the neighboring Rhode Island School of Design. All Visual Art (VISA) courses are graded S/NC (https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/policies/gradeoptions). </p></div>

A lecture and computing lab course providing an introduction to quantitative analysis of neural activity and encoding, as well as modeling of neurons and neural systems. Emphasizes Matlab-based computer simulation. Prerequisites: NEUR 0010, 1020 or 1030; APMA 1650 or equivalent; APMA 0330 or 0350 or equivalent. Experience with Matlab desirable. Please request an override through C@B. Please keep in mind that decisions on overrides may not be made until the first meeting of the course. The goals of this course are to illustrate what basic science can teach us about neurological disorders and how these pathologies illuminate the functioning of the normal nervous system. Consideration will be given to monoallelic diseases (e.g. Fragile X Syndrome, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Tuberous Sclerosis) as well as genetically complex disorders, such as Autism, Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Emphasis will be on the cellular and molecular basis of these disorders and how insights at these levels might lead to the development of therapies. Prerequisites: NEUR 1020. BIOL 0470 suggested. The recent surge in understanding the cellular and molecular basis of neurological disease has opened the way for highly targeted drug discovery and development. In this course we will use several case studies to illuminate how mechanistic insights are being translated into novel therapeutic approaches. Please request an override through C@B. Please keep in mind that decisions on overrides may not be made until the first meeting of the course. This couse will consider the neuroscience of consciousness from a variety of perspectives, using examples from behavior, neurophysiology, neuroimaging and neurology. The course content will focus on primary literature, using review articles for background. Students will lead discussions. Sign-up required by Google Docs (link below). Please keep in mind that overrides may not be given until after the first meeting. Overrides are given based on seniority, concentration requirements, etc. Strongly Recommended: NEUR 1030.

Virgil, most famous as the poet of the Aeneid, began his career with two smaller masterpieces: a collection of ten bucolic poems (Eclogues) modeled on the Idylls of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus, and a didactic work on agriculture in four books, the Georgics, which found its inspiration both in Hellenistic models and in more recent Roman antecedents (including Lucretius' De Rerum Natura) and is viewed by many as the poet's finest achievement. We will read selections from both works, concluding with the epyllion at the end of Georgics Four, which relates the tragic love story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Section numbers vary by instructor.

Sanskrit Reading and Research.CLPS 0110. Animal Behavior. The topic of this course is the scientific study of animal behavior, based on the theoretical framework proposed by Nobel Prize winner Niko Tinbergen. This framework addresses four basic questions about behavior: its evolutionary history, its function, its development, and its causation (underlying mechanisms). Using Tinbergen's framework, we will study two major categories of behavior -mating and aggression -in a range of animal species.CLPS 0120. Introduction to Sleep. This course uses sleep as the focal point for describing complex behavioral phenomena. How is sleep measured and defined? How does sleep differ across species? What accounts for the timing of sleep? How does sleep change with age? What are the behavioral, physiological, and cognitive concomitants of different states of sleep? How can dreaming be understood? What can go wrong with sleep? Recommended prior coursework: CLPS 0001 or NEUR 0010, or an AP course in psychology or physiology.g., when should physicians order expensive diagnostic tests?); risky choice (e.g., is it rational to play the lottery?).</note></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_30"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This seminar will focus on the views of Plato and Aristotle on god's thought and human thought. Plato treats god as a craftsman who looks to unchanging forms and attempts to replicate them in recalcitrant materials. By contrast, Aristotle regards the cosmos as eternal. His god maintains the world as the relatively stable place it is and does so as an object of desire and thought. God's own activity-thinking of thinking--is extremely simple, whereas ours is necessarily more complex and involves recognizing our place and contribution to the order of things. Interested students must register for ENGL 2761R. Interested students must register for ENGL 2901M. Lyric poetry is the prime mode for conveying emotion in many cultures, from ancient times to the present day. This course will survey the variety of forms and themes from the earliest texts from Greece, Rome, China and Japan, then the glories of the Renaissance and the Tang Dynasty, then move to the challenges for lyric expression in the modern world. Enrollment limited to 19 first year studens. Examines a seemingly universal theme-coming of age-by focusing on texts from disparate periods and cultures. Proposes that notions of "growing up" are profoundly inflected by issues of class, gender and race, and that the literary representation of these matters changes drastically over time. Texts from the Middle Ages to the present; authors drawn from Chrétien de Troyes, Quevedo, Prévost, Balzac, Brontë, Twain, Faulkner, Vesaas, Rhys, Satrapi and Foer.

But what if we understand them as an intensification, rather than a reduction, of forces? How do slowness, stillness, and stasis animate fugitivity in various bodies of thought? What if slowness, stillness, and stasis instantiate modes of anti-colonial practice and thought, or imagine/realize a world nonsensical to much of dominant western thought?

James</head><label></label><figDesc>From Danish cartoons and fatwas to student protests and the stabbing of a Nobel laureate, in this course we will study several literary scandals that have rocked the Middle East since the mid-twentieth century. Our focus will be not only on the content and form of the texts themselves, but also on the historical, political, social, and cultural circumstances in which literature comes to have meaning for particular social and religious communities. Both are also moving narratives about humans with different sorts of artistic, emotional, and bodily ambitions, grappling with new forms of subjective and collective life in modernity, trying to work out their own place within social, political and artistic systems. Join Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom, Ulises Lima and a cast of minor characters as they make their way through the hearts, minds, memories, and nervous systems of a range of modern metropoles. An advanced course with readings in modernist Arabic poetry, beginning with the so-called neo-classical poets and proceeding through Romanticism and Modernism, from Egypt to Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and beyond. We will examine such recurring themes as love, loss, and longing; war, exile, and homeland; cultural heritage (turath) and creative innovation (ibda'); gender and genre.

Topics in 3D Game Engine Development.</head><label></label><figDesc>Probability and statistics have become indispensable tools in computer science. Probabilistic methods and statistical reasoning play major roles in machine learning, cryptography, network security, communication protocols, web search engines, robotics, program verification, and more. This course introduces the basic concepts of probability and statistics, focusing on topics that are most useful in computer science applications. Covers software exploitation techniques and state-of-the-art mechanisms for protecting (vulnerable) software. It begins with a summary of prevalent software defects, typically found in applications written in memory unsafe languages, like C/C++, and proceeds with studying traditional and modern exploitation techniques, ranging from classical code-injection and codereuse up to the newest goodies (just-in-time code reuse). For the most part, it focuses on defenses against certain vulnerability classes and exploitation methods. Students will learn about the boundaries and effectiveness of virtualization, stack and heap protections, and address space randomization, and analyze advanced exploitation techniques and countermeasures. Who is the Big Brother that we most fear? Is it the NSA --or is it Google and Facebook? Rapidly changing social mores and the growing problem of cybersecurity have all contributed to a sense that privacy is dead. Laws protecting privacy and civil liberties are stuck in the analog age, while the capabilities for mass digital surveillance continue to advance rapidly. This course will examine a variety of informational privacy and technology issues. A major theme: the historical and contemporary struggle to bring surveillance under democratic control to protect against abuses of privacy, civil liberties and human rights. Mastering big data requires skills spanning a variety of disciplines: distributed systems over statistics, machine learning, and a deep understanding of a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms. Data Science refers to the intersection of these skills and how to transform data into actionable knowledge. This course provides an overview of techniques and tools involved and how they work together: SQL and NoSQL solutions for massive data management, basic algorithms for data mining and machine learning, information retrieval techniques, and visualization methods.</figDesc><table><row><cell>CSCI 1951A.

This course offers all students regardless of background the opportunity for hands-on data science experience, following a data science process from an initial research question, through data analysis, to the storytelling of the data. Along the way, you will learn about the ethical considerations of working with data through ethics spotting, and become more aware of societal impacts of data science. Course does not count toward CS concentration requirements.their knowledge of probability and statistics, machine learning, and data and computational science. A faculty member from one of the four core DSI departments (Applied Mathematics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, Mathematics) will oversee the capstone course. Students may collaborate with an additional faculty member, postdoc, or industry partner on projects. DATA 1010 and DATA 1030 are recommended pre-requisites.</note></figure>

The goals are to increase appreciation and enjoyment of our natural surroundings and provide a better understanding of environmental problems, natural resources, land use, and geologic hazards. Four labs, plus a field trip. For nonscience concentrators (science concentrators should take EEPS 0220). Students MUST register for both components of this course (the lecture and one of the labs) during the SAME registration session. Enrollment limited to 100. Space exploration has revealed an astonishing array of surface features on the planets and their satellites. Why are atmospheres on the planets different from Earth's atmosphere? Do other planets represent our past or future environment? Is there life on other planets? The planets and their histories are compared to gain insight and a new perspective on planet Earth.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Fall EEPS0050 S01 16812 MWF</cell><cell>2:00-2:50(07)</cell><cell>(J.

However, underneath the glitter of modernity visible in the urban sprawl of Seoul's "Gangnam Style" are forgotten stories, stratified claims, and a tumultuous history covering 35 years of Japanese rule, a war, and the ongoing presence of 28,500 American troops. This course examines how Chinese cultural industry was shaped by sociopolitical institutions and religious practice between 1400 and 1900 CE. The course highlights the concept of craft, broadly understood as the ways of making artifacts and building social community by using environmental resources and through micro-political negotiations in everyday life.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">This course will take an</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>The</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">interdisciplinary approach to Seoul incorporating history, urban culture,</cell><cell cols="3">course aims to equip students in ways to decipher the political, religious</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">literature and visual media, and engage key concepts informing the</cell><cell cols="3">and gendered significance embedded in cultural products, including</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">burgeoning field of Korean studies.

In developing the concept, Laura Mulvey refused to posit a corrective "female gaze" -which makes Maggie Nelson's remark about the female gaze in literature all the more surprising. This course discusses experimental writing primarily by women through the proposition that, without the male gaze, writing has the potential to be an "astonishing equalizer."

This seminar examines the Anthropocene idea from the perspective of environmental history. What activities might have changed the planet -the use of fire thousands of years ago, or agriculture, or fossil fuels? Is the Anthropocene another term for climate change, or does it include pollution and extinction? Is it a useful concept? Drawing on anthropology and the sciences as well as history, we will use the Anthropocene to think through environmental change and the human relationship with the non-human world. This course provides an introduction to a wide range of research approaches in the social and environmental sciences. We will cover the epistemological and theoretical foundations of various research approaches and discuss implications of these foundations for what research questions are answerable and what evidence one can bring to bear to answer such questions. By the end of the semester, students will be able to write a clear and answerable research question, and know what methods are appropriate to use to answer such a question. Enrollment limited to ENVS Juniors. ENVS seniors must receive instructor override from Professor Bosworth, kai_bosworth@brown.edu. From coal power to solar power, energy drives economies and increases quality of life world-wide. However, this same energy use can, and often does, lead to severe environmental destruction/pollution and global warming. This course serves as an introduction to energy policy in the United States and also explores global attempts to solve energy problems. This course examines different types of energy sources and uses, different ideological paths driving energy policy, the environmental impacts of energy use, current global and domestic attempts to solve energy problems, and the role of renewable and alternative forms of energy in future energy policy. This is the first half of a two-semester course. Four meetings a week for oral practice. One hour of work outside of class is expected every day (grammar/writing, oral practice, reading).

Something called both "French" and "theory" came ashore in the Anglo-American academic scene of the 1970s. Supposedly both impenetrable and hegemonic, it was seen to reconstitute what was discussed in programs in literature and the social sciences, and how it was discussed. Today the shoreline of study in the humanities has been transformed, but French theory's moment is presumed to have past. This course will trace that history through key French texts (read in translation) written between the 1960s and 1990s.

What was the fate of the knight errant in the modern era and how did the invention of printing transform medieval romance cycles? Did the humanist novel offer a corrective to the vagaries of chivalric romance? Literary works will be read in light of theories of the novel. Readings in Chrétien de Troyes, the prose Lancelot, Rabelais, Bakhtin, Lukács, and others. Taught in French. Under the influence of "New Science," the 17th century witnessed dramatic shifts in ways of perceiving and relating to the natural world. Guided by theoretical and historical work in environmental humanities and with a focus on literature, we will consider how French thinkers and writers framed the relationship between humans and their non-human others(animals, plants, natural landscapes).

Intended to provide a thorough review of German grammar and help students develop their writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills. Frequent writing assignments. Four hours per week. Recommended prerequisite: GRMN 0200. This introductory course will examine the fraught relationship between Germans (and Austrians) and Jews in Germanophone writing across genres from the Enlightenment to the mid-20th century. We will consider writing by Jewish authors, images of Jews, and the themes of Jewishness and Germanness, emancipation, assimilation, anti-semitism and Zionism. Students will learn analytic reading, writing and research skills. Texts by Lessing, Mendelsohn, Veit, von Arnim, Heine, Marx, Droste-Hülshoff, Laske-Schüler, Kafka, Benjamin, Scholem and Arendt, among others. Readings and discussion in English. Globalization is a phenomenon that changes basic structures of contemporary life. The political, social, economic and cultural spheres are connected worldwide &amp;influence each other like never before. German literature reflects these developments &amp;reflects on them in a multitude of ways. One of the modes in which literature after the spatial turn renegotiates space, time, &amp;identities, are contemporary travel accounts, in which encounters w/the other are shown to be cultural constructions that are always influenced by preconceived ideas and ideologies. Readings of texts by Christoph Ransmayr, Sten Nadolny, Felicitas Hoppe, Daniel Kehlmann, and others. Prereq: GRMN 600 or equivalent. In German. Kafka's writing might be profoundly singular, but it also challenges us to think about dualities. His texts teem with thematic dyads and character pairs that are as memorable and genial as they are incommensurable, uncanny, absurd, and disastrous. Our seminar takes on these unlikely couplings alongside the question of what it means to 'pair' Kafka with philosophy, film, history, post-modernity, etc. Readings and discussions in English, with German originals available to students with the necessary proficiency.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>GRMN 1340Y.

Our readings will be set against a moving backdrop of theory, film, art practices, and political upheavals, asking how poetry reconfigures the aesthetic while engaging questions of gender, race, and audience. Writers will include Parra, Carrión, JL Martínez, Hora Zero, Varela, Thenón, Carrera, Zurita.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">HISP 2350Z.

Its logic is not encoded on human DNA, and its practices are not the inevitable outcome of supply and demand. So how did capitalism become the dominant economic system of the modern world? History can provide an answer by exploring the interaction of culture and politics, technology and enterprise, and opportunity and exploitation from the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade to the 2008 Financial Crisis. HIST 0150 courses introduce students to methods of historical analysis, interpretation, and argument. This class presumes no economics background, nor previous history courses. Refugees are arguably the most important social, political and legal category of the twentieth century. This introductory lecture course locates the emergence of the figure of the refugee in histories of border-making, nation-state formation and political conflicts across the twentieth century to understand how displacement and humanitarianism came to be organized as international responses to forms of exclusion, war, disaster and inequality. Colonial Latin America, from Columbus's voyage in 1492 to Independence in the nineteenth century, was the creation of three peoples: Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans. Spanish and Portuguese conquerors brought with them the world of the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the Renaissance. Native Americans lived there already, in rich empires and hunter-gatherer bands. Africans came as slaves from Senegal, Nigeria, Congo and Angola, bringing old traditions and creating new ones. These diverse peoples blended together to form a new people. This was a place of violence, slavery and oppression --but also of art, faith, new societies, new ideas. P This course is an introduction to the history of modern Latin America. Through lectures, discussions, shared readings, we will explore major themes in the past two hundred years of Latin American history, from the early nineteenth-century independence movements to the recent "Left Turn" in Latin American politics. Some of the topics we will examine include the racial politics of state-formation; the fraught history of U.S.-Latin American relations; the cultural politics of nationalism; how modernity was defined in relation to gender and sexuality; and the emergence of authoritarian regimes and revolutionary mobilizations, and the role of religion in shaping these processes. A robust introduction to Middle East history from early-modern to contemporary times. We begin in Reconquista Spain with the expulsion of Iberia's longstanding Muslim and Jewish populations, before journeying to the eastern Mediterranean at the Ottoman Empire's zenith. In the "long" 19th-20th centuries, we explore modern tensions shaping this amorphous but pivotal region, including: colonialism, nationalism, and Islamism; water, fossil fuels, and information infrastructures; constitutionalism, authoritarianism, and "street" politics; and interventions by the US, USSR/Russia, and local powers. Emphasizing socioeconomic, legal, and environmental history perspectives, our goal is to unearth the roots of conflict and other conditions shaping today's "Mideast." The Ottoman Empire was the longest lived, most powerful, and most controversial Muslim dynasty in history. From Turkish nomads in Asia to multiethnic empire straddling three continents, the Ottomans became the premier power of the early-modern Mediterranean and last to single-handedly govern most of today's "Middle East." Yet, the empire's formation and evolution-fusing Persianate, Mongol, and Roman heritages, as well as Muslim, Christian, and Jewish populaces-remain little understood. Navigating multiple regions and eras, we'll explore the contours of Ottoman history-from medieval beginnings to modern legacies, including those surviving the empire's partition and demise after WWI. This course uses the American Civil War of 1861-1865 to investigate certain issues relevant to current domestic and global affairs: the use of history in popular memory and popular culture (focusing on the Civil War in public art and film); the role of law in the prosecution and resolution of war; international law, especially as it applies to war and human rights. The course is aimed at students interested in history, law, and international relations. There are no prerequisites--the course is accessible to students at all levels--but some knowledge of U.S. history might be useful. Religion has played an undeniable role in the contemporary American cultural landscape. This course lends some perspective on the present by investigating the various and, at times, surprising role religion has played in history in the shaping of American culture from 1865 to the present.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">HIST 0150D.

In this course, we put current events in the context of the past 500 years, exploring how climate, plants, animals, and microbiota -not just humans -acted as agents in history. From imperialism to the industrial revolution and from global capitalism to environmental activism, we will examine how nature and culture intermingled to create the modern world. This is an introduction to environmental history and assumes no prior courses. People have always attempted to promote health and prolong life, and to ameliorate bodily suffering. Those living in parts of Eurasia also developed textual traditions that, together with material remains, allow historians to explore their medical practices and explanations, including changes in their traditions, sometimes caused by interactions with other peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa. We'll introduce students to major medical traditions of the Old World to 1700, with emphasis on Europe, and explore some reasons for change. A knowledge of languages and the social and natural sciences is welcome not required. P From the 18th century onward, Western medicine has claimed universal validity due to its scientific foundations, relegating other kinds of medicine to the status of "alternative" practices. The course therefore examines the development of scientific medicine in Europe and elsewhere up to the late 20th century, and its relationships with other medical ideas, practices, and traditions. Students with a knowledge of languages and the social and natural sciences are welcome but no prerequisites are required. On the eve of the First World War, many Europeans cheered for a "war to end all wars." It achieved nothing of the like, instead inaugurating a century of war and unthinkable destruction. This seminar explores the history of the first truly global conflict, examining its origins, its course, its aftermath, and how it might help us better understand our own world today. A broad set of primary sources, from soldiers' diaries to rationing cards, artwork, and diplomatic cables, forms the basis for discussion. Designed as an introduction to historical inquiry and writing. This seminar uses life, legacy, myth of Abraham Lincoln to explore central themes such as frontier in early republic, nature of political leadership, law/legal culture, and emergence of sectionalism, slavery, antislavery, Civil War. Frequent short writing assignments and research investigations allow students in-depth explorations of Lincoln's works, the writings of his contemporaries, and modern non-fiction, fiction, and film. The course enables us to consider two larger themes: 1) the relationship between memory and history; and 2) the function of history in modern society. The course has no prerequisites and does not presuppose special knowledge of American history. In the middle of the eighteenth century, the Americas belonged to a handful of European monarchies; within a few decades, most of the Americas was composed of independent republics, some of the European monarchs were either deposed or quaking on their thrones. Usually considered separately, revolutions in British North America, France, Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and Spanish America had diverse local circumstances yet composed a single cycle of intellectual ferment, imperial reform, accelerating violence and, forging of new political communities. We will examine revolutions that helped create the world we live in. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. P The United States is the only country in the world in which practically every institution of higher education finances and promotes high-caliber athletics. How did this phenomenon happen? Has there ever been any resistance to its happening? How and when did African Americans integrate collage sports? Did Title IX really open up opportunities for women in college sports? Are sports the "front door" of colleges and universities? This course examines these and other questions as it examines the interrelationship between the histories of sports and higher education in the U.S. Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, cites the ancient political thinker Han Feizi (280-233 BCE) as an important influence on his approach to governance. He has also embraced (as have several leaders before him) some of the political and social ideals of Confucianism -ideals first stated in the sixth century BCE. This lecture-and-discussion course traces the history of Chinese political thinking from the first Chinese state to the present, emphasizing first, those ideas that continue to shape Chinese notions of governance, and second, comparisons between these and American political ideals. P As the current revival of Confucianism in the People's Republic of China demonstrates, the past is still very much alive in China today. This lectureand-discussion course surveys the history of China from the origins of the first state through the twilight of the imperial period in the nineteenth century. Lectures are designed and the reading assignments chosen to emphasize in particular those ideas and beliefs, institutions and government structures, and literary and artistic developments that have shaped (and continue to shape) China today. "Imperial China" provides the knowledge necessary for informed study of modern China. P How did the Chinese empire become a nation-state? This question drives a survey of the history of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Chinese societies overseas from 1895 to the present. We will explore a variety of conceptions of the Chinese nation and the rise of new state formations,</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">HIST 0523P. The First World War.

The armed conflict began in 1937 with the Japanese invasion of China and ended in 1945 with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some attention is paid to military developments, but the principle concerns fall into the areas of mutual images, mobilization, and memory. Explores essential social, cultural, and religious foundation blocks of Western Civilization, 200 BCE to 800 CE. The main theme is the eternal struggle between universalism and particularism, including: Greek elitism vs. humanism; Roman imperialism vs. inclusion; Jewish assimilation vs. orthodoxy; Christian fellowship vs. exclusion, and Islamic transcendence vs. imminence. We will study how ancient Western individuals and societies confronted oppression and/or dramatic change and developed intellectual and spiritual strategies still in use today. Students should be prepared to examine religious thought from a secular point of view. There is no prerequisite or assumed knowledge of the period. P The overarching theme of the course is the relationship between modernity and the primitive as manifested in major cultural, aesthetic and political movements in the 20th century. Films are an integral part of the course. This course explores the variety of Italian women's histories, issues of gender and sexuality, and ingenious responses to circumvent the social, economic, religious, and political limitations placed upon them during the early modern period (1400-1800). Italian women produced some of the foundational texts of historical feminism, the intellectual and cultural movement that advanced the idea of equality across genders and the necessity of equal access to opportunity and education. This course surveys the alternatives proposed to the gender hierarchies of Italian society and will include selections from archival documents, letters, literature, treatises, and the visual arts. Why do we think that one human being can judge another? How did this activity, enshrined in legal and political systems, profoundly shape society? We'll examine the changing face of justice, from the medieval ordeal to judicial torture; expansion of inquisitorial and state law courts; and the eventual disillusionment with the use of torture and the death penalty in the eighteenth century. Using Italy as focus, the course explores how law courts defined social, political, scientific, and religious truth in Italy. Examines politics, religion, and society from the Protestant Reformation to the Puritan Revolution-a period of rapid and dramatic change when the world, for most English people, was turned upside down. Considers the experiences and concerns of ordinary men and women, as well as the elite. Takes in Scotland, Ireland, and the great migration to New England. P A survey of British history from the restoration of monarchy to the Wilkes affair and the loss of the American colonies. In addition to political developments such as the Glorious Revolution and the rise of party, examines political ideology (including the great political theorist, John Locke) and various themes in social history (such as crime, popular protest, the sexual revolution, and the experiences of women). P This course examines late Soviet socialism, the collapse of the USSR, and the emergence of the new Russia. The following themes are emphasized in lectures and readings: the major features of de-Stalinization; Soviet and Russian foreign policy during and after the Cold War; the domestic and international causes and consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union; and the emergence of a new Russian government and national identity during the 1990s and early 2000s. This course aims to provide a basic factual knowledge of the French Revolution, an understanding of the major historiographic debates about the revolutionary period, and a sense of the worldwide impact of events occurring in late-eighteenth century France. A strong historiographic focus will direct our attention to the gendered nature of the revolutionary project; the tension between liberty and equality that runs throughout French history; the intersection of race and citizenship in the Revolution; and the plausibility of competing social, political, and cultural interpretations of the Revolution. This course critically examines the economic, and particularly, the financial history of the modern Middle East in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is structured chronologically and thematically. It starts in the mid-19th century by examining the role of European states, as well as private European investment firms and oil companies, in facilitating the colonization of the region via loans, capitulations, and extractive concession agreements. It then shifts to the post-colonial period, studying how western oil companies, banks, investment firms, and multi-national organizations shaped the trajectories of the newly-independent states in the Middle East.</figDesc><table><row><cell>HIST 1262F.

With readings from Gandhi, Marx and Tagore, amongst others, this course interrogates relationships between power and knowledge, histories from below, as well as violence and political mobilizations that would, by the mid-twentieth century, bring down an empire and create a bloody and enduring divide with the birth of two nation-states. With a fifth of the world's population on a twentieth of its land, the ecosystems of China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam have been thoroughly transformed by human activity. This course will explore the human impact on the environment from the first farmers to the industrial present, exploring how wildlife was eliminated by the spread of agriculture, how states colonized the subcontinent, how people rebuilt water systems, and how modern communism and capitalism have accelerated environmental change. Each week we will examine primary sources like paintings, essays, maps and poems. The course assumes no background in Asian or environmental history. This course examines the creation and circulation of scientific knowledge in Renaissance Europe, ca. 1450-1600. We will explore the practices, materials, and ideas not just of astronomers and natural philosophers, but also of healers, botanists, astrologers, alchemists, and artisans. How did social, political, economic, and artistic developments during this period reshape how naturalists proposed to learn about, collect, manipulate, and commercialize nature? We will also consider the ways in which colonial projects forced Europeans to engage with other "ways of knowing" and rethink classical knowledge systems. P How was the physical human body imagined, understood, and treated in life and death in the late ancient Mediterranean world? Drawing on evidence from written sources, artistic representations, and archaeological excavations, this class will explore this question by interweaving thematic lectures and student analysis of topics including disease and medicine, famine, asceticism, personal adornment and ideals of beauty, suffering, slavery, and the boundaries between the visible world and the afterlife, in order to understand and interpret the experiences of women, men, and children who lived as individuals-and not just as abstractions-at the end of antiquity. P Philosopher George Santayana famously warned that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Ten years later, industrialist Henry Ford perhaps even more famously dismissed that notion: "History is more or less bunk." What we mean by history and how we construct and use it are essential questions in all societies. Thinking Historically explores how we view and employ the past. The course examines major ways of interpreting the past through a survey of historians and methods and studies how history is produced, used, and misused, by professionals as well as by the public. Cross-dressing knights, virgin saints, homophobic priests, and mystics who speak in the language of erotic desire are but some of the medieval people considered in this seminar. This course examines how conceptions of sin, sanctity, and sexuality in the High Middle Ages intersected with structures of power in this period. While the seminar primarily focuses on Christian culture, it also considers Muslim and Jewish experience. Alchemists claiming to possess the philosophers' stone; basilisks for sale in the market; Jews pretending to be Catholics; women dressing as men: early modern Europe appeared to be an age of impostors. Officials responded to this perceived threat by hiring experts and creating courts, licenses, passports, and other methods of surveillance in an era before reliable documentation, photography, DNA. And yet one person's fraud was another's self-fashioning. We will examine instances of dissimulation, self-fashioning, and purported fraud, efforts to identify and stem deception, and debates about what was at stake when people and things were not what they seemed. P There were multiple forms of slavery in the Early Modern world. We will look at three major systems: Mediterranean slavery and the Barbary Corsairs, Black Sea slavery and slave elites of the Ottoman Empire, and the Atlantic triangular trade. We will examine the religious, political, racial, and economic bases for these slave systems, and compare the experiences of individual slaves and slave societies. Topics discussed include gender and sexuality (e.g. the institution of the Harem and the eunuchs who ran it), the connection between piracy and slavery, and the roles of slavery in shaping the Western world. P In this course students will examine in detail one of the most deadly and perplexing phenomena of the twentieth century: Stalinism. Readinngs will introduce students to major events of Soviet history from the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s as well as debates among historians about how to interpret those events? This seminar introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Middle East Studies in the broader context of the history of area studies in the humanities and social sciences. Why and when did the Middle East become an area of study? What are the approaches and topics that have shaped the development of this field? And what are the political implications of contending visions for its future? The readings sample canonical and alternative works and the classes feature visits by leading scholars who research and write on this pivotal and amorphous region. This seminar explores connections and exchanges between the diverse peoples of two constructed regions: the Middle East and North America. The course proceeds chronologically from the global context surrounding Columbus's 1492 voyage, eventually focusing on US relations with the "Mideast." But we'll not stop there. Rather, we'll read closely for underlying socioeconomic, diplomatic, and cultural processes-including trade, migration, education, and evolving conceptions of race, religion, and citizenship-themes often ignored by conventional histories that dwell on watershed events, personalities, or conflict. Our goal: to recognize how American-Mideast ties are far more complex, rich, and deep-rooted than is generally assumed This advanced undergraduate seminar seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the links between the region now known as Israel and Palestine and the peoples that have inhabited it or have made it into part of their mental, mythical. and religious landscape throughout history. The course will be interdisciplinary at its very core, engaging the perspectives of historians, geologists, geographers, sociologists, scholars of religion and the arts, politics and media. At the very heart of the seminar is the question: What makes for the bond between groups and place -real or imagined, tangible or ephemeral. No prerequisites required. This seminar investigates the historical bases of some of the major debates which continue to dominate contemporary discussions on the Middle East. These include debates on colonialism and its legacies; problems associated with the post-colonial Middle Eastern state (the "democracy deficit": human rights; oil; political Islam); and arguments about the causes and consequences of some of the major events in Middle Eastern history (the Israel-Palestinian conflict; the Iranian revolution; the Lebanese civil war; 9/11 and the Iraq invasion; and the Arab Spring). This course explores alternatives to the common view that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a struggle between two nationalist movements over the same land. Moving away from state-centric political discourse, it engages the questions of imperialism, settler-colonialism, and displacement from a bottom-up perspective of everyday life of Palestinian communities in historic Palestine and the Diaspora. How do these internally divided and spatially fragmented communities negotiate the present and imagine the future? Ultimately, the course asks: What does it mean to be a Palestinian? And what can the Palestinian condition teach us about the modern world?</figDesc><table><row><cell>HIST 1835A. Spr HIST1835A S01 24612 MWF HIST 1969F.</cell><cell>12:00-12:50(05)</cell><cell>(J.

Contested Histories of Colonial Indochina: Encounters, Social Transformations, Legacies of Empire.1992. History Honors Workshop for Prospective Thesis Writers.</head><label></label><figDesc>The digital revolution is transforming the study of history. But is it allowing us to better recover the voices and lived experiences of people in the past? This course considers the possibilities and pitfalls of using digital tools to understand the lives of enslaved men and women in the Americas between 1500 and 1800. Each session considers a different digital humanities project, supplemented by primary sources and recent books. For their final project, students will contribute to the Database of Indigenous Slavery in the Americas, which is hosted here at Brown. There are no prerequisites for this course. P Undergraduate seminar on the United States and international law. Focuses mainly on the period before the twentieth century. Examines subjects such as the right of revolution; the evolution of U.S. Constitution law; law as an instrument of economic development and exploitation; and the evolution of rights-consciousness-all within the context of international law. Enrollment limited to 20. Students should contact the instructor before the beginning of the semester if they are interested in taking the course. Instructor permission required. This seminar explores the gendered and racial histories of disease and medicine in nineteenth and twentieth century Latin America and the United States. From the dark history of obstetrics and slavery in the antebellum U.S. South to twentieth-century efforts to curb venereal disease in revolutionary Mexico or U.S.-occupied Puerto Rico, to debates over HIV policy in Cuba and Brazil-together we will explore how modern medicine has shaped both race and gender in the Americas. Topics we will explore include environmental health and the body; infant mortality; the medicalization of birth; and the colonial/imperial history of new reproductive technologies. This seminar explores the history of French colonial Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos) from 1858 to 1945. Challenging Euro-centric narratives of colonialism, we will critically analyze the colonial encounter as complex exchanges, geographically diverse, and socially uneven. We will examine the mechanisms and limitations of the colonial state, capitalism, cultural institutions, and science and technology. Rather than position colonialism as an external agent of change, this seminar dedicates attention to local agency, social and cultural transformations, and the creative production of ideas, print media, and urban and religious communities especially in 1920's to 1940's Hanoi, Saigon, and Phnom Penh. Guided reading on selected topics. Section numbers vary by instructor.Please check Banner for the correct section number and CRN to use when registering for this course.

A Global History of Art and Architecture.Introduction to American Art: The 19th Century.</head><label></label><figDesc>This collaborative seminar focuses on identifying and contextualizing a dissertation topic; choosing a dissertation committee and a support network; designing and executing plans for research and writing; and articulating a thesis project as a prospectus, grant proposal, and other oral and written forms. This is a required course for and open only to third-year students in the History Ph.D. program. This graduate course encourages a rethinking of the complex components, arguments and activities that have characterized what we have come to know as the Civil Rights Movement, concentrating primarily on African American agency, actions and politics, through careful reading of recent scholarship in the field. While knowledge of U.S. history is preferred, this course asks larger thematic questions about protest movements (the role of the state, relationships with and between oppressed groups and organizations, and periodization), that will interest non-Americanists also. Some of the topics covered include: gender, organizing and strategies, the local, global ramifications and interactions, organizational structures and politics, and the recent concept of the Long Civil Rights Movement. M Over the past several decades, the field of medieval history has been reshaped radically. New approaches have changed the ways in which medievalists think about old subjects. Our understanding of medieval society itself has expanded as previously marginalized or unexplored subjects have become central to medievalists' concerns. This seminar explores the ways in which medievalist historians have altered how they practice their craft in response to these developments. Readings in classic older works are juxtaposed with newer ones on the way to becoming classics themselves. This seminar examines the relationship between History as a narrative of events and history as individual experience. Postulating that historical events as related by historians were experienced in numerous different ways by their protagonists, the seminar focuses on the complementary and contradictory aspects of this often fraught relationship at times of crisis, especially in war and genocide. While much time will be spent on World War II and the Holocaust, the seminar will engage with other modern wars and genocides across the world. Materials will include eyewitness reports, postwar testimonies and trial records, memoirs and relevant works of fiction. Open to graduate students only. M Introduction to the global history of art, architecture and material culture from cave paintings to installation art. The course is both an historical survey as well as an analysis of case study examples. In addition to examining visual strategies of representation, the course explores the varied ways in which art shapes and reflects cultural, social, religious, and political concerns. Weekly one-hour conference required. Limited to 225. A This undergraduate lecture course traces the rise of American painting in the period from the Revolution to the dawn of modernism in the 20th century. Major figures, such as Thomas Cole, Frederick Church, Winslow Homer and Albert Pinkham Ryder, will be examined, as will significant movements, such as the Hudson River School and Tonalism. Discussion will help place American art within the context of history, the invention of national identity, and parallel developments in popular visual culture.

Close study and discussion of Dante's deployment of systems of retribution in the Inferno and rehabilitation in the Purgatorio with a view to imagining a society based on love and resistant to the effects of nascent capitalism and the money economy. Dante's work summarizes and transforms the entire ancient and medieval tradition of literature, philosophy, and science. Close study and discussion of Boccaccio's collection of 100 tales told by ten young Florentines over a period of two weeks, while in flight from the devastating plague of 1348. The Decameron defined the standard of Italian prose narrative for four centuries and deeply influenced Renaissance drama. We will also pay particular attention to visualizations and adaptations of the Decameron into a variety of media, from manuscript illumination to painting, theatre and film. Students will contribute to the Decameron Web, the award-winning Boccaccio web site administered by the department of Italian Studies. Sections in English and Italian. Enrollment limited to 40. This course explores the variety of Italian women's histories, issues of gender and sexuality, and ingenious responses to circumvent the social, economic, religious, and political limitations placed upon them during the early modern period (1400-1800). Italian women produced some of the foundational texts of historical feminism, the intellectual and cultural movement that advanced the idea of equality across genders and the necessity of equal access to opportunity and education. This course surveys the alternatives proposed to the gender hierarchies of Italian society and will include selections from archival documents, letters, literature, treatises, and the visual arts. A look at the dramatic events that transformed Italy over the past two centuries and the ways that this history has been represented in film. For the nineteenth century, the focus is on the violent birth of the modern Italian nation-state. For the twentieth century, the course focuses on the drama of Benito Mussolini and the birth, life, and death of Italian Fascism. In addition to examining the transformation of Italian history, the course investigates the many issues involved in turning a book of history into a commercial film. How can storytelling help us cope with complexity? How can novels help us detect and debunk conspiracy theories? We will read major works by Italian fiction masters Italo Calvino (If On A Winter's Night ATraveler,  1979)  and Umberto Eco (The Name of theRose, 1980, Foucault's  Pendulum, 1988, The Prague Cemetery, 2010, tackling the paradoxes of "fake news" and "conspiratorial evidence" from Luther Blissett's Q (1999) to Q'Anon.

Prerequisite: HEBR 0400 or equivalent. Enrollment limited to 20. In recent decades, there has been a resurgence of religiosity in contemporary society, while at the same time many have been skeptical and even hostile to religious belief and practice. Others are just not sure what to believe. We will study selections of fiction and memoirs by writers of Christian and Jewish background that explore such situations as the affirmation or negation of the existence of God, the role of religious ritual in a person's life, and the positive and negative impacts on society of religious institutions and the clergy who lead them. Enrollment limited to 19 first-year students. Israel's history has unfolded under the shadow of its prolonged conflict with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors. This first year seminar will survey the military aspect of this conflict. The major aim of the course is to present an historical survey of the Israeli-Arab wars and Jewish-Palestinian encounters in the 20th century. This will provide some of the necessary background for understanding the present phase of theArab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, and help in comprehending the roots and causes of contemporary controversies between Israel and the Palestinians and/or its Arab neighboring states. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. What are angels and demons, what roles do they play in religious thought, and how do their roles change or remain consistent over time? These are only a few of the questions this course seeks to address. Texts to be considered include the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, rabbinic literature, the Kabbalah, records of the Salem Witch Trials, Milton's Paradise Lost, Goethe's Faust, the Book of Mormon, contemporary Evangelical literature and New Age writings, and representations of angels and demons in film and television. No prior knowledge of the Bible, Judaism or Christianity is assumed.Ancient Israel produced a great body of narrative art that is preserved in the Bible-Genesis, Exodus, the warriors of Judges, the story of David's founding of Israel and the succession to Solomon. The Jewish culture that followed extended the story-telling tradition in new directions-Daniel, the "novel women" of Esther, Susanna, and Judith. These brilliant and powerful stories inspired equally powerful images in art and sculpture. Both story and image still affect us. This course will explore the ancient narratives as story and the art they inspired as visual image.</figDesc><table><row><cell>ITAL 2980.

Attempts to analyze the meaning of the Holocaust from three vantage points: that of European, and more particularly, German history; that of Jewish history; and that of those states and religious institutions which shared responsibility. Enrollment limited to 40. If unable to enroll because of closed registration please contact the professor and a wait list will be created. The seminar explores the relationship between humor, popular culture and Jewish ethnic identity in early 20th-century Europe and America. It argues that self-deprecating humor and satiric performance of Jewish stereotypes were not expressions of self-hatred, but complex cultural gestures that led to in integration within mainstream society. Topics to be considered are: the joke as a social gesture; the Jewish music hall as an urban institution;the politics of blackface in American Vaudeville; the East-European Jews in Hollywood. African Americans and American Jews have interacted throughout the history of the United States. Through readings, images, and films, this course will explore this complex, sometimes tortured relationship in its religious, cultural and political aspects. It will discuss the role of Jews in the slave trade, the contributions of both groups to American popular culture, both groups' involvement in the struggle for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the rise of Black Power, attitudes to Zionism, affirmative action and more. We will try to answer the question how the experiences of both groups both overlapped and led to conflict.

Considers issues like: What is the just distribution of resources and opportunities in society? And complementary policy issues like: affirmative action, immigration, public provision of health care and social welfare. Asks whether/how liberal democracies can come to consensus on contentious moral issues like abortion, and what the ethical roles of politicians and citizens are in such struggles. Focus will be on growing partisan polarization in American politics. Existence of polarization in institutions like House of Representatives, Senate, the presidency, federal courts, media, and religion will be examined. Emphasis will include the roles of political elites, non-elites, lobbyists, money in politics, red states/blue states, House and Senate rules, particular pressures created by budget, domestic, foreign policy, defense and homeland security issues. Requires extensive reading, detailed paper, take-home final exam and active class participation. Expectation to remain informed about current events as they apply to partisan polarization and to weigh the impacts of polarized politics on a democratic nation. Debates over capitalism and its alternatives date back centuries. Proponents say that market institutions have enabled extraordinary productivity growth and life-saving innovations. Trade and the division of labor have been central to human progress in recent centuries. Capitalism's critics point out that the growth of market economies has often had unacceptable consequences. The course is organized around four main challenges facing market economies today: environmental degradation, labor exploitation, inequality, and crisis. Can capitalism be reformed to solve the problems that it has helped generate, or is a market system unequipped to grapple with social and environmental challenges? Topics covered include the state and challenges to the state of social class, ethnicity, immigration and religion; political parties and the formation of governing coalitions; new social movements and new political identities; voting behavior and other forms of mass politics; the European Union. Focus on democratic quality in modern Latin America, its failures as well as its successes. Topics include police violence, the rule of law, indigenous movements, gender and gay rights, anti-poverty policy, and direct democracy. Will draw on material from across the Spanish and Portuguese speaking democracies in the region. We will engage with different theories of what makes democracies representative and accountable to their citizens. Not open to first years. This course examines the causes and consequences of China's societal transformation and emergence as a global power. Employing perspectives from comparative politics, international relations, and economics, the course explores the connections between China's domestic transformation and its integration with the global system.

After the collapse of Communism in 1989, ECE states embraced democracy, liberal economics and their 'return to Europe' after decades of Soviet domination. By 2007 all had entered the European Union, and political scientists viewed most as 'consolidated' democracies. In the years since, populist parties have emerged, won elections, and promoted illiberal, nationalistic and anti-EU policies.

What can food tell us about religion, politics, and culture? Food in South Asia often shapes identity, social status, ritual purity, religious belonging, and political activism-the notion that you are what you eat has wide currency. Whatever form it takes, food embodies histories of migration, trade, empire, colonialism, and ethics. Through reading primary texts and ethnographic articles, watching films, and (of course) eating delicious food, we will explore the rich foodways of South Asia and their social, religious, and political ramifications.</note></figure>

A mantra is a syllable or formula used in ritual and meditation. Mantras are central to Indian religions-not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language-usually in Sanskrit-while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices?

Drawing on Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, and concentrating on embodied practices such meditation, chanting, eating, sex, asceticism, ritual, possession, and performance, we will examine experiences of the sacred in India, past and present. How has sensory culture shaped lives, practices, and doctrines? What place do the senses have in South Asian traditions? Drawing on premodern law codes, erotic handbooks, and medical treatises; and integrating new media from ethnographic films to graphic novels, we will plunge into to the rich sense- worlds of religions in South Asia.Spr SAST0037 S01 25795 Arranged (F.

Social forces constrain and empower us, bond us together and push us apart. Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues and topics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout the social sciences. Emphasis on understanding the interrelations among economic, political, and cultural aspects of change in developing countries. The experience of currently developing nations is contrasted to that of nations which industrialized in the 19th century. Compares the different development strategies which have been adopted by currently developing nations and their consequences for social change.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">SLAV XLIST.

And how is social change -that is, the making of new rules and expectations -possible? When we respond to rules, do we act as free-willing individuals or do we follows social structures we have no control over? These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments have been already developed by the four "forefathers" of sociology: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Georg Simmel. Looking at the transformations around them -the rise of capitalism, the modern nationstate, rational bureaucracy, the metropolitan, the decline of religion, and much more -they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">SOC 1010.

Principles and Methods of Geographic Information Systems.</head><label></label><figDesc>Introduction to data and research methods for private and public sector organizations. Data used in market research include trends in the population of consumers, economic trends, trends within sectors and industries, analyses of product sales and services, and specific studies of products, promotional efforts, and consumer reactions. Emphasizes the use of demographic, GIS, and other available data. Applies sociological analysis to understand present and historical cases of ethnic and race relations and conflicts. Topics addressed are the social construction of race and ethnicity; historical processes of racialization; ethnic conflict and the nation state; and the linkages between race, class, and social mobility. Focuses on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S., but also has a strong international comparative component. Examines historical trends and determinants of migration from Latin America to the United States. Each stage of the migration process is examined: the decision to migrate, getting across international borders, settlement and integration in destinations, and return to places of origin. The course integrates theories and empirical studies of international migration with hands-on analysis of survey data from the Mexican and Latin American Migration Projects, the two largest survey databases for studying migration in the Americas. Students will learn how to formulate and operationalize research hypotheses, read, process, and analyze survey data files, and present and interpret research results. Cities are being reshaped by immigration, economic restructuring, and other forces. This course reviews these changes from several perspectives, including the patterns and causes of change, the role of politics and public policy, and how different groups of people (by class, race, and national origin) manage under the new conditions. Readings will emphasize historical and cross-national comparisons. The course focuses on the personal and structural sources and consequences of violence in the U.S. We investigate three levels of violence: interpersonal; institutional, wherein social institutions do violence to individuals or groups; and structural, examining the structures of society that tolerate or promote violence, both within the society and toward other societies. Next, we examine the culture of violence that permeates our society, including the mass media and violence. WE focus on specific forms of violence in our society, including gang violence, bullying, violence within schools, sex trafficking, war, religious violence, and terrorism.</figDesc><table><row><cell>SOC 1270.

This class offers a review of some of the most interesting contemporary social theorists and the most intense debates in current sociological thought. It thematically reviews the works of Jurgen Habermas on the public sphere, Michel Foucault on disciplinary and governmental modes of power, Bruno Latour on modernity and modern science, Pierre Bourdieu on field and habitus and among others. No prerequisites. Emphasis on ethnographic field work through participant observation and interviews. Some attention to content analysis and visual sociology. Technical training in developing observational and interview guidelines, data collection, coding, transcript analysis, and computer applications. Strong emphasis on quality writing. Analysis of ethnographic research in book and article format. Attention to recent developments in ethnography, especially reflexivity and autoethnography. This seminar aims to provide students a solid base in the analysis of racial and ethnic boundaries, identities, and inequalities. The seminar addresses a number of central topics in the field and acquaints the students with some key works. The course is divided in three parts. The first part focuses on how race constituted the modern world and on contemporary forms of racialization. The second part focuses on the construction of nations and challenges to their ethnic and racial boundaries. The third part of the course looks at contemporary boundaries of race and ethnicity in the United States. Open to upper level undergraduates with permission of instructor. This course investigates Du Bois' empirical and theoretical sociological work and its implications for contemporary sociology. W.E.B Du Bois is recognized as a pioneer of sociology of race, but his work is seldom explored. The first part of this course we discuss in-depth Du Bois work to construct the bases for a Du Boisian sociology. The second part we will read contemporary theories of race through the lens of Du Bois' work. The final section we will read contemporary empirical works in the field of race and ethnicity, reflect how we would conduct them differently from a Du Boisian perspective.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SOC 2210.

In this intermediate course, we will focus on bolstering our writerly voices while defining ongoing artistic practices. In this hybrid workshop and seminar, we will work toward writing one-act plays of our own, while investigating other writer's worlds. In the plays we will encounter this semester, characters engage in some form of role play. We end up asking: what does it mean to play? How does a play play? Through this study, we will ask what it means for characters to be active, how to write plot as an offering of contrasts and tensions, and where exactly character is composed.

Monologues, scene study, and improvisation are basis for comment on individual problems. Reading of dramatic texts and theory. Substantial scene rehearsal commitment necessary. Attendance mandatory. Not open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 20. Instructor permission required. No permission will be given during pre-registration. S/NC Each dance is taught in relationship to relevant oral histories, folklore and contemporary expressions. Emphasis is placed upon building a mindful community of committed thinkers and doers. Attendance at the first class is required. There is an application process for enrollment. Enrollment limited to 100. S/NC This course delves deeply into the Viewpoints as directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau have adapted and defined them for training performers and generating composition. Viewpoints Technique systematically breaks down elements of time and space, providing a precise language for makers to communicate about dynamic staging and offering performing artists the tools to direct themselves more successfully from within composition. An indispensable practice for ensemble awareness, Viewpoints Technique invites us to break down the binary of the dance artist and theatre artist. All performers can benefit from this rigorous investigation of time and space and the pursuit of cohesive ensemble. An introduction to the breadth of topics covered in the TAPS Department, this class is a gateway to the concentration open to all students interested in live arts. We will explore how, where, and why theatre, dance and performance are made and investigate their relationship to broader culture and society. Students will learn basics: how to read a play, how to appreciate dance, and how to approach the variety of venues, histories, and methods involved in production. Overlaps with other media will be explored. Visits from TAPS faculty will dovetail with the season of offerings on the TAPS main stage. .A complete and well-seasoned actor has the ability to perform with specificity and ease, both vocally and physically. Specificity comes from an integration of speech and movement technique. Ease is only possible when a mastery of technical skills reaches the point where the actor can integrate them without loss of spontaneity. The goal of this class is to give the student the fundamental techniques of voice and speech in relation to the body. Prerequisite: TAPS 0230. Enrollment limited to 16.

Please check Banner for the correct section number and CRN to use when registering for this course. For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis. To many students, an exclusive emphasis on specialized studies fragments the "world" in which they live. A widespread feeling of loss pervades the minds of students who often come to universities to learn right from wrong, to distinguish what is true from what is false, but who realize at the end of four years that they have deconstructed their freshman beliefs, values, and ideologies, but have created nothing to replace them. This course examines the diversity of worldviews both synchronically and diachronically and surveys various explanations for such diversity. Enrollment limited to 30. Conducted in English. This introductory course to Urban Studies is taught in an entirely new format. Led by Professor Zipp, it will include lectures by Urban Studies faculty who will present their views of the field. It offers an interdisciplinary approach to the history, physical design, spatial form, economy, government, cultures, and social life of cities worldwide. Which are the most urgent issues facing cities today? How will continued urban growth affect the environment? How can we learn from historic approaches to urban planning? Which are the most promising solutions to relieve urban inequality? What can be learned from 'informal housing' developments? This course examines the history of urban and social welfare policy in the United States and abroad. It reviews major theories accounting for the origins and subsequent development of welfare states, explains the "exceptional" nature of American public policy, and employs a combination of historical texts and case studies to analyze the connections between politics and the urban environment.</figDesc><table><row><cell>TAPS 2990.

At least two different academic disciplines should be represented in the ten courses. Courses in which the student did substantial work on a Latin American, Caribbean, or Latinx subject may count toward this total, even if the course as a whole has a more general subject matter. Concentrators should periodically update their courses on ASK and confirm with the Director of Undergraduate Studies that they are on track to meeting the coursework requirement. Competence in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Haitian Kreyol, Kaqchikel Maya, etc. may be demonstrated through a departmental test, AP credit, language courses at Brown or elsewhere, study abroad, etc; please contact the concentration advisor to confirm. (If the student's primary area of study is the Anglophone Caribbean, a field language is not necessary.)3. An internship or volunteer service, located in the U.S. or overseas, for one semester or one summer. Work completed during study abroad may count toward this requirement. The service work will connect theory to practice, applying scholarly knowledge to social challenges. Students are encouraged to consult with the Swearer Center for Public Service for assistance finding a volunteer placement. Students should also meet with the DUS by the beginning of junior year to discuss their work plan for their service component.

An application consists of a brief statement addressing the focus of a proposed thesis and the names and signatures of two faculty members from the Department of Anthropology who have agreed to serve as the student's honors committee-one as honors thesis advisor, the other as a reader. Candidates for honors are required to:</p><p>1. Fulfill the standard concentration requirements.</p><p>2. Take two additional courses, usually , which may be used for thesis preparation.</p><p>3. Have a majority of A's in the concentration. 4. Submit an approved honors thesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Mathematics</head><p>The concentration in Applied Mathematics allows students to investigate the mathematics of problems arising in the physical, life and social sciences as well as in engineering. The basic mathematical skills of Applied Mathematics come from a variety of sources, which depend on the problems of interest: the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations, matrix theory, statistical sciences, probability and decision theory, risk and insurance analysis, among others. Applied Mathematics appeals to people with a variety of different interests, ranging from those with a desire to obtain a good quantitative background for use in some future career, to those who are interested in the basic techniques and approaches in themselves. The standard concentration leads to either the A.B. or Sc.B. degree. Students may also choose to pursue a joint program with biology, computer science or economics. The undergraduate concentration guide is available here (http://www.brown.edu/academics/ applied-mathematics/undergraduate).</p><p>Both the A.B. and Sc.B. concentrations in Applied Mathematics require certain basic courses to be taken, but beyond this there is a great deal of flexibility as to which areas of application are pursued. Students are encouraged to take courses in applied mathematics, mathematics and one or more of the application areas in the natural sciences, social sciences or engineering. Whichever areas are chosen should be studied in some depth. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Science-Economics</head><p>The joint Computer Science-Economics concentration exposes students to the theoretical and practical connections between computer science and economics. It prepares students for professional careers that incorporate aspects of economics and computer technology and for academic careers conducting research in areas that emphasize the overlap between the two fields. Concentrators may choose to pursue either the A.B. or the Sc.B. degree. While the A.B. degree allows students to explore the two disciplines by taking advanced courses in both departments, its smaller number of required courses is compatible with a liberal education. The Sc.B. degree achieves greater depth in both computer science and economics by requiring more courses, and it offers students the opportunity to creatively integrate both disciplines through a design requirement. In addition to courses in economics, computer science, and applied mathematics, all concentrators must fulfill the Computer Science department's writing requirement by passing a course that involves significant expository writing. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineering and Physics</head><p>The Sc.B. program in Engineering and Physics is sponsored jointly by the School of Engineering and the Department of Physics. The program is designed to ensure that students take a significant portion of the usual curriculum in Engineering and in Physics, obtain substantial laboratory experience, and take several upper-level elective courses, focusing on applied science. Students may take either the standard Physics or Engineering programs during their freshman and sophomore years and then switch to this combined program. The Sc.B. degree program in Engineering and Physics is not accredited by ABET.</p><p>The following standard program assumes that a student begins mathematics courses at Brown with MATH 0170 or its equivalent. Students who begin in MATH 0200 can substitute an additional science, engineering or higher-level mathematics course for the MATH 0170 or MATH 0190 requirement. To accommodate the diverse preparation of individual students, variations of the following sequences and their prerequisites are possible with permission of the appropriate concentration advisor and the instructors involved. We recommend that each student's degree program be submitted for prior approval (typically in semester four) and scrutinized for compliance (in semester seven) by one faculty member from the Department of Physics and one faculty member from the School of Engineering. The ECON 0110 core requirement can be waived for students with an AP exam score of 4 or 5 in both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors (OPTIONAL):</head><p>History concentrators in the 5th or 6th semester may apply for honors. To be admitted, students must have achieved two-thirds "quality grades" in History department courses. A "quality grade" is defined as a grade of "A" or a grade of "S" accompanied by a course performance report indicating a performance at the "A" standard.</p><p>Students who wish to enroll in honors are recommended to takeHIST 1992, "History Honors Workshop for Prospective Students." HIST 1992 can count as one of the 10 courses required for graduation in history. HIST 1992 students who prepare a prospectus that receives a grade of A-or above will be admitted to the honors program. Students in their 7 th semester who have not taken HIST 1992 (including but not limited to those who are away from Brown during that semester) may apply to the program by submitting a prospectus no later than the first day of that semester. All honors students must complete one semester of HIST 1993 "History Honors Workshop for Thesis Writers, Part I" and one semester of HIST 1994 "History Workshop for Thesis Writers, Part II." HIST 1993 and HIST 1994 do not count towards the 10 courses required for graduation in history; they are an additional two courses to the minimum of 10 required history courses. Students who contemplate enrolling in the honors program in History should consult the honors section of the department website. They are also encouraged to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who serves as the honors advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History of Art and Architecture</head><p>The concentration in History of Art and Architecture introduces students to the history of art, architecture, and visual culture. Students in HIAA explore Western and non-Western areas ranging over a wide period of time (Ancient, Medieval, Islamic, East Asian, Latin American, Early Modern, Modern/ Contemporary). Concentrators often focus on a particular period (e.g. ancient, modern architecture), a particular branch of the field (e.g. urbanism), or a methodology (e.g. semiotics, critical interpretation, archaeology), but students may choose to create their own program of study. Concentrators will receive essential training in perceptual, historical, and critical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History of Art and Architecture Requirements</head><p>To complete the concentration, you will be expected to take a minimum of ten courses (11 for honors). Our goal in setting out these requirements is to welcome students into a lively and diverse department that also shares a cohesive and strong commitment to the field. We as a faculty want students to cultivate their special interests and also to venture into areas that may not be so familiar but that will open new and exciting possibilities for them. Ten courses are only the minimum requirement. Beyond that students are encouraged to take courses at RISD, participate in study abroad programs, and take courses in other Brown departments. As we are a truly interdisciplinary department, you will also find that our faculty collaborates with members of other departments to teach courses that bring together the strengths of different disciplines. We encourage both experimentation and concentration. Because foreign language skills are essential for pursuing art historical studies in a professional environment or in graduate school, HIAA requires knowledge equivalent to passing a 500-level language course at Brown.</p><p>Our general survey in history of art and architecture (HIAA 0010 (https:// bulletin.brown.edu/search/?P=HIAA%200010)) is an excellent foundation for the concentration. It is not a prerequisite for taking other lecture courses but you can count it as one of the 4 non-core courses required for the concentration (see below for core and non-core courses).</p><p>Since the history of art and architecture addresses issues of practice within specific historical contexts, concentrators are encouraged to take at least 1 studio art course. Courses in history also train students in methods and approaches that are highly relevant to the history of art and architecture. Study abroad can be a valuable enrichment of the academic work available on campus, in that it offers opportunities for first-hand knowledge of works of art and monuments as well as providing exposure to foreign languages and cultures. Study abroad should be planned in consultation with the concentration advisor in order to make sure that foreign course work will relate meaningfully to the concentrators program of study.</p><p>Four core general lecture courses, numbered HIAA 0020 -HIAA 0940. The courses should be distributed between three of the seven available areas of the discipline: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Architectural Studies Track</head><p>The Optional Architectural Studies track within the History of Art and Architecture concentration blends a variety of disciplines toward the study of buildings and the built environment. The concentration prepares students for the continued study of architecture and the history of architecture in graduate school as well as careers in related areas such as urban studies.</p><p>Because the architectural studies program was especially designed for students wishing to gain greater experience in the practical skills necessary for a career in architecture or a related field, concentrators are required to take a course in design from the Visual Arts Department, the Rhode Island School of Design or an introduction to architectural design, theatre set design at Brown University.</p><p>Four lecture courses. These courses will be numbered between HIAA 0020 and HIAA 0940 and will be marked with an "A" in the course description. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Concentration</head><p>The Independent Concentration program is for exceptionally dedicated students who are willing to spend extra time and effort creating an interdisciplinary concentration, representing a coherent field of study that Brown does not offer and that cannot be studied cohesively within a standard concentration. Such fields may include emerging fields in the academy, such as "Educational Neuroscience," or broader interdisciplinary areas, such as "Migration Studies." The proposal process consists of: Remaking the City URBN 1250</p><p>The Political Foundations of the City</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>The IR concentration will be available to students graduating through the class of 2023.</p><p>The IR concentration requires 14 courses and the equivalent of 3 years study of a second language. Regardless of track, all IR concentrators must take all five core courses, research methods, regional focus, and capstone courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Security and Society track</head><p>Core Courses 5 Students must take 5 core courses, preferably during freshman or sophomore year. AP credit does not count toward the concentration.</p><p>ANTH <ref type="formula">0110</ref>  The program has a director/concentration advisor and two faculty track advisors to assist students in planning their academic programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Italian Studies</head><p>Inherently interdisciplinary, the Italian Studies concentration allows students to strengthen their language skills in Italian and deepen their knowledge of Italian literature, history, art, and culture. Most concentrators have some background in Italian language. However, it is possible to concentrate in Italian studies without having studied the language before coming to Brown, although doing so requires an early start. After fulfilling the language requirement by completing up to Italian 0600 (or the equivalent), students enroll in a variety of advanced courses, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the concentration. Junior concentrators often study abroad in the Brown Program in Bologna. All senior concentrators participate in the "senior conference" by delivering brief presentations on academic topics of their choice in Italian Studies. Concentrators might also pursue capstone research, writing, or multimedia projects.</p><p>The concentration requires that students demonstrate proficiency in the Italian language by completing up to ITAL 0600 (or the equivalent in Bologna). ITAL 0400 is the first language course that counts toward the ten required courses for the concentration (except for students who place out of ITAL 0400, who will need to complete a total of nine courses </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Italian Studies Concentration and the Brown Program in Bologna</head><p>Concentrators who enroll in the Brown in Bologna program should fulfill the requirements according to the following sequence: prior to departure, the student should complete the level of Italian language study required (ITAL 0300) and enroll in one of the courses in the four distribution areas --Italian literature; Italian History; history of Italian art and architecture; film or performance. Upon return from Bologna, the student should enroll in at least one advanced course offered by the department, preferably a course taught in Italian. Any student returning from the Bologna program must enroll in a course above the language level of ITAL 0600. Credits toward the Italian Studies concentration may also be transferred from the Brown in Bologna Program. Concentrators may count three courses per semester toward the concentration (or six courses total for the year), although the course content must focus on Italy if the student wishes to count the course toward the concentration requirements. Concentrators should consult the concentration advisor to know which courses may or may not transfer as credits toward the concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Italian Studies</head><p>Concentrators are encouraged to expand their understanding of Italian language, history, or culture through independent research that will result in a thesis, a translation, or a multimedia project, developed in consultation with the undergraduate concentration advisor and the individual faculty member who will advise the student's project. The Honors thesis in Italian Studies is a two-semester thesis. Students who intend to complete an honors project should enroll for the first semester in ITAL 1920 (Independent Study), and have their project approved by their advisor by October 15. During the second semester, honors students enroll in ITAL 1990 and continue to work with their advisor to complete the project. ITAL 1990 does not count as one of the eight courses required for the concentration.</p><p>additional detail, though other pathways are possible, if approved by the concentration advisor. The core requirements are:</p><p>• One gateway course • Four breath requirements, one each in Phonology, Syntax, Semantics or Pragmatics, and Psycholinguistics. • Three electives in the focus area (see individual pathways below) • Four non-linguistic focus area electives (see individual pathways below) • Two breadth requirements that satisfy the Linguistics AB requirement.</p><p>These could serve as a secondary focus area. • One additional linguistics course, either as additional breadth or in the focus area • One Capstone course </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors:</head><p>The honors program in MCM is designed for students who wish to integrate their skills in a special project. Students who qualify for Honors in Track II are eligible to apply to do an Honors project or thesis. Students should submit a letter of intent in their 6 th semester, and a formal proposal by the first day of their 7 th semester. Applications will be screened by the MCM Honors Committee. (Application forms are available in the MCM office.) If approved, a student must then register for MCM 1980 (taken in the 7th semester), a one-credit course which can count towards their Focus Area requirements, and MCM 1990 (taken in the 8th semester), a one-credit thesis course in which they complete the Honors project/thesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music</head><p>The concentration in Music integrates theory, history, ethnomusicology, technology, composition, and performance. Upon completing two foundational courses in theory and musicianship, concentrators have the flexibility to craft an intellectual pathway based on their particular interests and goals. The curriculum is supported by the Orwig Music Library, a state-of-the-art facility with holdings of over 40,000 books and scores and an equal number of sound and video recordings. Concentrators are encouraged to participate in one or more of the departmentally sponsored performing organizations: Chorus, Orchestra, Jazz Band, Wind Symphony, Chamber Music Performance, Electroacoustic Ensemble, Sacred Harp/ Shape-Note Singing, Old-time String Band, Javanese Gamelan, or Ghanaian Drumming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentrating in Music</head><p>If you choose Music as a Concentration*, you will be expected to achieve well-rounded training as a musician, regardless of the genre(s) in which you specialize. This training is manifested in the following general components: Fundamental skills are important for any musician, and therefore a minimum of two music theory/musicianship courses are required of all students who wish to Concentrate. Students have the opportunity to enter into various theory courses according to their interest and experience. Historical and cultural knowledge of music is another key area from which Concentrators are required to complete courses. These courses may be studies of Western or non-Western forms of music. The creation of music is also central to the Music Concentration.</p><p>Students are encouraged to make music in a number of ways, including participation in ensembles, solo performance, composition, music production, and/or conducting. Music faculty will be available to advise students on shaping the flexible parts of their Concentration and achieving their goal at Brown. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Project</head><p>All music concentrators will choose a culminating experience for their senior year, either a capstone project or honors project. This may take the form of a performance, scholarly study, or original creative work. All students will have a primary advisor for their Senior Project. The work may be done independently of a course for credit, as an independent study, or within the framework of an existing course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Notes</head><p>All concentration substitutions and/or exceptions must be approved by the concentration advisor in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. A substitution or exception is not approved until specified in writing in the student's concentration file in ASK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Music (optional)</head><p>Faculty Rules stipulate "Brown University shall, at graduation, grant honors to students whose work in a field of concentration has demonstrated superior quality and culminated in an honors thesis of distinction."</p><p>In order to apply for Honors in Music, a student must fulfill the following criteria:</p><p>1. The student must have acquired a 3.5 cumulative grade point average overall. 2. The student must also have acquired a 3.5 cumulative grade point average in courses that count toward the concentration. ("S with distinction" equates with "A". Grades of "S" are not computed in the grade point average.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy</head><p>The Philosophy concentration offers courses covering subjects from the philosophy of religion to the philosophies of science and literature. It also provides survey courses on various periods in the history of philosophy. Concentrators can expect to strengthen their knowledge of and skills in ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, logic, epistemology and metaphysics. Students are asked to identify an area of specialization. There is also a related, but separate concentration in physics and philosophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Concentration</head><p>10 courses total, of which no more than one may be below PHIL 0350, and at least three must be at or above PHIL 0990.</p></div>

Or: a broader selection of courses chosen with the approval of the department's Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) 3) Capstone: One of the following four options a. Reading Course <ref type="bibr">(PHIL 1990</ref>): a reading course for one semester involving one professor and one student, leading to the preparation of a substantial resarch paper on a particular topic. The Reading Course may accompany a 1000-level course being taken concurrently. In this case, the 1000-level course would provide a general overview of the topic and the reading course would consist of a deeper foray into the topic. A one-semester Reading Course may also be a first step towards writing an Honors Thesis. b. Senior Seminar (PHIL 0990 or 0991): Seminars aimed primarily at advanced undergraduates, on varying topics each year, requiring the completion of substantial research and writing.</p></div>

You can grapple with every one of them -and many more-in the classrooms of the Brown political science department. We study how people -nations, regions, cities, communities-live their common lives. How people solve (or duck) their common problems. How people govern themselves. How they think, talk, argue, fight, and vote. Students passionate about social challenges may also choose to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program, which allows them to connect theory and practice and gain hands-on experience working with community partners.</p><p>The undergraduate concentration is organized around three broad tracks, or programs of study: American politics, international and comparative politics, and political theory. Twelve courses are required overall: ten within the Department of Political Science and two from areas outside the department related to your chosen track. Thirteen courses are required if the methods requirement is fulfilled with a course outside the department.</p></div>

Inhabited by two hundred fifty million people, this area includes Brazil, Continental and Insular Portugal, Lusophone Africa and Luso-America. Although concentrators are encouraged to examine the global nature of the Portuguese-speaking world, typically they focus on one of the specific geographical entities mentioned above. Concentrators will strengthen their Portuguese language skills (Portuguese 400 or the equivalent is a pre-requisite) and explore relevant Lusophone literature, education, history and social science. The concentration offers one program in language and literature and another that is interdisciplinary. Most concentrators study abroad in either Brazil or Portugal.</p></div>

The centerpiece of the concentration is a rigorous and comprehensive collection of courses: (1) that develop an understanding of the principles underlying the processes of data collection and analysis; and (2) that train students in the application of advanced statistical techniques for data description and analysis. The concepts and skills learned in these courses are reinforced through engagement in applied research with Sociology faculty and/or internships with local organizations in the for profit and not-for-profit sectors.</p><p>Concentrators also take courses that provide grounding in the theoretical approaches to social phenomena that are foundational to social research.</p><p>Graduates develop an understanding of the concepts and processes that underlie the issues studied by sociologists and the analytic techniques that allow sociologists to understand social relations and individual behavior. </p></div>

While India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and neighboring nation-states constitute a recognizable geographic region, the equally vital diasporic communities from South Asia and their globally dispersed networks extend our understanding of an old and yet changing South Asia. South Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary concentration in which students work in a specified chronological period (e.g. ancient, medieval, early modern, or contemporary), in a geographical area (e.g. Bangladesh, Bengal, Maharashtra, North India, Pakistan, South India), or in a particular discipline (e.g. anthropology, Hindi/Urdu, history, religion, or Sanskrit) but also take courses outside of their chosen area of emphasis in disciplines such as economics, literature, philosophy, political science, or theatre arts.</p></div>

Native Hindi/Urdu speakers are encouraged to fulfill the language requirement by taking another South Asian language for four semester, such as Sanskrit at Brown or a relevant language at another institution. Up to two language courses can count toward fulfilling the student's elective requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior-Year Project</head><p>Students must complete either a senior capstone project OR an honors thesis.</p><p>Capstone projects or honors theses are opportunities for students to creatively synthesize the thinking on South Asia that they have developed during the concentration. The project should exhibit an empirically and theoretically driven research question or argument about some aspect</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Concentrations</head><p>of South Asian Studies. the senior-year project should involve some research in at least one South Asian language.</p><p>All students are encouraged to start thinking about their capstones in their junior year.</p><p>Capstones can take two primary forms: 1. A research paper of approximately 30 pages on a topic related to South Asia for an existing concentration-eligible course, undertaken with the permission of the instructor. 2. An independent study-based project. the produce and/or process that constitutes this can be artistic, primary or secondary researchbased, internship-related, or something else. the project must be supervised by at least one CCSA faculty member* for at least one semester under SAST 1970. This course can count towards the five elective requirement.</p><p>At the end of the junior year, each student should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Study (DUS) to review their plan for completing their capstone. If pursuing a capstone project, students will be required to submit, by the end of the shopping period of the fall of their senior year, a short proposal (300 words) that describes how they are going to complete this requirement.</p><p>An Honors Thesis is a two-semester independent study supervised by a thesis advisor <ref type="bibr">(SAST 1970)</ref>. These two courses constitute the additional courses needed for honors in the concentration.</p><p>An honors thesis can be textual, or it can take other forms (multi-media, visual, artistic, or musical, for example). The form and substance of a nontextual honors thesis must conform to the rigorous regulations set out by the relevant department(s) and the Dean of the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Honors Requirements</head><p>To be eligible for Honors, students will have earned an "A" in the majority of courses for the concentration.</p><p>Students may graduate with Honors in South Asian Studies by completing an undergraduate Honors thesis under the supervision of at least one reader drawn from the CCSA faculty* and one additional reader from the Brown (or RISD, in the case of Brown-RISD students) faculty community.</p><p>In order to pursue Honors, students must submit the following materials to the CCSA DUS by April 25:</p><p>1. A prospectus (3-5 pages, describing the major research questions and methods to be used, complete with bibliography) that has been read and vetted by the student's intended primary reader. 2. An email from the faculty member who will serve as primary reader to the CCSA DUS noting their willingness to advise on the thesis.</p><p>In addition, students must:</p><p>1. Enroll in a two-semester sequence of Independent Study, <ref type="bibr">SAST 1970</ref> or under a relevant depawrtment course code 2. Designate a second reader by September 30 of the senior year.</p><p>Second readers should also confirm their willingness to serve as a reader by sending an email to the CCSA DUS. 3. Be in regular contact with the thesis advisor about the progress of the project. 4. Present their research to the CCSA community during their final semester.</p><p>For mid-year graduating students, the topic and primary reader must be identified and confirmed by mid-November of the junior year, and a second reader must be arranged and confirmed by January 30 of the senior year.</p><p>A complete penultimate draft of the thesis is due to both readers on April 1. A final draft that incorporates readers' comments is due back to the readers on April 15 of the student's senior year.</p><p>* This includes all people listed under the Faculty, Postdoctoral Associate, and Visiting Scholars (limited to those in residence at Brown) tabs on the CCSA website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p>The Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics is designed to provide foundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. To ensure deep rigorous understanding of the foundations and main methods of analysis in statistics, the program is composed of three parts: a) foundations in mathematics and computing, combined with an introduction to statistical thinking and practice; b) four core courses on the fundamentals of statistical theory and data analysis; and c) more advanced material covering important areas of statistical methodology. A capstone project involving substantial data analysis or focused on methodology/theory is required. Students also have opportunities to acquire practical experience in study design, data management, and statistical analysis by working as undergraduate research assistants in projects in one of the participating academic departments or Research Centers at Brown.</p><p>The Concentration is based on several premises: that statistics is a scientific discipline in its own right, with specialized methodologies and body of knowledge; that it is essentially concerned with the art and science of data analysis; and that it is best taught in conjunction with specific, substantive applications. To this end, the Concentration is designed to provide foundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. The Concentration prepares students for careers in industry and government, for graduate study in statistics or biostatistics and other sciences, as well as for professional study in law, medicine, business, or public administration. The undergraduate concentration guide is available here (https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostatistics/ undergraduate-statistics-concentration).</p><p>The Undergraduate Concentration in Statistics is administered by the Department of Biostatistics and leads to a Sc.B. degree. To ensure deep rigorous understanding of the foundations and main methods of analysis in statistics, the program is composed of three parts. The first part entails foundations in mathematics and computing, combined with an introduction to statistical thinking and practice. The second part includes four core courses that provide a comprehensive account of the fundamentals of statistical theory and data analysis. The third part delves into more advanced material covering important areas of statistical methodology. In addition to the formal coursework, students are required to complete a capstone project that involves a substantial data analysis or a methodological/theoretical project. Students also have opportunities to acquire practical experience in study design, data management, and statistical analysis by working as undergraduate research assistants in projects in one of the participating academic Departments or Research Centers at Brown. Please note that only the required Calculus courses may be accepted with P/F grades. All other required courses must be taken for a grade.</p><p>The program requires thirteen one-semester courses. The required courses are as follows: There are also other statistics courses offered by other departments (e.g., Applied Mathematics, Cognitive Sciences, and Psychology). On occasion, an alternative research skills course may be approved for a specific concentration. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The courses provide opportunities to undertake research or fieldwork projects and all qualify as "capstone" experiences. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> No more than two may be used to satisfy the requirements of this concentration. The RISD course is identified in the student's record at Brown by a RISD course code.</p><p>Off-Campus Courses: Some courses taken outside Brown (e.g., in study abroad programs) may be used for credit towards the concentration if the material covered directly corresponds to that taught in Brown courses, or is relevant to the complementary curriculum. Such courses will be approved each semester by the concentration advisor.</p></div>			</div>
