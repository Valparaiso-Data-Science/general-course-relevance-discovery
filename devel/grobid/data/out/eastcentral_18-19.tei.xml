<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section I INTRODUCTION TO</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE UNIVERSITY HISTORY AND FUNCTIONS</head><p>The University</p><p>East Central University was established by legislative act in 1909 as one of three regional state normal schools founded that year in the eastern half of Oklahoma, that part which had been Indian Territory before the founding of the State in 1907. Three similar institutions had been established earlier in Oklahoma Territory, which became the western half of the new state. The six institutions for many years served virtually identical purposes in the state's program of higher education.</p><p>The normal school program consisted of four years of preparatory, or high school, work and two years at the college level. Graduates of the normal schools were awarded lifetime licenses for teaching in the public schools of the state. In 1919 the six state normal schools were authorized to increase their college programs to four years of teacher education and to confer bachelors degrees. At that time they were designated teachers' colleges. In 1939 they were authorized to expand their programs to include degree programs in Arts and Sciences as well as Education, and the designation was changed to Oklahoma state colleges.</p><p>In 1954 East Central University and the other Oklahoma state colleges were authorized to offer their fi rst graduate work in a fi fth-year program for teachers leading to the Master of Teaching degree. In 1969 the state colleges were authorized to change the name of this advanced degree from Master of Teaching to Master of Education. Other masters degrees have since been added. As a unit in the state's system of higher education receiving principal support from public taxation, East Central University has sought to serve the needs of the people of the state in a democratically responsive manner. The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education have specifi ed the following functions for the senior universities of the state.</p><p>The functions of the senior universities include: (1) offering undergraduate study in several fi elds leading to the bachelors degree; (2) offering a limited number of programs leading to the fi rst professional degree when appropriate to an institution's strengths and the needs of the state; (3) offering graduate study at the masters level, primarily in teacher education and in selected fi elds related to Oklahoma's human resource needs; (4) responsibility for extension and public service in the assigned geographic regions; (5) responsibility for institutional and applied research in those areas related closely to their program assignments; (6) responsibility for regional programs of economic development; (7) responsibility for offering associate degrees when not in close proximity to a community college; (8) responsibility for offering certifi cate programs as specifi cally authorized; (9) responsibility for offering programs of statewide impact; and (10) admitting students in the top one half of the class as defi ned in State Regents Policy. All of these functions except number seven have relevance for East Central University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section II GENERAL INFORMATION OF THE UNDERGRADUATE DIVISION INSTITUTIONAL ADMISSION AND RETENTION</head><p>The Undergraduate</p><p>Division Anyone planning to attend East Central University must apply online at the university's admission website. The student must support his or her application with the following records:</p><p>A. an offi cial high school transcript; B. all offi cial transcripts, including all military transcripts, showing his or her records at each institution (any institution of higher education) in which he or she has enrolled;</p><p>C. an offi cial report of his or her American College Testing Program (ACT) test scores or, if he or she attended high school out of Oklahoma, a record of an approved similar battery of tests.</p><p>These records should be fi led in the Records Offi ce at least two to four weeks before registration. If the records are in a different language, they must be submitted in authenticated English translations (see International Student Admission for more information). Undergraduate students applying to East Central University for the fi rst time must pay an application fee before forms will be processed.</p><p>If an applicant is accepted for admission as a beginning freshman (a student with six or fewer attempted credit hours, excluding remedial [0-level courses] or pre-college work and excluding credit hours accumulated by concurrently enrolled high school students), the applicant must attend a freshman advisement and enrollment session before registration. A current immunization record or immunization waiver must be on fi le at that time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.3">Admission of First-Time Freshmen: Curricular Requirements</head><p>Students must meet the criteria for both the high school curricular requirements and the high school performance requirements as defi ned in the following sections. Students meeting both the high school curricular and the high school performance requirements are eligible for admission. This section includes curricular requirements for regular admission.</p><p>A. High School Curricular Requirements for Admission to Programs Leading to AA, AS and Baccalaureate Degrees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Units (Years)</head><p>Course Areas (4) <ref type="bibr">English (grammar, composition, literature;</ref> should include an integrated writing component)</p><p>(3) Lab Science <ref type="bibr">(Biology, chemistry, physics</ref> or any lab science certifi ed by the school district; General science with or without a lab may not be used to meet this requirement.)</p><p>(3) Mathematics (from algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, math analysis, pre-calculus, statistics and probability (must have completed geometry and Algebra II), calculus, Advanced Placement statistics)</p><p>(3) History and Citizenship Skills (including one unit of American history and two additional units from the subjects of history, economics, geography, government, non-Western culture)</p><p>(2) Additional units of subjects previously listed or selected from: computer science, foreign language, or any Advanced Placement course except applied courses in fi ne arts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15">Total Required Units</head><p>Computer science courses (one or more units) that meet the State Regents' guidelines for high school curricular requirements may satisfy the postsecondary systemwide computer profi ciency graduation requirement (see the State Regents' Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy).</p><p>In addition to the above requirements, the following subjects are recommended for college preparation: 2 additional units: Fine arts -music, art, drama, and speech 1 additional unit: Lab science (as described above) 1 additional unit: Mathematics (as described above) 4 Recommended Units.</p><p>While these curricular requirements will normally be met by students in grades 9 through 12, advanced students who complete these courses in earlier grades will not be required to take additional courses for purposes of admission.</p><p>The remaining units required by the State Board of Education for high school graduation may be selected from courses to meet students' individual needs and interests.</p><p>Additionally, 70 O.S. § 11-103.6 outlines the curricular units or sets of competencies that are required to graduate from an Oklahoma public high school. By virtue of this statute, high school courses that satisfy college admission requirements, which are subject to State Regents' approval, also satisfy specifi c college preparatory/work ready curricular high school graduation requirements. Therefore, if a high school or the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education wishes to determine if a course will satisfy a college admission curricular requirement, which fi ts within one of the legislatively defi ned college preparatory/work ready curricular subject areas, but is not explicitly detailed therein, it shall require State Regents' approval. Additional information regarding the course review process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.</p><p>B. Curricular Defi ciencies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Baccalaureate Programs</head><p>Students must meet all basic academic skills curricular requirements <ref type="bibr">(English, mathematics, and science)</ref> to be admitted to baccalaureate programs at research or regional institutions. Students with a defi ciency in a non-basic academic skills course (excludes English, mathematics, and science) who present an ACT reading subject score at or above the specifi ed level or who score at the designated level on any approved secondary institutional reading assessment instrument may be admitted as a regular admission student. These students will be required to complete an additional three-hour collegiate course in the relative subject area to make up the high school defi ciency (see the State Regents' High School Curricular <ref type="bibr">Requirements policy)</ref>. Other exceptions are noted in the special admission options outlined later in this policy. If an institution admits students with one or more curricular defi ciencies to a baccalaureate program utilizing the alternative admission category, the institution must provide the means to satisfy those defi ciencies (see the State Regents' High School Curricular Requirements policy) and the student must successfully remediate basic academic skills course requirements within 24 college level hours attempted. Students continuously enrolled in courses designed to remove defi ciencies bay be allowed to continue enrollment beyond the 24 hour limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Associate in Arts and Associate in Science Programs</head><p>Students lacking curricular requirements are admissible into AA or AS programs in the community colleges but must remediate curricular defi ciencies in the basic academic skills at the earliest possible time but within the fi rst 24 collegelevel hours attempted. Students continuously enrolled in courses designed to remove defi ciencies may be allowed to continue enrollment beyond the 24 hour limit. In addition, students must remove curricular defi ciencies in a discipline area before taking collegiate level work in that discipline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Associate in Applied Science Programs</head><p>Students entering AAS degree programs or other certifi cate programs must remove high school curricular requirement defi ciencies before taking courses in the same fi eld as part of an AAS degree or certifi cate program. Students admitted under this provision may not transfer into an AA, AS or baccalaureate program without fi rst removing the high school curricular defi ciencies.</p><p>Students may remove curricular defi ciencies as detailed in the State Regents' High School Curricular Requirements policy. The institution's president or the president's designee may allow a deserving student who failed to remediate a basic academic skills defi ciency in a single subject to continue to enroll in collegiate level courses in addition to remedial INSTITUTIONAL ADMISSION AND RETENTION POLICY (OSRHE Policy 3.9, 4/18) course work beyond the 24-hour limit providing the student has demonstrated success in collegiate courses to date. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented.</p><p>Students pursuing admission to AA, AS, AAS, or baccalaureate degree programs may not count remedial/ development courses toward satisfaction of degree program requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Applied Courses</head><p>The use of applied courses to meet the high school curricular requirements is to be considered an alternative. College bound students are encouraged to take courses currently specifi ed in the State Regents' Institutional Admission and Retention policy. The State Regents are interested in experimenting with alternative delivery systems that might facilitate student interest and success. It must be noted that the State Regents request and expect high school transcripts to be valid and refl ective of the actual courses taken by students; anything less threatens the integrity of the academic process.</p><p>One year of Principles of Technology may substitute for one of the currently required lab science courses providing that students taking the course also successfully complete a lab science course listed in the State Regents' Institutional Admission and Retention policy. Additionally, the Principles of Technology course must be taught by a teacher certifi ed or endorsed in physics who has completed the specialized training to instruct the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.4">Admission of First-Time Freshmen: Performance Requirements</head><p>Students must meet the criteria for both the high school curricular requirements and the high school performance requirements as defi ned in the following sections. Students meeting both the high school curricular and the high school performance requirements are eligible for admission. This section includes performance requirements for regular admission which includes three options for admission: standardized tests, high school GPA in all courses plus class rank, or high school GPA in theState Regents' 15-units of required high school core courses.</p><p>The ACT score used for admission purposes is the composite score without the writing component. The SAT score used for admission purposes is the combined critical reading and math scores without the writing component. Students utilizing a test other than ACT will have their scores converted to ACT equivalents. The high school class rank is one more than the number of students in the high school graduating class who have a high school GPA greater than the student in question.</p><p>A GED recipient's high school class must have graduated to be eligible for admission. The president or the president's designee may allow exceptions on an individual student basis. Any exceptions, including subsequent student academic performance, will be reported to the State Regents upon request. The University of Oklahoma (OU) is authorized by the State Regents to also require a minimum average standard GED score for automatic admission.</p><p>The high school GPA used for admission purposes in option 2 is the unweighted average of all grades ("A" equating to 4.00 and "D" equating to 1.00) taken in the 9th through 12 grades. The GPA used for admission purposes in option 3 shall add a standard weighting (1.0) to The College Board's Advanced Placement courses and the International Baccalaureate Organization's higher-level courses (an "F" remains zero).</p><p>While the State Regents strongly support the initiation of honors courses, honors weighting will not be used in the calculation of either high school GPA because there is no equitable mechanism to include the honors premium.</p><p>The exact standardized test scores and high school GPA will vary over time, and may differ at each institution. The high school GPA will be defi ned annually to correspond to the rank in class. The ACT score equivalent to these percentages will be determined based on the average of the preceding three years' ACT scores of graduating seniors if available.</p><p>Oklahoma test data will be used. The concordance table used to set the equivalent SAT score is updated regularly.</p><p>First-time entering students must also meet entry-level assessment requirements before enrolling in college-level courses. See the State Regents' Student Assessment and Remediation policy for more information.</p><p>A. Minimum High School Performance Criteria for Admission of First-Time-Entering Students at Regional Universities Any individual who:</p><p>1. is a graduate of a high school accredited by the appropriate regional association or by an appropriate accrediting agency of the home state or has achieved a high school equivalency certifi cate based on the GED;</p><p>2. has met the curricular requirements as set forth in part 3.9.3 of this policy;</p><p>3. has participated in the ACT program or a similar acceptable battery of tests; and 4. meets the following criteria is eligible for admission to any of the regional universities in the State System. Top 50%</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimum Performance-Based Admission Standards: Regional Universities</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.5">International Student Admission and Admission of Non-native Speakers of English</head><p>International undergraduate students are required to meet equivalent academic performance standards as listed in section 3.9.4 above. Additionally, both fi rst-time undergraduate and graduate students for whom English is a second language shall be required to present evidence of profi ciency in the English language prior to admission, either as fi rst-time students to the system or by transfer from another non-system college or university. The State Regents adopted this policy to ensure that students will have a reasonable chance to succeed at a higher education institution based on their ability to comprehend, read, and write the English language.</p><p>Students must meet one of the standards described below to demonstrate their competency in English. Results of the TOEFL taken at international testing centers and special testing centers will be accepted at all State System colleges and universities. Results of the TOEFL administered at institutional testing centers shall not be accepted by colleges and universities other than the administering institution.</p><p>2. Intensive <ref type="bibr">English Program (IEP)</ref>. Students must meet a minimum score set by the State Regents on the TOEFL administered at a special testing center or an international testing center or on the IELTS Examination. In addition, after achieving the required score and immediately prior to admission, successfully complete a minimum of 12 weeks of study at an IEP approved by the State Regents. At least two-thirds of the 12 weeks must be instruction at an advanced level. A list of State Regents' approved IEPs can be found in the State Regents' Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.</p><p>3. High School Performance. Undergraduate students must have successfully completed the high school core requirements in or graduate from high school where English is the primary language in a country where English is a primary language and demonstrate competency through the High School Curricular Requirements policy.</p><p>4. Graduate students may satisfy the English language requirement by completing a baccalaureate or graduate degree from a college or university where English is the primary teaching language in a country where English is a primary language and that is recognized by professional organizations in the U.S. involved in admissions and international education.</p><p>5. Institutional Discretion. In extraordinary and deserving cases, the president or the president's designee may admit a student in lieu of the above requirements. In these situations, the applicant must have demonstrated profi ciency in the English language by some other means prior to admission. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented and reported to the State Regents annually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.6">Special Admission</head><p>Students admitted must meet curricular standards as defi ned in section 3.9.4, and must meet the high school performance criteria as defi ned in section 3.9.4. The only exceptions are students admitted in the following special admission categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Special Non-Degree Seeking Student</head><p>Students who wish to enroll in courses without intending to pursue a degree may be permitted to enroll in no more than nine credit hours without submitting academic credentials or meeting the academic curricular or performance requirements of the institution of desired entry. Retention standards will be enforced. Once a student has completed the designated number of hours, the student is required to meet the formal admission or transfer criteria for the institution of desired entry in order to enroll in additional course work. (This provision is not intended to be limited only to fi rst-timeentering students.)</p><p>The president or the president's designee may allow nondegree-seeking students to exceed this initial nine credit-hour limit on an individual student basis. Such exceptions may be made for non-degree-seeking students only who meet the retention standards and must be appropriately documented and reported to the State Regents annually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Alternative Admission</head><p>Research and regional institutions may admit 8 percent of the number of previous year's fi rst-time freshmen or 50 students (whichever is greater) without the students having met the State Regents' high school curricular or performance admission requirements. Institutions admitting students through the alternative admission category must have formally established admission criteria on fi le at the State Regents' offi ce.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.8">Retention Standards</head><p>In keeping with this philosophy of maximizing student success, institutions are strongly urged to initiate or strengthen programs which will assure that students experiencing academic diffi culties will be provided appropriate academic assistance. Such specially designed programs should include, but not be limited to, academic and career counseling, tutoring opportunities, study skills sessions, and diagnostic testing as appropriate. Students on academic notice or academic probation should be required as a condition for continued enrollment to participate in these special academic support services. These programs should be available to all students who feel participation will enhance their academic performance and success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.

If the need for developmental education is indicated, the student must successfully complete the developmental education prior to entering this provisional program.</p><p>The fi nal admission decision will be made by the appropriate institutional offi cials based on the applicant's academic performance and potential for success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Program Requirements</head><p>a. Enrollment is restricted to the summer session immediately following the student's high school graduation.</p><p>b. Each student is required to register for a minimum of two summer session core academic courses (at least six hours), exclusive of credit by examination or correspondence study. Students must take one course in each of the fi rst two categories listed below:</p><p>English: Either of the introductory college-level English courses unless the student through advanced standing credit or concurrent enrollment has previously acquired such credit. If such credit has previously been earned, then the student may take an additional course in one of the categories listed below.</p><p>Mathematics: College algebra or the equivalent unless the student through advanced standing credit or concurrent enrollment has previously earned such credit. If such credit has previously been earned, then the student may take an additional course in one of the categories listed below.</p><p>Students testing out of the introductory English and/ or Mathematics courses must select courses from the following categories:</p><p>Social Science: A college-level course approved for general education credit.</p><p>Natural Science: A college-level introductory lab science course approved for general education credit.</p><p>Humanities: A college-level course approved for general education credit.</p><p>c. It is expected that these courses will be taught with equivalent rigor in presentation, assignments, and grading as the same courses taught during the regular semesters. Institutions are encouraged to use regular faculty members.</p><p>d. Students admitted in this program will be required to participate in academic support programs designed to enhance their success. Such services should include academic tutoring, mentoring opportunities, career counseling, diagnostic testing, etc.</p><p>Any student not maintaining satisfactory progress toward the academic objective as indicated above will be placed on probation for one semester. At the end of that semester, the student must have a semester GPA of 2.0 in regularlygraded course work, not to include activity or performance courses, or meet the minimum GPA standard required above, in order to continue as a student. Students not meeting either of these criteria will be immediately suspended and may not be reinstated until one regular semester (fall or spring) has elapsed.</p><p>Students suspended in the spring semester may attend, at the discretion of the suspending institution, the summer session immediately following spring suspension. However, such students may enroll only in core academic courses which meet the general education requirements or degree requirements. The student's transcript will note suspension at the end of the spring semester. For students who fail to achieve retention standards after the summer session, the phrase "suspension continued" should be entered on the transcript at the end of the summer session. Only students under fi rst-time suspension status at the suspending institution are eligible. To continue in that fall semester, such students must achieve a 2.0 semester GPA or raise their GPA to the required level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Suspension of Seniors</head><p>An institution may allow a student with 90 or more hours in a specifi ed degree program who has failed to meet the GPA of 2.0 or the semester GPA of 2.0 to enroll in up to 15 additional semester hours in a further attempt to achieve the GPA requirement. During this 15 hours of enrollment, the student must achieve a minimum 2.0 semester GPA during each enrollment or raise the GPA to 2.0 or above. This senior suspension exception can be exercised only once per student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Academic Suspension Appeals</head><p>Institutions have the discretion to establish an academic suspension appeals procedure. Such procedures should allow appropriate discretion in deserving cases. Academic suspension appeal procedures should require that the suspended student document any extraordinary personal circumstances that contributed to the academic defi ciencies. Such events must be highly unusual such as the death of an immediate relative; a serious illness; severe fi nancial distress; direct, signifi cant work confl icts; unexpected, substantial family obligations; or personal crisis. Such appeals decisions should be made only following the thoughtful deliberation of an appropriate committee which may include faculty, students, and administrators. Any institutional policies and procedures developed for the appeal of academic suspension decisions must be submitted to and approved by the State Regents. Annual reports detailing all decisions concerning appeals requests will be submitted to the State Regents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Readmission of Suspended Students</head><p>Students who are academically suspended by an institution will not be allowed to reenter the suspending institution for at least one regular semester (fall or spring) except as noted above. Institutions should develop policies and procedures to guide the readmission of suspended students. Such policies should include the provision that suspended students can be readmitted only one time. Such students are readmitted on probationary status and must maintain a 2.0 GPA average each semester attempted while on probation or raise their GPA to the designated level. Should a reinstated student be suspended a second time from the same institution, the student cannot return to the suspending school until such time as the student has demonstrated, by attending another institution, the ability to succeed academically by raising the GPA to the retention standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Reinstatement of Suspended Students at System Institutions</head><p>It is the intent of the State Regents that public higher education opportunities be provided for all citizens with the ability and desire to use these public services. As previously stated, students will not be permitted readmission to the suspending institution for a minimum of one regular semester (fall or spring). However, research indicates that many times students suspended from one institution may succeed in a new academic environment if given the opportunity. As such, institutions may develop a special admission procedure, subject to State Regents' approval, for students who are suspended from other system institutions and who would otherwise qualify for admission to the reinstating institution. Such students would be admitted at the discretion of the receiving institution and such admission would be probationary. Institutions admitting such students should provide the appropriate academic services to facilitate their success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.10">Non-Academic Criteria for Admission</head><p>A. In addition to the academic criteria used by institutions in the State System as the basis for student admission, institutions shall consider the following non-academic criteria in deciding whether a fi rst-time applicant or a transfer student shall be granted admission:</p><p>1. Whether an applicant has been expelled, suspended, denied admission or denied readmission by any other educational institution.</p><p>2. Whether an applicant has been convicted of a felony or convicted of any lesser crime involving moral turpitude.</p><p>3. Whether an applicant's conduct has been such that if, at the time of the conduct in question, the applicant had been a student at the institution to which application is made, the course of conduct would have been grounds for expulsion, suspension, dismissal or denial of readmission.</p><p>B. If the institution fi nds that an applicant has any of the above, then the institution shall deny admission to applicant if it decides that any of the events described indicates the applicant's unfi tness, at the time of application, to be a student at the institution to which application is made.</p><p>If an applicant is denied admission on any of the foregoing grounds, there must be substantial evidence supporting the basis for denial. In addition, the applicant must be afforded adequate procedural safeguards, including the following:</p><p>1. Be advised of the ground of the denial.</p><p>2. Be informed of the facts which form a basis of the denial.</p><p>3. Be afforded an opportunity to be heard.</p><p>Institutions should establish a hearing committee or some other appropriate mechanism to guarantee the proper administration of the procedural safeguards outlined above.</p></div>

Institutions may develop policies and procedures, subject to State Regents approval, to guide the admission of transfer students who do not meet the requirements. Such policies should include that these students are admitted on probation and must maintain a 2.0 GPA average each semester while on probation or raise their GPA to the designated level, as detailed in the State Regents' Institutional Admission and Retention policy. Any transfer probation student with curricular defi ciencies must remove the defi ciencies within the fi rst 12 hours of enrollment. Additionally, it is expected that institutions will provide the appropriate academic support services to assist such students in achieving academic success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Higher Standards</head><p>The University of Oklahoma (OU) and Oklahoma State University (OSU) are authorized by the State Regents to assume higher standards for admission by transfer. Standards for the admission of students as stated above are considered minimum. Institutions may request higher standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.4">Transfer of Course Work Within the State System from Degree-granting Institutions</head><p>The following guidelines for transfer of students among institutions have been adopted for the State System.</p><p>A. A student who has completed the prescribed lower-division requirements of a State System institution developed in accordance with the standards set forth in the State Regents' Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy may transfer into a baccalaureate degree program at any senior institution of the State System and be assured of completing his or her program in sequential fashion. Senior institutions may, with the approval of the State Regents, require that transferring students complete additional general education work for the degree. However, such additional work shall be programmed as a part of the upper division requirements of the senior institution in order that any student shall be able to complete a baccalaureate program in a number of semester hours equal to the total specifi ed for graduation published in the receiving institution's offi cial catalog.</p><p>B. It is understood, however, that it might be necessary for certain students to take additional courses in general education to meet minimum professional certifi cation requirements as defi ned by the state. It is also understood that the completion of these requirements does not preclude requirements of senior institutions of particular GPAs for admission to professional departments or fi elds.</p><p>C. It is further understood that it is the responsibility of the transferring institution to provide adequate counseling to enable a student to complete during the freshman and sophomore years those lower-division courses which are published prerequisites to pursuit of junior level courses of his or her chosen major disciplinary fi eld.</p><p>D. The baccalaureate degree in all Oklahoma senior-level institutions shall be awarded in recognition of lower-division (freshman and sophomore) combined with upper-division (junior and senior) work. If a student has completed an AA or AS degree, the lower-division general education requirement of the baccalaureate degree shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the associate degree, providing the general education requirements specifi ed herein are met. If, for any reason, a student has not completed an associate degree program prior to his or her transfer to another institution, the general education requirements shall become the responsibility of the receiving institutions. However, the receiving institution will recognize general education credit for all transfer courses in which a reasonable equivalency of discipline or course content exists with courses specifi ed as part of general education at the receiving institution, provided that there is an appropriate correspondence between the associate degree and the baccalaureate degree being sought.</p><p>E. If a student has completed general education courses at a baccalaureate degree-recommending institution within the State System, the receiving baccalaureate institution will recognize general education credit for all courses in which a reasonable equivalency or discipline or course content exists with courses specifi ed as part of general education at the receiving institution, provided that there is an appropriate correspondence of disciplinary study.</p><p>F. Lower-division programs in all state institutions enrolling freshmen and sophomores may offer introductory courses which permit the student to explore the principal professional specializations that can be pursued at the baccalaureate level. These introductory courses shall be adequate in content to be fully counted toward the baccalaureate degree for students continuing in such a professional fi eld of specialization. The determination of the major course requirements for a baccalaureate degree, including courses in the major taken in the lower division, shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the degree. However, courses classifi ed as upperdivision courses generally taken by sophomores at senior institutions, even though taught at a community college as lower-division courses, should be transferable as satisfying that part of the student's requirement in the content area.</p><p>G. Courses offered at the freshman or sophomore (1000 or 2000) level at baccalaureate degree-recommending institutions may be offered at a community college provided that such courses are included in the community college's approved instructional program.</p><p>H. Other associate degrees and certifi cates may be awarded by institutions for programs which have requirements different from the aforementioned degrees, or a primary objective other than transfer. Acceptance of course credits for transfer from such degree or certifi cate programs will be evaluated by the receiving institution on the basis of applicability of the courses to the baccalaureate program in the major fi eld of the student. Each receiving institution is encouraged to develop admission policies that will consider all factors indicating the possibility of success of these students in its upper division.</p><p>I. Each baccalaureate degree-recommending institution shall list and update the requirements for each program leading to the baccalaureate degree and shall publicize these requirements for use by all other institutions in the State System. Each baccalaureate degree-recommending institution shall include in its offi cial publications (whether print or electronic) information stating all lower-division prerequisite requirements for each upper-division course. All requirements for admission to a university, college, or program should be set forth with precision and clarity. The degree requirements in effect at the time of the student's initial full-time enrollment in any State System college or university shall govern lowerdivision prerequisites, provided that the student has had continuous enrollment in the State System as defi ned in the offi cial college or university publications.</p><p>J. Institutions are encouraged to publish, distribute, and keep current transfer guides. The transfer guides should include institutional procedures for the evaluation of course equivalency and a description of the appeals process. A systemwide course transfer matrix is maintained online and updated annually by the State Regents. 1. The Course Equivalency Project Matrix is updated each academic year. Detailed information regarding the process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.</p><p>2. The Course Equivalency Project Matrix is updated each academic year. Detailed information regarding the process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.</p><p>3. Courses listed on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix satisfy content requirements for all courses listed within the same Common Course category; however, all degree requirements listed in the State Regents' Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy must be met before the degree may be awarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.11.5">Transfer of Course Work from Oklahoma Technology Centers Through the Statewide Articulation Agreement</head><p>The purpose of the Statewide Articulation Agreement is to expand, not outsource through contractual arrangement (see Contractual Arrangements Between Higher Education Institutions and Other Entities policy) or prior learning assessment (see Credit for Prior Learning policy), student access to Oklahoma's educational opportunities. The Statewide Articulation Agreement includes a list of technical courses which meet technical major degree requirements at participating State System of Higher Education institutions, and which will be accepted in transfer from Oklahoma technology centers towards a college technical certifi cate, an associate in applied science degree, or a technology baccalaureate degree. The Statewide Articulation Agreement strengthens the education and training programs that lead to employment in occupational and technical fi elds in Oklahoma.</p><p>A. Principles. The Statewide Articulation Agreement will:</p><p>1. Adhere to academic educational standards and policies as specifi ed by the State Regents for Higher Education and the ODCTE.</p><p>2. Inform students about the participating higher education institutions offering technical certifi cate and degree programs for which technical courses from an Oklahoma technology center are listed on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix. These courses may be applicable for technical degree major requirements or technical degree major electives, but not as general elective credit.</p><p>3. Facilitate articulation with an uninterrupted sequence of learning experiences for technology center students.</p><p>4. Provide students who are enrolled in technology center courses and programs included on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix the opportunity to continue their educational careers in higher education.</p><p>5. Ensure the effi cient use of public resources and expand access to educational services. Technical course credit earned through the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Agreement will be posted on the offi cial college transcript as a grade of "S" or "P" at the receiving institution. All technical credit awarded through the Statewide Articulation Agreement shall be appropriately identifi ed by source and method on the offi cial college transcript.</p><p>C. Procedures 1. A State System institution seeking approval for technical courses from an Oklahoma technology center to be included in the Statewide Articulation Agreement shall have the president submit the proposal to the Chancellor for State Regents' consideration. After receipt of the proposed courses for articulation, State Regents' staff will manage the content faculty review and evaluation process for the proposed technical courses to be inventoried in the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix. After review, staff will submit the faculty-recommended technical courses to the State Regents for approval. Detailed information on the technical course review process is available in the State Regents' Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook and online.</p><p>2. An institutional request for approval of technical courses from an Oklahoma technology center to be included in the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix shall contain the following information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IN-STATE/OUT-OF-STATE STATUS OF ENROLLED STUDENTS POLICY (OSRHE Policy 3.18, 4/17)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.18.1">Purpose</head><p>Oklahoma statute 70 O.S., <ref type="bibr">Supp. 2003, §3218</ref>.2 authorizes the State Regents to establish tuition and fees charged at public institutions to in-state/out-of-state postsecondary students. This policy statement establishes defi nitions, principles, criteria, and guidelines to assist institutional offi cials in the classifi cation of postsecondary students as in-state/out-ofstate students. Also, the policy statement should be helpful to prospective students in the determination of their in-state/ out-of-state status prior to enrollment or for those out-of-state students seeking to be reclassifi ed as in-state. Determination of in-state status for purposes of attendance at an institution in the state is based primarily on domicile as defi ned below.</p><p>Since 1890, it has been public policy in Oklahoma to provide comprehensive, public higher education opportunities for citizens to improve themselves, to upgrade the knowledge and skills of the Oklahoma work force, and to enhance the quality of life in Oklahoma generally. Therefore, residents of Oklahoma are afforded subsidies covering a portion of their educational costs at state colleges and universities. Out-of-state students are also provided educational subsidies, although at lower levels than those provided for permanent in-state students.</p><p>Out-of-state tuition waivers provide Oklahoma institutions the ability to attract and graduate out-of-state students with academic abilities and talents who contribute to the economic development, vitality and diversity of the state's campuses. Additionally, Oklahoma institutions located near the state's borders are especially sensitive to serving demographic areas where population, tax dollars, property ownership, etc., cross state borders frequently. Out-of-state tuition waivers allow institutions to serve the community and surrounding area to the benefi t of the institution and its students without detriment to Oklahoma residents</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.18.2">Defi nitions</head><p>The following words and terms, when used in the Chapter, shall have the following meaning, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:</p><p>"Dependent Person" is one who is under the care, custody, and support of a parent or legal guardian.</p><p>"Domicile" is a person's true, fi xed, permanent home or habitation. It is the place where he or she intends to remain and to which he or she expects to return. A person can have more than one residence, but only one domicile. Domicile has two components --residence and the intent to remain. When these two occur, there is domicile.</p><p>"Documented foreign national" is a person who was born outside the jurisdiction of the United States (U.S.), is a citizen of a foreign country, and has not become a naturalized U.S. citizen under U.S. law, but has entered the U.S. by way of legal documentation such as a visa.</p><p>"Full-Time Professional Practitioner or Worker" is a U.S. Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident who has come to Oklahoma to practice a profession on a full-time basis, conduct a business full-time, or work on a full-time basis.</p><p>"Full-Time Student" is an undergraduate student enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester in an academic year or a minimum of six credit hours in a summer session. A full-a. Names of the participating technology center and the participating higher education institution. time graduate student is one enrolled in a minimum of nine credit hours per semester or as required by the institution.</p><p>"Home of Record" is the location where the reservist enlisted, reenlisted, or was commissioned into the military.</p><p>"Independent person" is one who is responsible for his or her own care, custody, and support.</p><p>"In-state" status is a classifi cation for a postsecondary student who has lived continuously in Oklahoma for at least 12 months not primarily as a postsecondary student and has established domicile in Oklahoma or meets requirements associated with in-state status including sections 3.18.4, 3.18.7 and 3.18.9. Students classifi ed upon admission as instate are eligible to apply for state scholarship and fi nancial aid programs.</p><p>"Lawful permanent resident" is a naturalized alien who has been granted offi cial immigration status as a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. This is evidenced by a lawful permanent resident card (also called a "green card").</p><p>"Out-of-state" status means an individual does not meet in-state requirements defi ned in this policy unless otherwise allowed by exceptions or provisions in policy.</p><p>"Out-of-state tuition waiver" is the portion of tuition that is waived in excess of that paid by students classifi ed as in-state. This is referred to as "Nonresident Tuition Waiver" in State Regents' Fiscal policy.</p><p>"Undocumented student" is a person who was born outside the jurisdiction of the U.S., is a citizen of a foreign country, and has not become a naturalized U.S. Citizen under U.S. Law and has entered the U.S. without documentation. Refer to 3.18.6 "Uniformed services" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public Health Service.</p><p>"U.S. Citizen" is a person born in the United States, a U.S. Territory or former U.S. Territory or who has been granted citizenship by the U.S. Government.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.18.3">Principles</head><p>As part of the admissions process, institutions are responsible for determining students' in-state/out-of-state status consistent with this policy. Administrators interview students, review documentation and are in the best position to determine whether the student may be classifi ed as in-state. Each institution must designate an appropriate administrative offi cial (most often the Admissions Offi cer) as responsible for administration of this policy. Clarifi cation and additional information including documentation examples and frequently asked questions are in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.</p><p>The burden of proof to establish in-state status shall be upon the student. Since residence or domicile is a matter of intent, each case will be judged on its own merit by the appropriate administrative offi cial(s) consistent with this policy. Mere assertion by a student such as checking "In-State" on the application for admission is insuffi cient. The appropriate administrative offi cial must review relevant documents, consider the policy principles and procedures, circumstances, and documentation to determine in-state status. While no set criteria, documentation, or set of circumstances can be used for this purpose, the principles outlined below guide the process.</p><p>A. Attendance at a postsecondary educational institution, albeit a continuous and long-term experience, does not establish in-state status. Therefore, a student neither gains nor loses instate status solely by such attendance.</p><p>B. Students attending an Oklahoma college or university may perform many objective acts, some of which are required by law (i.e. payment of taxes), and all of which are customarily done by some out-of-state students who do not intend to remain in Oklahoma after graduation, but are situational and necessary and/or voluntary (i.e. registering to vote, obtaining a driver's license). Such acts and/or declarations alone are insuffi cient evidence of intent to remain in Oklahoma beyond the college experience.</p><p>C. An out-of-state student attending an Oklahoma college or university on more than a half-time basis is presumed to be in the state primarily for educational purposes.</p><p>D. An individual is not deemed to have acquired in-state status until he or she has been in the state for at least a year primarily as a permanent resident and not primarily as a student and has established domicile. Likewise, an individual classifi ed as in-state shall not be reclassifi ed as out-of-state until 12 months after leaving Oklahoma to live in another state.</p><p>E. Unless residency has been established in another state, an individual who resided in Oklahoma at the time of graduation from an Oklahoma high school and has resided in the state with a parent or legal guardian for two years prior to graduation from high school will be eligible for in-state status and as allowed in 3.18.7 and 3.18.8.</p><p>F. Each spouse in a family shall establish his or her own status on a separate basis. Exceptions include the following: when an out-of-state status individual marries a person with in-state status, the out-of-state individual may be considered in-state after documentation of the marriage and proof of domicile are satisfi ed without the 12 month domiciliary waiting period, and as provided in sections 3.18.7 or 3.18.8.</p><p>G. Initial classifi cation as out-of-state shall not prejudice the right of a person to be reclassifi ed thereafter for following semesters or terms of enrollment as in-state provided that he or she establish domicile as defi ned in this policy. Institutions must establish procedures for students to appeal out-of-state status classifi cation.</p><p>H. Institutions may, but are not required, to waive out-of-state tuition (also known as Nonresident Tuition Waiver) in accordance with current State Regents' Tuition and Fees policy 4.18.5.B that allows any institution in the State System to waive a portion of the out-of-state tuition which amount shall not exceed the difference between out-of-state tuition and the amount paid by in-state students.</p><p>I. When a student transfers from one institution to another, the institution to which the student transfers is not bound by the in-state/out-of-state classifi cation previously determined and may request documentation to determine the student's instate/out-of-state status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.18.4">Dependent and Independent Persons</head><p>A. The legal residence of a dependent person is the postsecondary student's parents or the residence of the parent who has legal custody or the parent with whom the student habitually resides. If the student is under the care of those other than the parents, the legal residence is that of the student's legal guardian.</p><p>B. In-state/out-of-state classifi cations of postsecondary students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., divorced parents with joint custody when one parent or legal guardian lives outof-state and/or claimed as a dependent on a tax return, etc.) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Guidance for administrative offi cers charged with classifying students will be provided in the procedures manual.</p><p>C. A dependent person may establish independent person status through circumstances including, marriage, formal court action, abandonment by parents, etc. To qualify, a dependent person must have completely separated from the parental or guardian domicile and prove that such separation is complete and permanent. Additionally, the individual must provide evidence that they are responsible for their housing and living expenses. Mere absence from the parental or guardian domicile is not proof of its complete abandonment. If an applicant can provide adequate and satisfactory evidence of independent status and domicile, they may be granted in-state status.</p><p>D. If an independent person can provide evidence of coming to Oklahoma to establish domicile, the applicant may be granted in-state status at the next enrollment occurring after expiration of 12 months following establishment of domicile in Oklahoma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.18.5">Documented Foreign Nationals</head><p>Documented foreign nationals may attend as postsecondary students if they have appropriate educational visas. These individuals are eligible for in-state classifi cation if they become lawful permanent residents, have resided in Oklahoma for at least 12 consecutive months, and meet domicile requirements as set forth in this policy.</p><p>Documented foreign nationals who are present in the U.S. with visas that allow full-time employment for extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, athletics, as an executive, manager, or specialist of a treaty nation company operating in the U.S. are eligible for out-of-state tuition waivers as long as they remain in full-time working status. Dependents of these documented foreign nationals who are lawfully present in Oklahoma based on the documented foreign national's visa are also eligible for out-of-state tuition waivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.18.6">Undocumented Students</head><p>Pursuant to Title 70, O.S., Section 3242 (2007) (also known as HB1804 of the First Regular Session of the 51st Legislature), an individual who cannot present to the institution valid documentation of United States nationality or an immigration status permitting study at a postsecondary institution but who:</p><p>A. Graduated from a public or private Oklahoma high school;</p><p>B. Resided in this state with a parent or legal guardian while attending classes at an Oklahoma public or private high school in this state for at least two (2) years prior to graduation; and C. Satisfi es admission standards for the institution.</p><p>Individuals who meet the above requirements are eligible for enrollment and/or out-of-state tuition waivers if that individual:</p><p>1. Provides the institution with a copy of a true and correct application or petition fi led with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) to legalize the student's immigration status, or 2. Files an affi davit with the institution stating that the student will fi le an application to legalize his or her immigration status at the earliest opportunity the student is eligible to do so, but in no case later than: a. One <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> year after the date on which the student enrolls for study at the institution, or b. If there is no formal process to permit children of parents without lawful immigration status to apply for lawful status without risk of deportation, one <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> year after the date the USCIS provides such a formal process, and 3. If the student fi les an affi davit pursuant to subsection B. above, presents to the institution a copy of a true and correct application or petition fi led with the USCIS no later than: a. One <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> year after the date on which the student enrolls for study at the institution, or b. If there is no formal process to permit children of parents without lawful immigration status to apply for lawful status without risk of deportation, one (1) year after the date the USCIS provides such a formal process, which copy shall be maintained in the institution's records for that student.</p><p>4. Any student who completes and provides the institution with a copy of a true and correct application or petition fi led with USCIS to legalize the student's immigration status shall not be disqualifi ed on the basis of the student's immigration status from any scholarships or fi nancial aid provided by this state as long as the student meets the following:</p><p>a. Graduated from a public or private Oklahoma high school;</p><p>b. Resided in this state with a parent or legal guardian while attending classes at an Oklahoma public or private high school in this state for at least two (2) years prior to graduation; and c. Satisfi es admission standards for the institution.</p><p>5. This policy shall not impose any additional conditions to maintain eligibility for an out-of-state tuition waiver at a postsecondary educational institution within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education on a student who was enrolled in a degree program and fi rst received an out-ofstate tuition wavier and/or access to state scholarships at that institution during the 2006-2007 school year or any prior year</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Improvement of Teaching and Learning</head><p>For the purpose of improving teaching and learning, each college and university shall assess students using criteria approved by the State Regents and including at least the following four categories: (1) entry level to determine academic preparation and course placement;</p><p>(2) general education assessment; (3) academic program learning outcomes assessment; and (4) student engagement and satisfaction. Assessment applies to all students including those admitted through adult admission (refer to Adult Admission in the Institutional Admission and Retention policy). Assessment will be consistent with the HLC Criteria for Accreditation and Core Components and consistent with 3.7 Academic Program Review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Accountability and Institutional Effectiveness</head><p>Assessment for accountability and institutional effectiveness should, whenever possible, be compared to external benchmarks. Data in each category of assessment will be reported to the State Regents annually and will include detailed information designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the assessments consistent with the mission and programs of the institution. Reports may include the annual student assessment report and national assessment reports for comparing institutions and State Systems.</p><p>As institutions develop criteria and select assessment measures that demonstrate institutional effectiveness, each assessment should be coordinated and complement the improvement of teaching and learning. Institutions should evaluate the validity and reliability of the assessments.</p><p>In recognition of varying institutional missions and student populations served, assessment for accountability and institutional effectiveness should include the institutional characteristics that produce the most meaningful comparisons and useful information for improvement. Assessment programs should also consider the needs of special populations in the development of policies and procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Developmental Education</head><p>Certain disciplines, most notably English, mathematics, and science, build on requisite knowledge. College courses in such disciplines assume a student knowledge base gained in high school or other previous academic experiences. It is therefore imperative that students not enroll in college-level courses in the fi elds when lacking that knowledge.</p><p>Students should not enroll in college-level courses, such as history or other elective courses, without a necessary foundation in reading and writing.</p><p>Students, who can demonstrate competency in an academic fi eld, even though they did not take the required course(s) in high school, will have the curricular defi ciency waived. Such students will be allowed to enroll in the respective discipline's college-level courses.</p><p>Within the State System, the community college tier is offi cially designated as responsible for developmental education. Although institutions in other tiers, with the exception of regional universities with assigned community college functions, do not have this developmental education responsibility, such institutions may also offer developmental education.</p><p>Developmental education at all state system institutions shall be fully supported through student fees.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Concurrently Enrolled High School Students</head><p>High school students wishing to enroll concurrently in college courses must meet the designated score in English, mathematics, and science or they will not be permitted enrollment in the corresponding college subject area. A student scoring below the established ACT score in reading will not be permitted enrollment in any collegiate course (outside the subjects of science, mathematics, and English). Concurrent enrollment students are not eligible for secondary institutional assessments and may not enroll in developmental education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Adult Students</head><p>Institutions must assess adult students' academic competence through the evaluation of basic academic skills or curricular requirements appropriate. This must be done through participation in the ACT or the review of additional information. If indicated by the course placement information, adult students must be remediated consistent with this policy. Institutions are responsible for directing students to complete developmental education within the fi rst year or 24 college-level credit hours.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Pell Grants</head><p>Federal Pell Grants are awarded to eligible undergraduate students who show fi nancial need based on a standard formula. Funding is not limited by the number of students who apply. The Federal Pell Grant is the only type of aid that may cover less than half-time enrollment (1-5 hours). Students are limited to 12 semester of full-time enrollments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG)</head><p>SEOG awards are made to undergraduate students who have exceptional fi nancial need.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vocational Rehabilitation Program</head><p>A student who has an impairment to employment because of a physical or an emotional impairment may apply for payment of tuition and other services to the Division's District Offi ce on campus which is located at 1001 E. 14th St. The phone number is 332-0178. In order to be eligible for this assistance, a student's impairment must be medically established, and their vocational objective must be approved by the appropriate counselor of the Division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LOANS</head><p>Several types of loans are available to help students pay for school. Loans must be repaid with interest. Loans require entrance counseling prior to disbursement of funds and exit counseling prior to graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time. Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments. The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester. Students must repay loans even if they do not complete their education, are not able to get a job after completing the program or are dissatisfi ed with the education for which they paid. The Health Care Act of 2010 (H. R. 4872) eliminated the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and requires schools to participate in the William D. Ford Direct Lending Program. Since the federal government will be the only lender, new and former loan borrowers (prior to Summer, 2010) will need to complete a Direct Loan Master Promissory Note and Direct Loan Entrance Counseling to continue receiving student loans. Students may also want to consider loan consolidation to avoid multiple payments to more than one lender. Students should refer to the Direct Loan tab and the loan consolidation tab on the fi nancial aid webpage for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program (subsidized and unsubsidized)</head><p>The Stafford Loan is a low interest loan guaranteed and funded by the federal government. The federal government pays the interest on the subsidized Stafford loan while the student is in school and during the grace period. The student is responsible for the interest on the unsubsidized Stafford loan. Repayment normally begins six months after graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time. The monthly repayment amount depends on the total amount borrowed, the length of the payment period and the repayment option chosen.</p><p>The amount of the loan is determined by the Financial Aid Offi ce, and depends on several variables such as expected family contribution as determined by the FAFSA, other types of fi nancial assistance which the student receives and grade level. East Central University may not deliver the fi rst installment of Stafford Loan proceeds to a fi rst-year undergraduate student who has not previously received a Stafford Loan until 30 days after the fi rst day of classes (the 31st day). Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments. The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester. To qualify for a Stafford Loan, undergraduate students must be enrolled in at least 6 hours and graduate students must be enrolled in at least 4 hours. All summer loans are disbursed in two payments, one in June and the second in July.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct PLUS Program</head><p>This loan may be available to families of dependent students when other types of aid do not meet their needs. It is a loan program similar to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program. Repayment normally begins 60 days after the last loan disbursement for the loan period. However, if a deferment applies, borrowers do not begin repaying any principal until the deferment ends. The lender will run a credit check on all PLUS Loan borrowers. The student must be enrolled in at least 6 hours for the parent to qualify for a PLUS loan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT EMPLOYMENT</head><p>Many students are employed by area businesses. Others work on campus either as regular student employees or as participants in the Federal Work Study program. Student employment allows students to earn money to pay for educational costs while providing valuable job experience. Money is earned hourly and paid monthly. ECU offers a variety of community service employment opportunities funded through the federal work-study program. The University assists students in securing this work. Further information may be obtained from the Financial Aid Offi ce, or Employment Services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VETERANS ADMINISTRATION EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS/PROGRAMS</head><p>East Central University is approved for students who are eligible for a variety of Veterans Administration benefi ts. The Offi ce of Veterans Affairs will provide information, as well as assistance, in the proper fi ling of all forms for those who are eligible for educational benefi ts.</p><p>Information is available concerning all G.I.

This includes post-secondary and military transcripts. All transcripts must be provided before a student can be certifi ed for VA benefi ts. ECU will evaluate these records, and when possible, grant appropriate credit for the previous education and/or training, shorten the length of the training program, and notify the student regarding the amount of credit being granted for previous training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORIENTATION</head><p>Every student should have a current copy of each of the following University publications: the Catalog, the ECU Student Handbook and the Schedule. The Student Handbook contains the East Central University Student Code of Conduct. The Handbook is available online at www.ecok.edu/student-development/student-development-home/ ecu-student-handbook. Since the Catalog explains the operation of and gives the rules of the University, the student will refer to it often. Usually a student follows the degree plan as stated in the catalog effective at East Central University at the beginning of his or her continuous enrollment. A continuous enrollment shall mean assignment of an East Central University grade on the transcript of at least one semester hour, semester after semester-excluding summer-until graduation. Additional rules to the above policies are: a. If the student leaves East Central University and returns during a later term, continuous enrollment at any accredited institution will also be acceptable.</p><p>b. If general education requirements are completed under an East Central University Catalog at the time of the student's enrollment, the new general education requirements need not be met.</p><p>c. If the student is in attendance at East Central University when changes are made in the requirements for three components, the general education program and/or the major and/or the minor program of studies, he or she may follow the requirements of either component in effect at his or her fi rst enrollment or he or she may choose to follow the requirements of any successive catalog provided that he or she is in continuous enrollment.</p><p>d. If a student is suspended by the University for academic reasons, he or she may return under the original catalog within a year. e. In cases not covered by the above rules, the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs, in consultation with the student, will determine which catalog will be in effect for that student's graduation.</p><p>Any changes imposed by law or policies by governing regulatory boards or agencies become effective at the date specifi ed regardless of continuous enrollment or provision stated above. East Central University would in no case be obligated to offer courses only for a student to meet degree requirements under a previous catalog. The Schedule, published each semester, gives vital information about the current term.</p><p>A student may become familiar with East Central University by reading this chapter and by referring to other parts of the Catalog, and to the Schedule. Additional help in becoming familiar with the University is given at the Freshman Advisement and Enrollment to beginning freshmen (students with 6 or fewer attempted credit hours, excluding remedial [0-level courses] or pre-college work and excluding credit hours accumulated by concurrently enrolled high school students). This session occurs at times indicated in the Schedule. All beginning freshmen will be required to successfully complete new student orientation immediately prior to their fi rst semester of enrollment and UNIV 1001 Freshman Seminar in their fi rst semester of enrollment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISBURSEMENT POLICIES</head><p>Student aid eligibility is computed to the maximum amount possible in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines and the availability of funds. In the event that this amount does not cover all costs, the student must pay the balance from some other source. This aid may not be used for deposits, physical exams or any other fees that are due prior to enrollment. East Central University has no obligation to make this aid available until the student is properly admitted and enrolled.</p><p>Awards for the fall and spring semesters are normally made at the same time. One-half of the total aid for the school year will be made available in the fall semester and one-half in the spring. Awards for summer school are made late in the spring semester. A separate summer aid application is required. The summer aid application may be obtained in the Financial Aid Offi ce when summer enrollment begins.</p><p>If the student has been awarded for the fall and spring and does not attend the fall semester, the award will be cancelled for both semesters unless the student specifi cally requests that aid for the spring be continued. This will be done if funds are available on the date of request. In addition, if the student drops below half-time, the second semester Stafford Loan must be cancelled and the student must reapply.</p><p>If the student withdraws during the fall term, the award will be cancelled for the spring term. If the student wishes to return to school for the spring or summer term, the student should contact the Financial Aid Offi ce to have the application re-evaluated. East Central University may not deliver the fi rst installment of Stafford Loan proceeds to a fi rstyear undergraduate student who has not previously received a Stafford Loan until 30 days after the fi rst day of classes (the 31st day). Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments. The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester.</p><p>All fi nancial aid funds are credited to the ECU Bursar account and refunds are disbursed through Higher One. Students are required to activate the ECU Tiger Card and may choose either an ACH transfer (direct deposit to a currently existing bank account) or open a Higher One account. Students need to carefully review their options before making a selection. Although the ACH transfer may take slightly longer depending on the policies of their bank, certain transaction fees may apply to the Higher One account and $500 is the maximum cash withdrawal per day from any ATM. Students may contact the Controller or Bursar if they have questions pertaining to the ECU Tiger Card.</p><p>The initial disbursement each semester occurs approximately two weeks following the end of the 100% refund period (10 class days for fall and spring). After the initial disbursement each semester, funds are disbursed twice a week as they are received. First time loan recipients who are freshmen must wait until the 31st day of classes to receive their loan funds. Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Oklahoma's Promise, etc., are disbursed when received from their respective agencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE IDENTIFICATION</head><p>Department course offerings are listed in their respective school sections of the Catalog. The courses offered in a particular semester or term are listed in the Schedule. Many departments regularly post a list of courses to be taught within a few terms in the future.</p><p>A course prefi x indicates the department offering the course. The fi rst digit of a four-digit course number indicates the class level (0 is pre-collegiate; 1 is freshman; 2 is sophomore; 3 is junior; 4 is senior; 5 is graduate). The last digit of a four-digit number indicates the credit. ENG 2243, for example, is a sophomore course offered by the English Department for 3 hours of credit. CJSOC 4313 is a senior course offered by both the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Sociology for 3 hours of credit.</p><p>The digits 499 (undergraduate) and 599 (graduate) at the beginning of a course number indicate a course of individual study (directed individual study on a special subject or problem).</p><p>A prerequisite course is one in which a student must earn credit before enrolling in another particular course. A corequisite course is one in which a student must enroll concurrently while enrolled in another course. The course description (a brief description following the number and title) indicates any prerequisite or corequisite for a course. With the permission of the instructor, a prerequisite or corequisite may be waived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Graduate Study</head><p>See School of Graduate Studies -Admission Categories for details. labeled the same. The undergraduate schools and colleges are made up of departments (for example, the Art Department and the Biology Department), which offer courses in their own academic fi elds.</p><p>A course meets a specifi c number of clock hours each week throughout a semester (Fall or Spring semester) or summer session. A regular semester meets for sixteen weeks. A summer session meets for eight weeks. Occasionally courses are offered as intersession or accelerated courses. Dates and times of those courses which meet less than a full term are noted in the Schedule. When a student makes a passing grade in a course, he or she earns the appropriate semester hour(s) of credit. During a regular semester, a lecture course will meet 50 minutes per week for each hour of credit being granted. Laboratory courses will meet a minimum of 120 minutes per week for each hour of credit. Class periods during shorter terms and sessions will be adjusted proportionately.</p><p>As a student accumulates hours of credit, his or her classifi cation changes. A student is a freshman if he or she has earned 0-29 semester hours, a sophomore if he or she has earned 30-59 hours, a junior if he or she has earned 60-89 semester hours, or a senior if he or she has earned 90 or more semester hours. A student is a post-graduate student if he or she has earned a bachelors degree but has not earned graduate credit. A graduate student is one who has earned at least a bachelors degree and who earns graduate credit.</p><p>Most semester hours earned will apply toward a bachelors degree. Some semester hours apply toward general education requirements (courses required by the university prior to graduation which give a broad background in a variety of subject areas) while others are in the student's major (a fi eld of intense specialization) or minor (a fi eld of less intense specialization) areas. Additional courses taken to complete degree requirements are called elective courses. Some majors require minors and some do not. Students should refer to major requirements for specifi c graduation requirements.</p><p>Lower-division courses are generally taken during a student's freshman and sophomore years and are listed as 1000-2000 level. Some freshmen may also be required to take pre-collegiate level (0-level) courses during their fi rst year of attendance. Upper-division courses are generally taken during a student's junior, senior, or postgraduate years and consist of 3000-4000 level courses. During the freshman and sophomore years, the student usually takes general education courses and decides on a major and minor. During the junior and senior years, the student usually takes a greater number of classes in the major and minor areas. Graduate students will enroll in graduate courses numbered as 5000 level. With the approval of the instructor, a senior having earned more than 99 semester hours credit may enroll in a 5000 level course. These courses, if taken for graduate credit, may not apply on a bachelors degree. Seniors, however, may not enroll in an individual study course on the graduate level. 5000 level courses must be taken for graduate credit if the student holds a bachelors degree.</p><p>A student plans his or her course load each semester with the help of an advisor. An advisor is an instructor in the student's major area who assists in planning the student's schedule each semester. Should a student be pursuing two majors, he or she should have an advisor in each area. The student is responsible for keeping both advisors informed on degree plans from each major.</p><p>Each student is fully responsible for meeting the requirements of the university. He or she must plan his or her own course load to suit his or her own program and goals. The student should consult the assigned advisor at appropriate times for help with and approval of his or her plans. To aid in the planning process, at the end of each semester the Records Offi ce makes available the grades and hours a student has earned. When he or she becomes a junior, the Records Offi ce will prepare an offi cial degree requirement check sheet at the student's request.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGISTRATION, COURSE LOAD, AND OVERLOAD REGISTRATION</head><p>Information concerning registration is published in the Schedule. Although advisors assist students and grant enrollment clearance, each student is responsible for the correctness of his or her own course load and for seeing that it suits his or her own program. Before registering, a student should be familiar with all degree requirements.</p><p>A student may register late but no later than the fi rst week of a semester, the fi rst week of a summer session, or the fi fth class day of a half-semester course. Deadlines for registering in a class with an atypical schedule are determined proportional to those for a full term. Registration policies for intersession courses are unique. Specifi c details may be found in the Schedule.</p><p>A student may not be registered at both East Central University and another institution at the same time without prior approval from each institution. Overload regulations apply to students enrolling on more than one campus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE LOAD AND OVERLOAD APPROVAL</head><p>An undergraduate student should register each semester or term in a course load which meets his or her needs. Minimum loads are required for veteran's benefi ts, student loans, sports eligibility, and so forth. Although an undergraduate student is usually considered a full-time student if he or she takes a load of a minimum of 12 semester hours in a semester or 6 semester hours in a summer session, the normal load is 15 or 16 semester hours in a semester or 8 or 9 semester hours in a summer session. This load, regularly taken, will enable a student to</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Taking a Regular Course</head><p>A student ordinarily earns credit toward a degree by selecting regularly scheduled courses. These courses are taught in classrooms on the campus or at approved off-campus locations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Taking an Individual Study Course</head><p>A superior student may pursue special academic interests in consultation with an instructor outside the conventional class structure. The department chairperson and dean must approve this study, which ordinarily is from one to four semester hours for each course.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Policy and Procedures</head><p>A. Students eligible to receive advanced standing credit at East Central University must be enrolled at East Central University as a resident student.</p><p>B. Advanced standing credit awarded to a student must be validated by successful completion of 12 or more semester hours at East Central University before being placed on the student's offi cial transcript. Successful completion is determined to be a 2.0 retention GPA. fulfi ll the graduation requirement of 124 semester hours in 8 semesters or the equivalent. A student may register for as many as 20 semester hours in a semester or 10 semester hours in a summer session without special permission. To register for an overload of as many as 24 hours in a semester or 15 in a summer, the student must have the approval of the Dean of his or her major. Oklahoma Regents allow no more than 24 semester hours credit granted for a fall or spring semester, or 15 hours for a summer term without special approval from the university president or his or her designee. It should be noted that status for Financial Aid may be different from status for enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANGING A COURSE LOAD OR FORMALLY WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY</head><p>Changing a course load or withdrawing from the university results from the student's formally processing the transaction. See the ECU Schedule for specifi c procedures and deadlines.</p><p>A student may add a full semester course to his or her course load within the fi rst week of classes in a semester, the fi rst week of classes in a summer session, the fi rst fi ve class days of a half-semester course, or the fi rst three days of a half summer session course. Deadlines for adding a class with an atypical schedule are determined proportional to those for a full term.</p><p>A student who formally withdraws from a course through the twenty-eighth day (fi ve weeks plus 3 days) of a summer session or the eleventh week of a semester receives the guaranteed grade of "W" for the course. One who withdraws after the guaranteed "W" deadline through the seventh week of a summer session or the fourteenth week of a semester may receive "W" for the course if passing, "F" if failing. The assignment of an "F" is optional to the instructor. Time limits for withdrawing from a class meeting less than a full term are proportional to those for a full term.</p><p>An instructor may withdraw a student from a course he or she teaches if the student's attendance or performance becomes unsatisfactory. A student who stops attending one or all of his or her classes without formally withdrawing will receive an "F" in each unfi nished course. If a student's attendance or performance becomes unsatisfactory, he or she may be required to withdraw from the University.</p><p>shall not exceed the criteria and recommendations contained in publications of the American Council on Education especially designed for that purpose. East Central University reserves the right to evaluate for credit on a course-by-course basis. 5. Credit for experiential learning, including but not limited to military occupational specialties (MOS), may be granted only on a course-by-course basis in instances in which an approved academic unit at East Central University determines, on the basis of appropriate validation (i.e., not based simply on the presentation of experience), that the credit is equivalent to a course offered by East Central University.</p><p>E. Validation procedures used should:</p><p>1. be weighted in objectivity versus subjectivity to the extent that external evaluators would reach the same conclusion given the materials reviewed;</p><p>2. specify competencies sought to establish credit; methods such as comprehensive papers or structured comprehensive oral examinations with competency based questions should be used.</p><p>F. Credit may be earned by advanced standing examinations and applied to a degree program subject to meeting the residency requirements of East Central University which is 30 semester hours and subject to the availability of established procedures to validate a course. Credit earned by advanced standing will not count toward meeting the 30 semester hours residency requirements at East Central University.</p><p>G. East Central University shall require a minimum score as prescribed by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education for national examinations and a grade level of C or better for examinations constructed at East Central University in order to record credit in a particular subject.</p><p>H. East Central University will award advanced standing credit only in those courses which are taught at East Central University. The neutral grade of pass (P) will be utilized to designate advanced standing credit. All credit earned through advanced standing examinations will be designated as such on the transcript.</p><p>I. Charges for administration and recording of departmentally administered advanced standing examinations shall be at the rate of $5 per semester-credit-hour. Charges for administration and recording of nationally developed advanced standing examinations shall be at the rate established by the national testing agency for the particular test in question. No other charges shall be made for the administration or recording of advanced standing credit.</p><p>J. Advanced standing credit, once recorded and validated at East Central University, is transferable on the same basis as if the credit had been earned through regular study at East Central University. Advanced standing credit recorded and validated at other accredited institutions of higher education will be accepted as if the credit had been earned through regular study at the awarding institution.</p><p>K. Advanced standing credit will not be considered as part of the regular study load for the semester or term in which the credit is recorded.</p><p>L. No graduate credit will be granted by advanced standing examinations at East Central University.</p><p>M. East Central University will administer advanced standing examinations only in those academic disciplines which are taught at East Central University. A student is not eligible to receive advanced standing credit in any course unless he or she is eligible to enroll in the course at East Central University; no student may take the advanced standing examination in any course in which he or she already has credit. No student will be permitted to repeat an advanced standing examination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Taking an Educational Tour Course</head><p>On occasion, the University provides educational tours as special features of the academic program. These tours, at times, are entirely within the continental United States, and, in some instances, they involve travel and study in foreign countries. They are planned and conducted in a manner to make them soundly educational and wholesomely recreational. Generally they are directed by instructional departments of the University, and they provide for earning credit appropriate to the time spent and the educational opportunities afforded. Costs to the students are kept at a minimum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Taking a Course via Electronic Media</head><p>A student may earn credit for courses delivered electronically at East Central University or at one of the approved off-campus locations. East Central University, having both receiving classrooms and transmitting studios, is a participating member of OneNet, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education statewide instructional and communications network. This two way video and audio instructional method allows institutions to share the best available faculty and courses via Instructional Television.</p><p>A student may also earn credit for courses delivered in a web-based environment over the internet.</p><p>All Oklahoma State Regents' and institutional policies, standards, and guidelines for on-campus instruction apply to electronic instruction with the exception of course meeting time as defi ned in the State Regents' Academic Calendar Policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Auditing a Course</head><p>An applicant must qualify for admission to enroll in an audited course. A student earns no credit for auditing a course. An audit student may attend class only as an observer; he or she may not take any examinations. A student may audit a course if he or she does not plan to take it later for credit. Changing class status either to or from audit status must be done prior to the last day to enroll in the course. Fees for a class being audited are the same as if the class were being taken for credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Duplicating a Course</head><p>A student earns no credit for taking a course substantially equivalent to a course for which he or she has already received credit, regardless of whether he or she intended to duplicate work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.">Transferring Credit for the General Education Requirement (Articulation Policy)</head><p>East Central University participates with certain other Oklahoma institutions in a reciprocal transfer agreement (the Regents' Articulation Policy). By virtue of this agreement a student who has completed his or her general education requirement and received an Associate degree in Arts or Science at one of the participating Oklahoma two-year colleges may fulfi ll East Central University's general education requirement by transferring his or her credit to East Central University. Transferring credit for general education does not eliminate or otherwise affect any of the following East Central University requirements: (1) prerequisites; (2) specifi c requirements in majors, minors or related work in these areas; (3) the requirements for teacher certifi cation. Not included in this transfer arrangement are vocational and technical twoyear college programs and other programs not primarily designated for students intending to transfer to bachelor's degree programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.">Transferring Credit from Accredited Institutions</head><p>A student may transfer from approved institutions up to 94 semester hours of approved credit toward a degree or a program. No more than 64 hours of the transferred credit may be earned at two-year colleges. No more than 32 hours of the transferred college credit may be earned at one-year colleges. A student may transfer credit from a two-year college after he or she has earned 64 hours or from a one-year college after he or she has earned 32 hours only if the credit is in courses that are equivalent to lower-division courses at East Central University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">Transferring Credit from Unaccredited Institutions</head><p>After completing at least twelve hours at East Central University with a grade average of "C" or higher, a student may ask to have credits transferred from unaccredited institutions. If his or her request is approved, he or she may transfer credit generally on the basis of credit acceptance policies described in "Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions," a publication of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Offi cers. Credit is evaluated on a course-by-course basis and is usually granted only toward specifi c requirements in the general education, major and/or minor areas.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.12.3">Grading Terms</head><p>The following types of grading entries with respective defi nitions will be used for institutional transcript notations: A. Other Symbols I An incomplete grade may be used at the instructor's discretion to indicate that additional work is necessary to complete a course. It is not a substitute for an "F", and no student may be failing a course at the time an "I" grade is awarded. To receive an "I" grade, the student should have satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the required course work for the semester. "I" grades must be changed by the instructor within one year from the end of the semester in which the "I" was assigned or they will remain as a permanent "I" and not contribute to the student's GPA. Prior to fall 1993, an "I" grade became an "F" if the work was not completed in the required time frame.</p><p>For students who are members of the active uniformed military service, refer to Leave of Absence <ref type="bibr">(3.12.3.B)</ref>.</p><p>AU Audit status is used for the student not interested in obtaining a course grade, but who is enrolled to get course content knowlegdge. The allowable time to change an enrollment status from audit to credit will be established by each institution but may not exceed the institution's add period and must be consistent with the State Regents' add period, which is defi ned as the fi rst two weeks of a regular semester/term and the fi rst week of a summer semester/ term. Students who change their enrollment status from audit to credit must meet institutional admission/retention standards as set by the State Regents. The allowable time to change an enrollment status from credit to audit will be established by each institution, but will not exceed the institution's last date for withdrawal from classes. An AU is GPA neutral.</p><p>W An automatic withdrawal grade of "W" is issued when a student initiates a withdrawal during the institution's allowable withdrawal period. An institution's withdrawal period for an automatic "W" shall begin after the tenth day of classes in the regular session and the fi fth day of classes in the summer term and shall not exceed 12 weeks of a 16-week semester or, in general, not exceed three-fourths of the duration of any term. (These are maximum limits. The State Regents encourage institutions to establish shorter limits.) For any drop or withdrawal accepted after this deadline, a "W" or "F" will be assigned depending upon the student's standing in the class and the institution's stated withdrawal policy. If an "F" grade is assigned, it is calculated in the student's GPA; the "W" grade is GPA neutral.</p><p>WF Withdrawal Failing. This grade may be given if a student is failing when he or she formally withdraws from a course within the prescribed time. (Discontinued beginning Fall 1993.) AW Administrative Withdrawal may be assigned by the Offi ce of Academic Affairs or Student Affairs to indicate that a student has been "involuntarily" withdrawn from class(es) after the institution's drop-and-add period for disciplinary or fi nancial reasons or inadequate attendance. Such withdrawals must follow formal institutional procedures. Administrative withdrawals are GPA neutral.</p><p>S-U/ P-NP An institution may use the grades "S" or "U" and "P" or "NP" for specifi ed courses or may allow students to elect an "S/U" or "P/NP" option under circumstances specifi ed by the institution. The "S" and "P" are grades neutral indicating minimum course requirements have been met and credit has been earned. The "S" and "P" grades may also be used to indicate credit earned through advanced standing examinations. The grades of "U" and "NP" indicate that a student did not meet minimum requirements in a course designated for "S/U" or "P/NP" grading. While all four grades, "S, U, P, N/P" are GPA neutral, they are counted in the total number of attempted hours for retention and the total number of attempted and earned hours for graduation.</p><p>P-F An institution may use Pass-Fail as an option for students in specifi ed courses. The Pass grade indicates hours earned but does not contribute to the GPA. The Fail grade is an "F" and is calculated into the GPA.</p><p>N An "N" grade may be used by an institution to indicate that the semester grade was not submitted by the instructor by the appropriate deadline. The "N" grade must be replaced by the appropriate letter grade prior to the end of the subsequent semester. The "N" grade is GPA neutral.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Leave of Absence</head><p>Pursuant to Title 70, O.S., Section 3248, State System institutions shall grant a leave of absence, which shall not exceed a cumulative fi ve (5) years, to a student who is a member of the active uniformed military services of the United States and called to active duty. The student shall be eligible to:</p><p>1. Withdraw from any or all courses for the period of active duty service without penalty to admission status or GPA and without loss of institutional fi nancial aid. (for refund of tuition and fees refer to Budget and Fiscal policy 4.18.4.I); or 2. Receive an "I" for any or all courses for the period of active duty status irrespective of the student's grade at the time the "I" is awarded; provided, however, that the student has completed a minimum of fi fty percent (50%) of all coursework prior to being called to active duty and the student completes all courses upon return from active duty. The student's admission status and GPA shall not be penalized and the student shall not experience loss of institutional fi nancial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.12.4">Grade Point Averages</head><p>The GPA is used to determine a student's eligibility to remain enrolled or graduate from an institution. Activity courses and forgiven course work are not calculated in GPA. This GPA may be used to determine fi nancial aid eligibility, admission to graduate or professional programs, or for graduation honors.</p><p>The cumulative GPA includes grades for all course work, including activity courses and forgiven course work. The use of the cumulative GPA on transcript is optional, but it may be used to determine fi nancial aid eligibility, admission to graduate or professional programs, or for graduation honors.</p><p>Remedial/developmental courses, audited courses, and courses in which the grades of I, W, AW, S, U, P, NP, N and X are given are not calculated in the retention/graduation or cumulative GPAs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.12.6">Academic Forgiveness Provisions</head><p>Circumstances may justify a student being able to recover from academic problems in ways which do not forever jeopardize the students academic standing.</p><p>Academic forgiveness may be warranted for currently enrolled undergraduate students in three specifi c circumstances:</p><p>A. For pedagogical reasons, a student will be allowed to repeat a course and count only the second grade earned in the calculation of the GPA under the prescribed circumstances listed below.</p><p>B. There may be extraordinary situations in which a student has done poorly in up to two semesters due to extenuating circumstances which, in the judgment of the appropriate institutional offi cials, warrants excluding grades from those semesters in calculating the student's GPA.</p><p>C. A student may be returning to college after an extended absence and/or under circumstances that warrant a fresh academic start.</p><p>Students may seek academic forgiveness utilizing the following institutional procedures. A student may receive no more than one academic reprieve or renewal in the academic career, and only one option (reprieve or renewal) can be used. The repeated courses provision may be utilized independent of reprieve or renewal within the limits prescribed below. All institutions will conform to the repeated courses forgiveness provision. Institutions may offer students academic reprieve or academic renewal as detailed below. Institutions that grant academic reprieve and/or academic renewal must submit an annual report to the State Regents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Repeated Courses</head><p>All State System institutions are required to offer the repeated courses provision.</p><p>A student shall have the prerogative to repeat courses and have only the second grade earned, even if it is lower than the fi rst grade, count in the calculation of the GPA, up to a maximum of four courses but not to exceed 18 hours, in the courses in which the original grade earned was a "D" or "F." Both attempts shall be recorded on the transcript with the earned grade for each listed in the semester earned. The Explanation of Grades section of the transcript will note that only the second grade earned is used in the calculation of the GPA. If a student repeats an individual course more than once, all grades earned, with the exception of the fi rst, are used to calculate the GPA. Students repeating courses above the fi rst four courses or 18 credit hours of "Ds" or "Fs" repeated may do so with the initial grades and repeat grades averaged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Academic Reprieve</head><p>Offering academic reprieve for students is optional for all State System institutions.</p><p>Academic reprieve is a provision allowing a student who has experienced extraordinary circumstances to disregard up to two semesters in the calculation of his or her GPA.</p><p>A student may request an academic reprieve from State System institutions with academic reprieve policies consistent with these guidelines:</p><p>1. At least three years must have elapsed between the period in which the grades being requested reprieved were earned and the reprieve request;</p><p>2. Prior to requesting the academic reprieve, the student must have earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher with no grade lower than a "C" in all regularly graded course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding activity or performance courses;</p><p>3. The request may be for one semester or term of enrollment or two consecutive semesters or terms of enrollments. If the reprieve is awarded, all grades and hours are included during the semester(s) for which a reprieve has been requested. If the student's request is for two consecutive semesters, the institution may choose to reprieve only one semester;</p><p>4. The student must petition for consideration of academic reprieve according to institutional policy; and 5. All courses remain on the student's transcript, but are not calculated in the student's GPA. Course work with a passing grade included in a reprieved semester may be used to demonstrate competency in the subject matter. However, the course work may not be used to fulfi ll credit hour requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Academic Renewal</head><p>Offering academic renewal for students is optional for all State System institutions.</p><p>Academic renewal is a provision allowing a student who has had academic trouble in the past and who has been out of higher education for a number of years to recover without penalty and have a fresh start. Under academic renewal, course work taken prior to a date specifi ed by the institution is not counted in the student's GPA.</p><p>A student may request academic renewal from State System institutions with academic renewal policies consistent with these guidelines:</p><p>1. At least fi ve years must have elapsed between the last semester being renewed and the renewal request;</p><p>2. Prior to requesting academic renewal, the student must have earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher with no grade lower than a "C" in all regularly graded course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding activity or performance courses;</p><p>3. The request will be for all courses completed before the date specifi ed in the request for renewal;</p><p>4. The student must petition for consideration of academic renewal according to institutional policy; and 5. All courses remain on the student's transcript, but are not calculated in the student's GPA. Neither the content nor credit hours of renewed course work may be used to fulfi ll any degree or graduation requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Transcript Notations</head><p>The student's academic transcript should be a full and accurate refl ection of the student's academic career. Therefore, in situations which warrant academic forgiveness, the transcript will refl ect all courses in which a student was enrolled and in which grades were earned, with the academic forgiveness provisions refl ected in such matters as how the GPA is calculated. Specifi cally, for those students who receive academic forgiveness by repeating courses or through academic reprieve or renewal, the transcript will refl ect the GPA excluding forgiven courses/semesters. The transcript may also note the cumulative GPA which includes all attempted regularly graded course work.</p><p>The Explanation of Grades section of the transcript will note the courses and semester(s) reprieved or renewed. Institutions will include a legend developed by the State Regents and consistent with this policy which defi nes the grading symbols listed on the student's transcript to the reader.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Posting a Grade</head><p>Faculty members are not required to post fi nal grades. If a faculty member chooses to post grades, safeguards must be taken in order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appealing a Grade</head><p>The University believes students should be given the opportunity to meet with instructors and department chairman to resolve issues concerning assigned grades. Student grade appeals are not intended to interfere with the instructor's right to determine the evaluation process and to perform that evaluation. They are intended for instances that deviate from the basic understanding of how grades are to be assigned.</p><p>Students wishing to appeal a grade should fi rst discuss the grade with the instructor. If the student is still dissatisfi ed and believes there are circumstances that merit an appeal of grade, the student should discuss the issue with the department chair and, if necessary, the dean. If further appeal is requested, information can be obtained on the process from the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs and/or designee.</p><p>A grade appeal must be initiated within one calendar year of the semester in which the grade was issued, (i.e., a fall semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next fall semester, a spring semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next spring semester, and a summer term grade must be initiated before the end of the next summer term).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Point Average</head><p>Grade point numerical values are: A is 4; B is 3; C is 2; D is 1; F is 0; WF is 0; and I is 0. Incomplete grades assigned prior to Fall 1993 were computed as F in grade point average calculation. Incomplete grades assigned Fall 1993 or later are disregarded in fi guring a grade point average. A grade point average is computed by multiplying the grade points earned in each course by the semester hours of that course, adding the results for each course, and dividing the total by the total credits attempted. A student shall have the prerogative to repeat courses and have only the second grade earned, even if it is lower than the fi rst grade, count in the calculation of the GPA, up to a maximum of four (4) courses or eighteen (18) hours, not to exceed eighteen (18) hours, in courses in which the original grade earned was a "D" or "F." The fi rst attempt shall be recorded on the transcript with the earned grade. The second course with its grade will be listed in the semester earned. The EXPLANATION OF GRADES section of the transcript will note that only the second grade earned is used in the calculation of the retention and graduation GPAs. If a student repeats an individual course more than once, all grades earned, with the exception of the fi rst, are used to calculate the retention and graduation GPAs. Students repeating courses above the fi rst 4 courses or 18 hours of "Ds" or "Fs" repeated may do so with the original grades and repeat grades averaged. The fi gure calculated is then rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, 1.594 is 1.59, and 1.595 is 1.60. The grades "P", "N", "AU" and "W" are disregarded in fi guring a grade point average.</p><p>(NOTE: This East Central University policy is based on the State Regents' Grading Policy and is subject to review and modifi cation by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transferring Grades</head><p>A transferred grade other than A, B, C, D, F, and WF has a value as close as possible to the one assigned by the institution where it was earned. A grade from an institution using a different grading system is given the value of a comparable grade at East Central University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance Requirements</head><p>Individual instructors determine the degree that tardiness and absence from class affect a student's grades and his or her ability to continue attending their classes. Makeup work, if it is permitted, also is done under conditions set by the instructor. Instructors notify students of their policies in each of their courses at the beginning of each semester or term.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, GRIEVANCE, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES Communicable Disease Policy</head><p>It is the general policy of the University that applicable state and federal laws pertaining to contagious or infectious diseases, all matters of public health, as well as those governing discrimination and privacy shall be appropriately observed and followed in its operation. All University personnel are expected to cooperate with authorized public health offi cials in resolving threatening situations which may arise. Recent events have brought attention to numerous communicable diseases including AIDS, H1N1 Flu, bacterial meningitis, mumps, measles, and rubella.</p><p>Critically important is an increasingly large body of information that clearly demonstrates that AIDS is not transmitted by any form of casual interpersonal contact. The causative virus is actually surprisingly fragile, and does not survive and multiply in the air, on inanimate objects, or on environmental surfaces. It does not swim across pools or fl y. Medical research studies in households and schools have demonstrated convincingly and repeatedly that the risk of transmission of AIDS is exclusively that of intimate sexual contact, mother to child, shared needles and that transmission in an ordinary academic, domestic, or work setting does not occur. It is known that HTLV-III is present in the blood of most people with AIDS and AIDs related illnesses, and in some who are healthy carriers; thus, exposure to contaminated blood by sharing needles is dangerous. That many Americans continue to believe that AIDS can be acquired from a drinking glass, toilet seat, or one's casual companion undoubtedly refl ects not just misinformation, but fear.</p><p>Current knowledge thus indicates that college and university students or employees with AIDS, AIDs related illnesses, or a positive HTLV-III antibody test do not pose a health risk to other students or employees in a usual academic or residential setting. The Public Health Service has stated that there is no risk created by living in the same house as an infected person, caring for an AIDS patient, eating food handled by an infected person, being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person, casual kissing, or swimming in a pool with an infected person.</p><p>Education and communication form the basis of the institution's strategy for dealing with the issues raised by communicable diseases on campus. Based on current medical fi ndings and recommendations of the American College Health Association, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and the Oklahoma State Department of Health Bulletin, East Central University has established administrative guidelines and educational strategies for students, faculty and/or staff with serious communicable diseases. The University recognizes that no single policy statement can govern every situation which may arise; thus, individual cases shall be considered on their own needs and merits. The University will continue to develop and review guidelines, educational programs and resources to meet the needs of all its students and employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Institutional Policy Statement and Procedure on Serious Communicable Diseases</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Campus Life</head><p>A. Individuals with a serious communicable disease should have the same rights as any other person -free of discrimination on the basis of their infection, but will comply with University policy and procedures contingent on medical recommendations. Individuals seeking reasonable accommodations originating from a documentable disease must register with the Offi ce of Disability Services so that said accommodations may be provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Housing</head><p>On campus housing will be made available to persons with communicable diseases under the same conditions as applicable to any individual, but will comply with federal, state, local, and University policy and procedure in relation to the disease. Requests by the infected individual for unique accommodations will be given every reasonable consideration, where possible, to meet the special housing needs of that individual. Precautions will be taken on the advice of appropriate public or private health science professionals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Class Attendance and Laboratories</head><p>Laboratory instructors, workers, and students should follow safe procedures that would prevent transmission of body fl uids. In the event of laboratory accidents that break the skin, precautions should be exercised to prevent transmission of body fl uid. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Counseling and Health Services</head><p>A. East Central University will make all reasonable effort to provide referral for students, faculty and/or staff for counseling or health services in community and state agencies. The Student Development Offi ce, Counseling Center, Health Services and Disability Services will maintain information regarding sources of assistance available to students, faculty and staff.</p><p>B. Confi dentiality Confi dentiality must be carefully maintained in accordance with all legal requirements. The patient's right to confi dential treatment should be protected and the associated medical records should be kept confi dential in accordance with existing institutional and legal requirements. East Central University will make all reasonable efforts to insure that such information is kept confi dential. In addition, other University personnel will be made aware of the necessity for confi dentiality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Responsibility of Individual Infected with Communicable Diseases</head><p>East Central University emphasizes that individuals who know they have a communicable disease have a special responsibility to protect others from this infection. This re-sponsibility includes appropriate conduct in situations where the infection could likely be transmitted. Behavior contrary to this responsibility may be considered as cause for disciplinary action by the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Special Needs</head><p>The future may require diffi cult decisions concerning the rights of the individual having a communicable disease, the need for medical or psychological assistance to the infected individual, and the protection of the welfare of the larger community. To facilitate such decision making and to provide academic counseling or health care needs, University staff members may fi nd it necessary to seek the assistance of a limited number of key University personnel. Such consultation will take place only with the consent of the student or employee involved, unless consent is refused and inaction is judged to endanger the welfare of others. In all cases, steps will be taken to protect the identity of those involved and utilize only data pertinent to the decision making process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Grievance Policy</head><p>A student should attempt an informal resolution of his/her grievance with the appropriate faculty member, staff member or administrator. If the grievance cannot be resolved at the level to which the complaint is made, it is referred to the next higher level. The President will review lower level decisions if an appeal is made to the President. The President may overrule any and all decisions. Also, anyone choosing to do so may fi le a grievance directly with the President; the complaint will then be processed through the administrative channels to attempt resolution prior to the taking of fi nal action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Complaints</head><p>Students may fi le complaints with appropriate institutional offi cers. Normally complaints are addressed to the individual most directly involved with the complaint. Written complaints which are signed by the student and addressed to the President, the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs, or the Vice President for Student Development will be shared with the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association during on-site accreditation visits. Individual identities will be shielded. Students may request contact information from institutional offi cers to fi le a complaint with the appropriate state agency of the institution's accrediting body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sexual Harassment Policy</head><p>Section 1. Purpose</p><p>The Regional University System of Oklahoma Board places a very high priority on each university governed by the Board maintaining a learning and work environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is recognized as a barrier to the educational, scholarly and research purposes of the universities governed by the Board, and will not be tolerated. Such conduct threatens the mission of the universities governed by the Board, and threatens the careers, educational experience, and well-being of students, faculty and staff.</p><p>Sexual harassment is especially serious when it threatens relationships between teacher and student or supervisor and subordinate. In such situations, sexual harassment exploits unfairly the power inherent in a faculty member's or supervisor's position. Through grades, wage increases, recommendations for graduate study, promotion, and the like, a teacher or supervisor can have a decisive infl uence on a student's, staff member's or faculty member's career at a university and beyond.</p><p>While sexual harassment most often takes place in situations of a power differential between the parties involved, the Board also recognizes that sexual harassment may occur between persons of the same university status. The Board will not tolerate behavior between or among members of the university community which creates an unacceptable working or educational environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section 2.

For these students East Central University offers pre-professional programs in engineering, law, and several of the medical fi elds. Students in these programs have the opportunity to spend from one to three years at East Central University completing the basic entrance requirements to the professional schools. Students interested in this opportunity should contact the appropriate advisor for their program. A description of the basic programs and their advisor follows below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Dental Hygiene</head><p>The dental hygienist is a licensed member of the oral health care team responsible for providing preventive, therapeutic and educational services for dental patients and the community. Dental hygienist services are provided in a variety of settings including hospitals, public health clinics, schools and geriatric centers. Basic admission requirements consist of a minimum of 60 semester hours of prescribed course work which may be completed at ECU.

For more information, contact the Department of Physics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Law</head><p>A successful career in law demands profi ciency in three-skills areas: the ability to think critically, the ability to analyze information from a variety of sources and apply that analysis to solving problems, and the ability to communicate that analysis to others. While completion of any undergraduate degree program confers eligibility for law school, the most successful candidates often come from programs located in the Liberal Arts which emphasize mastery of these skills. ECU offers two programs, Political Science and Legal Studies, which have proven especially successful in helping graduates attain success in law school. The specifi c choice of major (and minor), however, should be tailored to match the interests and particular needs of each student. Please contact the Pre-Law advisor in the Department of Politics, Law, and Society for more information.</p></div>

Legal requirements and ethical considerations are explored regarding the student with disabilities. Practicum experiences with children who are at various levels of academic functioning are completed before student teaching. Special Education majors complete twelve semester hours in each of these areas: science, mathematics, social studies, and language arts. This program leads to state certifi cation for teaching children with mild/moderate disabilities from preschool through high school.</p><p>Teacher candidates who wish to certify in two of the following programs: Early Childhood, Elementary, and Special Education, must complete an application, meet with the program coordinator of the additional certifi cation area, complete identifi ed requirements and pass the appropriate Oklahoma State Subject Area Test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for Admission to Teacher Education</head><p>Students who are considering teacher education as a career must make application for admission into the Teacher Education Program. Applications for admission will be completed while enrolled in EDUC 2012, Foundations of Education.</p><p>A student must meet the following criteria to be admitted to the Teacher Education Program: The Department of Education serves the University in three essential functions. The fi rst function is to prepare students in the three areas of specialization the department offers at the undergraduate level: Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, and Special Education. The areas of specialization lead to teacher licensure and certifi cation in Oklahoma. The second function is to provide professional education courses which enable competent educators in all of the teacher education programs at the University. The third and fi nal function is the offering of eight options at the master's level (see Section on School of Graduate Studies). The graduate program prepares individuals for a variety of occupations in public schools, related positions in institutions, business, industry, or hospitals.</p><p>Each teacher certifi cation program offered at East Central University is nationally accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation. The teacher preparation program addresses both national standards and Oklahoma's required 10 competencies. All standards are delivered within ECU's PRIDE conceptual framework where faculty are committed to preparing Professional, Refl ective, Innovative and Dedicated Educators. Integrated throughout the program are technology standards and best practices in STEM education. These experiences are enhanced by additional workshops organized through ECU's Institute for Math and Science Education. Students preparing to teach in secondary schools acquire a content knowledge base and competency in their respective specialty fi elds to teach at the middle school, junior high, or high school level. Special Education majors are prepared to appropriately educate children with disabilities at any grade level and in a variety of settings. Elementary Education majors are prepared to teach in elementary, middle school, or junior high through eighth grade. Early Childhood Education majors prepare to teach in nursery schools, kindergartens, and grades one through three. Field experiences provide supervised interactions with public school children before and during student teaching.</p><p>All teacher certifi cation programs provide academic backgrounds for students wishing to pursue graduate level education. These advanced studies lead to an expanded professional knowledge base and set of skills which may provide access and entry into professional careers in education. The professional careers include school administration, supervision, educational technology, library media, guidance and counseling, special education, school psychology and psychometry, and research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elementary Education Program</head><p>Elementary Education majors develop skill and competency in educating children in grades one through eight. The student acquires an academic foundation in language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies by completing at least twelve semester hours in each of these content areas. Elementary Education majors expand their teaching knowledge and skills in the use of teaching methods, materials, various assessment instruments, and appropriate technologies toward meeting the educational needs of elementary students. They develop perspective and skills in planning, organizing, implementing, and evaluating learning activities and lessons. Students also learn appropriate classroom management skills that provide a setting and climate conducive to learning and growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Childhood Education Program</head><p>Students who major in Early Childhood Education complete courses concentrating on the development and education of young may appeal to the Teacher Education Committee for a hearing and submit evidence of cause for reconsideration.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal, Dismissal, and Suspension Admission Process-Appeal</head><p>The Teacher Education Committee has the responsibility for conducting due process hearings for students who wish to appeal a decision or policy regarding teacher education admission. If an appeal is wanted, the student must write a letter to the chair of the Teacher Education Committee requesting a hearing. Additional information concerning the process for appealing may be obtained from the offi ce of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology. A student may appear before the Teacher Education Committee to have the application considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Denial of Admission or Dismissal From the Teacher Education Program</head><p>The obligation for maintaining academic integrity, professional standards and ethics, and legal responsibilities should be considered fundamental in the preparation of future educators. East Central University's Teacher Education Program assumes this obligation to parents, public schools, and the State of Oklahoma. In this respect, the Teacher Education Program will attempt to screen and deny admission or dismiss from the program those students deemed unsuitable teacher education candidates. This is an attempt to protect public school students from unacceptable teacher education candidates. In addition, this good faith effort will preserve the credibility and effectiveness of the Teacher Education Program in maintaining its relationship with public schools and demonstrate the program's efforts to provide teacher candidates who are suited to teach public school students.</p><p>East Central University maintains the obligation to deny admission to or dismiss from the Teacher Education Program at any time, any student whose personal conduct is deemed detrimental to:</p><p>1. the welfare of students in the public schools; 2. the Teacher Education Program's effective working relationship with the public schools; 3. the student's future success in the program; 4. the student's fi tness to teach; 5. the Teacher Education Program's role in training future educators; or 6. the profession of teaching.</p><p>Behavior that may constitute grounds for denial to or dismissal from the Teacher Education Program includes, but is not limited to, conduct that may result in felony conviction.</p><p>A student who is denied admission or who is being considered for dismissal from the Teacher Education Program for personal conduct shall be so notifi ed in writing by the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology. Such notice shall include a statement of:</p><p>1. the proposed action; 2. the reason(s) for the proposed action; 3. the evidence supporting the alleged personal conduct in question; and 4. the opportunity to appeal the proposed action to the Teacher Education Committee.</p><p>The student who is denied admission to or dismissed from the Teacher Education Program who wishes to appeal this decision must request, in writing, a hearing within ten <ref type="formula">(10)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Retention and Graduation in Teacher Education</head><p>Students who are admitted to teacher education and intend to graduate from the program must maintain their eligibility while enrolled. The Teacher Education Program has an ongoing informal evaluation, and specifi ed reviews of teacher education majors regarding continued eligibility for retention, certifi cation, and graduation in teacher education. The following is the review procedure for retention: 1. A continuous informal evaluation is in progress for each candidate enrolled in professional education classes. This evaluation is accomplished by each professor being sensitive to special problems or concerns that may be noted. If a problem or concern is observed and is considered serious enough to be a part of the student's record, the professor will fi le a formal report with the Director of Teacher Education. This report will be the basis for a formal reevaluation of the student by an appropriate committee to determine the eligibility and suitability of the student to remain in teacher education. 2. The second review in the retention program takes place as needed at the request of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology and consists of the following three parts: (a) the student's grade point average will be examined, (b) the student will be formally evaluated by the professor, and (c) the student's portfolio will be evaluated. A student who has not maintained an overall grade point average of 2.75 or better in all college work attempted may not enroll in additional professional education courses until the grade point average is 2.75 or better. An unfavorable evaluation by the professor will lead to a formal reevaluation of the student by an appropriate committee to determine the eligibility and suitability of the student to remain in teacher education. A student with an unsatisfactory portfolio will not be allowed to continue in the program until a satisfactory portfolio is presented. 3. The third review in the retention process occurs at the time the student applies for student teaching when eligibility for student teaching will be examined. A student who is removed from the Teacher Education Program</p></div>

The Department of Psychology is actively involved in fulfi lling the three functions of a University: Teaching, Research, and Service. These three functions merge as professors have students participate in research, use research fi ndings and student research to enrich classes, and provide a service to the community by teaching needed skills and providing needed services. As a behavioral science, it employs the scientifi c method to greatly enhance the problem-solving abilities of people. Further, since psychology involves the study of behavior, it enables people to understand themselves better and to understand others. General Psychology is the course that fulfi lls the general studies function. It is a general course in which the student learns the principles of behavior and how to apply these to everyday living. The Department of Psychology provides support courses for majors in other areas. For example, majors in elementary education, special education, nursing, and professional programs in human services take courses in psychology to develop the understanding and skills necessary to function in their professions. The Department of Psychology provides a major fi eld of study leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree. Just as in the minor fi eld of study, some students majoring in psychology do not intend to become professional psychologists. These students may use psychology to enter professional schools such as medicine, dentistry, law, or theology. Others use psychology as a liberal education and enter business and industry or use this knowledge and these skills to become effective parents or citizens in the communities in which they live. Finally, of course, students choose to major in psychology because they want to go on to graduate school and make psychology their professional career.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHYSICS</head><p>Physics is one of the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences. It is an attempt to understand the foundations of our universe through the study of motion, force, energy, sound, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, heat, light, and quantum mechanics. Physics students use advanced mathematics to solve challenging experimental or theoretical problems, so they often major in mathematics as well. The ability to analyze a problem and fi nd the best possible solution is vital to success in many fi elds. As a result, physics graduates often work in such seemingly non-related areas as medicine, law, biology, business, or military science, as well as in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or industry. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOLOGY DEGREE CONCENTRATION</head><p>The Department of Biology offers majors in four bachelor degree concentrations. A Bachelor of Science is designed for students who plan to become practicing biologists in industry or government, or plan to pursue a graduate degree in biology. This degree concentration is usually chosen by those students who need pre-professional training before entering the schools of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, or other health-related professional schools. A Bachelor of Science for Teacher Certifi cation gives a prospective science teacher an appropriate academic background in biology and in the methods of teaching. The Bachelor of Science for Molecular Biology prepares students for graduate research and/or employment in the rapidly growing fi elds of biotechnology, agribusiness, industry, law enforcement, and molecular biology. A Bachelor of Science for Clinical Laboratory Science prepares students to conduct and supervise complex medical tests, clinical trials, and research experiments; manage clinical laboratories; and consult with physicians and clinical researchers on diagnoses, disease causation and spread, and research outcomes. This degree concentration requires three years of prescribed study on campus followed by a year of clinical training in an approved hospital School of Clinical Laboratory Science. The EHS program is one of 31 baccalaureate programs accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council and has maintained accreditation since 1975. EHS majors must complete a total of 55 hours of core courses in environmental health and environmental science which includes a supervised, professional internship at an approved site. The internship provides students with an opportunity to integrate their academic preparation with actual work experiences. EHS majors must also complete supporting courses in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. A minor is advised, but not required. The Mathematics program offers three concentrations which leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The curriculum is fl exible and can be adapted to a variety of student interests. After completing one of the three concentrations, program graduates typically enter the job market as certifi ed teachers of secondary school mathematics, actuarial trainees, applied mathematicians in business or industry; or pursue study in graduate school leading to advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, computer science, fi nance, or management science. Some program graduates elect to pursue further study in a professional school such as law or medicine.</p></div>

"Pursuant to SB1797, effective July 1, 2014, the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation (OCTP) consolidated with the Offi ce of Educational Quality and Accountability (OEQA). The responsibilities of the OCTP, enacted by legislation HB1549 passed in 1995, remains the same, creating a competency-based teacher preparation system that would ensure competent and qualifi ed teachers in every classroom. The agency assumes three primary responsibilities: the accreditation of teacher preparation programs, the assessment of teacher candidates, and the ongoing growth and development of classroom teachers across the state." Central University will provide support for candidates who wish to pursue alternative certifi cation for school administration.
