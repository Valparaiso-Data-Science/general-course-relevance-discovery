The trustees are elected by patrons of the College district and serve a six-year term without pay. They are charged with the primary responsibilities of setting College policy and the selection of a President to administer those policies. NCMC operates under the general supervision of the Missouri Department of Higher Education. <ref type="bibr">CATALOG 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">CATALOG -2020</ref> The Campus NCMC is located in the heart of the Midwest, in downtown Trenton, Missouri. Campus facilities have more than doubled in recent years. The Barton Farm Campus, a second campus near Trenton, includes three classroom buildings and grounds for development. NCMC established the North Belt Center in Country Club, Missouri in 2018 to serve students in the western part of the college service district. The North Belt location offers a combination of traditional classroom and online instruction.</p><p>The Willis Alexander Student Center (ASC), is a one-stop center for most student-related services. The upper level contains the Students Affairs Division including offices for the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs, Admissions, Advising, Testing, Accessibility Services, Financial Aid and Registrar.

The land was given to the College by Marilyn Witten Whisler and Katherine Witten Parker in memory of their mother, Mary Louise Witten. Ellsworth Hall (EH), a residence hall for men, is named in honor of Dr. and Mrs. Willard Ellsworth. Each room has its own heating/air conditioning unit, a sink, cable TV, Wi-Fi and standard internet. Ellsworth Hall also includes a large lounge area for students, a laundry area, computer lab, mailboxes and easy access to parking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Everett &amp; Hazel Frey Administrative Center (FAC)</head><p>includes offices for the College President, Development/Foundation and Marketing, Public Relations, the College Business Office, Human Resources and Information Technology, as well as the Dorris Rider Art Gallery.

The local Shakespearean Circle has developed a Shakespeare garden and each spring it features flowers and plants featured in Shakespearean literature. A metal arbor was erected in honor of Virginia Holmes and Maurine Embry and adds beauty to the scenic green space. In front of the Plaza sits a large, engraved rock marking a time capsule from 2000. The Dr. T. E. Ritze Building, located on Crowder Road and directly north of Hoffman and Cross Halls, houses the Office of Corporate and Business Relations. Selby Hall, a residence hall for women, is named in honor of Dr. James and Betty Selby. Selby Hall has a comfortable lobby/TV room, large study lounge and a computer room for student use.

Please note that all students must abide by college rules, regulations and deadlines, including add/drop and withdrawal deadlines. Also, courses may be conducted with adult content and it is the responsibility of the student and parent to determine if the course is appropriate for the student prior to enrollment in the course. Course content will not be adjusted for underage students. *Other evidence of equivalent academic preparation may be accepted at the discretion of the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Student Admissions</head><p>International students who wish to enroll must submit the following: 1. Completed NCMC International Student Application. 2. Official transcripts of all high school (or equivalent), college and/or university studies. Transcripts must be translated in English. NCMC may require postsecondary transcripts to be sent to an organization that provides evaluations of foreign educational credentials, at the expense of the prospective student. Information, including costs for this service, is available from the NCMC Admissions Office. 3. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores for students whose native language is other than English. A minimum score of 500 (paper version), 173 (computer-based test) or 61 (Internet based) is required. Limited entrance into coursework for those students not meeting the minimum required TOEFL may be granted if the student is enrolled in an ESL program. 4. American College Test (ACT) or SAT results. If the ACT or SAT has not been taken, students will be required to take the Accuplacer test and any other NCMC placement tests as needed. 5. Proof of financial support, for one year, in the form of an authorized bank statement that is no older than six months. U.S. Federal Regulations requires students to prove the financial ability to cover the cost of a full year of education and living expenses in the U.S. *Financial support includes documentation proving sufficient resources, in the form of US dollars, are available for the following:  Cost of transportation to and from North Central Missouri College  All expenses for one full year of study  Return transportation to the home country  Financial support for any dependents that may accompany them, if applicable  Expectation of financial support for the remaining years of their program. This may be demonstrated through a notarized Affidavit of Support and appropriate notarized bank statements. 6. Copy of valid passport. 7. Proof of required health insurance with coverage for the entire period the student will be attending North Central Missouri College. Coverage must be through a provider approved by NCMC. F-1 students may work less than 20 hours per week on campus or work off campus with permission from the U.S. government. International students may work on campus up to 19 hours per week. International students may not work off campus unless approved by the US Federal Government. Unauthorized off campus work can jeopardize a student's ability to remain in the US on an F-1 visa. Permission to work on campus will not be granted during the first academic year. On-campus employment opportunities for F-1 students are extremely limited. International students should not plan on employment in the U.S. as a way to meet the first-year financial obligation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission of Service Members</head><p>If a student cannot attend school due to military service lasting more than 30 consecutive days, NCMC will readmit them at the same academic status they had at the time of their last attendance or acceptance. The student must not have received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, general court-martial, or federal or state prison sentence to be eligible for readmission as a service member. Military service, for the purpose of this guideline, includes:</p><p> voluntary or involuntary  armed force service, including the National Guard or Reserve on active duty  active duty for training or full-time National Guard duty under federal authority  service is under federal authority, rather than state The student must notify the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs of the student's military service as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. The student may, alternatively, submit an attestation of military service at the time of readmission. No notice is required if precluded by military necessity. The student must also notify the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs of their intent to return to NCMC within three years after the completion of the period of service and provide appropriate documentation. If a student is injured due to service, the student will be given a two year extension from the end of the recovery period to provide notification. Documentation of service should establish eligibility and may include:</p><p> DD (Department of Defense) 214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty  Copy of duty orders prepared by the facility where the orders were fulfilled carrying an endorsement indicating completion of the described service  Letter from the commanding officer of a Personnel Support Activity or someone of comparable authority  Certificate of completion from military training school  Discharge certificate showing character of service  Copy of extracts from payroll documents showing periods of service  Letter from National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Team Leader or Administrative Officer verifying dates and times of NDMS training or Federal activation At the time of readmission, the student will be admitted at the same academic status into the next program class, unless a later date is requested. NCMC reserves the right to readmit at a later date to extenuating circumstances. If the program is no longer offered, admittance will be offered into a similar program. If NCMC determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program, NCMC will make reasonable efforts to assist the student to become prepared. However, NCMC will not readmit a student if it is determined that there are no reasonable efforts available to prepare the student to resume the program at the same point or enable them to complete, or that the student is not prepared after reasonable efforts are made. For the first academic year, a student readmitted to the same program will be charged tuition and fee charges they would have been assessed for the academic year during which he left the school. However, if veteran education benefits or other service member education benefits will pay the higher tuition and fee charges for the year, the school may assess those charges to the student as well. The cumulative length of the absence and of all previous absences from the school for military service may not exceed five years. Only the time the student spends actually performing service is counted. Please see the military/veteran advisor for possible exclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of Students</head><p>NCMC students are classified in a variety of ways for reporting purposes. These classifications are not mutually exclusive and may change as a student's goals change. Freshman: Completed less than 30 semester credit hours. Sophomore: Completed 30 or more semester credit hours. Because NCMC is a two-year institution, status beyond the sophomore year is not recognized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Residency</head><p>Classification as a resident, for tuition purposes, is determined by Missouri law. The initial classification is made at the time of admission or first-time enrollment. Students are classified according to the location of their true, fixed and permanent home and place of habitation, or the domicile where they intend to remain and to which they expect to return. "In-District" students are those whose permanent home is within boundaries of the North Central Missouri College taxing district. "Missouri Resident" students are those whose permanent home is not within the boundaries of the NCMC District, but is within the State of Missouri. "Out-of-State" students are those whose permanent home is located outside the State of Missouri. The determination of residency status is initially made in the Admissions Office. Status may change when a student is known to move from the district. A student may challenge residency status by presenting sufficient proof, as defined by the Missouri Department of Higher Education, to the Registrar's Office before the end of the published add/drop period for the semester in which fees will be affected. Change of residency status is not retroactive and will affect future terms only. A dependent student's residency will remain the same as the custodial parent or guardian. IRS code and definitions will be used to determine dependency. See the Registrar's Office for complete details on residency qualifications.</p><p>Public Law 114-315, as amended 38 U.S.C. 3679(c), targets educational assistance through insuring in-state tuition rates to uniformed services veterans and qualified dependents.</p><p>Public Law 115-251, as amended 38 U.S.C. 3679(c), pertains to individuals using educational assistance under chapter 31, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (effective March 1, 2019).</p><p>The following individuals shall be charged the in-state rate, or otherwise considered a resident, for tuition purposes:</p><p>• A participant using educational assistance under either chapter 30 (Montgomery G.I.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising Services</head><p>Through advising, students receive help in exploring and developing options for the future. Trained academic advisors assist students in realistic self-evaluation, developing life plans and setting career and educational goals prior to initial enrollment at NCMC. Career planning: Academic advisors provide individual career exploration opportunities. A variety of tools are available to help students evaluate interests, values and abilities. Career assessment materials are also made available on the myRESOURCES page of the student portal. Academic advising: NCMC requires all degree-seeking students to meet with an academic advisor prior to their first semester of college. With the help of an advisor, students can clarify educational goals and plan an appropriate program of study to meet their career objectives. Academic advising helps students understand the full range of programs and services offered by NCMC. Some anticipated majors, such as engineering, art and music, should be thoroughly discussed with an advisor to gain understanding of the unique conditions regarding these programs at four-year schools. NCMC cooperates on a one-to-one basis with other institutions to ease the transition for students. Articulation agreements and partner schools are listed by institution on the NCMC website (http://www.ncmissouri.edu/). Personal counseling: NCMC works with a local agency to provide counseling services to students. Students experiencing a situational problem, immediate crisis or have a longstanding mental health concern are encouraged to contact the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs or a staff member for assistance and referral.</p><p>Counseling referrals are confidential with the following exceptions:  when self or other harm is possible  when a student has given written permission  when child or vulnerable adult abuse is indicated  when specifically ordered by a court of law </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Procedures</head><p>The Missouri Saving for Tuition (MO$T) program makes it easy to save for postsecondary education expenses. Anyone--parents, grandparents, relatives, employers or friends--can open a MO$T account for a beneficiary with as little as $25 (or $15 through payroll deduction). MO$T provides an added incentive by allowing up to $8,000 in total contributions to be deducted annually from an individual's Missouri adjusted gross income for state tax purposes. All earnings on the contributions are exempt from state taxes if used to pay the beneficiary's qualified postsecondary education expenses, and federal taxes on the earnings are deferred until the money is withdrawn. The MO$T Program is managed by TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing, Inc., a nationally recognized financial services firm, under the direction of the MO$T Program Board and the Office of the State Treasurer. Additional information about the MO$T Program can be obtained by calling <ref type="formula">(888)</ref>  </p></div>

Students are responsible for adding and dropping classes through their NCMC-assigned myCOMPASS online portal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree and Program Changes</head><p>A student may change program of study and/or degree for a term until the add/drop deadline for the term. After the add/drop deadline, any changes will be effective in future semesters. Students who wish to apply financial aid to their tuition and fees must have a declared degree or certificate in a program of study by the add/drop deadline for the affected term, in addition to meeting other financial aid requirements. Degree, certificate and program of study may be changed by submitting a Degree Change Request Form found in the myCOMPASS student portal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Schedule Changes</head><p>While NCMC recognizes that schedule changes may be necessary, students should plan carefully and make thoughtful choices in order to obtain the best schedule possible at initial registration. Changes may be made during the Add/Drop period. Though advisors are available to assist students with the development of their class schedule, the final schedule and degree tracking is the responsibility of each student. The assigned academic plan will provide information on courses counted as degree requirements. Schedule changes may impact length of time to complete a degree, billing, and financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Add/Drop</head><p>Classes may be added or dropped from a student's schedule only during the Add/Drop period established for each semester. There is no financial obligation and a 100 percent refund will be given when schedule changes are made during the Add/Drop period. Add/drop deadlines are published on the NCMC website and Academic Calendar located in the college catalog. Some classes may be canceled due to low enrollment before the term begins. Students should check their NCMC email and schedule prior to the start of classes to confirm enrollment status. After the published Add/Drop date, students are financially responsible for costs associated with classes remaining on their semester schedule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administrative Drop Policy</head><p>An "administrative drop" is when the student is removed from a course(s) as a result of one or more of the incidents outlined below. Students who have been administratively dropped will be charged a $50 fee for each administratively dropped course. Any classes left on a student's schedule will be charged at the full tuition rate. Administrative drops occur when: On-Ground Classes  8-week or full semester class -If a student fails to attend during the first ten calendar days of the semester  4-week class -If a student fails to attend during the first six calendar days of the semester Online Classes  8-week or full-semester class -If a student does not complete at least one substantive activity (activity or assignment that impacts the final grade) during the first ten calendar days of the semester  4-week class -If a student fails to complete at least one substantive activity (activity or assignment that impacts the final grade) during the first six calendar days of the semester</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Withdrawal</head><p>Courses dropped after the Add/Drop deadline are considered withdrawals and students are financially obligated to pay for all associated tuition and fees. A grade will not be earned and a "W" will be recorded on the permanent record. Notifying an instructor, advisor or simply not attending class is not sufficient to withdraw. Students may withdraw by doing one of the following by the Final Withdrawal Deadline: 1. Completing the withdrawal card, available at the Information Desk in the Alexander Student Center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Emailing the request to</head><p>Registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu from the student's pirate email account 3. Mailing a signed, dated, written request to the Registrar's Office The final withdrawal deadline is published in the academic calendar on the NCMC website and in the student planner. For off-schedule classes, contact the Registrar for withdrawal deadlines. (email: Registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu). A verified withdrawal, prior to the published withdrawal deadline, is always the student's responsibility. Withdrawals may be verified by viewing the transcript, available through the student's online myCOMPASS portal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Load</head><p>Each course offered for college credit is assigned a specific credit hour value. The normal load for a full-time student is 15 to 18 credit hours in a regular semester. Enrollment in a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester is considered half-time, 9 credit hours is three-quarter time, and 12 credit hours is full-time. Student enrollment may not exceed the credit hour cap for each semester:</p><p>Fall and Spring 20 credit hours Summer 12 credit hours Intersession should be limited to no more than 8 credits within the total for the term. Requests to override limits should be addressed to the assigned academic advisor.</p><p>International students must maintain enrollment in a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester. Any decrease, through drops or withdrawals, must be approved by the Primary Designated SEVIS Officer, jcunningham@mail.ncmissouri.edu. .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head><p>Each instructor may set his or her own standards relative to attendance as it pertains to the grade received.</p><p>Students are encouraged to attend all class sessions of the courses in which they are enrolled and respond to all online class assignments. Absences reduce the value of the learning experience and also reduce the probability of passing the course successfully. Students who stop attending, with unexcused absences, will be reported to the Financial Aid Office. Federal financial aid awards may be adversely affected by nonattendance.</p><p>Federal government regulations require that international students attend a minimum percentage of class sessions for all enrolled classes. VISA status may be negatively affected by failure to attend. Students participating in NCMC athletic events or attending college-sponsored events, as required by faculty, are excused from class and should not be counted absent. In this case, it is the student's responsibility to inform their instructor as to when they will miss class in advance of the event (1 week in advance, whenever possible). If an assignment is due, the student must submit the work prior to the absence. If there is a quiz or test on the day of the absence, the student must make arrangements with the instructor to complete the work before the absence or at a time designated by the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Conduct</head><p>Standards of academic and non-academic conduct are included in this catalog. Due process is available to all students, including the right to appeal a case and the right to obtain advice. Students are expected to read and abide by the policies and guidelines outlined in this catalog. All members of the learning community at NCMC are expected to be honest. The College will not tolerate cheating or plagiarism on tests, examinations, reports, laboratory reports and/or other assignments. Those who engage in such misconduct may be subject to disciplinary action, which can result in expulsion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal Procedures</head><p>If a student chooses to appeal a policy or decision, they should submit their appeal to the respective Appeals Officer, as referenced on the NCMC website under Consumer information -"Student Complaints/Appeals". An appeal form can be obtained online (http://www.ncmissouri.edu), through the myCOMPASS portal, or through the Student Affairs Coordinator located in the Alexander Student Center. Unless otherwise noted under a specific process, appeals must be received by the end of the following semester from the time the business under appeal was conducted. Any issue cited in an appeal must demonstrate that it significantly altered the student's ability to complete their responsibilities, could not have been anticipated, and involved something outside of the student's control. Documentation should be provided. Lack of knowledge regarding deadlines or policy and/or disagreement with institutional policy are not circumstances under which an appeal may be granted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System</head><p>North Central Missouri College follows a standard grading system. Students receive one of the following symbols for each course attempted. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Point Average</head><p>Grade point average (GPA) is the standard term used to describe a student's overall academic level. Only letter grades of A, B, C, D, and F factor into the grade point average noted on the NCMC transcript. However, P and X grades are factored into the GPA used for financial aid eligibility. To compute the GPA, use the following formula and grade quality points: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0. 1. Compute the number of grade quality points earned per class. For example, a three-credit (3) hour course with a grade of "B" (3) would have a grade quality point value of 9 (3 credits x 3 points). 2. Add together all of the grade quality points earned to date. 3. Add together all of the GPA credit hours to date. 4. Divide the total number of grade quality points by the total number of GPA credits. Transferred credit is not used to calculate the NCMC grade point average. Athletic eligibility is calculated using NJCAA guidelines and with an assigned grade point value of 2.00 for any grade of "P". Graduation requirements for the Associate in Arts in Teaching Degree include a minimum GPA calculated on all college credit, regardless of originating institution. Grades are available approximately one week after the end of the academic term. Students may access grades through the myCOMPASS portal, accessible from the NCMC website. Academic transcripts will not be released for students with outstanding financial obligations to the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Grades</head><p>Under extreme circumstances, a student may apply for an incomplete grade prior to the final week of a term. An incomplete grade may be given, at the discretion of the instructor, when accident, illness, death in the immediate family, or other documented circumstances beyond the student's control prevent the student from completing some course requirements. An incomplete grade should only be considered when 80% of the course requirements have been satisfied with a grade of "C" and attendance has been maintained. Course work must be completed within eight weeks of the first day of the term immediately following the term in which the incomplete was received; otherwise, the grade will be recorded as "F". No extension of time beyond the allotted 8 weeks will be permitted. The application for an incomplete grade is available in the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/Fail Grading</head><p>Developmental and some college skills classes at North Central Missouri College are graded with "P"-Pass or "X"-Fail grades. Credits earned in courses that are stipulated in the catalog as being graded on a Pass/Fail basis will not be used in computing a student's grade point average, with the exception of athletic eligibility and satisfactory academic progress for financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeated Courses</head><p>Students may receive credit value for a repeated course only once, unless the published course description notes otherwise. Repetition of coursework may have a negative impact on financial aid eligibility.</p><p> Courses used to meet requirements for a previously conferred degree or certificate may not be repeated.  Grades for transferred-in credit do not override grades earned from NCMC.  Students may repeat a course in which a grade of "C" or lower was earned, provided they have not completed a higher level course with a grade of "A" or "B" that required the first course as a prerequisite.  Recorded grades will not be removed from the student transcript, but only the last grade earned will be used when computing the cumulative grade point average.  Nursing coursework in the PN and PN to ADN programs may be repeated, regardless of the first grade earned, when the last enrollment in the course was at least five years prior to the repeat term, and the student has not used the credit to meet requirements for a previously conferred degree or certificate. Courses with recorded grades of "A" or "B" may be repeated, for informational purposes only, by declaring an audit at the time of enrollment. In the case of an audit, the student does not receive credit or a grade for the course. The first grade earned in the class remains in the grade point calculation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auditing a Class</head><p>A class auditor is a student registered for a course for informational instruction only, not to earn credit. An audit must be declared in the Registrar's Office by the student prior to the end of the Add/Drop period for the semester. Tuition and fees for audited classes are the same as for those taken for credit. A grade of "AU" -Audit will be placed on the student's transcript. Financial aid is not available for audited classes. Auditing students are expected to attend the class, but are not required to take examinations or do assignments required of regularly enrolled students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Disputes and Appeal Process Grade Disputes During a Semester</head><p>Faculty members and students should communicate regularly and openly about all grading issues. A student who is dissatisfied with an instructor's grading decision during a semester should discuss the issue with the instructor and attempt to resolve the matter informally as soon as possible. A student who believes that a grading issue has not been satisfactorily resolved should speak with the Dean or Program Director about the matter. The Dean or Director will work with both the student and the instructor to address the issue. Students may not file a formal course grade appeal during the semester. Grading issues that remain unresolved during the semester may become the basis for a formal course grade appeal once the semester has ended and a final course grade has been assigned. The formal process may be used only for grading issues that impact the final course grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disputes Regarding Final Course Grades</head><p>A student who is dissatisfied with a grading decision must attempt to resolve the matter by contacting the instructor immediately. If the instructor is unavailable, the student may wish to contact the Dean or Program Director within ten business days of receiving the final grade to facilitate communication between the student and the instructor and to help resolve the dispute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Final Course Grade Appeal Procedure</head><p>The North Central Missouri College Student Course Final Grade Appeal Procedure is based on the following principles:  A student has a right to appeal a final grade that the student believes was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error.  A student's grade should reflect the student's mastery of the course subject matter.  Students are entitled to a fair and impartial evaluation of their work.  Students and faculty should communicate regularly and openly about course requirements, assignments, tests, grading procedures, and grades.  The college faculty is responsible for creating the curriculum and establishing the standards by which students will be evaluated in each course.  Faculty members are entitled to the presumption that the grades they assign are an accurate reflection of the performance of the students in their courses.  Both students and faculty members have rights and responsibilities in the grading process.  Students who wish to appeal a final grade are responsible for demonstrating that the grade received was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error.  Faculty members have a responsibility to provide their students with syllabi that clearly explain the basis on which student grades will be assigned.  Faculty members are responsible for providing their students with timely feedback on their performance on tests, papers, projects, and other graded assignments.</p><p> Faculty members are responsible for keeping course records, final exams, and other materials on which grades are based (that have not been returned to students) for a year.  Faculty members have a right to have the grades they assign upheld unless it is clearly demonstrated that a grade was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on bias, caprice, or computational or clerical error.  Both faculty members and students have a right to have grade appeals resolved in a timely fashion (as prescribed in the timeline given in this document).  Both faculty members and students have a responsibility to attempt to resolve grade disputes informally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grounds for a Formal Final Course Grade Appeal</head><p>A student may file a formal course grade appeal if the following conditions are met:  The student has made legitimate attempts to resolve the dispute informally by discussing the issue with the instructor.  The grading issue at stake impacts the final course grade. (A course grade appeal may not be filed until the semester has ended and a final course grade has been assigned.)  The student believes that his or her final course grade was assigned contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeals</head><p>Students wanting to appeal a grade must contact their instructor within ten (10) business days after the end of the semester for which the grade was given using their pirate email account. The deadline for the final ruling of the grade appeal cannot exceed the term following the completion of the course for which the grade is being considered. A student who is dissatisfied with an instructor's final course grade decision should adhere to the following steps: 1. Discuss the concern or issue with the instructor. THIS IS ALWAYS THE FIRST STEP to the appeals process. If resolution is not achieved after meeting with the instructor, move to step #2. 2. File a formal grade appeal by emailing the reason for the appeal using the student pirate account to the Dean or Program within ten (10) business days of meeting with faculty member. Receipt of the formal grade appeal form and supporting documentation will result in initiation of an investigative process by the appropriate Dean or Director. The appropriate Dean/Director will respond, in writing, to the student within ten (10) business days of receipt of the appeal circumstances. If resolution is not achieved through the Dean/Director, move to step #3. 3. A formal appeal may be made in writing by the student to the Vice President of Academic Affairs within ten (10) business days of receiving the Dean's decision. Upon receipt of the formal appeal, the Vice President will initiate an investigative process which will result in a written response to the student within ten (10) business days of receipt of the formal appeal. If resolution is not achieved, move to step #4. 4. If not satisfied with the Vice President's decision, the student may request through their pirate email, within ten (10) business days of the Vice President's decision, to move to the next step. At this time a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will be formed to review the appeal. The request to appeal to the panel will be handled by the Vice President. The panel review will be scheduled as soon as possible with a decision being rendered and communicated in writing to the student within ten (10) working days of the panel review. If resolution is not achieved, move to step #5 5. Either party involved in the grade appeal process has a right to appeal to the President of the College within ten (10) business days of receiving the panel's decision. The President will review the appeals and conduct whatever investigation he/she deems appropriate. The President determines the final outcome of the appeals and will communicate such in writing to the student, faculty, Vice President of Academic Affairs and the appropriate Dean/Director. In all cases, the decision of the President is final.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administrative Final Course Grade Appeal Procedure A. Informal Resolution</head><p>Upon receipt of a Student Final Course Grade Appeal Form, the Dean or Director will contact both the student and the instructor involved to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If the instructor is no longer with the college, the Dean/Director shall appoint another instructor to represent faculty interests in the appeal. The faculty member representing the absent instructor shall act as a good faith representative of the faculty whose goal is to resolve the grading dispute fairly. The instructor may agree to resolve the dispute informally if he or she believes it is appropriate. For example, if the dispute involves a computational or clerical error and the instructor representing the absent faculty member agrees with the student, he or she may simply sign the Change of Grade Form to change the grade rather than begin the process of a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel to resolve the issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Dean's Response</head><p>If the dispute is not resolved informally within ten (10) business days from the student-instructor meeting, the student will communicate, in writing, to the appropriate Dean/Director the desire to continue the appeal process. The Dean/Director will make the instructor aware of the appeal and ask the instructor involved to prepare a written response to the appeal. The instructor's response should include the following:  A copy of the course syllabus.  A copy of any relevant graded assignments that had not been returned to the student.  A written statement responding to the issues raised by the student.  Any other documents the instructor believes are relevant to the resolution of the course grade appeal.  The Dean/Director should continue to pursue an informal resolution to the dispute if he or she believes that a resolution is possible. The Dean/Director may share the instructor's response with the student in hopes of finding common ground between the two. The Dean/Director may wish to give the student the opportunity to address issues raised in the instructor's response that the student has not previously addressed.  The Dean/Director may meet with the student and instructor individually and offer a decision, in writing, within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request to continue the appeal process. If the student is not satisfied with the Dean/Director's decision, he/she may request in writing, to the appropriate Dean, within ten (10) business days of the Dean's decision that the appeal be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. C. Vice President of Academic Affairs</p><p>The Vice President of Academic Affairs will review the documentation from the student, faculty, and Dean/Director. The Vice President may meet with the student, faculty member, Dean/Director to review the appeal and circumstances. The Vice President of Academic Affairs will offer a decision within ten (10) business days of receipt of the appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the Vice President's decision he/she may request, in writing, within ten business days of receipt of the Vice President's decision, request the appeal be forwarded to a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel</head><p>The Vice President of Academic Affairs shall appoint a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel to consider the appeal. The Panel shall consist of a minimum of three members: a division chair, at least one full-time faculty member (the student may choose the full-time faculty member), and the Vice President of Academic Affairs and/or the Dean. The instructor involved in the grade dispute is not eligible to serve on the Panel. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel is responsible for ensuring that the grade appeal process is completed before the end of the subsequent semester. The Vice President of Academic Affairs is responsible for ensuring that the instructor and the student have at least ten (10) business days advance notice of the time and location for appearing before the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel if they requested an appearance. The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel is responsible for determining the facts in the dispute and making a judgment on the merits of the course grade appeal. The Panel shall review the materials submitted both by the student and the instructor. The Panel may request any other information it deems necessary, including additional instructor records and input from third parties. Both the student and the instructor have the right to request the opportunity to appear in person before the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel if they so choose. If both parties appear before the Panel, they should be heard separately. If neither party requests to appear in person, the Panel should complete its review based on the written materials supplied by the parties and whatever other information the Panel may request. The Panel's deliberations, including hearing testimony from the parties involved and third parties, shall take place in private. The student has the burden of proof. The student must present clear evidence that a final grade was contrary to procedures as specified in the course syllabus or was based on computational or clerical error.</p><p>Once the members of the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel have determined that they have sufficient information to make a decision, they will vote either to grant or reject the grade appeal. A simple majority is sufficient to decide the issue. If the Panel grants the appeal, the panel will determine the appropriate course grade for the student. A member of the Panel shall prepare a written report stating the Panel's decision and the justification for that decision. Copies of the report must be conveyed to the student, the instructor, and the Vice President of Academic Affairs. If the Panel determines that the student's grade shall be changed, the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will prepare a Change of Grade Form and submit it to the Vice President of Academic Affairs with the Panel report attached. The stated reason for the change of grade will be "the recommendation of a Faculty Grade Appeal Panel." The Faculty Grade Appeal Panel will sign the form instead of the course instructor. Sometimes a course grade appeal raises issues that go beyond the resolution of grading issues. These issues could include questions about compliance with ADA guidelines, concerns about an instructor following NCMC policies, or questions of a student's academic integrity. At the Faculty Grade Appeal Panel's discretion, they may prepare a supplementary report addressing those issues and present it to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. E. Appealing the Panel's Decision Either party involved in the grade appeal process has a right to appeal to the President of the college within ten (10) business days of receiving the panel's decision. The President will review the appeal and conduct whatever investigation he or she deems appropriate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Forgiveness</head><p>Occasionally, due to overwhelming or unavoidable circumstances, a student earns grades that are not representative of his/her true abilities. Students returning to North Central Missouri College after an absence of at least 3 consecutive years may be eligible for academic forgiveness for one semester, completed prior to their absence, for the purpose of raising the cumulative grade point average at NCMC. Academic forgiveness is granted only once and for one semester only and will include all courses in that semester, regardless of the grade earned. Once granted, it cannot be undone and students cannot apply again. Academic forgiveness does not erase the record. Grades received for the applied semester will be removed from the grade point average at NCMC. The original grades received will remain on the transcript with a notation indicating forgiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility:</head><p>To be eligible for academic forgiveness consideration, a student must meet these requirements:  The student must have been absent from NCMC for 3 or more consecutive years.  The cumulative NCMC grade point average before the absence is less than 2.00.  The student cannot have earned a degree or certificate from NCMC or from another institution of higher education.  The student must be currently enrolled at NCMC.  Upon re-enrolling at NCMC, the student must complete all course work and earn at least twelve credit hours, with a minimum grade point average of 2.00.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions:</head><p> All grades earned since the student's return (after a minimum of 3 years) will be averaged to determine eligibility at the time application for forgiveness is made. Pass/Fail classes cannot be included in the credit hours considered for academic forgiveness eligibility.  Academic forgiveness cannot be used to obtain athletic or financial aid eligibility.  An applicant for academic forgiveness must be in good financial standing with NCMC, with no outstanding balance. Academic forgiveness does not erase any financial obligation to pay for all classes taken at NCMC.  Credit hours selected for academic forgiveness cannot be used to meet academic requirements <ref type="bibr">(graduation, certification, prerequisites, etc.)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process:</head><p> Meet with an academic advisor prior to submitting the application for academic forgiveness for a recommendation on the semester to choose.  Submit the completed, signed application to the Registrar.  The Registrar will verify eligibility for academic forgiveness, and notify student of the results.  The notation for forgiven grades will be placed on the academic transcript. All grades, whether forgiven at NCMC or not, may apply when transferring to another institution. Policies at the receiving institution apply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standards</head><p>Academic Excellence NCMC encourages academic excellence by naming students who have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement to the honor lists for the fall and spring semesters. The President's Honor Roll lists students who have earned at least 6 credit hours and achieved a grade point average of 4.00 for the semester. The Dean's Honor Roll lists students who have earned at least 6 credit hours and achieved a grade point average of 3.50 for the semester. North Central Missouri College officially recognizes students with outstanding cumulative grade point averages at the time of graduation. To qualify for this recognition, at least fifty percent of the student's coursework in the program must be completed at NCMC. Graduates "with honors" are those with cumulative grade point averages on NCMC coursework of 3.5 to 3.84. Graduates "with highest honors" are those with cumulative grade point averages on NCMC coursework of 3.85 or above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>To maintain good standing, a student must achieve a cumulative grade point average corresponding to the total GPA eligible credit hours at NCMC as follows: 0-14 credit hours 1.50 GPA 15-29 credit hours 1.66 GPA 30-44 credit hours 1.83 GPA Over 44 credit hours 2.00 GPA A student falling below these standards may be placed on academic probation for a period of one semester. At the end of the probationary period, the student will be subject to extended probation or academic suspension. Students placed on academic suspension have the right to appeal the suspension. Academic suspension appeals should be directed to the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs. The guidelines for academic good standing differ from those for financial aid eligibility. See the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in the "Financial Aid" section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Transfer Policy</head><p>NCMC considers the "transferability" between colleges and universities as a matter of considerable importance and practice. NCMC also believes the relationship between and among academic disciplines and between levels of coursework must be clear. NCMC strives to assist students in making progress toward their educational objectives without unnecessary disruption or duplication of coursework. An articulation agreement is a formal arrangement for transfer of a defined set of academic credits between an academic program at NCMC and a program at another college or university. Transfer guidelines facilitate cooperation between colleges and universities for the purpose of accommodating the needs and interests of students who earn credit at one institution and choose to transfer to another. Successful transfer minimizes loss of time and duplication for students and optimizes the use of institutional resources. NCMC transfer policies recognize that each college and university has a separate and distinct mission and that each has the responsibility to establish and maintain academic quality within that mission. Underlying the policy is an attitude of mutual respect and cooperation among the institutions and recognition that the primary objective of articulation agreements is to benefit students. North Central Missouri College maintains a list of established articulation agreements with other institutions for the transfer of the Associate in Arts, Associate in Arts in Teaching, and Associate in Applied Science degrees, available on the NCMC website. For further information on articulation and transfer policies between institutions contact: Transfer and Articulation Officer -660-359-3948 Ext. 1405 or advising@mail.ncmissouri.edu or view the transfer information on the NCMC website (http://www.ncmissouri.edu) Student Resources page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transferring Credit to NCMC</head><p>The Missouri Higher Education Core Transfer Curriculum is a recommended lower-division core curriculum of fortytwo semester credit hours intended to facilitate student transfer among Missouri's public institutions of higher education. All public colleges and universities have adopted the Core Transfer Curriculum, which is commonly known as CORE 42. CORE 42 is comprised of dozens of courses distributed across five knowledge areas. These courses are designated with a Missouri Transfer (MOTR) course number and icon, which guarantees the one-to-one transfer of these courses among all Missouri public institutions of higher education.</p><p>NCMC accepts credit earned from institutions accredited by agencies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. All courses designated as MOTR courses by sending institutions will be accepted in transfer. Courses outside the designated Missouri Transfer Core Curriculum will be accepted in transfer when the courses are:  Lower division, credit-bearing courses equal in content to current NCMC coursework.  Lower division, credit-bearing courses with a grade of "D" or higher. Lower division, credit-bearing courses with content that does not equal NCMC coursework will be transcripted as a block of lower division coursework. Coursework from institutions on a quarter hour system will be converted to semester hours using a two-thirds conversion factor for transfer to NCMC. Transferred-in credit is not used to calculate a student's grade point average for academic standing at NCMC. All grades, including any received from other higher education institutions, will be considered for athletic eligibility and used to calculate the cumulative grade point average required for graduates in the Associate in Arts in Teaching program. Transfer course equivalencies for many institutions can be found on the Course Equivalency page (https://sail.ncmissouri.edu/Sail/Search/TransferEvaluatio n.aspx) of the NCMC website, under Degrees &amp; Academics/Academic Records/Transfer Coursework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign College and University Credit</head><p>North Central Missouri College staff does not evaluate foreign transcripts. Students seeking credit must have their foreign transcripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evaluation service, nationally accredited in the United States, and submit an official copy of the results to the NCMC Registrar's Office. Credit may be granted for foreign coursework based on the results of such evaluations if substantially similar to courses offered by NCMC. The same requirements and limitations apply to foreign credit as those applicable to credit earned at U.S. colleges and universities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Appeal Procedure</head><p>Transfer students have the right to appeal institutional decisions on the acceptance of transfer credit toward graduation requirements at NCMC. Students may complete the Transfer Credit Re-evaluation Appeal (http://www.ncmissouri.edu/registrar/transfer-credit-reevaluation-appeal/) form and submit to the Registrar's Office. The decision on transferability will rest with the academic department chairperson. A student, whose appeal is denied, may file a request for review with the Dean of Instruction. If the issue is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the Vice President of Academic Affairs will make a final decision.</p><p>If NCMC does not accept credit from a Missouri public institution for courses designated as MOTR courses, a written notice will be sent to the student and the sending institution within ten business days of the denial of credit. When the transfer dispute involves any designated MOTR course, and the dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of the student or sending institution, NCMC will notify the commissioner of higher education within 45 business days after the written notice of denial. Review by the commissioner of higher education is initiated after all other remedies have been exhausted, without resolution to the satisfaction of the student and sending institution. The commissioner of higher education will make the final determination about a dispute concerning MOTR course transfer and give written notice of determination. For more information, call (660)359-3948, ext.1206 or email registrar@mail.ncmissouri.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit for Prior Learning (CPL)</head><p>North Central Missouri College believes that learning is a lifelong process and recognizes knowledge is acquired in many different ways. In addition to the traditional classroom setting, mastery of college-level knowledge and skills may occur as a result of nontraditional learning experiences such as employment, military training and experience, non-collegiate training programs, advanced high school courses, and self-development. NCMC awards credit for measurable college-level learning which includes knowledge, skills and competencies that students have obtained as a result of their prior learning experiences. College credit may be granted on a case-by-case basis for prior learning that can be documented and is equal to learning outcomes of NCMC regular credit course offerings. Application for credit for prior learning (CPL) must be approved prior to course enrollment, regardless of method or type of prior learning. All mandatory institutional requirements for certificates and degree programs must be met and individuals are only eligible for prior learning credit once officially accepted as an NCMC student. Missouri state law limits the number of credits that can be awarded for prior learning to a total of 30 credit hours. A maximum of 50% of courses required in a certificate or degree program will be awarded for prior learning, institutional or national examinations, and articulated credit. Please note that there may be financial aid implications as it relates to credit for prior learning. Please visit with the Financial Aid Office for further details. Credit granted through one of the CPL options may be used to fulfill NCMC program requirements, however transferability to other institutions is at the discretion of the receiving institution. The Credit for Prior Learning policy (https://www.ncmissouri.edu/admissions/wpcontent/uploads/sites/5/2017/01/credit-for-priorlearning.pdf) and applicable fees may be found on the NCMC website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Collegiate Programs</head><p>Credit may be granted for training programs that have been successfully completed at non-collegiate organizations such as government agencies, and corporations and businesses, when applicable to students' declared programs of study at NCMC and approved by the NCMC instructional department and dean. Non-collegiate courses will be evaluated in accordance with the American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations and with The National College Recommendation Service (formerly known as PONSI, the National Program of Non-collegiate Sponsored Instruction) recommendations, as well as in accordance with the college's articulation agreements with nontraditional organizations and agencies. Noncollegiate programs must be approved prior to NCMC course enrollment when students believe they have mastery of course skills and objectives. An approved application for Credit for Prior Learning and payment of fee is required to award credit. Credit for non-collegiate programs cannot be retaken and cannot be taken by students previously unsuccessful in courses for which they are seeking CPL credit. Students must be admitted to the college prior to receiving credit. Official transcripts or certificates must be submitted to the registrar's office. Information on availability can be sought through division chairs or the appropriate academic dean. Missouri state policy requires industrial certification, used for credit for prior learning, must have been awarded within the last five years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Military Education and Training</head><p>Credit may be granted for military education and training, based on recommendations made by the American Council on Education. Credit will be awarded in disciplines substantially similar to courses and programs offered by NCMC. Official military transcripts, including Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), AARTS, SMART, or other military transcripts, must be submitted to the registrar's office for evaluation. There is no fee charged to transcript credit for training in the armed services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Portfolio Assessment</head><p>Credit for prior learning acquired through employment, self-study, volunteer, civic, or other activities may be awarded through the portfolio assessment option. Students must demonstrate that prior learning and experience have resulted in the acquisition of college-level competencies and skills directly related to courses in their learning programs. Portfolio assessments can be attempted only once per course and cannot be taken by students previously unsuccessful in courses for which they are seeking credit. Students must be admitted to the college prior to attempting portfolio assessment. Students must complete the application process for credit for prior learning and receive prior approval for portfolio assessment by the dean and appropriate academic department chairperson. Upon approval, the student must pay the required CPL fee and complete the portfolio process within thirty days. The appropriate department chair will assess the portfolio to ensure the student has met or exceeds the learning objectives of the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Licensures &amp; Certifications</head><p>North Central Missouri College may award credit for some licensures and certifications, when applicable to a career and technical program at NCMC. The certification must be current, documented and approved by the academic department chairperson and dean. Credit is given when the training and experience required for the certification is equivalent to learning outcomes in courses offered at North Central Missouri College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>National Examinations</head><p>The national examination programs for which the college awards credit are: Advanced Placement (AP) Exams Subject-matter exams sponsored by the College Board and generally administered through high schools at the culmination of advanced placement (AP) course offerings.

Students may earn up to three credits for each examination based upon their scores and the American Council of Education's (ACE) score recommendations. Additional information can be obtained on the DSST website. Excelsior College Exams Students may complete subject-based exams developed and offered through Excelsior College and Pearson VUE. Students must receive a grade of "C" or higher for examinations to be considered for college credit at NCMC. Official transcripts must be submitted to the Registrar's Office for evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Institutional Proficiency Examinations</head><p>Institutional proficiency examinations are offered for some, but not all, NCMC credit classes. An application for credit for prior learning through an institutional exam must be approved by the appropriate dean and academic department chairperson. Upon approval and payment of the required CPL fee, students contact the appropriate faculty member to arrange to take the proficiency exam within 30 days. Proficiency exams cannot be retaken and cannot be taken by students previously unsuccessful in courses for which they are seeking credit. Students must be admitted to the college prior to taking proficiency exams. Proficiency exams must be taken within thirty calendar days after fee payment. The appropriate department chair will evaluate the exam to ensure the student has met or exceeds the learning objectives of the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Articulated Credit</head><p>North Central Missouri may award credit for approved programs of study taken at area high schools and technical schools.

For more information on approved programs, please visit the Dual Credit page, under Degrees/Academics, on the NCMC website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Requirements</head><p>Graduation requirements for each degree and certificate program are outlined in the Programs of Study section of this catalog. The catalog in force at the time a student begins a program will be used to establish graduation requirements, provided the student maintains continuous enrollment in the declared program. Continuous enrollment for this purpose is defined as the successful completion of at least three credit hours in at least two of the three terms per academic year in the program of study. Students who do not maintain continuous enrollment in the program of study will lose the right to use the original catalog requirements and must use the catalog in force at the time of re-enrollment, program change, or application for degree completion. *Students who are fulfilling military service obligations may be exempt. Contact the Veterans Service Advisor for more information.</p><p>Candidates for graduation also have the option of selecting the current catalog (in force at the time an application for graduation is submitted) in order to fulfill program requirements. Programs may occasionally be made inactive or eliminated at NCMC. Students enrolled in a program at the time it is made inactive may complete degree requirements and graduate in the program as long as the following criteria are met:  Continuous enrollment is maintained in a program of study  A minimum of 25% of the total credit hours required for the program have been earned when the program is inactivated  Career and technical coursework can be made available by arrangement  All degree requirements are met within six semesters of program elimination Graduation requirements can be met through a combination of NCMC courses, transfer credit and credit obtained through nontraditional means, however a minimum of 25% of the credit hours required in the certificate or degree must be earned through traditional means at North Central Missouri College. A maximum of 50% of the required credit hours may be earned through non-traditional means (refer to Credit for Prior Learning section). Students who are planning to transfer credit back to NCMC to complete degree requirements should complete the Application of Transfer Credit for Degree Completion form, available in the Registrar's Office, on the myCOMPASS portal, and on the college website, during the last semester at NCMC. The transfer of credit must occur within one year from students' last enrollment at NCMC. All other graduation requirements must be met. All degrees and certificates require a minimum cumulative grade point average. Some programs of study have additional graduation requirements. The Missouri Reverse Transfer (MRT) initiative allows a student, who transfers from NCMC before earning an associate's degree, to opt-in to the MRT program at a Missouri baccalaureate-granting institution. Academic records will be shared between the baccalaureategranting institution and NCMC until the student completes the required credits for the award of an associate's degree. Contact the MRT Coordinator at the 4-year institution for more information. Missouri Reverse Transfer CATALOG 2019-2020</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. General Policy</head><p>North Central Missouri College is a community of learners. The College is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and learning and to the development of ethically responsible persons. College students are expected to uphold appropriate standards of behavior and to respect the rights and privileges of others. Student conduct is expected to be lawful and in accordance with all federal, state and College regulations.</p><p>The Student Code of Conduct and the student conduct process apply to the conduct of individual students and student organizations regardless of where or when the conduct may take place, including off-campus or outside of school when the administration determines in its discretion that the off-campus or outside-of-college conduct affects a substantial college interest. The conduct of students, both on campus and off campus, is ordinarily of College concern when:  Conduct interferes with the College's responsibility for ensuring members full and equal opportunity to obtain their educational objectives and/or disrupts the academic environment; or  Conduct interferes with the College's responsibility to protect the health, safety and general welfare of persons in the college community, to protect the rights of others, to protect property, to maintain the ordinary rules of good conduct and to sponsor President. The Dean of Instruction/Dean of Extended Campus is the administrative officer in cases of academic misconduct. Grade appeals follow a different procedure, which is outlined in the "Grade Appeals" section. Each instructor is assigned jurisdiction for class conduct and grades. Charges of academic misconduct should follow one of these options: 1. Provide timely written notice to the student of the suspected academic misconduct and invite the student to discuss the matter. Advise the student in writing within ten (10) business days, after such notification and/or personal meeting, of the decision and penalties imposed and the student's right to appeal, in writing, to the Dean of Instruction/Dean of Extended Campus within ten <ref type="formula">(10)</ref>  shall discuss the charges with the student(s) accused with committing the offense in an effort to determine responsibility.

The student may confer with the advisor, but the advisor will not be allowed to address the judicial officer, any witnesses, or speak on behalf of the student. In addition, the advisor should keep the following in mind:</p><p>The hearing process is not a court of law. It is not obligated to follow the formal rules of evidence and procedure. Academic decorum requires an advisor to play a different and more limited role than in the court. The standard of proof for the College shall be "preponderance of evidence." 3. Findings and Decision-The hearing officer shall issue a decision and impose sanctions, if warranted. The hearing officer reserves the right to postpone a decision if additional information is needed. The student will be notified of the decision within ten (10) business days after a decision has been made.

In this instance, the hearing officer will contact the student via a certified letter within ten (10) business days of receipt of the incident report, and allow the student to respond to the charges within a reasonable time. The student can respond to the charges, either in written form or by scheduling a meeting by the deadline provided in the letter. If the student chooses not to respond or a response is provided in written form, a determination of responsibility will be made by the hearing officer based on the information provided. At that time, the hearing officer may impose appropriate sanctions. The Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs, or designee, shall have the power and jurisdiction to order any student to cease and desist from any activity that is judged disruptive to the institution's operation. If the student fails to cease and desist from such activity, the Associate Vice President/Dean of Student Affairs, or designee, may immediately suspend the student for a period of time not to exceed ten (10) business days, pending a formal hearing.</p><p>Appeals should follow the procedures outlined in C, "Appeals for both Academic and Non-Academic Misconduct" C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associate in Arts Degree (AA)</head><p>The Associate in Arts degree is often referred to as the university transfer program. Students awarded AA degrees are assured transfer to Missouri public universities through the Missouri Articulation Agreement and are accepted with junior standing at most Missouri public institutions, having fulfilled freshman and sophomore requirements with a solid foundation for upper class study. Credits earned in this program are accepted at state colleges and universities and many private institutions. Students receive individualized advisement in the selection of courses in order to meet the requirements of the transfer institutions in the college majors selected. Articulation guides for specific course transfer are available from advisors and the NCMC website (http://www.ncmissouri.edu/). Transfer students not planning to earn the Associate in Arts degree should carefully select courses that meet the general education or transfer requirements of their particular transfer school. A minimum recommendation is that students complete NCMC's 42 credit hour General Education Core.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education Rationale</head><p>General education is the curricular foundation for Associate in Arts Degree students at North Central Missouri College. It encourages students to acquire and use the intellectual tools, knowledge and creative capabilities necessary to study the world as it is, as it has been understood and as it might be imagined. It also furnishes students with skills which enable them to deepen that understanding and to communicate it to others. Through general education, North Central Missouri College equips students for success in their specialized areas of study and for fulfilled lives as educated persons, as active citizens and as effective contributors to their own prosperity and to the general welfare of society. As knowledge of the world is structured, so must general education be constructed to introduce students to the traditional disciplines of the arts and sciences. As that knowledge is ever changing, so must general education alert students to connections between the traditional disciplines and to the potential for interaction among all branches of knowing, ordering, and imagining the real world. As the real world is diverse, so must general education inform students that the world is understood in different ways and provide them with the means to come to terms, intelligently and humanely, with the diversity. As the diversities of knowing and understanding must be made open and accessible, so students must acquire appropriate investigative, interpretative, and communicative competencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education Policy</head><p>In order to facilitate the transfer of students among institutions of higher education in the state, the Missouri Department of Higher Education has supported the development of a statewide general education policy that is intended to ensure the portability of general education credit among Missouri's colleges and universities. State-level curricular goals and institutional-level student competencies for general education fall into two categories: academic skills and knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Skills Areas</head><p>A. Communicating To develop students' effective use of the English language and quantitative and other symbolic systems essential to their success in school and in the world.

Students should be able to make informed decisions through identifying personal values and the values of others and through understanding how such values develop. They should be able to analyze the ethical implications of choices made on the basis of these values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Knowledge Areas</head><p>A. Social and Behavioral Sciences To develop students' understanding of themselves and the world around them through study of content and the processes used by historians and social and behavioral scientists to discover, describe, explain, and predict human behavior and social systems.
