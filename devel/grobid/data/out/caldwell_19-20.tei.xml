In any such case, the university will give appropriate notice as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.</p><p>Students are expected to have knowledge of the information presented in this publication, the student handbook, and in other university publications, as well as officially posted notices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>• Grades of C or better may be accepted. Grades of P (passing) or S (satisfactory) may only be considered if it is the policy of the transferring institution that these grades are equivalent to a C or better and may only used for elective credit.</p><p>• A cumulative maximum of 90 semester hours may be transferred and used toward an undergraduate degree. The final 30 credits and at least one-half of the major requirements must be taken at Caldwell University.</p><p>• Credit may only be awarded for coursework that is similar to Caldwell University coursework and is appropriate to the chosen curriculum.</p><p>• Transfer credit is initially reviewed by the Office of Admissions, but the ultimate authority on the equivalency of credits to Caldwell University courses lies with the Academic Departments or Division for the particular discipline of the individual course.</p><p>• Transfer credit awarded may not exceed the maximum credits offered for an equivalent course in the Caldwell University curriculum.</p><p>• Students who have received an Associate of Arts (A. <ref type="bibr">A.)</ref> degree from a New Jersey community/ county college will have satisfied, as a block, the Caldwell University core requirements, except for 3 credits in theology, 3 credits in philosophy and 3 credits in the Catholic and Dominican tradition and any course or courses in which a C or better was not achieved.</p><p>• In most cases, courses from other institutions will not be equivalent to TH 102 Theology due to the focus on Catholic theology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Student Admission</head><p>In addition to traditional admissions standards, students educated outside the United States must demonstrate their qualifications for baccalaureate study in their respective country by submission of secondary school transcripts and college transcripts, if any. Students wishing to demonstrate the equivalency of a United States High School Diploma must have their transcripts evaluated in certified English translation from any NACES accredited agency. Other NACES accredited evaluations may be submitted at the discretion of the Assistant Vice President, Enrollment <ref type="bibr">Management.</ref> For international applicants who have earned college credits from foreign educational institutions, a World Education <ref type="bibr">Services (www.wes.org)</ref> course by course evaluation must be completed prior to enrolling at Caldwell University to be able to apply any transfer credit.</p><p>SAT or ACT is required for admission for students who have been educated in English and also required for any international student wishing to receive an academic scholarship.</p><p>Students educated in languages other than English must demonstrate their current level of English language proficiency through submission of transcripts showing English language study and/or score of 70 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), certificate showing completion of Level 112 from an ELS program, or a score of 6.0 on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Upon entry to Caldwell University, these students will be tested for English language reading, writing, and oral proficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RETURN OF FEDERAL TITLE IV FUNDS Effective Fall 2000</head><p>The 1992 reauthorization of Higher Education Act of 1965 imposed a federally mandated refund policy on colleges and universities for students who receive Title IV financial aid. Institutions were required to use various refund calculations to determine the amount that the institution earned while the student was in attendance. The calculations varied according to the student's status, first-time student or continuing student. There was considerable confusion in the financial aid community with regard to the amount that the institution would be eligible to retain and that a student would be required to "repay" if he or she withdrew from a semester. The 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1964 simplified this calculation by replacing the current calculations with a single pro rata formula. It also shifted the focus from institution to the student. The student is only eligible for the amount that is earned at the time he or she ceases attendance. It no longer has a relationship to the student's institutional charges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EFFECTIVE FOR PERIODS OF ENROLLMENT BEGINNING ON OR AFTER 8/28/2000</head><p>The policy shall apply to all students who withdraw, drop out or are expelled from Caldwell University and receive financial aid from Title IV Funds:</p><p>1.The term "Title IV Funds" refers to the Federal financial aid programs authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended) and includes the following programs: a. Unsubsidized FFEL/Direct loans, subsidized FFEL/Direct loans, Federal Pell Grants, Federal SEOG. 2.A student's withdrawal date is: a. The date the student began the institution's withdrawal process or officially notified the institution of intent to withdraw; or b. The midpoint of the period for a student who leaves unofficially without notifying the institution; or c. The student's last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity. 3.Refunds on all institutional charges, including tuition and fees, will be calculated using the Caldwell University refund policy published in the Catalog and class schedule and will be calculated and determined by the Bursars Office. 4.Title IV aid is earned in a prorated manner on a per diem basis up to and including the 60% point in the semester. 60% is approximately 9.6 weeks of a 16-week semester or 4.8 weeks of an 8-week summer session. Title IV aid and all other aid is viewed as 100% earned after that point in time. <ref type="bibr">5</ref>.The percentage of Title IV aid earned shall be calculated as follows: a. Number of days completed by student ÷ Total number of days in term* = Percent of term completed. b. The percent of term completed shall be the percentage of Title IV aid earned by the student. c. The total number of calendar days in a term of enrollment shall exclude any scheduled breaks of more than five days. * 6.The percentage of Title IV aid unearned (i/e., to be returned to the appropriate aid program) shall be 100% minus the percent earned. 7.Unearned aid shall be returned first from the student's account calculated as follows: a. Total institutional charges (x) percent of unearned aid = amount returned to programs. b. Unearned Title IV aid shall be returned to the following programs in the following order:</p><p>• Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan • Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan • Federal Pell Grant • Federal SEOG Grant • Other Title IV grant programs Exception: no program can receive a refund if the student did not receive aid from that program. <ref type="bibr">8</ref>.When the total amount of unearned aid is greater than the amount returned from the student's account, the student is responsible for returning unearned aid to the appropriate programs(s) as follows: a. Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan* b. Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan* c. Federal Pell Grant** d. Federal SEOG Grant** e. Other Title IV grant programs** *Loan amounts are returned in accordance with the terms of the promissory note signed by the student. **Amounts to be returned by the student to federal grant programs will receive a 50% discount.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Return of Title IV Funds Policy</head><p>The following procedures should be followed when the Office of Financial Aid receives notification that a student, who is receiving financial aid, has withdrawn from the university.</p><p>• Official Withdrawal: Caldwell University will apply the official withdrawal date as recorded by the Office of the Registrar in determining the return of funds due by the student and/or institution. Caldwell University will consider the student's official withdrawal date to be the date the student submits his/her written withdrawal request, to the Registrar.</p><p>• Unofficial Withdrawal: Caldwell University will contact the student's instructors to verify that the student attended "at least half-time." If the instructor/s cannot verify the student's attendance "at least half-time," the student must return all financial aid funds. If the instructor/s verifies the student did attend "at least half-time," the Office of Financial Aid will apply the 50% point of the semester to be the withdrawal date. If Caldwell University determines that a student did not begin the institution's withdrawal process or otherwise provide official notification (including notice from an individual acting on the student's behalf) to Caldwell University of his/her intent to withdraw because of illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumstances beyond the student's control, Caldwell University may assign a withdrawal date that is related to that circumstance.</p><p>• Calculations: Caldwell University will use the Return of Financial Aid -Refund Policy federal software program to determine the amount the student and /or institution must refund to the appropriate program. The Office of Financial Aid and Student Accounts will work cooperatively to verify the accuracy of each refund calculation.</p><p>• Institution's Return of Funds: Once the institution's portion of the return of funds has been calculated, the Office of Financial Aid will reduce the student's original financial award and return the funds within 30 days to the appropriate program/s in the order specified. If this creates a "charge" on the student's account in Student Accounts, the student will be responsible for paying the debt to Student Accounts immediately. The student will not be allowed to register, receive an official transcript, and/or receive future financial aid until the debt to Caldwell University has been paid in full.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Student's Return of Funds:</head><p>Once the student's portion of the return of funds has been calculated, the Office of Financial Aid will notify the student of the amount he/she must repay. The student may select one of the following repayment options: -The student may pay Caldwell University the full amount of his/her debt, and the university will return the funds to the appropriate programs; or -The student may contact the Department of Education to establish a repayment plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23</head><p>The student will remain eligible for Title IV Funds for 45 days from the date the institution sends a notice to the student of the overpayment. To continue eligibility past 45 days, the student must pay the overpayment in full to Caldwell University or make satisfactory arrangements to repay with the Department of Education. On the 46th day, the institution will report the student's overpayment to the Department of Education, and if the student must return federal loan funds, the student's lender will be notified of the amount owed by the student. The student is responsible for repayment of any loan debt to his/her lender.</p><p>• Return of Unearned Funds: Unearned funds must be returned in the following order: <ref type="bibr">Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Subsidized Federal PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, other grant, scholarship,</ref> or loan assistance. If there is a return for a loan fund that was originally received by EFT, the Office of Financial Aid will be responsible for the return of these funds. If the loan funds were originally received by "paper check" from the lender, Student Accounts will be responsible for return of these funds to the lender.</p><p>• Post-Withdrawal Funds: If the amount disbursed to the student is less than the amount the student earned, the amount is considered to be post-withdrawal disbursement. Postwithdrawal eligibility can be used to credit outstanding charges on the student's tuition account. Caldwell University has 30 days, from the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew, to offer any amount of the post-withdrawal disbursement to the student (or parent for PLUS loans). The student (or parent) may accept or decline some or all of the post-withdrawal disbursement that is not credited to the student's account. The student or parent must respond within 14 days of the date that the institution sends the notification to be eligible to receive the post-withdrawal disbursement. If the post-withdrawal disbursement is accepted, Caldwell University must make payment within 90 days of the date of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. If the student (or parent) does not respond to the institution's notice, no portion of the post-withdrawal disbursement that is not credited to the student's account may be disbursed.</p></div>

Unless otherwise noted in the course syllabus, students who have missed 40 percent of the coursework without documentation and have not withdrawn will receive an F for the course.</p><p>Students who fail to attend class by the first meeting after the add/drop period should officially withdraw from the course through the Registrar's office to avoid receiving an F.</p><p>Students must be registered and in class prior to the start of the second week of classes. If a student has not been in attendance by the first class of the second week, the student will need faculty, department chair, and the Vice President of Academic Affair's approval to enter the class. Instructors retain the right to deny admission to a course to any student who wishes to enroll after the add/drop period has ended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Delayed Opening/Emergency Closing</head><p>If a class is canceled for illness or personal emergency of the professor, every effort will be made to notify students by phone. The university's Emergency Closing telephone number is 973-618-3100. In the event of inclement weather, students and faculty should call this number or go to the university Web site for information regarding classes. Students should keep in mind that late afternoon and evening classes are not necessarily canceled if day classes are.</p><p>Should the weather improve, these classes may be held. Therefore, this number or Web site should be checked any time after 6:30 a.m. for information regarding day classes and again after 3:00 p.m. for a final decision on evening class cancellations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standing</head><p>The scholastic standing of a student is determined by the quality of work in class and semester examinations. It is expressed in terms of the scholastic index also known as the Grade Point Average (GPA). The scholastic index is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted. For example, a student who has earned 30 quality points for 15 semester hours has a scholastic index of 2.0. Only course work taken at Caldwell University or in an approved affiliation program is included in the computation of the GPA.</p><p>Quality points are the numerical values assigned to the various grades as shown in the following table. For example, the grade "A" translates into 4 quality points per semester hour.</p><p>The cumulative index will determine the academic standing of a student at every point. A student is in good academic standing if the cumulative index is 1.8 at the end of the first semester and 2.0 at the end of every semester thereafter. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE QUALITY POINTS INTERPRETATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progress</head><p>Full-time students (defined as students taking 12 or more credits per semester) are required to demonstrate progress toward a degree according to the following conditions:</p><p>1. The attainment of a degree within a maximum of six academic years, fulfilling degree requirements as described in the university catalog for the year in which the student entered the university. The university cannot assure students that requirements and courses will be applicable for more than six years. Students in teacher education programs or other programs subject to professional licensing may be required to take additional courses in order to secure certification. (See also section on Interruptions of Registration, page 58.) 2. The successful completion of at least one-sixth of the credits required for graduation at the end of the first academic year, including summer school, and an additional one-sixth increment at the end of each successive academic year.</p><p>3. The maintenance of a minimum GPA of 1.8 during any one semester, a minimum cumulative average of 2.0 after two semesters, and a minimum of 2.0 in major courses during the junior and senior years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Students who have not accumulated the minimum credits and/or the minimum cumulative average at the end of each academic year will be evaluated by the Vice President for Academic Affairs to determine if the student has the potential to complete the degree requirements within the maximum years allowed. A positive determination will indicate satisfactory progress.</p><p>The progress of part-time students (defined as students taking fewer than 12 credits in a semester) will be periodically reviewed by the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment <ref type="bibr">Services.</ref> Ordinarily, a student should be able to attain a degree within a maximum of ten academic years. After ten years, a re-evaluation of the student's record will be necessary. Students who take more than ten years to complete a degree run the risk of having to repeat or add courses in the major field in order to keep their education current.</p><p>A student who has been academically dismissed and then reinstated must show evidence of improved academic progress since dismissal in order to receive financial aid.</p><p>Students will not be funded with any financial aid past completion of 150% of their educational degree requirement (i.e., 120 credits to graduate cannot exceed 180 credits).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Standing</head><p>To be classified as a sophomore, a student must have earned at least 30 credit hours; as a junior, the student must have earned at least 60 credit hours; as a senior, at least 90 credit hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Reports</head><p>At the close of each semester, grade reports will be available online. Report cards will only be generated if requested.</p><p>Mid-semester grades for students with freshman status will be available on the web. Upperclass students whose mid-semester grades are below C will be sent a warning letter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change of Grade</head><p>A final grade may be changed for reasons of error in computation or in transcribing or in exceptional circumstances with written approval of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Any such changes must be made within six months of the posting of the initial grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal of Final Grade</head><p>In exceptional circumstances, if a student believes that a grade is unjustified, the following appeal process can be followed. An attempt must be made to resolve the matter in a face-to-face meeting with the faculty member. If the student believes that the situation has not been resolved, the student may meet with the Department Chair (or the Vice President for Academic Affairs if the faculty member is also the Department Chair.) If the student continues to believe that the resolution is not satisfactory, he/she may appeal in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs using the designated Student Appeal form on the Caldwell Portal. The appeal will then be heard by the Academic Foundations Committee which may request oral testimony from the parties involved. The final decision will then be made by the faculty members of the Academic Foundations Committee. If the faculty member is not available to participate in the appeal process, the department chair shall act as surrogate for the faculty member in the appeal process. At all times, the burden of proof is on the student to demonstrate that the final grade does not accurately reflect the student's performance in the course.</p><p>When supported by sufficient evidence, any of the following reasons may constitute cause for challenging a final grade: 1. The grade was the result of an error on the part of the instructor in calculating, recording, or reporting a final grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>The grade was awarded in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>The grade was the result of unfair discrimination. The student must provide evidence that the instructor did not apply a consistent grading standard to all students in the course.</p><p>None of the following shall be considered cause for appealing a final grade: 1. Disagreement with the course requirements established by the professor.</p><p>2. Disagreement with the grading standards established by the professor.</p><p>3. Disagreement with the instructor's judgment when applying grading standards, assuming that the instructor has made a reasonable effort to be fair and consistent in exercising that judgment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>The desire or need of the student to attain a particular grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Consequences that a student might face as the result of a grade award.</p><p>An appeal of a final grade must be made within four months of the posting of the initial grade.</p><p>*Adapted from Shepherd University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC POLICIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>57</head><p>Academic Recovery Academic Standing Summary:</p><p>• Good Academic Standing: Cumulative and major GPA is 2.0 or above.</p><p>• Academic Warning: Any student whose term GPA is below a 2.0.</p><p>• Academic Probation: Any student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 -Re-admit Probation: Returning students who have a cumulative GPA below 2.0 -Continued Probation: Second semester probation students whose GPA remains below 2.0 but have shown improvement by raising their cumulative GPA or achieve a term GPA of 2.0 or above. • Academic Suspension: Any student who has failed to improve cumulative GPA or who has not achieve a term GPA of 2.0 or above after one semester on Academic Probation. • Academic Dismissal: Any student who has failed to improve cumulative GPA after returning from Academic suspension and has put little to no effort in achieving academic goals will face academic dismissal from the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Warning:</head><p>Students on academic warning are in danger of meeting academic requirements because their term GPA is below a 2.0. These students may need additional support and will meet with a recovery advisor during the semester to ensure that they are utilizing academic resources as needed. Advisor will monitor students' progress throughout the semester. Students on academic warning will be suggested, by recovery advisor, to participate in academic activities to improve their grades. This includes, but is not limited to, tutoring, writing assistance, workshops, career development, and counseling. Any student who demonstrates academic progress by obtaining a term GPA of 2.0 or above will no longer be on academic warning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation:</head><p>Students on academic probation have a cumulative GPA below a 2.0. Traditional students on academic probation are required to meet with their recovery advisor at the beginning of semester for an initial meeting where they will review academic policies and develop a strategic academic plan for success. Specialized cohorts such as: adult students will meet with the Academic Recovery advisor for an individualized plan. In the Academic Recovery program, students will meet with advisor consistently throughout the semester to ensure that student is not having academic difficulty. Students will also meet with their advisor before finals to ensure the proper final exam preparation. While on academic probation, students may not take more than a 12-13 credit course load. Adult undergraduate students may not register for more than 6 credits (or two courses) while on academic probation. Students are required to participate in activities suggested by their recovery advisor, including: tutoring and career development. Students on probation are ineligible to participate in athletic sports and may be prohibited to engage in campus activities and organizations. Student athletes can submit an appeal in order to play sports the semester on academic probation; however, they will still be required to meet the guidelines of the Academic Recovery program.</p><p>Once a student's overall GPA is at or above a 2.0, the student will be in good academic standing and thus, will no longer be on academic probation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continued Probation:</head><p>If a student's GPA does not reach good standing status by the end of the first probationary term, they must demonstrate academic improvement by achieving a term GPA of 2.0 or above or raise cumulative GPA in order to be on continued probation. Students on continued probation will follow the same structure and guidelines until they are in good academic standing (cumulative GPA of 2.0). Students who do not show academic improvement after one semester on continued probation will face academic suspension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Re-admitted Probation:</head><p>Students who were suspended from the university and have been re-admitted to complete their degree, are to follow the same probation requirements. Students in this group will receive specific attention when working with their recovery advisor. They will meet consistently with their recovery advisor throughout the semester and develop a strategic academic success plan to improve their GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension:</head><p>Students who do not show improvement to their cumulative GPA or do not obtain a term GPA of 2.0 or above while on academic probation will face suspension. Students who are suspended will be required to take 1-2 semesters of administrative leave from the university. Academic suspension time will be based on a case by case basis and many factors, such as attendance and effort in the Academic Recovery program, will be taken into consideration when making the decision of academic suspension.</p><p>Students have the right to appeal their suspension and will be required to fill out the appeal form addressed to the Vice-President of Academic Affairs (VPAA). Upon their return, students will have a re-admitted probation status and work closely with the recovery advisor to develop an academic action plan for success. Any student who has an appeal approved will remain on continued probation and work towards improving their cumulative GPA. If a student's cumulative GPA decreases instead of improving and the student does not obtain a term GPA of 2.0 or above; they will face suspension or dismissal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal:</head><p>Students who return from academic suspension and are given the opportunity to raise GPA but have failed to do so will face academic dismissal. Academic Dismissal is the final status at Caldwell University in which students are not allowed to return to finish their degree within 2-5 years. After 2-5 years, the student can re-apply to the university and be re-admitted on probationary status and work closely with the recovery advisor to develop an action plan for success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinstatement Procedure</head><p>A student dismissed from the university for academic reasons may submit a petition for reinstatement to the Vice President for Academic Affairs after the lapse of two semesters. A student applying for reinstatement is cautioned that reinstatement is never automatic: the student's overall record (academic and disciplinary) is reviewed, as is performance in courses taken elsewhere during his/her suspension from the university. A student who is reinstated to the university must make an appointment with the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services to complete the registration procedures. Once reinstated, if the student again fails to meet the minimum cumulative quality point index required, he/she will be subject to dismissal at the end of the semester. A student who has been dismissed a second time may not apply for reinstatement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from the University</head><p>Traditional students who withdraw from the university are required to meet with the Director of Advising an exit interview and follow established procedures for remaining in good academic standing. If a student withdraws from the university during a semester, the student must also withdraw from all courses. Failure to follow this procedure will result in a grade of F in every course for which the student was registered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interruptions of Registration</head><p>Traditional students are normally expected to register for courses every semester until completion of degree requirements. Students wishing to interrupt their registration, for any reason, should apply to the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services for a leave of absence. The Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services will advise them concerning: re-registration at the university after the leave of absence; transfer of any credits earned at other insti-tutions during the leave of absence; and completion of degree requirements within the six-year period stipulated under Academic Progress above. Any student who has received financial aid at Caldwell University should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine the impact of this leave of absence.</p><p>Students who interrupt their registration without having an approved leave of absence must apply to the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services in order to re-register at the university. A student whose registration at the university has been interrupted for a period of five years or longer will, upon re-entry, be obligated by the current catalog requirements. The student's transcript will also need to be re-evaluated by the department chair in order to determine the viability of credits earned toward the major.</p><p>Students who take more than 10 years to graduate also need to have courses in their major re-evaluated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses at Other Institutions</head><p>Students who have declared a major and have completed a minimum of 15 degree credits at Caldwell University with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 or 2.75 for Nursing and Education majors, may request permission to take a course at another approved institution. No more than 2 courses or 6 credits whichever is greater may be completed during summer session in one calendar year. For all majors, one half of the coursework in the selected major and at least the last 30 credits must be completed at Caldwell University.</p><p>Students must obtain the appropriate signatures on the permission form to take a course at another institution available at the Registrar's office. The student must have an official transcript sent to the Registrar of Caldwell University after completion of the course.</p><p>No grade below C will be accepted for transfer credit. Grades for courses taken at other institutions are not included in the student's cumulative index.</p><p>No more than six (6) credits or two (2) courses, which ever is greater, may be completed at another institution during a summer session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcripts</head><p>Official Transcripts may be ordered online at www.getmytranscript.com. Select Caldwell University and follow the instructions provided. The cost of a transcript is $7.25 for regular processing (3 business days) and $12.25 for rush processing (1 business day). Both services require a processing fee for each recipient being issued a transcript. Students may view and print unofficial transcripts through the MyCaldwell Portal at https://mycaldwell.caldwell.edu. Transcripts issuance may be delayed and/or suspended during periods of registration and grade distribution. All financial obligations must be met before transcript(s) will be issued.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Integrity Policy</head><p>Academic Integrity, or honesty, in dealing with ideas, facts, data, interpretations, conclusions and expression of these, is essential to the very nature of any academic community. The nature and mission of Caldwell University demand a high respect for moral values, including intellectual honesty and justice. Every student who attends Caldwell University agrees to abide by this Academic Integrity Policy as long as he or she remains enrolled. Students who witness violations are strongly encouraged to report the academic dishonesty to the appropriate academic authority (instructor, chair or Vice President for Academic Affairs.)</p><p>The following is an explanation of violations, penalties and procedures regarding academic dishonesty:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIOLATIONS OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</head><p>Academic dishonesty includes but is not necessarily limited to the following: Cheating 1. Unauthorized use of materials during tests and examinations.</p><p>2. Unauthorized possession of test or examination material prior to the administration of same.</p><p>3. Altering assigned grades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Submitting, as one's own work, assignments (for example, papers, data, computer assignments, or artistic works) obtained in whole or in part from another, unless specifically authorized to do so by the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fabricating</head><p>Inventing data or other information to reach a desired conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plagiarism</head><p>The unacknowledged, undocumented presentation of words or ideas which are the intellectual property of another as one's own.</p><p>1. Direct quotation, that is, even a few of the exact words of a source, must be indicated by the use of quotation marks or indentation of the text and be properly documented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Passages which parallel the thought or expression of the source, even without using the same words, must be properly documented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple Submission</head><p>Assignments, substantially the same as those submitted for credit in another course, may not be resubmitted in a second course without the explicit authorization of that instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interference</head><p>Behavior deliberately calculated to prevent or impede another student from fulfilling his or her academic responsibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complicity</head><p>Assisting another student in violating Academic Integrity by any of the actions described in this document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Charges and Appealing Charges</head><p>If a faculty member determines that a violation of academic integrity has occurred, he/she must confront the student and report the incident to the faculty member's department chair and to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p><p>The student charged with academic dishonesty may appeal the charge to the chair of the department in which the incident occurred, or the Vice President for Academic Affairs if the faculty member is also the department chair. The department chair or the Vice President for Academic Affairs if the faculty member is also the department chair, will investigate the facts and affirm or dismiss the charge.</p><p>Subsequently, the student may register a formal appeal with the Vice President for Academic Affairs via the Student Appeal form on the Caldwell portal, who will convene the Academic Appeals Board. The Board consists of a designated Chair, the chair of the department of the faculty member involved in the appeal, one member of the Academic Foundations Committee, the Vice President for Student Life, and either an SGA officer or faculty member or administrator of the student's choice. If the Board determines that an appeal is warranted, it will invite testimony from both the student and faculty member involved in the incident and, at its discretion, may solicit other pertinent information. The Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Board are responsible for ensuring that the appeals process is correctly followed and that all evidence has been thoroughly examined. The Board's decision is final.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Penalties and Appealing Penalties</head><p>Offenses against the Academic Integrity Policy are cumulative within the university. A record of each violation will be kept in the student's file. Prior offenses will be taken into account in the assignment of penalties for violations of the policy. Faculty have the right to include offenses and penalties in the course syllabus that may go beyond the stated standard.</p><p>Following are the penalties to be imposed on students for violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.</p><p>FIRST OFFENSE (no record of prior offense within the university)</p><p>• The student will be assigned a grade of F/no credit for the assignment or examination.</p><p>• For offenses such as interference, when the student may not be enrolled in the course, the offense will be recorded in the student's file.</p><p>MULTIPLE OFFENSES (prior offense has been reported and is part of the student's record/or multiple offenses are reported simultaneously)</p><p>• The student will be given an F grade in the course indicating failure due to a violation of the university's academic integrity policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MORE SEVERE PENALTIES</head><p>• The university reserves the right to impose more severe penalties, including suspension for a designated period of time or expulsion from the university, for multiple offenses and/or other factors that may compound the offense. • For offenses where the student is not enrolled in the course, the university reserves the right to impose other penalties including, but not limited to, suspension for a designated period of time or expulsion from the university.</p><p>A student will not be allowed to withdraw from a course in which there is a charge of violating the university's policy on Academic Integrity.</p><p>The Vice President for Academic Affairs is responsible for maintaining the necessary records and ensuring that the penalties for multiple offenses are appropriately administered.</p><p>In such cases where the more severe penalties of suspension or expulsion are imposed, the student may appeal to the Academic Foundations Committee. The Committee will then make a final decision on the penalty. If a student is expelled at any point during a semester/ session, due to a violation(s) of the university's Academic Integrity Policy, the student will receive an FX grade(s) in the course(s) where the violation(s) occurred and will receive a grade of W in all other courses taken in that semester/session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notification of Rights Under FERPA</head><p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. (An "eligible student" under FERPA is a student who attends a postsecondary institution regardless of age.) These rights include:</p><p>1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day Caldwell University receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the registrar, the registrar shall coordinate access to inspect those records.</p><p>2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA.</p><p>A student who wishes to ask Caldwell University to amend a record should write the registrar, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.</p><p>If Caldwell University decides not to amend the record as requested, Caldwell University will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.</p><p>3. The right to provide written consent before Caldwell University discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. See "Additional Disclosure Information" below. Students may request to withhold disclosure of directory information. To ensure that a request is properly processed, it must be submitted on the official 'Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information Form', which is available in the Office of the Registrar. The request will remain in effect until the student submits signed authorization to allow disclosure of directory information. Caldwell University assumes that failure on the part of any student to specifically request on the official form the withholding of release of directory information indicates individual approval of disclosure.</p><p>• To other school officials within Caldwell University whom Caldwell University has determined to have legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by Caldwell University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for Caldwell University. This includes contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other parties to whom the school has outsourced institutional services or functions, provided that the conditions listed in §99.31(a)(1)(i)(B)(1) -(a)(1)(i)(B)(2) are met. ( §99.31(a)(1))</p><p>• To officials of another school where the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled if the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer, subject to the requirements of <ref type="bibr">§99.34. ( §99.31(a)</ref>(2))</p><p>• • In connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or for which the student has received, if the information is necessary to determine eligibility for the aid, determine the amount of the aid, determine the conditions of the aid, or enforce the terms and conditions of the aid. ( §99.31(a)(4))</p><p>• To organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, the school, in order to: (a) develop, validate, or administer predictive tests; (b) administer student aid programs; or (c) improve instruction. ( §99.31(a)(6))</p><p>• To accrediting organizations to carry out their accrediting functions. (( §99.31(a)(7))</p><p>• To parents of an eligible student if the student is a dependent for IRS tax purposes. ( §99.31(a)(8))</p><p>• To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. ( §99.31(a)(9))</p><p>• To appropriate officials in connection with a health or safety emergency, subject to <ref type="bibr">§99.36. ( §99.31</ref>(a)(10))</p><p>• Information the school has designated as "directory information" under §99.37. ( §99.31(a)(11))</p><p>• To a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, subject to the requirements of §99.39. The disclosure may only include the final results of the disciplinary proceeding with respect to that alleged crime or offense, regardless of the finding. ( §99.31(a)(13))</p><p>• To the general public, the final results of a disciplinary proceeding, subject to the requirements of §99.39, if the school determines the student is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense and the student has committed a violation of the school's rules or policies with respect to the allegation made against him or her. ( §99.31(a)(14))</p><p>• To parents of a student regarding the student's violation of any Federal, State, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the school, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the school determines the student committed a disciplinary violation and the student is under the age of 21. ( §99.31(a)(15))</p><p>As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records-including Social Security Number, grades, or other private information-may be accessed without consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities ("Federal and State Authorities") may allow access to records and PII without consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal-or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is "principally engaged in the provision of education," such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to education records and PII without consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when Caldwell University objects to or does not request such research.

The breakdown of these courses follows below: Note that the 12 double-counted credits will be designated as "applicable to the graduate degree" only after the student receives the bachelor's degree and matriculates into the M.A. graduate program, which designation will be canceled if the student withdraws from graduate study before completing the master's program. In that case, Caldwell University will count the credits only towards the student's undergraduate degree. Note also that grades below B in required graduate-level courses will necessitate that the student retake that course; grades below B in an elective graduate-level course will necessitate that the student either re-take the course or take another graduate-level course in substitution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By permission.</head><p>CHAIRED BY JAMES J. FLYNN, Ph.D.</p><p>The department offers a B.A. in Theology, minors in theology, philosophy, faith in action and a certificate in theology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Core Curriculum</head><p>For students entering Caldwell University summer 2011 or later, 3 credits in philosophy and 3 credits in theology must be taken, with additional offerings available for meeting enriched core requirements. For the required credits, students must take PH 102 and TH 102. For these students, TH 102 serves as a prerequisite for all theology courses and PH 102 serves as a prerequisite for all other philosophy courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for a Theology Major</head><p>DEGREE: Bachelor of Arts Liberal Arts Core (see page 40   and seven additional courses after consultation with the department chairperson. It is suggested that students with a major in theology choose a minor in sociology, psychology or philosophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STATEMENT OF OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT</head><p>In addition to the 39 credits for the theology major, students declaring a theology major during or after summer 2011 are required to take a theology capstone course, TH 495.</p><p>Students declaring a major prior to summer 2011 have the option to fulfill their outcomes assessment with either TH 495, or an alternative process to be determined in consultation with the department chairperson. Outcomes assessments are required for all majors.</p><p>The TH 495 capstone course reviews material from each of the four major assessment areas (Scripture, Moral Theology, Christology, and Church History). In each area, the student will concentrate on material corresponding to their coursework used to meet their requirement. For example, Moral Theology will focus on either TH 201 or TH 209, while Scripture will focus on TH 318 or TH 319, depending upon the student's coursework. Students who have had two Scripture courses or Moral Theology courses will be able to choose their area of focus for their capstone. Normally, this is to be taken sometime during the student's final year of classes, or as shortly thereafter as possible. It is the student's responsibility to notify his or her advisor, as well as the department chairperson, of his or her intention to begin preparing for assessment. This should be done the semester prior to the time this preparation begins.</p><p>Within TH 495, students will be assessed on covering all four areas mentioned above. While the course will be taught by a single instructor, the work by each student may be assessed by full-time professors within the department to determine if the work is of passing quality. The decision about whether or not a student's performance for a given area is sufficient to pass is to be determined by the instructor and other department faculty who may be involved in the THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY 211 assessment, in consultation with one another. Each student must receive an assessment of "passing" for each of the four areas to pass the course. If by the end of the course the student has failed to pass any of the four areas before the conclusion of the course, he or she will receive a grade of "no pass" for the course. Students failing to pass TH 495 may either take the course again when it is next offered, or be reassessed in the particular area(s) which they failed to pass. Depending upon the timeline of the course, students may be able to redo work in areas they fail to pass before the conclusion of the course, though only as time allows. While there is no limit how many times a student may retake an assessment for any of the four areas, students will typically be allowed only one retake per area per semester.</p></div>

Upon successful completion of all requirements by the student, the final products are a B.A. in Psychology from Caldwell University and an M.S. in Occupational Therapy (OT) from Columbia.Students are NOT guaranteed admission or a seat in the Columbia OT program by entering into this option at Caldwell University. Rather, students must separately apply for admission to the Columbia OT program when they are eligible to apply. The decision for admission to the Columbia OT program is made solely by the Columbia OT program.If a Caldwell University student is NOT accepted into the Columbia OT program, however, then the student must complete all requirements for their 4-year degree at Caldwell University to obtain the B.A. in Psychology. This includes taking the coursework at Caldwell University that is required of typical psychology majors along with completing the required number of credits for graduation.If students are successfully admitted into the OT program at Columbia, then satisfactory completion of the first year courses at Columbia will "double count." This means that they will fulfill some portion of the requirements for graduation from Caldwell University with the B.A. in Psychology as well as the first year required coursework for the M.S. in OT at Columbia. This will allow students to complete a B.A. in Psychology (from Caldwell University) and an M.S. in OT (from Columbia) in a shorter time than is typical of separate degree programs.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Additional Substitutions for M.A. in Counseling with School Counseling Specialization: UNDERGRADUATE COURSE GRADUATE SUBSTITUTE PS 310 COMBINED B.A. IN PSYCHOLOGY/ M.S.

It is designed to facilitate the ongoing academic accomplishments of students who have established a record of excellence in psychology at the undergraduate level. Acceptance into the program will allow up to 12 psychology credits to be "doublecounted" toward both the B.A. in Psychology and M.A.  in Applied Behavior Analysis.
