<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inquiries for additional information should be forwarded to the following offices: <ref type="bibr">Office</ref>  Franklin &amp; Marshall College is a residential college dedicated to excellence in undergraduate liberal education. Its aims are to inspire in young people of high promise and diverse backgrounds a genuine and enduring love for learning, to teach them to read, write and think critically, to instill in them the capacity for both independent and collaborative action, and to educate them to explore and understand the natural, social and cultural worlds in which they live. In so doing, the College seeks to foster in its students qualities of intellect, creativity and character, that they may live fulfilling lives and contribute meaningfully to their occupations, their communities, and their world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE HISTORY OF FRANKLIN &amp; MARSHALL COLLEGE</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the United States. Its roots go back to Franklin College, founded in 1787 with a generous financial contribution from Benjamin Franklin. The product of a pioneering collaboration between English-and Germanspeaking communities in the most ethnically diverse region of the new nation, the College was launched by leaders of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches with support from trustees that included four signers of the Declaration of Independence, three future governors of Pennsylvania, two members of the Constitutional Convention and seven officers of the Revolutionary Army. Their goal was "to preserve our present republican system of government," and "to promote those improvements in the arts and sciences which alone render nations respectable, great and happy." Marshall College, named after the great Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, was founded in 1836 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania under the sponsorship of the German Reformed Church. It attracted a distinguished faculty that became nationally known as leaders of an intellectual movement known as the Mercersburg Theology. In 1853 Marshall College moved to Lancaster and merged with Franklin College to form Franklin &amp; Marshall College. James Buchanan, fifteenth President of the United States, was the first President of the Board of Trustees. From the time of its centennial, the College complemented its strengths in the classics and philosophy with a widely respected program in science. Then, in the 1920s, it added a program in business. The College's transformation continued after World War II with gradual expansion in size and academic scope. Increasingly, students and faculty were drawn from all regions of the nation and the world. Campus facilities expanded and the College became primarily residential. It became coeducational in 1969. The connection to the Reformed Church, later part of the United Church of Christ, was severed and the College became a secular institution. Throughout all of these changes, however, the College remained committed to "liberal learning." Frederick Rauch, the first president of Marshall College, had proclaimed in 1837, "The fortune of our lives and our government depends not exclusively on useful knowledge but on our character as citizens, and to form this character by cultivating the whole <ref type="bibr">[person]</ref> is the aim of education in the proper sense." Today, with approximately 2,400 students, Franklin &amp; Marshall College proudly continues its dedication to intellectual freedom and critical learning as fundamental to a democratic society. As its mission statement affirms, this means that it expects students to see connections, to discover community and to understand the centrality of service to the human endeavor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INTEGRATION OF ACADEMIC &amp; RESIDENTIAL LEARNING</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College offers an integrated learning environment where students engage the values of the liberal arts both through the curriculum and in their lives outside the formal classroom. Consistent with the Mission Statement of the College, faculty and administrative offices place student learning at the center of their work. Programs and activities guide and support students as they explore a love of learning, the skills of critical thinking, the role of citizenship in their lives and the values of civility. The College challenges students to make the most of the academic program and other educational opportunities offered by this residential campus, to practice mental and physical wellness and to develop their talents and interests as part of an educated and socially responsible community.</p><p>The faculty-led College House system is the keystone of Franklin &amp; Marshall's vision for integrating academic and residential life. While a College House is in a literal sense a student residence, it is more than this. College Houses are led by senior members of the Faculty, the Dons, and by their colleagues, the College House Deans, experienced academic and student life professionals. The Houses foster an environment that infuses student life with thoughtful deliberation and intellectual exploration, habits of thought and analysis that will serve students throughout their personal and professional lives. The Houses are the meeting ground where students can interact and network among the extended College family. Together, Faculty Dons, College House Deans and students create events that bring faculty, students, alumni/ae, distinguished visitors and professional staff together in formal and informal settings to engage in lively discussions and social interactions that break the barrier between classroom and student residence.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College 2019-2020 CATALOG Upon matriculation, all students are assigned to membership in a College House. Although students are not required to live in the House for all four years, this affiliation continues through the entire Franklin &amp; Marshall experience and extends beyond graduation. Most students enter the House System as a member of a residential Connections seminar. These courses introduce students to skills of critical reading, critical thinking, oral communication and information literacy. At the same time, the students live together in the same area of the College House making it possible for discussions of substance about ideas to move easily between the classroom and the residential environment.</p><p>Within Houses, students elect leaders, craft and enforce standards of behavior, manage their own social programs and resolve the problems of living that arise among House residents. The governing structure of each House is based on the explicit acknowledgement that students are adults and should control many aspects of their social and residential life. College Houses are therefore also places where the arts of democracy are learned and leadership is incubated.</p><p>College Houses express the ethos of the College. College Houses are connected communities where all students can find a place. Creating an environment that is neither exclusively academic nor residential, the House environment is sometimes called a "third space," a comfortable and inviting hybrid of classroom and residence hall that exceeds its individual parts. The College Houses model a way of living that makes for a rewarding life: they support a social landscape that integrates work, play, a critical approach to new ideas and the belief that every moment holds the opportunity for discovery and personal satisfaction.</p><p>This emphasis on integrating ideas and residential life informs many other areas of the student experience. Both academic and career advising ask students to think about the value of a liberal arts education and the connections among the liberal arts and the world of work. Social and co-curricular programming emphasizes student initiative in planning and organizing events. Students are encouraged to see themselves as citizens informed by an entrepreneurial spirit. The College also provides opportunities for students to explore the meaning of faith, religion and spirituality. Because of its commitment to educating the whole person, the College has a number of programs that emphasize health and wellness, including personal counseling, programs in the residence halls, varsity and intramural sports and workshops on health issues.</p><p>In March 2009, the faculty voted to implement a Common Hour, a weekly time during which no classes are scheduled, to enable the entire College community to gather for special events. This common gathering time, used for lectures, topical discussions, projects and other community gatherings since Spring 2010, was designed to promote the involvement of all members of the College in meaningful intellectual exchange and to broaden the reach of the liberal arts experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Franklin &amp; Marshall Curriculum</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS PAGE 131.</head><p>The Franklin &amp; Marshall Curriculum combines a spirit of innovation with a strong sense of tradition, and provides a framework for our students' intellectual development over their four years at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. Called "Connections," our curriculum encourages students to become responsible, creative, ambitious participants in learned discourse and discovery by making connections: connections across disciplines, connections between theory and practice, and connections between their liberal arts education and the world. A liberally educated person is one who is inquisitive about all realms of thought, who is able to take into the wider world a comfort with ambiguity and respectful debate, who understands the limits of knowledge and the value of evidence, who has refined his or her judgment about the good and the beautiful, and who has learned to analyze critically, to speak persuasively, and to listen attentively. The Connections curriculum guides students to become such educated people.</p><p>The curriculum has three phases: Introduction, Exploration and Concentration. Together with electives, these phases offer appropriate balance between structure and choice to allow the construction of an individualized educational experience.</p><p>In the Introduction phase, students take small, intensive seminars, Connections 1 and Connections 2, which are unified by a concern for the aims and standards of intellectual discourse and the communities that sustain it. These courses also sequence instruction in writing, research, and oral presentation. In Connections courses students become members of our intellectual community and learn the practices of critical analysis, research, writing, and civil debate that will help them attain their academic goals.</p><p>In the Exploration phase, students take courses that promote understanding modes of study in different intellectual arenas, from creating art to gaining competency in a foreign language to applying the scientific method. As they progress, students make connections among the ways different disciplines seek truth and structure inquiry.</p><p>The Concentration phase is the culmination of our students' four years of work and study. This phase is represented by their study in a major discipline and may include synthetic projects, capstone seminars, and one-on-one research. Given their growing intellectual maturity, students will be in a position to reflect on the connections they have drawn and the paths they have charted through the curriculum, both inside and outside their major fields.</p><p>All courses undertaken to fulfill the introduction, exploration, and concentration phases of the curriculum must be taken for a regular letter grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION: CONNECTIONS SEMINARS</head><p>In their Connections Seminars, students will:</p><p>1. Develop curiosity in order to learn how to read, write, listen, and converse in an intellectual community 2. Develop judgment in order to create and evaluate effective arguments, ideas, and solutions The Connections seminars are small classes limited to 16 students and share three important characteristics: they invite first-year students into an intellectual community and a life of the mind; they sequence the building of skills in close reading, writing, research, and oral presentation; and (in Connections 1) they integrate classroom work with residential life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONNECTIONS 1 SEMINAR</head><p>Connections 1 courses spark curiosity and teach students to value and practice our shared commitments to reasoned and respectful discourse. In them, students develop a comfort with debate and ambiguity and become active participants in a culture of evidence. Connections 1 courses enfranchise students first as members of the intellectual community of their classroom, and then as members of wider and interconnected intellectual communities on campus and beyond. In Connections 1 courses, students learn to observe closely the world around them, the details of the arguments they read, and the way those arguments marshal evidence. They also listen carefully to their peers' ideas, and improve their expression of truth, conciseness, and accuracy in their discourse.</p><p>Students who enroll in a particular Connections 1 seminar live together in one of the College Houses. This promotes an integration of the residence hall and the classroom that enhances both the academic success and the personal growth of students.</p><p>Students are expected to complete a Connections 1 Seminar in their first semester. A list of current Connections 1 Seminars appears on pages 7-8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONNECTIONS 2 SEMINAR</head><p>Connections 2 courses build on the practices of intellectual discourse established in Connections 1, improving students' ability to read closely, understand, reason, and debate. While in Connections 1 courses, students concern themselves primarily with making and comprehending arguments and ideas, in Connections 2 courses students progress to refining their judgment regarding effective and ineffective arguments. In addition, students apply these skills to the scholarly analysis of a complex problem examined from multiple perspectives. Thus, these seminars teach students to compare, contrast, and connect insights gained from different sources and perspectives, and guide them in connecting an argument or idea to its larger consequences, be they social, political, moral, or natural.</p><p>Normally, students will complete their Connections 2 seminar during their second semester at the College, but it must be completed no later than the third semester. A list of current Connections 2 Seminars appears on pages 9-13.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPLORATION: LIBERAL LEARNING</head><p>In their Exploration courses, students will: 1. Acquire familiarity with broad divisions of knowledge, modes of inquiry, and creative practices characteristic of different intellectual and expressive arenas 2. Develop intellectual breadth and versatility, fostering the ability to make connections across a broad range of disciplines, practices, and experiences To this end, students will complete courses (each for a regular grade) among the traditional divisions of intellectual inquiry in the liberal arts, including the Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences, in addition to language study and exploration of the non-western world, as described below. <ref type="bibr">Goal: Create, perform, or study art</ref> Courses that meet this goal are designated A in the catalog, and include the study of the creative and performing arts, as well as courses in the history, analysis, and criticism of the arts, including creative writing, but excluding the study of literature. Students must earn one course credit in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HUMANITIES</head><p>Goal: Analyze the systems of belief, knowledge, and ideas of the humanities Courses that meet this goal are designated H in the catalog, and focus on the study of ancient and modern literature, classical and modern languages, religion, or philosophy. Students must earn one course credit in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOCIAL SCIENCES</head><p>Goal: Learn about one or more societies or cultures in terms of their social, political, or economic organization and/or their history Courses that meet this goal are designated S in the catalog. They focus on history, ethnographic study, or the political and economic organization of the social world. Students must earn one course credit in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NATURAL SCIENCES</head><p>Goals: Practice the scientific method and better understand the larger social implications of science Students may satisfy these goals in either of two ways: 1. They may take two science courses with labs (N); or 2. They may take one lab science course plus one course designated "Natural Science in Perspective" (NSP) Natural Science in Perspective (NSP) courses help students understand: 1. The role played by theory in the natural sciences 2. The role of evidence in developing and testing scientific theories and what constitutes acceptable evidence in the natural sciences 3. How science deals with uncertainty, thus increasing students' ability to reason quantitatively 4. The role science plays in today's society, including those questions science attempts to answer and those questions that lie outside its domain 5. Real-world situations in which policy decisions need to be made without complete understanding or certainty A list of NSP courses appears on pages 13-14.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LANGUAGE STUDY</head><p>Goal: Acquire linguistic and cross-cultural competency through foreign language study Competency in a foreign language helps students develop an informed and thoughtful awareness of language as a system and facilitates their exploration of other cultural worlds. Students are strongly encouraged to begin language study in their first year and to complete the sequence of classes promptly; lengthy gaps between levels may disadvantage students in the next level course. Students are encouraged to complete their intermediate language competency by the end of their junior year (Please note that most departments offer the 101 introductory level course only in the fall semester.)</p><p>On-campus placement tests are available throughout the year and will determine the student's appropriate level. Placement results are valid for two semesters; after that a student must retake the placement test. Students enrolled in a language class may not take the placement test in the same language after the first two weeks of class.</p><p>To fulfill the goal to "acquire linguistic and cultural competency through foreign language study," students must pass, with a regular grade, the third course in a foreign language sequence or demonstrate equivalent proficiency through testing. The requirement may be satisfied in any of the following ways:</p><p>1. Passing at least one course at the 200 level or above taught in the student's non-native language 2. Studying in a non-English speaking country and completing a course at the 200 level or above in a foreign language 3. Scoring 4 or 5 in the Advanced Placement Exam in a foreign or classical language 4. Scoring 5 or higher in a Foreign Language Course via the International Baccalaureate 5. Placing into the fourth semester course or higher in the language sequence as taught at Franklin &amp; Marshall through a placement exam administered by the appropriate Franklin &amp; Marshall academic department Note that a student who tests out of this requirement for a particular language and who then decides to enroll in the 101, 102, or 201 level (the first three semesters) of that language forfeits the waiver and must complete a foreign language through the 201 level (third semester).</p><p>By completing and submitting a petition to the Committee on Academic Status, international students from non-English speaking countries may receive a waiver of this requirement. International students should contact the Office of tStudent Affairs to begin this process.</p><p>Courses that satisfy the Language Study requirement are designated (LS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NON-WESTERN CULTURES</head><p>Goal: Gain an understanding of the widely disparate ways in which human social and cultural life can be experienced and organized through an investigation of non-Western cultures and societies, including indigenous, colonial, and postcolonial contexts and/or gain a critical understanding of the West/non-West distinction, the limitations of this dichotomy, and the hybridity present in most cultures and societies.</p><p>Courses that meet either or both of these goals are designated (NW) in the catalog and are offered by a variety of programs and departments.</p><p>The NW requirement can also be met by achieving linguistic and cultural competence in a non-Western language as demonstrated by the completion of a course in such languages at the 200 level or beyond. (Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese)</p><p>A non-F&amp;M course (including one taken abroad) may count toward the NW requirement if that course satisfies at least one of the goals described above but requires approval as satisfying these criteria by the appropriate department or program chair. (In cases where a course in question falls outside the domain of a department or program, the decision to approve will be made by the director of International <ref type="bibr">Studies.)</ref> This requirement cannot be met via a proficiency exam, but only by earning a course credit for having completed an academic experience after matriculation at a college or university.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCENTRATION</head><p>In the Concentration phase, students will:</p><p>1. Gain depth and breadth within a specific field of inquiry. 2. Extend and deepen writing and analytical skills within the context of a specific discipline 3. Reflect on their intellectual development and prepare for the future At Franklin &amp; Marshall College, focus on a major field of inquiry allows students to pursue advanced work, which may include independent study and original research. Over four years, students hone their interests to develop a greater mastery over an area of specialty, and many do exceptional work in advanced research, upper level seminars and independent investigations. Students will have opportunities to participate in assessment and reflection exercises, whether formal or informal, curricular or non-curricular, and will be able to meet with advisers and professional staff to help prepare them for post-graduate life.</p><p>To qualify for the Bachelor of Arts degree, a student must complete a prescribed concentration of courses, referred to as the major. A major program must consist of at least eight required course credits and may not exceed 16 required course credits. All courses meeting major requirements must be taken for a regular grade; a student must earn a minimum of a 2.0 grade point average in those courses used by the major department to compute the major grade point average. Descriptions of course requirements for each major offered by the College can be found in the Catalog sections on Departmental offerings.</p><p>A student may declare more than one major. A student who wishes to declare more than two majors must have the approval of the Associate Dean of the Faculty.</p><p>Students may also satisfy the major requirement by designing a Special Studies major or a Joint major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECIAL STUDIES MAJOR</head><p>Students design a Special Studies major in consultation with the Special Studies adviser and a primary and secondary adviser. The design must be intellectually coherent and include courses from three different departments. The major must be a genuine liberal arts major that could legitimately be offered at the College and must progress through higher levels of courses; an assemblage of introductory courses from three departments is not acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELECTIVES: EXTENDED EXPLORATION</head><p>Within each phase of study, the curriculum is designed to incorporate additional curricular explorations. These are electives-courses that do not satisfy a requirement in the introduction, exploration, or concentration phases. Electives allow students to gain additional depth of knowledge outside their major or minor field of study, and to explore unfamiliar areas of knowledge. In addition to regular courses in the curriculum, electives may include internships, off-campus study, guided group study, or independent studies undertaken outside the major. Through the strategic use of electives, students individualize their academic experience. Thus, there is no curricular structure imposed on electives; students may take as many or as few as their other curricular commitments permit. However, students are encouraged to consult with their advisers so as to make best use of these opportunities in the context of their course of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNATIONAL AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY</head><p>(Adopted by the Off-Campus Study Committee of <ref type="bibr">the Faculty in April 2004)</ref> Recognizing the global nature of contemporary society as well as the need for intercultural understanding, Franklin &amp; Marshall College views international study as a valuable component of a liberal arts education. Study abroad promotes an increased understanding of the complexity of language and culture. It also constitutes a critical element of the College's commitment to build an increasingly international campus. Franklin &amp; Marshall College therefore encourages its students to give serious consideration to study in another country.</p><p>The College approaches international education as an integral part of the entire undergraduate experience. We view it not as a term away from campus, but as an encounter seamlessly connected with a student's entire education -before, during, and after the time spent off campus. Students planning foreign or domestic off-campus study will work closely with the Office of International Programs and with their academic advisers to select programs and courses of study that further their educational goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OPTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDY AND OFF CAMPUS STUDY</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College currently pre-approves more than 200 different off-campus study programs in 60 different countries, including programs led by F&amp;M faculty members. Each of these programs has been approved by a faculty committee and the Office of International Programs to ensure strong academic quality and opportunities for cultural learning and engagement with the local community. Off-campus study programs approved by F&amp;M offer coursework, internship, and field research opportunities that provide depth of knowledge and intercultural perspectives on courses and topics studied on-campus. Students interested in off-campus study should speak with their faculty adviser early in their academic career at F&amp;M, and visit the Office of International Programs at least two semesters in advance of the planned time away to begin shaping their off-campus study experience. For more information on off-campus study opportunities, please visit www.fandm.edu/off-campus.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall also offers the innovative International Studies program, an interdisciplinary academic program that combines off-campus study in a non-Englishspeaking-location with coursework on and off-campus. The mission of the program is to unite a cohort of students who, both individually and in collaboration, will broaden the experience of their various major programs as they develop an international perspective and immerse themselves in the language and culture of a non-English-speaking country.</p><p>In addition to off-campus study programs, Franklin &amp; Marshall also provides funding opportunities for international study and research. Please see the section on Summer Travel, Project, and Internship Awards for a list of these awards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FRANKLIN &amp; MARSHALL PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall offers more than 200 approved offcampus study experiences, including faculty-led programs as well as partnerships with a number of U.S. program providers and overseas institutions. Many of these programs offer coursework in English or a local language, as well as internship and research opportunities. Advisers in the Office of International Programs, in partnership with the student's academic adviser, offer guidance on program selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FRANKLIN &amp; MARSHALL FACULTY-LED PROGRAMS</head><p>Each summer, F&amp;M faculty lead a number of Summer Travel Courses. These courses offer unique opportunities to travel with and learn closely from an F&amp;M faculty member. New programs are regularly developed and in the past have taken place in Argentina, China, Cuba, Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Russia, Spain, and South Africa, among other locations. All students accepted to a Summer Travel Course are automatically considered for funding from F&amp;M, based on the student's demonstrated financial need. Students should contact the Office of International Programs to learn more about current Summer Travel Courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVANCED STUDIES IN ENGLAND</head><p>Owned by Franklin &amp; Marshall, the Advanced Studies in England program is administered in association with the University College, Oxford University, and is located in Bath, England. The program offers courses in literature, classics, government, history and creative writing during the fall and spring semester as well as a summer session. During the summer session, an F&amp;M faculty member typically leads one of the course offerings in Bath. Students studying with ASE also have the opportunity to participate in an academic internship. In addition to students from Franklin &amp; Marshall College, the program enrolls students from other affiliate institutions, such as Oberlin, Bucknell, Denison and Gettysburg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GUIDELINES FOR INTERNATIONAL AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDY</head><p>While most students participate in off-campus study during their junior year of study, opportunities exist for earlier or later study. Off-Campus study advisers in the Office of International Programs work with students and their faculty advisers to find programs that match student academic and cultural interests; off-campus study advisers also support students throughout the program application process and provide pre-departure orientation and advising. Students interested in exploring off-campus study opportunities are encouraged to begin working with the Office of International Programs staff at least two semesters in advance of the intended semester or summer off-campus.</p><p>In order to study off-campus, Franklin &amp; Marshall requires that all students:</p><p>• have a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA (though many programs require a higher GPA for participation), • have a plan to declare a major area of study before attending a semester-long program, • be making satisfactory academic progress, • demonstrate evidence of social maturity, and • not be on any academic or disciplinary probation. Students who do not meet these criteria should discuss their interests with an off-campus study adviser in advance of the typical one-year timeline. Depending on the particular circumstance, the student may be required to file a petition to study off campus if one of the above criteria is not satisfied.</p><p>For the majority of students who participate in an offcampus study program during the semester, Franklin &amp; Marshall will bill the student the College's tuition fee; Franklin &amp; Marshall College will then pay the program tuition on the student's behalf. Neither confirmation deposits, nor room &amp; board are billed by F&amp;M; these charges will be sent directly to the student by the off-campus study program provider. Students participating in an off-campus study program during the summer should expect to pay all program costs directly to the program provider, except in the case of Franklin &amp; Marshall faculty-led programs <ref type="bibr">(Summer Travel Courses)</ref>. Students participating in faculty-led programs are automatically considered for needbased aid. For more information about this policy or exceptions, please visit www.fandm.edu/off-campus.</p><p>During the academic year, students will continue to be eligible for financial aid during a term of off-campus study, including federal and state loans as well as Franklin &amp; Marshall merit scholarships and need-based grants. Students who receive Grant-in-Aid benefits will continue to access these benefits for the semester off-campus. This benefit is only available to students of eligible full-time F&amp;M faculty and staff. Students receiving Tuition Exchange benefits will continue to access these benefits for the semester off-campus.</p><p>A number of additional scholarships and financial aid opportunities may be available for off-campus study, depending on the student's demonstrated financial need and other factors. Students are encouraged to apply for national scholarships, such as the Gilman or Boren, as well as program scholarships, scholarships for first-generation college students, or locationspecific scholarships. Off-Campus Study advisers can provide more information about additional funding opportunities. For more information about financial aid policies and additional scholarship opportunities, please visit www.fandm.edu/offcampus. CNX 248. Human Rights and the Humanitarian Response. Human rights (a set of ideas or principles) and humanitarian efforts (a set of practices) both have a history. As rights claims have arisen and expanded globally over the last two hundred years or more, individual and collective efforts have also arisen and expanded to address them. We will use the work of biographers, historians, philosophers, economists, anthropologists, and others to trace these parallel developments and intertwined histories, not to seek definitive answers, but to raise important questions. Are rights universal? How should we respond individually and collectively to violations of rights? Are humanitarian actions effective in addressing human rights claims? Gasbarrone CNX 250. The Story of You: An Autoethnographic Exploration.</p><p>Autoethnography is a form of interdisciplinary self-study, combining personal reflection (memoir) and academic research (scholarship) to understand events and elements of one's life in a broader cultural context. In this course, students will develop critical thinking, reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. They will learn the meaning of autoethnography, analyze examples from a variety of disciplines (e.g., sociology, anthropology, race and gender studies) in essays and class discussions, and write and present their own autoethnographies on topics they choose. Hopkins CNX 251. 9/11 in Public Memory. "Never Forget 9/11." At least once a year, we hear this command. But what exactly are we being asked to remember? Using a variety of sources, such as journalistic accounts and government reports, as well as novels, film, and TV, this course will look at the shaping in public memory of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent war on terror. With this multimedia approach, we will come to understand that the ways in which we remember-and we forget-certain aspects of 9/11 play a role in shaping our understanding of the United States and its place on the world stage. Writing assignments will include a researched essay, pursued in stages throughout the semester. Frick CNX 253. Invention of Childhood. This seminar-style class explores how different societies view or have viewed children. We will address the questions of whether childhood is a socially constructed entity; how children become functioning adults in their culture; and how adults' beliefs about children affect the ways children areor are not-taught, disciplined, spoken to, and given freedom. Frequently our focus will be on American childhoods. Students will gain significant practice in public speaking (formal and informal), academic writing, critical thinking, and research methods. Casler CNX 255. Why We Hate. Why have groups of people targeted other groups of people for hatred, discrimination, and persecution throughout human history? In this course we will use multiple disciplinary perspectives to begin to answer this fundamental question. We will look at a number of historical examples of group hatred; examine some of the root causes of these hatreds; explore modern examples of Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing, and research and analyze Hate groups in contemporary America. Hoffman CNX 257. Europe-America:(Mis)perception.</p><p>Drawing from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, this course will examine European-American relations and (mis)perceptions with special attention to how historic patterns and experiences shape contemporary transatlantic discourses. Analysis of tropes of racism, civilization, and democracy will frame investigations of revolution, war, and cultural exchange designed to hone liberal arts skills of critical thinking, engaged reading, effective writing, research, information literacy, and thoughtful self-expression. Mitchell CNX 258. Object Lessons.</p><p>What can we learn from things? From family heirlooms to commodities to stolen goods-the objects filling this world importantly shape our individual and collective identities. We explore this proposition by developing the fundamental skills of close reading and careful looking, and through individual research projects on the exhibitions and collections of F&amp;M's Phillips Museum of Art. Focusing on connections between objects, collectors, anthropologists, immigrants, thieves, historians and others, students learn to "read" the tangible, exploring the many stories that objects yield. Aleci CNX 259. Elusive Justice. Justice issues dominate our news. Dictators arrest dissidents on trumped up charges, police kill unarmed citizens, victims of civil war are treated like outcasts. Is justice really so hard to achieve? If it is, why? Doesn't the fact that we seek justice foreshadow a better society? This course examines four thinkers who grappled with these questions from philosophical, religious, and political perspectives. Exploring their ideas helps students develop skills in argumentation, concise writing, and doing scholarly research. Whiteside CNX 263. Materials and Humanity. Diamond, gold, copper, glass, iron, and clay: Materials like these have played a key role in the success of the human enterprise from the Paleolithic to the present. This CNX seminar will explore the properties and utilization of different materials that have influenced human history and underpin modern society. Through reading, writing, and experimentation, we'll explore materials from multiple perspectives to understand how humans have exploited materials to innovate and advance technology and society. As part of this process, students will conduct a research project on a specific material that will culminate in a final report. C. Williams CNX 265. U.S. in the World, 1914-19. "Study of the years 1914-1919 will show how the Great War affected the lives of people and nations on every continent. The war involved soldiers and nurses as well as people on the home front. After the war debates raged about the shape of the peace. How would the aggressors pay for the war, and would the age of imperialism end? The course draws on wartime fiction, film, poems, diaries, paintings, and postwar monuments. Assignments will teach students the process of research, including finding authorities and primary sources and preparation of a coherent, purposeful narrative. Stevenson CNX 269. Psychology and Religion. What can psychology teach us about religion? The course begins with important 19th century philosophers and psychologists, turns to Freud and other psychoanalytic thinkers on religion, and concludes with a contemporary attempt to fuse psychodynamic theory with evolutionary psychology to develop a modern scientific psychology of religion. The course work is geared toward learning skills for doing academic research and combining them in a final research paper on a religious phenomenon of choice analyzed in light of psychological theories. Cooper CNX 271. Islam in North America. This course will introduce students to the history of Islam and Muslims in North America, and to the contribution of Muslims to the religious, cultural, and political life of the United States and Canada. Particular attention will be paid to the experience and contribution of African American Muslims, a fascinating narrative and topic that often gets left out of discussions on the interaction of race and religion in the region. A key goal of this course will be to highlight the diversity of the Muslim American Community and the challenges it has faced overtime. This course will focus on the development of student skills in close reading, writing, class discussion, and library research. The course will be scaffolded by a semester long research project on the themes of the course. Tareen CNX 281. Unequal America.</p><p>Since the Declaration of Independence, the United States has celebrated 'equality' as a founding principle. But there are striking inconsistencies between the value of equality and the actual conditions of social, economic, and democratic life. The central question posed by this course is: What are the implications of inequality for American democracy today? As we examine the nation's uneven landscape of class and civic status, students will sharpen their academic skills of synthesizing information and writing a critical research paper. Wilson CNX 291. The Shape of Space.</p><p>Although the earth has finite area, one could walk forever and never reach an edge. The same may be true for our universe (finite volume with no edges). We will learn about the mathematical possibilities for the shape of space and about the early cosmos. We will then connect the two through a program that may uncover the exact shape of our universe. The course will culminate in individual research projects that build on skills developed in CNX1. In these projects, students will further explore the math, the cosmology, and the connections between them, sharing their findings both orally and in writing. Nimershiem NSP 112. The Nature of Oceans. The Nature of Oceans will investigate the questions: what constitutes acceptable evidence in science and how do we make rational decisions about issues that affect shared natural resources? You will confront these questions through a series of case studies of current uses of ocean resources. Throughout the course you will explore the physiology of marine animals as well as the biology of diverse ocean communities and ecosystems. Thompson NSP 117. Women/Science. This course will introduce students to the role of women in science both as participants in the creation of scientific knowledge, and as the subjects of biological study of the female body. Topics will include sexual development, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause, as well as education and professional achievement in the sciences. Students will examine the contributions of women scientists through the lens of feminism, with an emphasis on the barriers women have faced historically and those that remain today. Same as WGS 117. Blair NSP 118. Water, Life and Society. This course examines the history, development, management, and policy issues associated with one of the most remarkable substances on Earth, water. The storage and flow of water in the natural world are explored to provide a basis for considering how people have rerouted water since the development of agriculture. The association between civilization and the construction of dams and irrigation projects is explored using case studies that include water conflicts and shortages from around the world. As population and consumption grow and water becomes increasingly scarce and/or polluted, water management and policy become more complex. Merritts NSP 119. Biology and Social Constructs. This course will introduce students to the fundamental biological processes of inheritance and sex determination in living organisms and examine the interplay of these concepts in our (mis)understanding of two social constructs commonly attributed to a biological basis: gender and race. Topics will include diversity of sexual mating systems, mechanisms of sex determination, concepts of genetic transmission and ancestry, pedigree analysis and human population genetics. Students will critically evaluate studies that apply and extend these concepts and their intersection with social constructs.  <ref type="bibr">of Scientific Revolutions (1970)</ref>, we survey numerous episodes in the development of the sciences, from the seventeenth century to the present. Using case studies from chemistry, physics, life sciences, and the interdisciplinary field of origin of life studies, we try to determine what it would mean for a scientific revolution to occur, would happen, and how to assess whether such a thing might be underway currently. The course in many ways serves as a broad introduction to history and sociology of science. Strick NSP 137. History of Space and Time. This course traces the development of views on space and time, from classical Greece to the modern theory of pace and time, relativity. Students will gain a conceptual understanding of relativity as well as use algebra to work out detailed problems. We will discuss some of the revolutionary aspects of relativity such as black holes, the warping of space, time travel and the big bang. We will explore the philosophical implications of relativity, how our modern view of space and time has changed our view of the world and how it has influenced society, literature and art. Stubbins NSP 138. Lakes as Sentinels.</p><p>Lakes are considered to be sentinels of environmental change because they respond rapidly to meteorological conditions and are closely linked to the surrounding catchment. The course will focus on basic physics, chemistry, and biology of lakes, as well as the importance of freshwater to humankind. Hands-on experiences in the field and laboratory will be emphasized. Fischer NSP 149. Life on Mars. Is, or was, there life on Mars? What about in our Solar System or galaxy? These intriguing questions will be addressed by examining the origins and evolution of Mars, and by comparing Mars to the geological and biological evolution of the Earth. From Lowell's observations in the 1890's to exciting new discoveries by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix Lander and the European Space Agency's Mars Express missions, our understanding of the red planet is increasing, but many questions remain. Perhaps human exploration of Mars will provide the answers and at the same time increase our appreciation of the uniqueness of planet Earth.</p><p>A. de Wet NSP 157. History of Natural History.</p><p>In this course, we'll cover briefly the history of man's fascination with Nature, from cave paintings to Ancient Philosophers to New World Explorers and beyond. The history of Natural History reflects very closely the evolution of the scientific method: with advances in philosophical and empirical approaches to interpret their observations, naturalists developed into scientists. The rigor of the scientific method can be understood when current forms of natural history are examined. From the development of ecology as a scientific discipline to the popularization of nature shows, a rigorous examination of natural history will allow students to visualize the different levels of data collection, analysis, confidence and uncertainty. As we learn from the past, students will start their own Naturalist journals as a way to appreciate nature and to develop a keen appetite and respect for the complex structure of our environment. We'll include a visit to the museum of natural history in Philadelphia, as well as Naturalist-oriented trips to the Millport Conservancy and other locations for exploration and inspiration.</p><p>Mena-Ali NSP 163. Environment: Science and Policy. The objective of this Science in Perspective course is to explore fundamental questions such as: What is scientific inquiry? What role should science play in determining environmental policy? This course is designed to foster an appreciation of the scientific method that is rooted in experimental measurement and quantitative uncertainty. Given relevant historical precedents such as the US Acid Rain Program and the UN Montreal Protocol, the issue of climate change will be examined from scientific, economic, political, and ethical perspectives. Leber NSP 168. Food, Plants and Nutrition.</p><p>As the world population continues to increase, how do we feed the world's people? Who are the world's hungry and why? Can food be grown in a sustainable way? Is organic, local food production really better? What is the impact of livestock on the environment? Are genetically-modified crops the answer to world hunger, or do they threaten the ecosystem? Is there really a global epidemic of obesity? This course will examine concerns about food and nutrition that influence our lives as individuals and as members of local, national, and global communities. Rice NSP 185. Impact of Reproductive Technology. This course will examine how reproductive technology has altered the way humans create and view family. Advances in medicine and manufacturing in the past century have produced unprecedented levels of control in preventing or producing offspring. What are the modern ways to make a baby? How have these options altered our views of family planning and parenting? What is the effect on the legal, social, and spiritual standing of the child (or potential child)? How does the impact of modern reproductive practices vary with different religions and cultures? Moore NSP 210. Genetically Modified Organisms. This course is designed for students not intending to major in the natural sciences, and is divided into classroom and laboratory components (there is no additional lab time). Topics discussed will include the origins and history of GMOs, their present uses in agriculture, industry and biomedicine, current controversies surrounding GMOs, and potential future applications of GM technology. A key focus of the course will be the use, misuse and selective disregard of evidence in the application of scientific research to policy considerations. Concurrently in the laboratory students will learn the techniques necessary to identify GMOs in food, and create their own (harmless) GMOs. Fields</p></div>

Coral Reefs in Time and Space.</head><p>This course addresses the history of reefs back through geologic time, and looks to the future in light of ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and coastal development. High rates of anthropomorphic change, from overfishing to global warming, threaten coral reefs in ways unprecedented in Earth's history and this course offers a view of how interconnected global systems affect this important marine community. We examine interactions and connections between geological, biological, physical and chemical systems as they determine reef composition and stability. We discuss the role of reefs in popular culture, from the discovery of these "cities below the sea", to modern resorts and eco-tourism, and how reefs are expressed in the visual arts for the public good and private goals.

Some writers and scholars question the identity of a region of so many diverse languages, races, ethnicities, religions, and nations. At the same time, others argue for the coherence of a region marked by a history of European colonization and slavery. This course will focus on anglophone (English-language) Caribbean literature of the twentieth century, a rich and varied body of work that has recently produced two Nobel Prize winners, Derek Walcott and V.S. Naipaul. In this course, we will explore how this literature grapples with issues of race, gender, nationalism, independence, decolonization, the ethics of violence, the importance of vernacular expression, and the formation of a literary tradition.

The Declaration of Independence, the founding narrative of American selfhood and agency, provides the discursive background of the course. The Declaration did not mention Slavery, thereby erasing Slaves' experiences in the American narrative about peoplehood. We will engage the logic, rhetoric and contradictions of the document by pluralizing "declaration" to broaden and then examine how Slaves' oral narratives (the Spirituals, etc.) and texts (by Phyllis Wheatley, Oladuah Equaino, etc.) were figurative and literal declarations of independence that simultaneously question the Declaration's principles and ideology and affirm its transcendent meanings in the writers' discourses on Slavery, Black humanity and selfhood, race, the American Dream, etc. Same as AMS/ENG/WGS 256.

Unlike traditional majors, American Studies asks students to combine and cross disciplines in their study of American culture, past and present. American Studies explores the core narratives of the United States as well as the diversity of American social and cultural life. The American Studies Department teaches students to read critically, to articulate ideas clearly, to conduct research and to write effectively. It expects students to develop these abilities within an interdisciplinary curricular framework that requires them to encounter diverse peoples, types of cultural expression and patterns of social interaction. Students are involved in research and internship opportunities in the local community as well as in more traditional scholarship. The American Studies Department is committed to the advancement of these goals through effective teaching and active scholarship by its faculty. American Studies prepares students for a wide range of careers, including education, museums, media and public relations.</p><p>A major in American Studies consists of 11 courses: AMS 100, AMS 350 and AMS 489; one class in global AMS-AMS 136, AMS 323 or an approved topics course; a thematic concentration of three courses, to be approved by the student's AMS adviser by the fall of the junior year; and four AMS electives or other courses from the list of approved courses. Of these four electives, one course must be in American arts and literature and five courses in the major must be at or above the 300 level.</p><p>The writing requirement in the American Studies major is met by completion of the normal courses required to complete the major. Majors intending to enter graduate or professional studies should see the chairperson for particular courses necessary or desirable to prepare for advanced study. Other courses, such as foreign languages and/or quantitative skills, may be required for students wishing to pursue graduate work.</p><p>Majors in American Studies have studied abroad in the following programs in recent years: Advanced Studies in England, Bath; </p></div>

This class explores the tendency to identify, and the desire to eradicate, national enemies-both imaginary and real. Course units include the McCarthy Era, the Kennedy assassination, the Vietnam war, 9/11 and the war on terror. We will try to understand the varied sources of American paranoia and explore the truth of the old adage "Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean that they aren't out to get you." This course will engage in hip hop's "politics of authenticity" while also offering a primer on the participation and contributions of a variety of transnational, sexual, gender, and racial/ethnic constituents. Rightfully centering and honoring the genre's Afro-diasporic influences, we will examine debates involving transnationalism, gender, sexual, and racial boundaries in hip hop. We will also explore hip hop's global relevance, such as its sonic and cultural presence in reggaetón and its spread as a global dance form. Overall, this class will prompt students to untangle hip hop's seemingly contradictory ethos of "keeping it real" while simultaneously promoting broader ideals of cosmopolitanism and global commodification.

Although the focus of such knowledge is the entirety of the human experience, students of anthropology apply their comparative perspective to reflect upon their own lives, beliefs and taken-for-granted assumptions. In this sense, anthropology provides a strong foundation for "the examined life," a Socratic ideal that is one of the founding inspirations of the liberal arts.</p><p>Anthropology, the study of humanity, is unique among academic disciplines in being simultaneously a social science, a natural science and one of the humanities. As one noted anthropologist has remarked: "Anthropology is the most scientific of the humanities and the most humanistic of the sciences."</p><p>Although it is true that many anthropologists spend much of their time studying and writing about the "small picture"-a remote village, a single archaeological site, a particular mythit is also true that the discipline is concerned with the biggest, most general, picture. General questions about the "natural" roles of parents, the meaning of work, the function of ritual and the origins of inequality are typically anthropological. All anthropologists, no matter what their theoretical persuasions or topical specializations, affirm the value of holism, viewing all aspects of human thought and action as interrelated. This holistic outlook is perfectly consistent with the nature and goals of liberal education in the modern world. Not only does the anthropology major provide a strong background in critical thinking, analysis and writing, but the anthropology graduate also generally comes away with a broad appreciation for global diversity and a deep sympathy for our fellow humans.</p><p>The Franklin &amp; Marshall Anthropology major seeks to balance the learning of factual content, theoretical analysis and actual empirical research in either cultural anthropology or archaeology. Our majors learn about anthropology, but they also experience what it means to do anthropology.</p><p>A major in Anthropology consists of 10 courses: 100, 102, 200; one culture-area course; two 300-level courses; 410 (for those mainly interested in social anthropology) or 411 (for those mainly interested in archaeology); and three electives. We also encourage our majors to expand the projects begun in their Methods course (410 or 411) into full-scale Independent Studies projects based upon original field research. Students should discuss research opportunities with their departmental advisers prior to the spring semester of their junior year. The writing requirement in the Anthropology major is met by completion of the normal courses required to complete the major.</p></div>

A survey of world prehistory from the earliest hominids through the rise of the first "civilizations" to expose the range of variation in past human social and political organization. Provides a global and comparative approach to better understand and appreciate this diversity.</p><p>As we learn about the messages and lessons that archaeology has to offer, we should begin to think critically about our own society and reflect on the possibilities for its improvement.</p></div>

This class is designed to introduce students to the cultural production of the region between North Africa and West Asia, between the Atlantic and Central Asia, commonly known as the Middle East. The course begins with the study of colonial approaches to the region and ends with a consideration of recent work that defines the Middle East anew by emphasizing the religious, commercial, and political networks that have historically connected urban and rural locations in regionally definitive way. By moving between primary source documents and scholarly analysis in class discussions and written course assignments, students will learn to be ethnographers and thereby sharpen their own critical interpretive abilities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOPICS COURSES EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED IN 2019-2020</head><p>The making of art, and the study of its visual traditions, takes place at the intersection of culture, material and digital practices, and history. The Department of Art and Art History affirms the centrality of the visual and material to a liberal arts education. Thus we engage students in the processes of art making and in the historical analysis of art and architecture as the gateway to larger endeavors of knowledge: considering such issues as personal and public life, religious and secular practices, political activism and cultural power, the local and global, and transformations of visual experience over time.</p><p>The Department of Art and Art History provides the flexibility for students to design a concentration in Studio Art, Art History, or a focused combination of the two. Our coursework encourages students to make creative, innovative connections across disciplines. Classes are taught in a diverse range of spaces, from the classroom and the studio to museums and field sites. Art and Art History students benefit from an array of campus resources, including interdisciplinary programs, international programs, and digital initiatives. Through our partnership with the Phillips Museum of Art, senior majors in Studio Art have the chance to learn how to design and exhibit their work, while Art History students have hands-on curatorial opportunities and exposure to a wide-ranging collection. The city of Lancaster offers a rich urban environment for our architectural courses, as well as abundant resources for archival study and local history. Franklin &amp; Marshall's proximity to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and New York allows students to have access to some of the most important collections of art in the country; the department schedules regular field trips to these collections.</p><p>We anchor our department mission in the ideals of a liberal arts education, and our program establishes a sound foundation for a range of professional paths. Our majors have successfully undertaken advanced study at excellent graduate programs in art history, studio art, and architecture. Our majors develop habits of mind and innovative approaches to considering intellectual and visual problems that enable them to embark on diverse careers. Department alumni have developed successful careers as museum professionals, conservators, preservation professionals, and appraisers. They work as web and graphic designers, restaurateurs, and as cutting-edge fashion and video-game designers. They practice as architects, lawyers, and doctors. Because we pride ourselves in training students in ways that emphasize the interdisciplinary, the local and the global, as well as a commitment to community, we anticipate that our future alumni will forge careers in areas that we have yet to imagine.</p><p>Students who major or minor in art elect either an art history or a studio concentration. The major consists of 11 courses in either of two possible combinations, as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDIO ART</head><p>Eleven courses are required for the studio art major:</p><p>Seven core courses are required: One introductory course in drawing, ART 114; One introductory course in sculpture, ART 116; One course in photography, ART 142 (can be satisfied with ART 242); One introductory course in 2-D design, ART 112; One art history survey, ART 103 One painting course, ART 222;</p><p>The advanced seminar in studio art practices, ART 462, one full credit.</p><p>In addition, students will work closely with their major advisers to choose four electives with which they can deepen their study in art history, create an area of special focus within studio art, or investigate courses of interest. Of these four electives, two are 200-level courses in studio, film, or art history; the other two are 300-level studio courses. Faculty advisers will help students construct a coherent cluster of courses for the area of special focus; this thematic cluster should be approved by advisers in the fall of students' junior year. Advisers may approve courses in other departments as part of this cluster. Some possible areas of focus include: advanced painting; advanced sculpture; design and the environment; architecture/ urbanism; and technology and image-making.</p><p>All studio art majors are required to present their work in the Senior Exhibition at the Phillips Museum. Preparation for the exhibition, guided and evaluated by Art major advisers and the professor teaching the ART 462 Studio Capstone course, includes a non-credit portfolio review in the fall semester and the required capstone course in the spring.</p><p>The writing requirement for majors concentrating in studio art is met by earning a minimum of "C" in ART 103, or in one seminar offered by the department.  <ref type="bibr">(ART 241,</ref><ref type="bibr">243,</ref><ref type="bibr">or 251)</ref>; ART 461, the advanced seminar in art history.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="211.">Islamic Art and Architecture. (A) (NW)</head><p>Islamic civilization is both global and regional. Spanning across three continents and fourteen centuries, it offers many interpretive challenges to western viewers, who have traditionally confined Islam to an outsider status. Growing out of the same cultural roots as medieval Europe, the art and architecture of Islam developed its own vocabulary, aesthetics and religious concerns. This chronological survey pays particular attention to the cross-cultural dimensions of Islam. We study the creative products of various caliphates but also contemplate the role that Islamic art and architecture has played in the construction of the West's self-identity. No previous familiarity with Islamic civilization is required.

Prerequisite: Permission of the chairperson. Behavior is manifest in the function of neurons, the cells that comprise the nervous system. The networks of a few to many million neurons that underlie the simple and complex behaviors exhibited by humans and animals are shaped by biological, environmental, ecological, evolutionary, social and psychological influences. To develop an understanding of the complex interactions among these factors that generate normal and abnormal behavioral states, critical thinking, reading and writing skills across disciplinary boundaries are required. The Biological Foundations of Behavior Program is offered jointly by the departments of Biology and Psychology. It presents students the opportunity to complete an interdisciplinary major with a focus on either animal behavior or neuroscience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ART HISTORY TOPICS COURSES EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED IN 2019-2020</head><p>Neuroscience is an integrative discipline that utilizes knowledge and tools from biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and psychology to study the nervous system across several levels of analysis from molecules to the behavior of individual organisms. Despite the amazing advances that have been made in neuroscience to date, the human brain is a frontier that we've only begun to chart. Understanding how it works, how to protect it from disease and how to fix it when it becomes damaged or diseased is one of humankind's greatest challenges.</p><p>Animal Behavior-Behavior is a fundamental property of all living things. Indeed, whether animals survive and reproduce often depends on how they behave. Studying individual variation in behavior can reveal the role of natural selection in shaping behavior. Comparative research with many species provides animal models for studying development, sensation, perception, life history evolution, reproductive behavior, learning and cognition as well as providing a broader context for better understanding the influences affecting human behavior and the mind. In addition, studying how individuals behave in response to varying environmental conditions can help predict effects of climate change and the fate of populations. Conservation efforts and resource management depend upon ecological and evolutionary studies of the relationship between animal behavior and the environment.</p><p>The Neuroscience and the Animal Behavior majors begin with core courses in biology, chemistry, physics and/or mathematics, that create a solid foundation upon which to begin the researchintensive coursework that follows. Following cornerstone courses at the introductory level in neuroscience and biopsychology, Neuroscience students choose elective courses in neuroscience and related areas. After foundational, researchintensive training in animal behavior, Animal Behavior students select from a series of core and elective courses in animal behavior. The Neuroscience and the Animal Behavior majors each culminate with capstone research experiences, typically through independent study, that may be defended for honors in the major during the senior year.</p><p>A major in Neuroscience requires the completion of 15 courses: To be considered for honors in BFB, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College's general requirements for honors, must possess a cumulative GPA in the major of 3.33 or greater and complete no less than two semesters of independent research in neuroscience or animal behavior. Normally, prospective honors students will enroll in two semesters of BFB 490.</p><p>The writing requirement in the Biological Foundations of Behavior major is met by completion of the normal courses required to complete the major.</p><p>The indication as to when a course will be offered is based on the best projection of the BFB Program Committee and the departments of Biology and Psychology and is subject to change. </p></div>

(N)</head><p>Behavioral ecology is an integrative discipline that synthesizes ecology, evolution and physiology into the study of the origin and persistence of behaviors. We will study the fitness consequences of behavior, with particular attention to the study of adaptation, sexual selection, evolutionary tradeoffs and constraints and life histories. We will examine the interplay between proximate control and ultimate consequences of behavior. The course will focus heavily on peer-reviewed literature. Prerequisites: BIO 110 and permission of instructor. Same as BIO 337. Ardia</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="341.">Neurochemistry. (N)</head><p>An introduction to neurochemistry focusing on cellular and membrane neurochemistry, intercellular and intracellular signaling and neuronal and whole-brain metabolism, with student-driven special topics in development, disease and/or behavior. Current research in these areas will be emphasized through student seminars. The study of biology furnishes insights into our species, our selves and the world of which we are a part. We humans have a fascination for other organisms and the very phenomenon of life. Biology provides us the tools to address questions ranging from how these organisms function at the molecular level to how they interact at the ecological level. Biology is an exciting, expanding discipline offering a broad and advancing frontier between the known and the undiscovered, with a variety of sub-disciplines that span the molecular to organismal to ecological levels of understanding. It is a gateway to diverse and satisfying careers and it provides insights and ways of thinking critical to each individual in society.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall's biology program, with required and elective courses in biology as well as courses in mathematics, chemistry and physics, provides students with a firm scientific foundation and enough flexibility to accommodate individual interests. The range of these interests is reflected in the many paths biology majors follow after graduation, with or without further education. The central goal of the Biology curriculum is to provide students with the essential research and analytical thinking skills needed by practicing biologists and, indeed, by all citizens in a democratic society. Critical reading of journal articles is an important feature of courses. Beginning in introductory courses, laboratory activities often involve student-designed investigative projects. In more advanced courses, students have access to sophisticated instruments and may spend the entire semester conducting a research project. In addition to learning to design, conduct, and analyze scientific research, students learn essential communication skills as they convey their results in written, spoken, and poster form. These activities lead many students to intensive research experiences during the summer or academic year, under the mentorship of faculty members. A major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology includes five biology courses <ref type="bibr">(BIO 110,</ref><ref type="bibr">220,</ref><ref type="bibr">230,</ref><ref type="bibr">305 and 334)</ref>, six chemistry courses <ref type="bibr">(CHM 111,</ref><ref type="bibr">112,</ref><ref type="bibr">211,</ref><ref type="bibr">212,</ref><ref type="bibr">321 and 451)</ref> and two electives from Biology and/or Chemistry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSEWORK REQUIRED FOR A MAJOR IN CLASSICS</head><p>Classical Languages and Literatures: 11 courses distributed as follows:</p><p>8 courses in Greek and Latin (at least 2 courses must be taken in each language, i.e. to 201 or above depending on point of placement, and 2 courses must be at the 300 level) 2 courses from two of the three subject areas of History <ref type="bibr">(CLS 113,</ref><ref type="bibr">114)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="231.">Ancient Laughter. (H)</head><p>This course is an introduction to the comic traditions of Greece and Rome. Students will become familiar with the characteristics, development, and social interests of comic literature; additionally, considerable emphasis will be on the analysis of organizing themes and the literary quality of these works through close readings and discussion. Same as LIT 231. Biles, O'Bryhim</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="241.">Ancient Medicine. (H)</head><p>This course is an introduction to the origins and development of Western medicine in Ancient Greece and Rome. Students will read from the sources of the ancient theories and practices of medicine, including epic literature, pre-Hippocratic texts, the Hippocratic corpus, and a number of works by Galen, widely considered the most accomplished medical researcher in antiquity. These texts will be complemented by selections of texts by the PreSocratics, Plato, and Aristotle that reflect a reciprocal borrowing of vocabulary, argumentation, and diagnostic methodologies between the developing "art of healing" and various classical philosophical texts. All readings will be in English. Same as STS 241. Fowler</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="242.">Gender and Sexuality in Antiquity. (H)</head><p>The aim of this course is to explore the cultural constructions of gender and sexuality in the ancient societies of Greece and Rome. We will approach questions such as the status of women and the context of misogyny, the societal role of same-sex relations, the presentation and visualization of sexuality, desire and the body. We will examine archaeological, visual and literary evidence through assigned reading and class discussion. This interdisciplinary approach will allow us to gain an understanding of gender and sexuality in antiquity and will offer insights into the shaping of our own cultural and personal attitudes. Same as WGS 242. Meyers</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="321.">Selected Studies in Greek History. (S)</head><p>A close examination of a particular period, place or individual in ancient Greek history. Seminar topics include "Alexander the Great" and "5thcentury Athens. Additional faculty not on the program committee also contribute to this program.</p><p>The minor in Comparative Literary Studies investigates the development of literature in an international and historical context. In this program, students study foundational works of literature from a variety of historical periods and national traditions in order to understand the diverse ways in which literary processes unfold in different social milieus and the interrelationships among different literary traditions. The study of genres, periods and themes across diverse cultures promotes "liberal education" in its truest sense, by enabling students to see beyond the parochial constraints of any single literary tradition.</p><p>Since antiquity, humanity has produced literary documents that serve as a repository of knowledge and wisdom, offering us the opportunity to reflect on the human experience. In addition to inspiring, literature enables us to see the ways in which other cultures are like our own, since we can discern in their literatures basic commonalities of form and theme that ground and sustain all peoples from otherwise diverse cultural, aesthetic and linguistic backgrounds.</p><p>The study of literary works offers a rich field of study for scholars from a broad range of academic disciplines. Because literature has always served as both outlet and inspiration for artists, historians (and makers of history), social thinkers and musicians, understanding literature prepares students in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences to participate actively in the global exchange of ideas.</p><p>A minor in Comparative Literary Studies consists of six courses. One of these is the required core course, LIT 101 Introduction to Comparative Literary Studies. The other five are electives; at least two of these must be at the 200 level or higher.</p><p>A list of regularly offered courses follows. Please note the key for the following abbreviations: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="220.">The World of the Novel. (H)</head><p>Since the time of its rise as a cultural force in the eighteenth century, the novel has changed our sense of reality and ourselves. It became a form that has reshaped the literary universe. Readings in this course will include works by Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, Fedor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Willa Cather, and Vladimir Nabokov. Staff</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="315.">Introduction to Literary Theory. (H)</head><p>As Jonathan Culler states, "Theory offers not a set of solutions but the prospect of further thought. It calls for commitment to the work of reading, of challenging presuppositions, of questioning the assumptions on which you proceed." Students in this course will be introduced to theoretical schools and concepts that shape the study of literature and the practice of literary analysis. The study of computer science includes, but is not limited to, computer programming. We learn how to solve problems by creating, implementing, and analyzing algorithms, and study how computers are organized, how they carry out their operations, how they store and transmit information, and how we control and interact with them.</p><p>Computer science has rich overlaps with a wide variety of fields, in terms of both shared skills and paradigms and interdisciplinary synergies, with particularly clear connections to mathematics, natural and physical sciences, philosophy, psychology, and the language arts. The computer is now deeply embedded in our culture and society, which means that its use and abuse are cultural and social concerns. A minor in Computer Science consists of six courses: CPS 111 and 112, and four other CPS courses, including at least one at the 300-level that is not cross-listed with another department or discipline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOPICS COURSES EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED IN 2019-2020</head><p>Information Retrieval. Our home the Earth is a complex, dynamic system. It changes from day to day and from year to year, from one ice age to the next and from eon to eon, in many different ways. Some changes are cyclical, others are quite unpredictable. We need to understand these processes, especially as they are increasingly affected by human action. They influence our habitat, to which we must continually adapt. They control the treasury of resources, rich but finite, on which we rely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT</head><p>Study of the Earth draws on all traditional disciplines. Geoscientists interpret field observations and lab data using principles of chemistry, physics and concepts unique to geology. They link processes that operate within and at the surface of the Earth. Environmental scientists focus on the impact of human action, on ways in which Earth systems respond when they are disrupted. These scientists evaluate and solve a wide range of technological problems. Environmental managers and policy-makers address the same issues in their cultural, economic and political contexts. As we learn how the Earth works, we must develop the means and the political will to manage it appropriately.</p><p>At Franklin &amp; Marshall, three majors are available to students who wish to explore these concerns: Geosciences, Environmental Sciences and Environmental Studies. Each major has its own core of introductory courses, but there is sufficient overlap among them so that students can embark on this field without immediately choosing one major or another. Later, students take more specialized courses in geosciences, mid-level courses in several sciences, or courses in environmental policy and its cultural, historical context. Each major program includes advanced courses, opportunities to engage in research with members of the faculty and an integrative capstone course. Many opportunities and significant financial support are available for students to study in the field, in their courses, on extracurricular field trips, through a variety of research programs and while studying abroad.</p><p>The scope of opportunities open to graduates of this program is very broad. Many own or are employed by businesses engaged in environmental consulting, management of water resources, environmental law and the energy industry (renewables, oil, gas and coal). Others are teaching in high schools, colleges and universities, or working in various branches of the federal government. But, this is a liberal arts program. It has served as a good launching pad for systems analysts and financiers, for veterinarians, writers and realtors and for at least one composer of classical music.</p><p>A major in Geosciences consists of 12 courses: ENE 110 or 114, followed by <ref type="bibr">ENE 221,</ref><ref type="bibr">226,</ref><ref type="bibr">231,</ref><ref type="bibr">321,</ref><ref type="bibr">324,</ref><ref type="bibr">353,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 480</ref>. ENE 353 can be taken during the summer after the sophomore or junior year. Students select one additional course above the 100-level from the Geosciences offerings. Students are also required to take the following cognate courses: CHM 111, MAT 109, and PHY 111. Students planning to pursue graduate studies or professional employment in geosciences should take as many courses as possible from the following: MAT 110, 111 and 229; PHY 112; and CHM 112. The writing requirement in the Geosciences major is met by the completion of ENE 480.</p><p>A minor in Geosciences consists of six courses, including one course selected from ENE 110 or 114, followed by ENE 221 and four Geosciences courses at the 200, 300 or 400 level selected in consultation with the department chair. A minor should focus upon a particular area of the geosciences such as surficial processes, paleobiology, geophysics, tectonics, petrology/geochemistry. No more than three courses from the student's major can also count towards the Geosciences minor.</p><p>A major in Environmental Science consists of 15 courses: ten core science courses from the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and ENE, including 2 courses from one department, 3 courses from the second department, and 5 courses from the third department, plus two quantitative and/or field skills courses, two environment and society courses and one upperlevel integrative seminar.

The experience of an Earth nowhere untouched by humans finds expression in all genres of literature and generates unfamiliar and compelling new ways of conceiving our species and our world. Readings include science fiction, realist fiction, poetry, non-fiction and theory. It is recommended that students complete at least one college-level literature or environmental studies course before enrolling. Same as ENG 362. Mueller</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECONOMICS</head><p>the allocation of scarce resources among competing uses; a society's social relations of production, distribution and consumption; the institutions through which humans have organized their material provisioning.</p><p>In line with these varied definitions, the study of economics can be pursued using a mathematical approach, a historical approach, or an institutional and sociological approach. Independently of the particular definition to which they are attracted, well-educated economics students will have familiarity with, and be able to draw on, all three approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accordingly, the economics curriculum at Franklin &amp; Marshall</head><p>College provides students with opportunities to study the discipline across the variety of approaches and/or to pursue depth in any approach. The sequence of introductory courses exposes students to both orthodox and heterodox themes and approaches, while the sequence of intermediate level courses emphasizes the core analytical techniques used in different approaches to theoretical and empirical analysis. Electives offer students the opportunity to undertake further exploration of theoretical issues and/or applications of fundamental economic theories to topics of special interest.</p><p>The study of economics encompasses a wide variety of models and topics that attempt to explain various social phenomena, including the operation of markets, the distribution of income and wealth, macroeconomic fluctuations, economic growth, international economic relations, the roles of class, culture, gender and race, and the ecological impacts of economic activity. Moreover, a good liberal arts economics education will involve students in interdisciplinary explorations. Economics majors are therefore encouraged to enroll in courses in other departments and interdisciplinary programs such as history, anthropology, government, women, gender and sexuality studies, earth and environment, Africana studies, and public health. Economics majors and minors are also encouraged to pursue opportunities to study abroad, where they are likely to deepen their understanding of the cultural context and nature of economic life. Economics majors have studied abroad in many countries, including: The writing requirement is met by completion of the normal courses required to complete the economics major.</p><p>Students who are contemplating graduate work in economics are strongly advised to undertake adequate preparation in mathematics-normally MAT 109, 110 and 111 (Calculus I, II, III), MAT 216 and 316 (Probability and Statistics I, II) and MAT 229 (Linear Algebra and Differential Equations).</p><p>To be considered for honors in economics, graduating seniors must meet the following conditions:</p><p>complete independent research during the senior year that results in a high caliber thesis deemed to be deserving of "honors" by an appropriately composed Honors Committee;</p><p>have an economics GPA of at least 3.5 and an overall GPA of at least 3.0 at the beginning of the honors project and at the time of graduation;</p><p>complete <ref type="bibr">ECO 200,</ref><ref type="bibr">201,</ref><ref type="bibr">203,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 210</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="354.">Behavioral Economics. (S)</head><p>The objective of the course is to expose students to the positive (descriptive) side of microeconomic theory, and behavioral economics in particular. Much microeconomic theory is fundamentally normative (prescriptive) in that it answers the question: What SHOULD a decision maker do in a particular situation? Positive economics generally seeks instead to answer the question: What WILL a decision maker do in a particular situation? The course teaches students how these two approaches relate to one another using examples from microeconomic theory. Prerequisite: ECO200. Roomets</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="381.">Postcolonial Perspectives on Development. (S)</head><p>A seminar on the question of economic development from the perspectives of formerly colonized societies, which are today described as 'less developed' or 'third world' countries. The English major at Franklin &amp; Marshall offers students a choice between two complementary tracks, one emphasizing literary study, the other creative writing. We require majors in either track to have some experience in both areas. Studying literature and practicing creative writing develop in us obvious skills-skills of reading, writing, analysis, creativity and critical thinking-but they also enable us to engage with the rich diversity of human experience.</p><p>Since we cannot separate language or literature from their cultural and intellectual contexts, the literature component of the English major at Franklin &amp; Marshall offers a substantial historical base, with core courses on topics in the traditional periods of British and American literature. Additionally, students take thematic courses in subjects like "Caribbean Literature," "Nature and Literature," "Graphic Novel," "African Literature," and "Baseball in American Literature and Culture," as well as upper-level seminars in authors or topics that build on the historical core.</p><p>The track in creative writing joins the passion for language and imaginative writing with the study of literature. It is built upon the premise that reading widely and deeply in literature, including contemporary literature, is essential to becoming a skilled creative writer: in other words, that the best writers are also avid, engaged readers. Students who choose a concentration in creative writing practice the craft of writing poetry, fiction and nonfiction in workshop settings where writing is valued as a serious art form. The major culminates in an advanced creative writing workshop in which students complete creative theses in the genre of their choice. The creative writing major is a gateway to a lifelong love and appreciation of words.</p><p>Literature majors also take at least one course in creative writing. All students, through their own attempts to write creatively, can develop an appreciation for how the great works they study in their literature courses might have been created. English majors in both tracks come to appreciate the rigor that both disciplines-literary criticism and creative writing-entail.</p><p>English majors have rich research opportunities beyond the requirements of the major through independent study and Hackman summer research scholarships, which engage students with the scholarly activities of their professors. They also have opportunities for involvement in a range of extra-curricular activities: attending readings by and meeting numerous visiting writers, participating in events at the Writers House, helping to plan the Emerging Writers Festival, or writing for or staffing one of the College's literary publications.</p><p>English majors are highly valued for their abilities to think and write. The study of English is not just good preparation for a career, however. It fosters an engagement with the big questions of living-questions about language, meaning and value. It fosters self-reflection and greater awareness of the natural and social worlds in which we live. Moreover, studying English literature gives us a purchase on how narratives and metaphors work so that we can interpret and deploy them wisely and even re-make them for our own time, with its enormous challenges and demands.</p><p>A major in English with a concentration in Literature consists of the following eleven courses, at least two of which must be literature courses at the 300-level: ENG 226; two Pre-1800 literature courses <ref type="bibr">(ENG 201,</ref><ref type="bibr">202,</ref><ref type="bibr">203,</ref><ref type="bibr">206,</ref><ref type="bibr">212,</ref><ref type="bibr">256,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 200</ref>-and 300-level courses designated as Pre-1800); two Post-1800 literature courses <ref type="bibr">(ENG 204,</ref><ref type="bibr">207,</ref><ref type="bibr">208,</ref><ref type="bibr">210,</ref><ref type="bibr">257,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 200</ref>-and 300-level courses designated as Post-1800); one course designated either Pre-or Post-1800; one creative writing course <ref type="bibr">(ENG 225,</ref><ref type="bibr">381,</ref><ref type="bibr">382,</ref><ref type="bibr">383,</ref><ref type="bibr">384)</ref>; two electives; and two 400-level seminars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="226.">Engaging Literary Texts: Introduction to Literary Study. (H)</head><p>What are some of the ways that works of literature engage us, and in turn how can we learn to engage in various ways with literary texts: their words on the page, their imagined communities, their invented characters? How can learning about and practicing different interpretive approaches incite our readerly pleasures as well as our understanding and excitement about a work of literature's complexity of language and form, its aesthetics, and its power both to represent and transform lives and times and places. Goeglein, Huber, Jaros, Mongia The Renaissance humanist has become symbolic of the many monumental achievements of the early modern European period: the discovery of the New World, the rediscovery of classical texts, the invention of the printing press, the reformation of the Western Church, and the formulation of a recognizable English language. We will take as our subject the Renaissance humanist and try to figure out just who this character was …and how s/he was figured in the literary and dramatic texts of William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, and John Donne as well as Thomas More, John Milton, and Queen Elizabeth I herself. (Pre-1800) Goeglein</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="203.">Eighteenth Century British Literature. (H)</head><p>A period of enormous social, intellectual and political revolution, the socalled long eighteenth century in Britain (1660-1800) calls into question age-old assumptions about the nature of humanity. From the sex comedies of the Restoration to the satires of Jonathan Swift, the treatises of Mary Astell, the novels of Daniel Defoe and Frances Burney, the neoclassical poetry of Alexander Pope and the lyric poetry of Thomas Gray, literature of the eighteenth century engages in debates about gender, slavery, social class, human nature and our place in the cosmos. Social, intellectual and literary developments of the age still shape our modern world and our understanding of what it means to be a human being. (Pre-1800) Mueller</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="206.">American Literature I: Insiders and Outsiders in Early American Literature. (H)</head><p>This course draws on a diverse body of writing stretching from Euro-American contact to the early years of the United States. The texts we'll read are gathered around the problem of belonging: distinguishing insiders and outsiders, considering what is at stake in making this distinction, and exploring what happens when the distinction breaks down. They range from sermons and political pamphlets-texts that may not immediately strike you as literary-to novels, lyric poems, and a play. In these texts, questions of belonging appear in the familiar categories of class, race, gender, and nationality as well as registers from religion (who are God's elect?) to aesthetics (which genres count as literature?). (Pre-1800) Jaros</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="212.">Sex, Lies, Shakespeare, and U. (H)</head><p>This course provides a general introduction to Shakespeare's language and dramatic literature: we will read comedies, tragedies, and histories; discuss text; analyze film adaptations; consider Shakespeare's relationship to modern culture; and attend a live performance. Meets pre-1800 English major requirement. (Pre-1800) Goeglein</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="256.">African American Literature I: Declarations of Independence and the Narratives of Slavery (H)</head><p>This course covers African American narratives of slavery from the colonial period through the early 19th Century. The Declaration of Independence, the founding narrative of American selfhood and agency, provides the discursive background of the course. The Declaration did not mention Slavery, thereby erasing Slaves' experiences in the American narrative about peoplehood. We will engage the logic, rhetoric and contradictions of the document by pluralizing "declaration" to broaden and then examine how Slaves' oral narratives (the Spirituals, etc.) and texts (by Phyllis Wheatley, Oladuah Equaino, etc.) were figurative and literal declarations of independence that simultaneously question the Declaration›s principles and ideology and affirm its transcendent meanings in the writers' discourses on Slavery, Black humanity and selfhood, race, the American Dream, etc. (Pre-1800).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="352.">Madonnas, Mothers, &amp; Virgins: Medieval Religious Women. (H)</head><p>This course will examine a range of texts written about, for, andespecially-by women, and will attempt to unravel how gender and religion reflect and shape one another from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries. We will look at early saints' lives and spiritual guides written for a female audiences, letters written by women theologians, hagiographic romances, miracle plays, and narratives of female spiritual revelation. Meets pre-1800 requirement in the English major. (Pre-1800).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="363.">Reading Characters in the Atlantic World. (H)</head><p>Texts from the eighteenth-century Atlantic world raise a number of related questions: What constitutes individual character: reputation? personal particularity? the body or face? Can one "read" a person like a book? How can printed texts both depict character and contribute to its formation? And why did readers and writers in early America and the broader Atlantic world find these questions so important? Through genres including drama, didactic sentimental fiction, gothic romance, and memoir, we'll expand and unsettle the way we understand both "reading" and "character. Comprising a broad survey of twentieth-and early twenty-first-century science fiction, our readings will include 4 novels and numerous works of short fiction. Although science fiction has its roots much earlier in literary history, we'll begin in the so-called "Golden Age" of science fiction (beginning in the '30's), then move through the "New Wave" that begins in the '60's, Cyberpunk and more. Mueller</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="164.">Fictions of Adolescence. (H)</head><p>This course explores the idea of adolescence through narrative fiction. How does narrative define and construct the adolescent experience through time? Attention will be paid to issues of gender as well. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="229.">Writing and Community. (H)</head><p>This Community-Based Learning course will give students the opportunity to both experience and reflect upon the role of the creative writer-as-educator-and-or-arts-activist. In class we will engage in exercises designed to increase our understanding of writing as both craft and practice. Students will produce significant written work for the course, including poems, fiction, and essays, journal entries, lesson plans, and a final essay and portfolio. They will also work in teams to lead creative writing workshops in the Lancaster community. Sherin Wright</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="231.">Women Writers I. (H)</head><p>A study of the experiences of women as presented in selected British and American literature from the Middle Ages through the 19th century, as presented from a variety of cultural perspectives. We will consider various readings of the texts, including those that emphasize feminist theory and historical context. Among others, we will be reading Jane Austen, Aphra Behn, Anne Bradstreet, the Brontës, George Eliot and Mary Wollstonecraft. Same as WGS 231. Hartman</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="233.">Women Writers II. (H)</head><p>A study of the changing world of American and British women in the 20th century as portrayed by women writers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="250.">Contemporary American Short Story. (H)</head><p>An examination of the current state of American short fiction. We will read, discuss, and write about arguably important short stories, most published within the past 25 years, in an attempt to explore some of the predominant concerns and formal innovations of today's short story writers. We will not consider these writers in a vacuum but rather in the context of those writers who have preceded them. Our discussions will focus on the formation of the notion of heroism, and examine various stages in the development of concepts of heroism in western culture, and the cultural fantasies that accompany it. Above all, epic and romance concern themselves with the process and problematics of self-definition, that of the individual and of the community as a whole. The course addresses the following questions: How was reading used as a method of unifying culture in secular communities? In what ways did these narratives affirm and/or challenge societal rules? How does this literature treat figures of the nation and the king? The conventions of gender? Same as LIT 253. Huber</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="258.">Contemporary Science Writing. (H)</head><p>In this course, we will examine texts ranging from popular science to science fiction, by scientists and nonscientists alike. As readers, we will be interested in the ways people write about science, and, as writers, we will try to put some of these principles into practice. We will be equally interested in the ethical, social, and philosophical questions that contemporary science raises, and in how to probe these questions in writing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="265.">Contemporary Graphic Novel. (H)</head><p>In this course, we will develop an historical, aesthetic and formal understanding of contemporary graphic fiction.

Yet when a work blatantly makes a play for our feelings, we dismiss it as sentimental or manipulative. This course explores the literary and cultural history underlying these intuitions. By tracing the interwoven histories of the novel, emotion, aesthetics, gender, and the self in eighteenth-and early nineteenthcentury transatlantic literary culture, it examines the changing relationship between feeling and fiction.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1757-1827)</ref>, satirists who stand at opposite ends of the eighteenth century. Blake-radical revolutionary and visionary-addresses some of the same questions that so concern the far more conservative Swift. Though each man would likely have found the other intolerable (given vast political, social, religious, artistic and personal differences), both effectively translate into art a profound rage about what Edward Said calls "schemes for projecting power on nature, on human beings, and on history." Among our chief objectives in our study of Swift will be to understand and enjoy the radical play of irony that characterizes his satire. We will examine both Blake's visual art and his poetry, though with emphasis on the latter. Mueller</p></div>

We will examine Morrison's oeuvre in both fiction and criticism, and explore how her aesthetics and vision, and her analyses of them, are informed by historical contexts and their racial, sexual, gendered, class, etc. impulses. Permission of the instructor required. Same as AFS/WGS 462. Bernard</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="463.">Arthurian Legends. (H)</head><p>This seminar intensively examines the cultural history of the Arthur myth through the Middle Ages and contemporary literature and popular culture. Readings will begin with some of the Celtic background to the legends of King Arthur, and will then address the history of the romance narrative tradition in the writings of Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chrétien de Troyes, and Thomas Malory. We will also consider ways that the Arthurian tradition has been revised and revisited in more recent contexts, from the poetry of Alfred Lord Tennyson, to novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King, to films like Boorman's Excalibur and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Huber</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="467.">Virginia Woolf. (H)</head><p>In her essay "Modern Fiction," Virginia Woolf wrote, "let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness." This proposition reflects Woolf's turn from realism to a modernist style devoted to interiority, impressionism, wordplay, and what she called "breaking the sentence and the sequence." At the same time, Woolf, an ardent feminist, wrote compellingly about the politics and culture of the early twentieth century. This course will consider Woolf's major works alongside excerpts from the letters and diaries, charting her formal innovations as well as her social critiques. Through an examination of literary criticism, we will explore the main tendencies in Woolf studies from the 1970s to the present day. Same as WGS 467. Abravanel</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="489.">Shakespeare Out of Time. (H)</head><p>In this seminar, we will deliberately study Shakespeare, his poems, and his plays out of their historical context and put them in other "out of order" time-frames. In other words, we will read anachronistically. This happens often in performances and film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays: think Henry 5 on WWI battlefields or As You Like It in 19th-century Japan. Other performances try to reconstruct the conditions of "the Shakespearean stage," with hose, doublets, and saucy wenches. A problem with this kind of performance/reading practice is that we spectators/readers aren't really living in the English Renaissance: think no electronic devices, no democracy, and no (respected) diversity. The study of French opens the door to diverse cultures around the globe, from France itself to other French-speaking countries and regions in Europe, North and West Africa, Quebec, the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific and Indian Oceans. French provides useful links to many parts of the world and to many areas of the liberal arts curriculum. Students interested in the arts, in government and business, in public health, environmental studies and international studies across the disciplines, benefit from the practical skills, the cultural knowledge and awareness and the intellectual connections that studying French can provide. . Two of these courses may be taken abroad. All joint majors, in consultation with their adviser, will also create and present a portfolio of their work in French. This presentation will take place during the student's final semester, before a group of department members and other French majors.</p><p>Most of our majors and minors spend a semester or year abroad. We strongly recommend this immersion experience to all of our students, believing that travel alone is not enough to learn about other cultures. Only by living, working, relaxing and even dreaming in French will students acquire an advanced command of the language and a fuller appreciation of French and Francophone culture. This course will focus on both the process and the product of writing in French. Analysis of model texts, targeted grammar review, and advanced stylistic practice will help students develop the skills necessary to accomplish a variety of writing tasks (description, letter, portrait, narration, summary, essay). Peer and self-editing techniques will help students learn to revise their own work. In addition, a common theme (different each semester) will provide material for discussion and inspiration for written assignments. Prerequisite: FRN 202 or placement or permission of instructor. Staff 261. Lire, Analyser, Critiquer. (H) This course introduces students to different types of French and Francophone texts. We begin by learning reading strategies and the techniques used in literary and textual analysis, then we learn to produce written and oral analyses of these texts using the forms common to French literary analysis. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify principal characteristics of major genres, write analytical commentaries on prose and poetry, and will be prepared to read unfamiliar French texts critically.

We will read works of literature, essays, art criticism, and personal correspondence in order to better understand these artistic women and society's perception of and reaction to women as "artists" in the past and the present. We will compare how women and men are portrayed in works written by male and female authors of the same time period in order to determine how myth and reality intersect in works of literature. Included will be works by Laclos, Elizabeth Vigée LeBrun, Baudelaire, Colette, Rykiel, and Simone de Beauvoir. Prerequisite: FRN 261 or placement.</p><p>Yetter-Vassot</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="368.">French Fashion as a Reflection of French Culture. (H)</head><p>French fashion is a cultural, historical, and literary phenomenon which can be interpreted in many ways. In this course, we will study the evolution of French fashion and the French system of haute couture. We will also explore fashion such as it is represented in literature across the centuries, reading Zola's Au Bonheur de Dames, Colette's Gigi, and Les chiffons du rêve, a collection of short stories written by the granddaughter of a famous French designer. We will also look at several theories on the interpretation and meaning of fashion; fashion marketing in the 21st century; and the special relationship between France, the French and the importance of being "à la mode. The study of German provides the broadening of linguistic and cultural awareness that accompanies the learning of any foreign language. In addition, knowledge of the German language and culture offers advantages in a wide range of fields. Germany plays a central role in the European Union, and a quarter of the population of the EU speaks German as a native language. Germany is the world's fourth largest exporter, one of the top three nations in research and development of high-tech and green products, and a leader in industrial, architectural, and automotive design. German is one of the top three languages used on the internet, and Germany is a leader in global book and film production. Our majors have entered fields as diverse as teaching, law, business and medicine and have used their mastery of the language to work in German-speaking countries. Students from other disciplines have taken courses in German for personal enrichment, for graduate school qualification, or for preparation in research or study in a German-speaking country.</p><p>From the first semester on, the German curriculum at Franklin &amp; Marshall integrates German language learning with a broad knowledge and in-depth understanding of cultural production within German-speaking Europe. Students practice their oral communication skills in a variety of settings, including classroom discussions, informal conversations, and formal presentations. Over the course of the curriculum, students acquire advanced writing skills in German in multiple genres, including short argumentative and interpretive essays, journalistic texts, and personal writing in the form of journals and letters.</p><p>German courses at all levels are organized around themes that provide students with an overview of German </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="464.">Depictions of Women in German Literature</head><p>Freud famously asked "What do women want?" This is a question that authors of texts featuring female characters have sought time and again to answer, and their responses naturally vary widely. In this course, we focus on depictions of female characters in German-language plays, films, and prose works from across two centuries. The unifying theme of the course is the relationship of gender to sex, violence, and power, a theme that we will analyze through close readings, examination of the socio-historical context in which the work arose, and through the lens of feminist literary criticism.

(H)</head><p>This course takes as its focus the rich tradition of fairy tales and legends that Germany has famously contributed to world literature, with a nod to the ballads that were part of its folk tradition. The course begins with a consideration of some (deceptively simple) folktales of the Brothers Grimm, organized by type. This is followed by two well-known "literary fairy tales," i.e. stories "invented" by known authors at known times. The latter part of the course is devoted to ballads and legends, principally the legend of the Nibelungen and that of Faust. Prerequisite: GER 302. Staff</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOPICS COURSES EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED IN 2019-2020</head><p>The mission of the International Studies Program is to unite a cohort of students who, both individually and in collaboration, will broaden the experience of their various major programs as they develop international perspectives and immerse themselves in the languages and cultures of non-Englishspeaking countries. The program prepares students for future study, careers and life in the increasingly unbordered community of the 21st century. The International Studies Program offers two minors: one in International Studies and one in Area Studies. Students may also choose a joint major with International Studies, or earn a concentration.</p><p>A minor in International Studies requires that a student take (1) take IST 200, typically in the first or sophomore year;</p><p>(2) propose a coherent program of four specific courses (of which no more than two can overlap with courses in the major) focusing on a particular geographical or topical theme;</p><p>(3) study for at least one semester outside the United States in a non-English-speaking environment, including (where feasible) doing coursework or research in the local language; (4) achieve an approved level of proficiency in a foreign language (normally marked by successful completion of a course at the 300 level); and (5) complete IST 489. In addition, while not required, an international internship is highly recommended.</p><p>A joint major in International Studies requires that a student: (1) take IST 200, typically in the first or sophomore year;</p><p>(2) propose a coherent program of six elective courses focusing on a particular geographical or topical theme, one of which must be numbered 300 or above, and which may include courses taken abroad with the approval of the program chair;</p><p>(3) study for at least one semester outside the United States in a non-English-speaking environment, including (where feasible) doing coursework or research in the local language; (4) achieve a level of proficiency in a foreign language (normally marked by successful completion of a course at the 300 level); and (5) complete IST 489. Joint majors are strongly encouraged to include GOV 130, ANT 100 and ECO 100 or 103 among their electives A minor in Area Studies requires that a student take six courses on a given geographrequires that a student take six courses on a given geographical area, of which at least two must be at the 300 level or above, selected in consultation with a faculty member specializing in that area. The Chair of the International Studies Program will refer interested students to an appropriate adviser, with whom the student will develop a list of appropriate courses. The minor declaration form must include signatures of chairpersons of departments offering the courses included in a student's program and the signature of the Chair of the International Studies Program. Topics for which there is no existing minor housed in a regular department or program are appropriate for this minor, which would take its name from the geographical area of its emphasis, for example, African, Chinese, European Union, Francophone, Iberian, Japanese, Middle Eastern or Latin American Studies. An Area Studies minor could include courses in a language other than English, although ordinarily no more than four will be foreign language courses. IST 200 and 489 could be a part of this minor, but are not required. Study abroad and language proficiency are strongly recommended but not required.</p><p>In addition to the minor, the International Studies Program offers a concentration. Requirements for the concentration are the same as for the International Studies minor except that the concentration requires only two courses in addition to IST 200 and IST 489. These two courses can be either inside or outside the student's major and are expected to cohere with and bring a significant international dimension to the student's chosen major.  </p></div>

The course provides a brief overview of the region's history and a discussion of some of the key issues shaping the region's politics, including: authoritarianism and democracy; development and dependency;</p><p>and revolution. The rest of the course will be dedicated to a survey of the politics of several countries from different areas of Latin Students who choose to study Italian at Franklin and Marshall immerse themselves in the rich humanistic tradition of Italian culture and reflect critically on Italy's unique position in global society. Those who earn a major or minor in Italian attain proficiency in the language and gain a solid knowledge of Italy's contributions to literature, cinema, the arts, and politics. Engaging in humanistic inquiry for its own sake, students of Italian learn to excel in critical analysis, creative thinking and effective written and oral communication, with the added cognitive and practical benefits of immersion in a foreign language. They thus become creative interpreters of Italian culture while acquiring core skills that are easily transferable to any number of other areas. Students who complete a major or minor in Italian will have built a foundation for life-long learning and success in any 21st-century career.</p><p>Italy is conceived broadly and dynamically in this program, as a space shaped by global forces and the circulation of objects, people, and ideas across borders. Italian at F&amp;M is typically pursued as a four-year course of study in which students take one course in the program during each semester they are on campus and also study abroad with F&amp;M's six-week summer program in Tuscany and/or for a semester or a full year at an approved program in Padua, Milan, Florence, Perugia or elsewhere.</p><p>On campus, small classes allow students to work closely with faculty in an informal atmosphere that encourages the pursuit of individual intellectual interests and learning. Courses are conducted in Italian from the introductory levels, and students are encouraged to practice the language outside of class through a variety of co-and extra-curricular opportunities.</p><p>The Italian Minor and Major prepare students for any number of future careers. In some cases, these include research and teaching in the humanities and social sciences: in History, Classics, History of Art, Comparative Literature, Urban Studies, Film Studies, Architecture, or other areas. Italian, on its own or as part of a double or joint major, may also serve as an excellent foundation for a wide range of post-graduate professional programs, including, for example, those in public or business administration, law, or the healing arts. Recent graduates of the Department have pursued careers in education and research, government and diplomatic service, travel and tourism, music and art.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Italian Major</head><p>The Italian Department offers a major with two distinct tracks, one in Italian and one in Italian Studies.</p><p>The Italian track involves all coursework in the Italian Department, and therefore in the Italian language. This track offers the greatest opportunity for refining, using, and being exposed to the language as a cultural form shaped by its political, historical, literary, artistic, and social contexts.</p><p>The Italian Studies track allows students to take two courses for the major outside of the Department. In these two courses, taught in English, students approach Italian history and culture through the lenses of specific humanistic fields: Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, History, or Music.</p><p>The Italian track consists of the following ten courses: ITA201, ITA202, ITA310, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>A study abroad experience in Italy is integral to the learning goals of the Italian Major and Minor and is strongly encouraged. Studying in Italy offers the opportunity to practice and strengthen linguistic competence, contextualizes language learning in the evolving social realities of Italy, develops students' cross-cultural competencies, and constitutes an occasion for self-reflection and self-awareness in the face of cultural difference. Franklin &amp; Marshall has its own immersion summer study abroad program in Tuscany, offering courses in Italian language and culture, advanced courses in literature, and independent studies, which are fully integrated with the on-campus curriculum (see Summer Travel Courses for information about coursework).

The cultural lens is provided by literary and cinematic works by At Franklin &amp; Marshall, the Japanese program offers students the opportunity to develop communicative skills in Japanese. We emphasize the authentic use of the language rather than mere knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. We also host weekly tea hours in which various cultural aspects are introduced, as well as Japan-related lectures and events.</p><p>We introduce contemporary Japanese language within the appropriate cultural context, so students also gain the requisite awareness and skills that will enable them to function appropriately and successfully in modern Japanese society. Considers distinct case studies drawn from several continents to show that some see being indigenous today as politically potent, while others take this category to be excessively vague or, even, invented; by focusing on ordinary lives and extraordinary struggles, we explore the wide variety of relationships to territory that "indigenous" encapsulates.

(NW) (S) (WH)</head><p>This course will examine the intersections of human history and culture with environmental change in Latin America from the early colonial period to the present. The major themes include the consequences and significance of the Colombian Exchange, the roles of religion and culture in shaping human relationships with nature, the development of exportled agriculture, urbanization, and the emergence of diverse environmental movements within Latin America. We will explore the origins of major environmental problems and the ways people have responded to these challenges. The course will also address how historian have approached the study of the environment. The Latin American Boom is a phenomenon in the history of literary movements in the 20th Century. In this course we will read some of the canonical pieces by authors that constitute the "boom." In so doing, we will examine the characteristics of the Latin American literary boom. We will read Alejo Carpentier, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garcia Márquez and Mario Varas Llosa, as the four biggest representatives of this movement. Prerequisite: SPA 321. Tisnado</p></div>

Political turmoil of the Southern cone in the 1970s and 80s and in Central America in the 1980s and 90s, however, created generations of exiles that were political prisoners or even desaparecidos, or whose close relatives disappeared or were killed. Some of these exiles are writers who conveyed their experience in their works. In this course we will read poems, short stories, and novels written by these exiles as well as works by authors who have chosen to live abroad for other reasons.

What are language disorders? Is spoken language processed differently from written language? What about sign languages? Class will include discussions, presentations, and hands-on analysis of language data. The study of mathematics is a hallmark of enlightened society, as it has been for millennia. Mathematics helps us understand our world and ourselves, and it is fun.</p><p>Mathematics is one of the oldest of the liberal arts. The study of mathematics has been used for centuries to train students to think clearly and creatively. Mathematical applications enlighten other disciplines and inform society.</p><p>Mathematical thought requires curiosity, creativity, discipline and logic. As students progress through the mathematics curriculum, they are expected to become increasingly adept at developing conjectures, constructing correct proofs and refuting weak ones, creating and using mathematical models to describe physical phenomena, working with abstract structures and clearly communicating results. A student planning to major in Mathematics should take MAT 211 as soon as possible, no later than the first semester of the junior year. A student planning to major in Mathematics and study abroad should complete 211 before going abroad.</p></div>

We also recommend taking courses in Economics and in Business, Organizations, and Society.</p><p>Students planning to enter other fields of applied mathematics should take MAT 323, 329, 337, 338, 339 and 442. Knowledge of probability, statistics and computer science is essential in many areas of applied mathematics.</p><p>A minor in Mathematics may be completed in one of two tracks. The "theoretical math track" consists of MAT 110, 111 and 211; and three courses chosen from <ref type="bibr">MAT 325,</ref><ref type="bibr">330,</ref><ref type="bibr">331,</ref><ref type="bibr">442,</ref><ref type="bibr">445,</ref><ref type="bibr">446</ref> or other theoretical courses as designated by the department. At least one of the three courses must be at the 300-level or beyond.

Each of these areas draws on techniques and perspectives that are a focus in other approaches to music. Musical composition, for example, is not an entirely intuitive process, but makes use of knowledge gained through the study of music theory. Similarly, performance is most profound when it is informed by an understanding of the context for a work's style, and the history of musical style is myopic without taking into account the culture in which a style developed.</p><p>The Music Department offers courses in all of these areas that are open to students with no formal background in music. All of its ensembles are open to the entire student body, and some private lessons are offered at the beginning level; there are also courses in music theory and in music history and culture that are specifically oriented to students with little or no previous background in music. At the same time, there are many offerings for students who have already made music an important element of their lives.</p><p>Many students choose to complete a major or minor in music whether or not they intend to undertake a musical career. Students going to medical school, for example, have often chosen to major in music, knowing that they want a lifelong involvement in music as an avocation. On the other hand, students who have chosen to go to graduate school in music or enter the music industry have found that their preparation through the music major program had prepared them well. Two music minor programs also offer an organization to the study of music that goes beyond a single course or participation in a single ensemble. One elective selected with the approval of the department chair. This elective should be a one-credit course selected from MUS 105, 106, 240, or any course above the 100-level, and may not include studio or ensemble courses.</p></div>

Philosophy has no single topic, but at the same time every part of philosophy is connected with every other in countless ways. It is hard to talk about what there is in the world without also analyzing how we can know about it, so metaphysics and epistemology often overlap. Some claim that without language humans can't know anything, so epistemology and philosophy of language come together. If you want to study why people act the way they do, you'll draw on ethics as well as philosophy of mind; the two merge in moral psychology. And so forth. Philosophy also analyzes the social and historical conditions that make it possible to ask such questions in the first place. Philosophy, therefore, always includes a study of its own history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOPICS COURSES EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED</head><p>The Philosophy program at Franklin &amp; Marshall aims to acquaint students with all of these areas of philosophy by examining the great historical traditions in philosophy as well as a broad range of contemporary issues and topics in philosophy. In addition, students are encouraged to cultivate skills in critical thinking and philosophical argument with the goal of helping them to become participants in the philosophical enterprise. Lower-division courses in the department aim to provide students with a broad background in the history of philosophy and contemporary problems in philosophy, while upper-division courses seek to engage students in discussion concerning cutting edge scholarship in the field. The work of philosophy majors culminates in the senior year when students compose a senior thesis in the context of the Senior Research Seminar. Majors have the further option of expanding senior theses with the goal of presenting the project for departmental honors.</p><p>A major in Philosophy consists of 10 courses.

(H)</head><p>An intensive treatment of some of the major philosophical themes in selected dialogues of Plato The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers two majors: Physics and Astrophysics.</p><p>Physics is the study of how objects interact, move and change. It covers objects as small as sub-atomic particles, such as quarks, to as large as the universe. It is inherently an experimental endeavour. The starting and ending points are the data and observations. From experiments and observations we develop fundamental theories that allow us to explain phenomena as commonplace as the flight of a baseball to as exotic as an electron travelling at a speed close to the speed of light.</p><p>Courses within the department seek to help students develop a deep understanding of fundamental concepts, problem-solving skills, oral and written communication skills, experimental skills and the ability to work independently as well as with others. The skills learned in studying physics translate well to many fields and careers.</p><p>Recent physics majors have gone on to graduate school in physics, astrophysics and engineering, to medical and law school and to careers ranging from teaching to working on Wall Street. To be considered for departmental honors, in addition to meeting the College's general requirements, a graduating senior must have an excellent record in required courses and complete a twosemester independent study project.</p><p>A major in Physics consists of 14 courses: <ref type="bibr">PHY 111,</ref><ref type="bibr">112,</ref><ref type="bibr">223,</ref><ref type="bibr">226,</ref><ref type="bibr">331,</ref><ref type="bibr">333,</ref><ref type="bibr">344,</ref><ref type="bibr">421,</ref><ref type="bibr">432;</ref><ref type="bibr">and either PHY 222 or 224 MAT 109,</ref><ref type="bibr">110,</ref><ref type="bibr">111,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 229</ref>.</p><p>A minor in Physics consists of six courses in the department:</p><p>PHY 111, 112, 223 or an approved substitute; 226; 333; and one additional Physics course above the 100-level.</p><p>The astrophysics major focuses on physical principles as they are applied to the study of the cosmos. The goal is to promote an understanding of a diverse array of extraterrestrial phenomena in terms of the fundamental physics principles on which this understanding is based. These phenomena range from the very small, such as the reactions between sub-atomic particles that power stars, to the very large, including the expansion and evolution of the universe itself. The astrophysics major emphasizes the same understanding of fundamental physical concepts and skills as the physics major and both majors provide the necessary grounding and background for advanced study in the sciences.</p><p>Students interested in a career in astronomy should complete an astrophysics major, or a physics major with a 100-level and at least one 300-level astronomy course as electives. </p></div>

Our courses cover a variety of religious traditions embedded in myth, ritual, art, ethics, doctrine, philosophy, literature, asceticism and other social practices. First and foremost, the study of religion engages the human-the limits of human beings as they have multifariously expressed them: in their audacious explanations of the invisible, the immaterial and the transcendental; in the extremity of their practices and beliefs; in the ordinary ways in which they confront the overwhelming presence of violence, suffering and death; in the emotive terms they provide to explain the significance of the past and the future; and in the constant struggle to come to terms with themselves and others. These activities, whether explicitly identified as religious or not, represent the persistent grappling of human beings with what different cultures throughout world history have articulated as beyond and more than the human. This human engagement with the variously formulated more-than-human Other, this engagement manifesting itself variously in many arenas of cultures, is the object of the academic study of religion. As such, the field demands an interdisciplinary approach drawing on the methodologies native to the humanities and social sciences as well as on the theoretical approaches developed specifically in the study of religion.  </p></div>

This interdisciplinary program deals with the nature of science and technology, the history and philosophy of science and the interaction of science, technology and human society. The program is designed to make it possible for students to link related work in several disciplines, including a methodology course in at least one of those disciplines. The program has its own courses and it draws on courses given in several departments.</p><p>The program offers three distinct minors: History and Philosophy of Science; Science and Society; and Medicine in Society (including study of public health). Each minor is designed to enable students to conceive and pursue individualized programs of interdisciplinary study in these three broad areas, within the field of Science, Technology and Society.</p><p>Each minor will consist of six courses, including: a core course that is introductory to the proposed minor; an appropriate midlevel methodology course; three electives; and a capstone course involving substantial work on an individual project, either as independent study or in an advanced seminar. Each student's proposed minor program must be approved by the chairperson of the STS Program, acting in consultation with the STS Committee.</p><p>The following lists include courses that are appropriate for each minor. These course lists and designations are not exhaustive; other courses may be appropriate. Some courses listed have prerequisites. Students who do not plan to take those prerequisites in fulfilment of other degree requirements, apart from the STS program, may have to take more than six courses to complete one of the STS minors.  </p></div>

Students will navigate scientific literature as well as information available via popular media, evaluate both for veracity and practicality, then share their own conclusions (and new questions arising from this evaluation!) during class discussions and course assignments. Students will also discuss issues related to conducting research, then explore known and/or hypothesized relationships between economic, behavioral, biological, sociopolitical, cultural, and environmental variables and food-related behaviors. Students will design and conduct research centered on food, nutrition, and health. Additional faculty not on the program committee also contribute to this program.</p><p>Scientific and Philosophical Studies of Mind (SPM) seeks to bridge the sciences and the humanities in the study of a common topic: the nature of mind. In order to provide a breadth of perspective as well as depth in an area of special interest, the SPM curriculum divides into two majors: Cognitive Science and Moral Psychology.</p><p>Cognitive science is concerned with how minds fit into the natural world. Nature is mechanistic; could the mind be a machine? Can other animals-or even computers or robotsthink? What is the (neural?) basis for consciousness? How do minds and mental abilities develop as we mature?</p><p>Moral psychology is concerned with what it is for an individual to be a worthwhile and responsible moral agent, and with the psychological processes that lead people to engage in altruistic actions and to evaluate and punish others' behaviors. Can we square our moral assessment of persons with a psychological understanding of the self? What does it take for a life to be significant or meaningful? Are humans primarily motivated toward good or evil? Is a moral sense innate or learned? To what extent do emotion and reason underlie moral judgments and actions?</p><p>Successfully bridging the sciences and humanities so as to answer these questions requires that students gain a broad background in both the content and methodology of philosophy and psychology; the courses in the "Core" of the program aim to provide this background. The needed depth is provided in the majors themselves, in which students further hone their skills of critical thinking and philosophical analysis in the context of the interpretation, assessment and even construction of empirical research. The SPM majors culminate in the Senior Research Seminar, in which students conduct research on a topic that combines both philosophical and scientific approaches to the study of a topic of their choosing. Students may also expand their senior thesis with the goal of presenting the project for departmental honors.</p><p>Each major offered as part of the SPM program consists of 12 courses. Of these, five courses are required as a part of a common core, and six courses are specific to each of the majors, designated below. Of these six courses, three must be in the sciences (at least one at or above the 300-level), and three must be in the humanities (at least one at or above the 300-level). The remaining course can be from either major or from the following list: ANT 330; BIO 330; BIO 343; CPS 222; CPS 337; ECO 350; PHI 213; PHI 217; PHI 381.</p><p>Students intending to major in SPM are encouraged to take one or more of the following courses in their first year: SPM 100, PSY 230. This course involves the student in exploration of some of the basic topics in experimental approaches to social psychology, such as cognitive and motivational perspectives on social phenomena, the role of affect and emotion in social action and current uses of the concept of self. Issues explored in this context include self-affirmation processes, regulation of social action and the relationship between affect, cognition and action. In this course we will study intelligence by focusing on perception and action in the environment. To this end, we will focus on ecological psychology, robotics, artificial neural networks and simulated evolution. Although students will be expected to build simple robots and work with computer models, no background knowledge of engineering or computing will be assumed. (Knowledge of programming is not required.) Prerequisite: PSY 100 or PHI 100 or SPM100. Staff PSY 313. Cognitive Neuroscience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. AREAS OF CONCENTRATION</head><p>Cognitive neuroscience explores the relations between neural systems and cognition. This course will provide both an introduction to some theoretical issues in cognitive neuroscience (e.g. the degree of localization of cognitive faculties), as well as an in-depth look at the neural bases of memory, language and motor control. Of particular interest will be understanding the technologies and techniques of cognitive neuroscience--including direct neural recording; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); magnetic encephalography (MEG); electroencephalography (EEG); and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Prerequisite: PSY 240 or 302 or 305. Staff PSY 314. Child Development in Cultural Context. The purpose of this travel course is to help students recognize and appreciate the impact of culture and social diversity on the development of children. It may also help them to see the reverse: how and when developing members of a culture affect that culture. Through readings, discussion, guest lectures, and local field trips, students will learn about the social-emotional, biological-physical, and cognitive development of children from many world cultures, especially using ecological and cultural-psychological approaches. The class will pay special attention to Danish childrearing culture, taking the Nordic view of what constitutes a "good childhood" as a starting point for many of our discussions of how culture informs development. Prerequisite: SPM 100 or PSY 100 or 101. Casler PSY 450. Cognitive Development.</p><p>In a matter of months, a zygote goes from a collection of cells to a thinking, feeling, learning baby…who quickly goes on to be a walking, talking, problem-solving toddler…who soon after is a reading, writing, sociallyaware child. It's breathtaking! This advanced, discussion-focused seminar explores the foundations of cognitive processes and developmental mechanisms that underpin our fantastic human cognitive growth. As we survey major topics in cognitive development, our focus will be primarily on birth through early childhood, asking the question: How do infants and children make sense of the myriad people, ideas, and objects around them Through course readings, class discussions, problem solving and group work, students will explore the core components of human language; speech sounds, word formation, sentence structure, and meaning. Provides numerous opportunities for students to use theoretical knowledge and apply it to analyzing the structure of other languages. Armstrong, Cox LIN 120. Sociolinguistics. An exploration of the relationship between language, culture and society. Special attention will be paid to language variation (styling and codes, dialects, creoles and pidgins) and language in society (multilingualism, language prejudice, identities). Readings, films, discussions and group work will prepare students for field work. Armstrong, Cox PHI 236. Knowledge and Reality. This class is an advanced, but accessible, introduction to two central branches of philosophy: epistemology and metaphysics. Epistemology, loosely characterized, is the study of knowledge. Metaphysics, even more loosely characterized, is the study of the general features of reality. We'll work through some of the central topics that fall under these two studies. This course will serve as an introduction to descriptive and theoretical approaches to the study of psychopathology. In addition to the study of disease-related processes, special emphasis will be placed upon developing an understanding of those biological, psychological and social conditions that are essential for healthy psychosocial functioning across the life span. Prerequisite: PSY 100 or SPM100 or permission. Offered every Spring. Grant, Penn PSY 309. Social Psychology. This course involves the student in exploration of some of the basic topics in experimental approaches to social psychology, such as cognitive and motivational perspectives on social phenomena, the role of affect and emotion in social action and current uses of the concept of self. Issues explored in this context include self-affirmation processes, regulation of social action and the relationship between affect, cognition and action. Recently many philosophers have argued that certain interpersonal emotions, such as resentment, indignation, guilt, gratitude, and approbation, are fundamental to a host of interconnected issues in ethics, including the nature of respect, dignity, freedom and responsibility, and the origins of moral values. This class will closely examine these claims and arguments with the aim of understanding more clearly how moral psychology and metaethics intersect. Helm</p></div>

Sociology is both a specialized academic discipline and an important part of a liberal education. As a social and cultural science, sociology studies human interaction within and between groups, the forces of interest and meaning that help to shape and reshape that interaction and its consequences for the lives of individuals and social groups. As one of the liberal arts, sociology enriches the study of history, philosophy, science and the arts and assists students in examining their personal lives, professional activities and public issues in a more thoughtful and critical way. In both capacities, and as our graduates attest, the study of sociology can be excellent preparation for a wide range of careers including law, education, business, government service, medicine and social work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOCIOLOGY</head><p>A major in Sociology consists of a total of twelve courses, eight of which are Sociology classes, and four of which are in related social sciences. The eight Sociology courses must include SOC 100, 301, 302 and a 400-level seminar or Independent Study, along with any other four Sociology courses (though see below for recommended classes). Of the additional four courses in related social sciences, two must be in a single department, and one of these must be above the 100 level. Related social sciences include the following: 1) All courses in Anthropology (ANT), Economics (ECO), Government (GOV) and History (HIS); 2) All courses in other departments cross-listed with Anthropology, Economics, Government and History; 3) Courses in Africana Studies (AFS), American Studies (AMS), Judaic Studies (JST), Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) and Science, Technology and Society (STS) that are cross-listed with Anthropology, Economics, Government or History or that have a social science (S) designation; 4) LIN 120 (Sociolinguistics); 5) Selected courses in Business, Organization, and Society (BOS) and Psychology (PSY). Students should consult their adviser in Sociology with questions about the related social science courses.</p><p>Students graduating in the class of 2020 or earlier who are completing a Sociology/Government double major, or a Government major and a Sociology minor, may substitute GOV 250 for SOC 302. However, students electing this option are advised that other requirements remain the same: eight courses in Sociology for a major, and six courses in Sociology for a minor. Thus, Government majors who substitute GOV 250 for SOC 302 will need to take an additional Sociology course to bring their total number of Sociology courses up to eight (for the major) or six (for the minor).</p><p>Starting with students in the Class of 2021, this option will no longer be available. Thus, all students, no matter what their major, will need to take SOC 302 in order to complete a Sociology major or minor.</p><p>SOC 100 is a prerequisite to all other courses in the department. Prerequisites may be waived only by the instructor.</p><p>The writing requirement in the Sociology major is met by completion of the normal courses required to complete the major.</p><p>Although SOC 210 and SOC 220 are not required courses, students contemplating a major in Sociology are encouraged to take these courses early in the major sequence as these subjects are important for upper-level courses. Additionally, we suggest that majors and minors complete SOC 301 (Theory) and SOC 302 (Methods) prior to the start of their senior year where possible, as these classes provide background and skills that are helpful for independent studies and 400-level seminars.</p><p>A minor in Sociology consists of a total of six courses, including SOC 100, 301 and 302, and three other courses selected in consultation with the student's departmental adviser.  </p></div>

The required courses are: SPA 221, 222 and 321. In addition, each student must take one 300 -400-level course in Peninsular Literature and one 300 -400-level course in Latin American Literature, and three other elective courses among the 300-400 level offerings in the department. During their senior year, students must take one additional 400-level Research Seminar. In this final course, students prepare a substantial research project, satisfying upon its completion the writing requirement for the major. All courses for the major should be in Spanish.</p><p>A major in Spanish includes knowledge and analysis of language, literature, and cultures in the Spanish-speaking world, including Spain, Latin America, and the United States. We strive to help students achieve a high degree of proficiency in the language by developing their ability to comprehend, read critically, speak and write in Spanish while developing an appreciation and understanding of Hispanic literature and cultures. Beginning in SPA 101, course work is conducted entirely in the target language, and the student is encouraged to use Spanish beyond the classroom. The department offers Community Based Learning opportunities in the Lancaster Hispanic community that further enhance students' intercultural awareness and competence. In addition, The Spanish Writing Center prepares students to write with precision and detail on a variety of topics and provides those in the upper-division courses with useful resources to hone their writing abilities in Spanish.</p><p>Majors interested in pursuing independent studies should prepare a preliminary proposal addressing the subject to be explored and speak with the faculty member whose line of research best aligns with the proposed topic.</p><p>A minor in Spanish consists of six courses beyond SPA 201. The required courses are SPA 202, 221, 222 and 321; one 300-400-level course; and one 400-level Research Seminar course. All courses for the minor must be in Spanish.</p><p>Majors and minors can also fulfill some requirements during their study abroad experience. The department strongly encourages students to spend a semester or year in a Spanishspeaking country, and approximately 80% of our students do so. Students are advised to have completed SPA 321 before they study abroad. A maximum of three courses will be available for transfer upon approval from the department.

The Declaration of Independence, the founding narrative of American selfhood and agency, provides the discursive background of the course. The Declaration did not mention Slavery, thereby erasing Slaves' experiences in the American narrative about peoplehood. We will engage the logic, rhetoric and contradictions of the document by pluralizing "declaration" to broaden and then examine how Slaves' oral narratives <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="345.">Sociology of Sexuality. (S)</head><p>This course examines the idea that sex is not a natural act; instead, sex and human sexuality are socially constructed. We will examine how power-in a variety of forms-is at play in our social and cultural understandings and experiences of sex and sexuality. We will examine a variety of approaches to the study of sexuality as we consider sex, gender and sexual orientation, sexual relationships, the body, race/ethnicity, the commodification of sex, reproduction and contraception, and sexual violence </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="364.">Sociology of the Family. (S)</head><p>Sociologists argue that the family occupies a contradictory location-as both a very private and public institution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="365.">Queens, Goddesses and Archaeology. (S)</head><p>This course will consider how archaeologists examine gender and interpret the roles of women in ancient subsistence economies, politics and religions. To achieve this goal we will discuss the roles of women in egalitarian and stratified societies and explore the actions and status of both high-ranking and everyday women in the ancient world. Through the analysis of novels and short stories written by Latin American female authors from different countries we will examine the construction of the concept of "Nation" in Latin America and the alternative that the female perspective offers to this construction. We will explore how gender roles have determined the idea of Nation. As part of the analysis, we will study historical and social aspects of the different countries to which the novels refer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="460.">Race, Gender, and Class on Campus. (S)</head><p>On college and university campuses across the country, intersecting social identity politics have come to the fore over the course of recent decades. This course will examine the socio-historical forces and contemporary dynamics that inform, challenge, support, and disrupt the establishment and cultivation of inclusive campus communities. Drawing from sociological literature on higher education, social mobility, race, gender, socioeconomic class, and social policy, students will critically analyze the complex issues germane to how American institutions of higher education operationalize ideas of "diversity" and "inclusion" in the 21st century. Same as AFS/SOC 460. Rondini</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="462.">Toni Morrison. (H)</head><p>This seminar will focus on Toni Morrison as a major African American and American writer. We will examine Morrison's oeuvre in both fiction and criticism, and explore how her aesthetics and vision, and her analyses of them, are informed by historical contexts and their racial, sexual, gendered, class, etc. impulses. Permission of the instructor required. Same as AFS/ENG 462. Bernard</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="467.">Virginia Woolf. (H)</head><p>In her essay "Modern Fiction," Virginia Woolf wrote, "let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness." This proposition reflects Woolf's turn from realism to a modernist style devoted to interiority, impressionism, wordplay, and what she called "breaking the sentence and the sequence." At the same time, Woolf, an ardent feminist, wrote compellingly about the politics and culture of the early twentieth century. This course will consider Woolf's major works alongside excerpts from the letters and diaries, charting her formal innovations as well as her social critiques. Through an examination of literary criticism, we will explore the main tendencies in Woolf studies from the 1970s to the present day. Same as ENG 467. Abravanel</p></div>

Academic advisers guide students as they learn to make decisions about intellectual interests, course selection, a Major and ultimately, the meaning of a liberal arts education. Faculty members from across the curriculum advise incoming students. Faculty in the academic departments advise their majors as well as offer advice to all students about pursuing graduate study in their disciplines. The College views academic advising as a natural extension of the faculty's teaching role, and it is supplemented and supported by Dons and College House Deans, who work within the College House System. Health professions advising and legal professions advising are also available.

CLAS provides an intellectual space for our collective and open-ended consideration of pressing civic challenges, such as increasing democratic participation, the ethics and politics of war and peace, the complex intersection of science and public policy, and the relevance of the liberal arts to society.</p><p>Through our signature programs, lectures, and colloquia, CLAS aims to enrich the curriculum, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and to demonstrate the critical relevance of liberal learning to our lives as citizens in a democracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE FLOYD INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY</head><p>The mission of the Floyd Institute is to improve the quality of public policy through research, training, and constructive interactions between the academic and policy-making communities. The Floyd Institute is a gathering place for faculty, policy makers, students and the public to discuss policy issues via colloquia, conferences, lectures, workshops, and research.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies and Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC HONESTY</head><p>Membership in the Franklin &amp; Marshall community involves obligations of personal and academic integrity, and members of our community are bound by ideals of scholarly conduct and intellectual honesty. We expect our students to be honest and forthright in representing their work and its origins. Adherence to these norms is at the core of our academic mission and is necessary for the educational benefits we seek to convey. Conversely, violations undermine our shared purpose. It is the responsibility of faculty members to explain the importance of academic integrity in their courses. This can include, but is not limited to, providing written expectations of these guidelines in the syllabus and explicit instructions for assignments, e.g., what level of collaboration is acceptable. It is the responsibility of the student to be aware of and abide by the standards set by the faculty member in each course. Ignorance of the standards is not an excuse and intent is not a factor in determining responsibility for misconduct.</p><p>The failure to meet these obligations of personal and academic integrity results in academic misconduct, which includes, but is not limited to, the following.</p><p>1. Unauthorized aid-making use of prohibited materials, study guides, or other assistance in an academic exercise, for example: a. accessing prohibited material during an examination, b. obtaining test questions before an exam is given, c. looking up solutions to homework problems online, d. obtaining the solution to a problem from a classmate, or e. collaborating on work that is assigned individually. 2. Plagiarism-reproducing the work or ideas of others and claiming them as your own, for example: a. claiming authorship of a piece of writing or artwork created by someone else, b. making use of ideas obtained from other sources (including classmates) without clearly acknowledging the source, or c. incorporating verbatim passages or elements from an existing work into one's own work without quotation marks or otherwise clear indication of authorship. 3. Falsifying information-making false statements or fabricating information in an academic exercise, for example: a. inventing data or sources for an assignment, b. lying to obtain an extension or other favorable consideration, or c. submitting work completed in another class for credit without the express permission of the instructor. 4. Unethical interference-interfering with or undermining the work of others to gain unfair advantage, for example: a. inappropriately limiting other students' access to relevant materials, b. tampering with others students' submissions or grades, c. purposely undermining the success of collaborative work, or d. interfering with other students' scholarship by creating inhospitable work conditions. 5. Facilitating misconduct-helping others commit acts of academic misconduct, for example: a. completing another student's work, b. providing a solution or other prohibited material to another student, or c. lying to help another student gain advantage or conceal wrongdoing. When a faculty member suspects that a student is responsible for academic misconduct, the faculty member will refer the case to the Office of Student Affairs for referral to the Student Conduct Committee or administrative action. The student and the faculty member are entitled to a Committee hearing upon request by either party.</p><p>If the student is found to be responsible for academic misconduct, a disciplinary sanction ranging from a warning to expulsion will be assigned. The faculty member, in consultation with the Committee or appropriate administrator, will decide upon a grading penalty up to a failing grade in the course. After receiving a sanction, the student may not elect the Pass/No Pass option in that course. In the case of a student who has already chosen the Pass/No Pass option, the Registrar will rescind that option. If assigned an F in the course, the student cannot withdraw from the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE USE OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS</head><p>The College obeys, and expects its students to obey, Federal copyright laws. These laws generally prohibit the copying without permission of a copyrighted work. That work may be literary, musical, or dramatic; a picture, a sound or video recording, or a computer program or material; or any other original expression fixed in some tangible form. For guidelines governing copyrighted materials, consult the College's Copyright &amp; Fair Use Policy web site at www.fandm.edu/ college-policies/academic/copyright-fair-use-policy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PATENT POLICY OF FRANKLIN &amp; MARSHALL COLLEGE</head><p>The objective of the College patent policy is to facilitate the invention, transfer and application of new technology that promises to be of benefit to the general public and, at the same time, to protect the interests of the inventor and the College. It applies to all employees and students of Franklin &amp; Marshall College.</p><p>A copy of this policy may be obtained by contacting the Office of the Provost or by viewing it at www.fandm.edu/ college-policies/academic/intellectual-property-policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISRUPTIONS OF THE ACADEMIC PROCESS</head><p>All students should be familiar with this policy statement on campus disruptions, adopted by the Faculty in May, 1969:</p><p>1. Franklin &amp; Marshall College is fully committed to the principle that freedom of thought and expression must be assured for all members of the College community, including the freedom to express or demonstrate disagreement and dissent by reasonable and peaceful means. 2. This freedom is a sine qua non of a college. The commitment is hereby reaffirmed. 3. The spirit of this commitment is clear and it should, by common consent, be held inviolate. 4. But the determination of what is orderly and peaceful cannot be left only to those engaged in that action. The College retains the responsibility to state and enforce those determinations. 5. The process of free exploration, examination and evaluation of ideas can survive only in an atmosphere in which every member of the College is guaranteed the right to think, talk and move about freely. When any members of the College, unwittingly or by design, deprive others of these rights, the institution and its academic endeavors are placed in grave jeopardy. 6. Those who deny this freedom to others shall be subject to sanctions by the College and may, after due process, be considered unwelcome as members of the community. 7. The academic process cannot be conducted in an atmosphere tainted by disruption or by the threat of intimidation, coercion, or duress. 8. While the maintenance of the integrity of the academic process is an obligation of all members of the College, there is a clear responsibility imposed upon the faculty to safeguard that integrity and to certify standards of performance of all engaged in the academic life of the College. 9. The College's determinations on such matters are reached through reasoned thought and rational discourse. The College will not condone or tolerate unreasoned or injudicious violations of the spirit of the College or disruptions of the orderly academic process. 10. The College cannot recognize as valid conclusions reached under the imposition or threat of intimidation. 11. It is asserted, therefore, that activities which disrupt the normal academic processes of the College are not only inappropriate but intolerable. Individuals who initiate or engage in such activity shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary procedures or sanctions by the College. Such action shall, of course, provide for appropriate access to fair hearing and due process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMUNICATION WITH STUDENTS</head><p>The College typically communicates with students by the following methods: mail to their home or local address, mail to their campus box, or e-mail to their Franklin &amp; Marshall account. Students are expected to regularly monitor communications to these destinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE COURSE CREDIT SYSTEM</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College uses a course credit system. Thirty-two course credits are required for graduation. A typical course is assigned one course credit, equivalent to four semester hours, though some courses may be assigned more or less than one course credit. Departments may offer half (0.5) credit courses and double (2.0) credit courses. The smallest unit of credit offered at Franklin &amp; Marshall is one-half (0.50).</p><p>The typical one-credit course meets three times per week for 50 minutes, or twice a week for 80 minutes, or once per week for 170 minutes. Courses with laboratories add a threeor four-hour lab to these lecture hours, but they do not carry additional credit.</p><p>Semesters are 13 and 3/5 weeks of classes (vacation periods such as fall break, Thanksgiving break, and spring break excluded), followed by at least two reading days, and then five days in which final examinations are scheduled.</p><p>We recommend that a student should typically spend three hours of out-of-class time for every hour spent in class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS</head><p>To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree, a student must satisfy these requirements:</p><p>1. Complete the online Application to Graduate by the published deadline (in the Fall semester of the student's senior year); 2. Earn 32 course credits (at least 21 of them with standard grades) a. within a time period of (1) twelve <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEGREE AUDITS</head><p>A degree audit is an electronic review of each student's course transcript matched against the College's requirements for a degree. Students may review their degree audits through Inside F&amp;M and become informed about their progress toward the degree at any given time. Faculty advisers also have access to the degree audits of their advisees. While the electronic degree audit is usually accurate, at times the complicated nature of a major or other requirement may lead to inaccuracies. Students are responsible for reporting audit discrepancies to the Registrar. In addition, a discrepancy in the degree audit does not change the actual requirements for graduation; in particular, unfulfilled requirements are not waived because of degree audit discrepancies. The responsibility for understanding and meeting degree requirements rests entirely with the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADUATION RATE</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College, in compliance with the 1990 Federal Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act, publishes the percentage of students who enter the College as new first-year students in the fall and then graduate in six years or less. The six-year graduation rate for the classes who entered as first-year students in the Fall of 2012 was 83%. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLLEGE GRADUATION HONORS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRANTING OF HONORS</head><p>Departmental or program honors are awarded to students who successfully meet the following requirements: 1. Complete an approved outstanding Independent Study project, which entails extensive independent research or creative effort and which culminates in a thesis, a work of art, a recital, or some other performance. 2. Submit the Independent Study project to a specially constituted review board and successfully defend the project in an oral examination of the project and of related work. 3. Complete a significant body of course work of high caliber in the department or program or in related departments or programs. The rule of thumb for a "significant body of course work" in the field or related fields is a minimum of four courses, in addition to the Independent Study project.</p><p>If departments or programs wish to impose stricter guidelines or to waive this minimum, they should submit requests to the Provost and Dean of the Faculty, who may consult the Educational Policy Committee for advice in particular cases. Departments may determine whether a "significant body of course work" is worthy of honors in either of two ways: first, they may determine a minimum grade point average for work in the department beneath which students may not be granted honors; or second, they may meet subsequently to the student's oral defense and vote to determine whether the "significant body of course work" is worthy of honors. Students usually will major or minor in a particular department or program in order to receive honors in it, but need not, provided that they: meet the above requirements; are recommended by the review board to the department or program for honors on the basis of the quality of the project and its defense; and receive the recommendation of the department or program that the supporting course work in the field is of sufficiently high caliber to support the recommendation for honors. The "significant body of course work" of students with a Joint Major will be evaluated by the home department of the adviser of the Independent Study. For students with Special Studies majors, this evaluation will be conducted by the student's primary department (typically the one in which five courses or more are taken).</p><p>The following guidelines are to be observed in Independent Study projects considered for departmental or program honors: 1. As early as possible, the project adviser, in consultation with the advisee and department or program chairperson, should constitute a review board of at least three but no more than five persons, one of whom might well be from another department, program, or institution. Copies of the completed thesis or project should be sent to all members of the review board before the oral examination.</p><p>2. The adviser should establish procedures for the oral defense with the examiners, specifying, for example, whether the student will make a brief opening statement, how much time will be allotted to each examiner and in what manner, etc. The adviser is responsible for briefing the student on these procedures well in advance of the defense. 3. The defense should last at least one, but no more than two hours. Artistic performances will, of course, vary in length. The defense should be open to any interested observers, with the knowledge of the student, and its time and location should be published in advance of the meeting. 4. To allow the student and examiners maximum freedom, the adviser should not enter into the defense unless specifically asked to do so, and should not feel obligated to be present for all the deliberations of the review board. 5. After the oral examination, the review board members alone should, after discussion, vote by secret ballot on the thesis and its defense. They are asked to determine whether the thesis and its defense warrant a recommendation of "Honors" or "No Honors," as one part of the department's or program's evaluation of candidates for honors. The chairperson of the review board should notify the department or program chairperson in writing of the board's recommendation. 6. The recommendation to the Provost and Dean of the Faculty for departmental or program honors will consist of: a. The written recommendation to the department or program chairperson by the chairperson of the review board concerning "Honors" or "No Honors" on the basis of the project and its defense, and; b. The evaluation by the department or program chairperson concerning the caliber of a significant body of course work in the field. Both recommendations must be made at the "Honors" level for students to receive departmental or program honors. 7. The project adviser alone is responsible for assigning the final grade for the Independent Study project and for reporting that grade to the Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERDISCIPLINARY HONORS</head><p>A student who earns "Honors" on an interdisciplinary project may be granted "Interdisciplinary Honors" if each department meets separately and each grants "Honors" based on a significant body of work in its own discrete department. In that instance, the transcript will read "Interdisciplinary Honors: Dept 1/ Dept 2."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHHOLDING AND REVOCATION OF DEGREES</head><p>1. A student who is subject to a pending disciplinary case is not eligible to receive a degree or participate in graduation until that case is resolved. 2. The College reserves the right to withhold a degree and/or graduation participation if warranted by circumstances such as the discovery of serious violation of the College's policy on Academic Honesty. 3. The College also reserves the right to revoke an already granted degree if circumstances such as the above warrant. 4. An eligible student with any unpaid College bills may participate in the graduation ceremony but will not receive a diploma. The College reserves the right not to release official transcripts until all bills are paid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMENCEMENT</head><p>The annual Commencement ceremony is held at the end of each spring semester and recognizes students who received degrees the preceding summer and winter as well as those students receiving degrees on the day of the ceremony. Degrees are conferred three times each year: at the annual Commencement ceremony following the spring semester, at the end of August, and at the end of January. Students who receive degrees in August or January will receive their diplomas by mail and will be listed in the Commencement program the following spring. Students who receive degrees at the end of the spring term may receive their diplomas at the Commencement ceremony. Those who elect not to attend should notify the Registrar and indicate their preferred mailing address in writing in order to receive their diploma. Attendance at the ceremony is not required. Seniors who are close to completion of graduation requirements by the end of the spring semester may apply with the Registrar's Office to participate in Commencement ceremony without receiving a diploma if they:</p><p>1. Have a 2.00 or higher major grade point average, a 2.00 or higher cumulative grade point average and the approval of their major department; 2. Are in overall good standing at the College (this includes disciplinary matters); 3. Are able to complete all graduation requirements by satisfactorily completing not more than two (2) additional course credits; 4. Submit a workable plan to complete all graduation requirements as soon as possible and no later than the August 31 following Commencement. In extraordinary circumstances, students may request an exception. If such a request is approved, students will not be permitted to participate in extra-curricular activities, including intercollegiate sports, subsequent to the Commencement in which they participate; This policy is administered by the Associate Registrar. Exceptions to these requirements are rarely made. If a student feels that an extraordinary situation is present, he or she may present the case, in a written petition, to the Committee on Academic Status for special permission to participate. No further appeals are possible.</p><p>Qualified students may participate fully as seniors in all Commencement exercises. Their names will be listed in the Commencement program with a notation "degree requirements to be completed."</p><p>These students will receive their diplomas on the degree conferral date following completion of all requirements but will not be listed in future Commencement programs. For alumni programs purposes, such students will be considered members of the class of their choice. Additional information may be obtained from the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HONORS LIST AND DEAN'S LIST</head><p>A student whose grade point average for the preceding semester is 3.70 or better is placed on the Honors List. A student who attains an average of 3.25 or better is placed on the Dean's List. In both cases, to be eligible, the student must have satisfactorily completed three course credits in courses for which the standard grading option was utilized. (In addition, there may be no grade below "C-," where "NP" grades are considered to be below "C-.") Each year, resident members of the Chapter meet to review students' credentials and elect new members, predominantly seniors, plus a few highly exceptional juniors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HONOR SOCIETIES AND SIMILAR RECOGNITION</head><p>The Society seeks students with outstanding records and good character who have developed the qualities of mind that are the aim of a liberal, humane education and approach their studies with intellectual curiosity in pursuit of a comprehensive understanding of the natural and social worlds.</p><p>Evaluation of candidates is based on various indicators of the intellectual spirit, including but not limited to high grades, the opinions of professors and professional staff familiar with candidates' achievements, participation in upper-level classes, independent research, competency in areas such as quantitative analytical skills and foreign languages and sparing use of the Withdrawal and Pass/No Pass options. Students should normally have completed either coursework in three different disciplines in at least two divisions (a minimum of two courses, one of which must be beyond the introductory level) or a double major or major/minor in two different divisions. These guidelines will pertain to Special Studies and interdisciplinary majors as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dana Scholars</head><p>The Dana Scholars program, made possible by the Charles A. Dana Foundation, recognizes about 70 continuing students of high academic achievement, outstanding character and leadership potential. Dana Scholars are nominated by the faculty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Andrew M. Rouse Scholars</head><p>The Andrew M. Rouse Scholarship, endowed by and named in honor of Andrew M. Rouse '49, former Trustee of the College, seeks to recognize two outstanding sophomore students, in good standing with the College, who have demonstrated high academic achievement, strong character and significant leadership skills, whether through their communities, schools, or religious organizations. Rouse Scholars should have the potential to make a positive and significant impact on the student body, and to contribute to the legacy of the College. The scholarship covers all academic costs, including full tuition, books and laboratory fees and is renewable for three years (subject to demonstrating academic eligibility and showing leadership at the College). Each scholar is eligible to apply for a $3,000 research/travel grant that will enable the student to develop further his or her leadership skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC STANDARDS</head><p>Students who are making satisfactory progress toward the degree are allowed to continue their studies at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. Satisfactory progress toward the degree is defined as meeting the following minimum class standing and academic performance standards:</p><p>A. ACADEMIC PROGRESS. Students are normally expected to complete four course credits each semester and to complete course work required for the Bachelor of Arts degree within eight semesters. A review is made at the end of each regular semester to determine the class standing of every student. For enrollment in the sophomore class, a student must have earned seven course credits; in the junior class, 15 course credits; in the senior class, 23 course credits; and for graduation, 32 course credits.</p><p>While unusual circumstances may prevent some students from proceeding on this schedule, the College is unwilling to extend the time indefinitely. Therefore, sophomore status must be attained in a maximum of three semesters; junior status in a maximum of six semesters; senior status in a maximum of nine semesters; and graduation within a maximum of 12 semesters. All requirements for graduation must be completed within a maximum of eight calendar years from initial matriculation. Students who fail to meet the minimum requirements of academic progress will be placed on academic suspension for a period of one semester. Students with unusual circumstances that prevent them from meeting these requirements may petition the Committee on Academic Status for an extension.</p><p>Students may view end of semester grades on their transcripts through Inside F&amp;M.</p><p>B. ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. Students must achieve the following minimum cumulative grade point averages as a function of the number of course credits earned:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Credits Earned</head><p>Minimum CGPA 0 to 4 1.50 more than 4 to 8 1.60 more than 8 to 12 1.70 more than 12 to 16 1.80 more than 16 to 20 1.90 more than 20 2.00 Students who do not achieve a semester grade point average of at least 2.00 will be placed on "semester advisory" status. Students who do not achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 will be placed on "cumulative advisory" status. Students who do not achieve either a semester or cumulative grade point average of 2.00 will be placed on "semester and cumulative advisory" status. Students on "advisory" status will be informed of this in writing, and a College House Dean will meet with these students to discuss academic concerns. Students should consider these meetings to be mandatory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Students will be placed on Academic Suspension if:</head><p>They fail to meet the minimum cumulative grade point average for the appropriate credits earned (unless in the just completed semester they earned a semester grade point average of 2.40 or higher for at least three course credits);</p><p>They fail to meet the minimum requirements for class standing; OR They fail all courses attempted in any one regular semester. Students in their first semester at Franklin &amp; Marshall College will generally not be suspended if they pass at least one course.</p><p>Suspended students may submit an appeal for a rescission of the suspension to the Committee on Academic Status.</p><p>First suspensions are for a period of one academic semester, and they include the summer period between the end of the semester at which they receive the suspension and their eligible date of return. Students receiving a suspension at the end of a fall semester are eligible to resume their studies at the beginning of the next fall semester. Students receiving a suspension at the end of a spring semester are eligible to resume their studies at the beginning of the next spring semester.</p><p>This period of suspension allows students time to reflect upon the sources of their academic difficulties and return to the College better prepared to meet the academic expectations of the faculty. Students placed on suspension should choose carefully the activities they pursue during the period of suspension because they will be expected to explain and justify those choices as part of the procedure for returning from a suspension. Although students may enroll in courses at another institution during the period of suspension, they may not earn credit toward graduation requirements at Franklin &amp; Marshall College during this period. Return to the College after a first suspension is highly likely but not automatic.</p><p>Subsequent suspensions are for a period of two academic semesters, and include summer period(s) from the beginning of the suspension to the eligible date of return. Subsequent suspensions place in doubt a student's willingness and ability to meet the academic standards of the College. This longer period of time should be used to examine seriously whether the student should continue at the College. Although students may enroll in courses at another institution during the period of suspension, they may not earn credit toward graduation requirements at Franklin &amp; Marshall College during this period.</p><p>Students who wish to return from an academic suspension must write a letter to the Committee on Academic Status requesting permission to return. This letter must be submitted by May 1 for students wishing to return in the Fall, and by December 1 for students wishing to return in the Spring. Prior to submission of this letter, students are expected to consult with their College House Dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE REGISTRATION AND CREDIT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS SCHEDULING</head><p>The master schedule of classes is made available online prior to registration each semester. Classes begin at 8:00 a.m. and end at 4:20 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; they begin at 8:30 a.m. and end at 6:05 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Additionally, there is an evening class period Monday through Thursday that begins at 7:30 p.m. The class schedule allows for a twice-weekly Common Hour. The Common Hour is scheduled from 11:30 a.m.-12:35 p.m. on Thursdays and is reserved for College community events. Tuesdays from 11:30 a.m.-12:35 p.m. is designated as a free hour and may be scheduled for meetings, multiple-section common examinations, etc.</p><p>In order to permit student participation in extracurricular activities, attendance at regularly scheduled classes or labs is not usually required after 4:20 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays or after 6:05 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, except for regularly scheduled evening classes.</p><p>Some courses involve field trips, lectures, or other activities scheduled outside of regular class hours. These experiences are listed in a course syllabus and course description whenever reasonably possible. If a schedule conflict occurs for a student, s/he should contact the instructor and attempt to resolve the matter as soon as possible, and certainly substantially in advance of the event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGISTRATION PROCEDURE</head><p>Class scheduling is done through the Registrar's Office, which maintains all official academic records, sends out transcripts, supervises course registration and changes, and tracks students' progress in meeting degree requirements. Students register online through Inside F&amp;M for courses that have been approved by their academic advisers. The class schedules of first-year students are prepared during the summer preceding entrance into the College. Subject to the payment of the appropriate fees, students may register for courses during the designated registration period. Exceptions to this are:</p><p>1. Students are responsible for satisfying prerequisites for a course; they may not register for courses with listed prerequisites that they have not completed unless they have permission of the instructor of the course or the chairperson of the department in which the course is offered. Credit for a course may be denied or later withdrawn if a student enrolls without the necessary prerequisites or prior approval of the instructor or department chairperson.</p><p>2. Certain courses require permission of the instructor prior to registration. Permission of the instructor may be withheld if a student has not completed the necessary prerequisites for a course, or has not done sufficient supplementary reading and work to prepare the student to profit from the course. 3. Registration in all courses is subject to availability of spaces in classes, and it is the student's responsibility to ensure that he or she is properly registered in all courses. Departments and instructors may, with the approval of the Provost and Dean of the Faculty, establish enrollment limits in courses. Enrollment may not exceed 50 in a course without permission of the Provost and Dean of the Faculty. 4. A student may be prevented from registering for courses if he or she has outstanding obligations to the College, such as an unpaid tuition balance or outstanding health forms, or an undeclared major in or after the fall of the junior year. In such cases, the student will be notified of the registration hold prior to the start of the registration period. The student will be eligible to register for courses once the outstanding obligation is met, providing that this occurs before the end of the add/drop period for the registration term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FULL-TIME STATUS</head><p>A student must be enrolled for at least three course credits a semester (equal to twelve semester hours) to be regarded as a full-time student. The normal student workload is four course credits each semester. Students may register for a maximum of two course credits in any one Franklin &amp; Marshall summer session. Two credits in a Franklin &amp; Marshall summer session is regarded as full-time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PART-TIME STATUS</head><p>Part-time status is defined as registration for fewer than three course credits. This option is not available during each of the last two regular semesters in which students are completing degree requirements. A student approved for part-time status will be charged tuition on a per-credit basis. Independent studies, tutorials, directed readings, and internships-for-credit are all billed at the standard per-credit rate.</p><p>Part-time status may have some effect on the student's participation in College activities (e.g., intercollegiate athletics, College governance, etc.). Also, the part-time student may not be eligible for any form of institutional financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADDING COURSES</head><p>After pre-registration has been completed, students may add open courses to their schedules through Inside F&amp;M. Entering a course later than the second meeting of the class requires the approval of the course instructor. The deadline to add a course is typically 7 calendar days after the start of the semester. Students may "withdraw without record" until typically 13 calendar days after the start of the semester. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that he or she is properly registered in the courses being pursued.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE CREDIT OVERLOADS</head><p>Course credit overloads are subject to the following rules: 1. A course load of four-and-one-half course credits (4.5) is not considered an overload. 2. A student may not take five course credits during his or her first semester of enrollment at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. 3. After the first semester, students who in the previous semester were enrolled as full-time students and earned a semester grade point average of 2.50 or higher automatically qualify to enroll for five course credits. 4. Students who do not automatically qualify must petition the Committee on Academic Status for permission to enroll for five course credits. 5. After the first semester, students who in the previous semester were enrolled as full-time students and earned a semester grade point average of 3.50 or higher automatically qualify to enroll for up to six course credits. Students who meet this requirement and wish to enroll for more than six course credits must petition the Committee on Academic Status. 6. Students may register for more than four course credits beginning the day before the first day of classes. 7. A 0.5-credit course that meets only for half the semester (with a frequency for that half semester equal to that for a full-credit course) shall be considered to contribute a credit load of 0.5 for the entire semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWING FROM COURSES WITHOUT RECORD</head><p>A student may withdraw from a course or courses through Inside F&amp;M during the "withdraw-without-record" period (typically 13 calendar days after the start of the semester), and no notation of the withdrawal will be made on the student's academic record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWING FROM COURSES WITH RECORD</head><p>Withdrawals with record may occur after the "withdrawwithout-record" period and before the withdrawal deadline (typically 10 -14 calendar days before the last day of regularly scheduled classes). Withdrawals with record are subject to the following rules: l. Any student in his or her first semester at the College may withdraw with record from one course provided that full-time status is preserved; the student must submit a completed Course Withdrawal Form to the Registrar's Office and a "W" will appear on the student's academic record. 2. After the first semester at Franklin &amp; Marshall College, a student may withdraw with record from two additional courses. This rule means that a student may withdraw from one of four courses in two different semesters or from two of five or more courses in one semester. In each case, the student must submit a completed Course Withdrawal Form to the Registrar's Office and a "W" will appear on the student's academic record.</p><p>3. Any student who does not follow the required procedures for withdrawing from a course will receive a grade of "F." See the 2019-2020 academic calendar for official withdrawal deadline dates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWING FROM COURSES AND PART-TIME STATUS</head><p>When withdrawing from a course (or courses) will result in a student being enrolled in fewer than three course credits, the student's status changes from full-time to part-time.</p><p>1. A student wishing to drop courses and assume parttime status must petition the Committee on Academic Status. Students should not assume that the Committee's approval is automatic. 2. Dropping to part-time status is an unusual step, and Committee approval depends upon the existence of extenuating circumstances such as health problems or unusual personal difficulties. 3. The deadline for submitting a petition for part-time status is the last day of classes in that semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PASS/NO PASS OPTION</head><p>The College encourages students to broaden their educational experience by taking some of their electives in areas that are of interest to them, regardless of the level at which they might perform. To this end, the College allows students the option of taking some electives on a Pass/No Pass basis. The purpose of this option is not to lighten course loads or to increase students' grade point averages.</p><p>The following rules apply: 1. A student may elect to take up to eight course credits on a Pass/No Pass basis. 2. The Pass/No Pass option is not available during a student's first semester at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. 3. If a student is enrolled in fewer than five course credits, only one course credit may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis (including courses with required Pass/No Pass registration). 4. If a student enrolls for five course credits, two course credits may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis. 5. The Pass/No Pass option may not be used when completing a course that satisfies any of the curriculum requirements. 6. The Pass/No Pass option may not be used when completing a course that satisfies any requirements for a major, minor, or special studies area of concentration (including specified related courses). 7. The Pass/No Pass option must be elected no later than 28 calendar days after the opening of a semester. Election of the option requires the submission of a form to the Registrar's Office with the signature of the adviser. The adviser should not be asked to sign the form if the adviser is also the instructor in the course. In this case, the student should obtain the signature of the department chair or the Vice President and Dean of Student Affairs. The signature of the instructor in the course is intentionally not required, and the instructor should not be consulted in this process. The instructor should not know who is registered on a Pass/No Pass basis until after final grades are submitted. 8. A grade of "C-" (as of Fall 2005) or better earns a "P" grade. 9. Courses taken Pass/No Pass that receive a grade of "P" earn credit toward graduation, but they are not included in the calculation of grade point averages. 10. One summer session course credit may be taken each five-week term on a Pass/No Pass basis. This option applies only to courses taken at Franklin &amp; Marshall College or a Central Pennsylvania Consortium school. 11. The election of a Pass/No Pass option is final. To request the change of a grading option after the deadline, including changing from Pass/No Pass to a standard letter grade, a student must petition the Committee on Academic Status. The Committee rarely grants these petitions unless there were truly extenuating circumstances why the regular deadline was not met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPEAT OF A COURSE</head><p>College policy permits a student to repeat a Franklin &amp; Marshall course for a grade only if the previous grade was "D+," "D," "D-," "F," or "NP." Please note that a subsequent offering of a particular course cannot be guaranteed.</p><p>The following rules apply to repeating a course: 1. When a course is repeated, it counts only once for credit toward the degree. 2. When a course is repeated, only the most recent grade is included in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average and the average in the major or minor. Both grades, however, appear on the permanent record, with a notation next to the original grade indicating that the course was later repeated. 3. Repeated courses must be taken for a regular grade unless the first grade was an "NP." When the original grade was an "NP," a student may elect either the Pass/ No Pass or regular grading options. 4. No course may be taken more than twice without the approval of the Committee on Academic Status. 5. No course that is a prerequisite to another course may be repeated if the higher level course has been passed successfully ("P," or "D-" or higher). 6. No course may be repeated by taking a proficiency exam. 7. A student may not use the repeat option more than three times. 8. An allowable repeat of a course must be taken at the same institution where the course was originally taken. In particular, courses originally taken at Franklin &amp; Marshall with a grade of "D+," "D," "D-," "F," or "NP" may only be repeated at Franklin &amp; Marshall. Students may petition the Committee on Academic Status for exceptions to this policy. 9. As clarification, if a course for which the original grade was "D-" or higher is repeated, and if a withdrawal ("W") occurs in the repeat, then the original grade and credit are retained. If, however, the course is failed when repeated, the original credit is lost. If a course for which the original grade was "F" is repeated, and if a withdrawal ("W") occurs in the repeat, then the original grade remains for grade point average calculations. 10. Election of the repeat option requires the submission of a form to the Office of the Registrar. 11. It is the student's responsibility to verify that repeated courses are properly noted on the transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AUDITING COURSES</head><p>There is no official auditing of courses at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. Any full-time student may, with the prior permission of the instructor, attend a course for which the student is not registered. There is no record of this shown on the student's transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE AT CLASS</head><p>At the opening meeting of each course, instructors state their policy on class attendance. Subject to the discretion of individual instructors, students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings, lectures, discussions and laboratory periods that make up the course. Students who violate instructors' rules of attendance may receive a grade of "F." In addition, when the rules of attendance are clearly communicated in the course syllabus or in a similarly explicit manner, a student who violates the attendance policy may be dismissed from the course upon the joint agreement of the instructor and the College House Dean. Students who are dismissed from a course for excessive absences may be reinstated only by the joint consent of the instructor and the College House Dean. Students who believe that they are obliged to miss class for health or counseling reasons should see those offices in advance, unless emergency conditions prevent. The Student Wellness Center does not issue class absence notes and encourages students to communicate with their professors before missing class, although there are certain health situations for which professors will receive communication from the Student Wellness Center or College House Deans, detailed on the Student Wellness Center's web site. Students with other reasons that they believe are valid for missing class should contact their College House Deans, also in advance unless emergency conditions prevent.</p><p>The academic calendar of the College is a secular one. A student who has a schedule conflict due to a religious obligation should discuss the situation with his or her professors prior to the date of the conflict; any accommodation would be at the discretion of the faculty member. A calendar of religious holidays is available on the College's academic calendar web page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PETITIONS FOR EXCEPTIONS TO ACADEMIC POLICIES</head><p>Students may petition the Committee on Academic Status for exceptions to academic policies of the College. Petition forms may be found in the Office of Student Success (College Square), in the Office of Student Affairs (Old Main), and on the Registrar's Office website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAJORS AND MINORS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAJORS</head><p>The regulations for admission to, and the maintenance of, an academic major at Franklin &amp; Marshall College are as follows:</p><p>1. A student must submit to the Registrar a major declaration form, approved by the chairperson of the department in which the student chooses to major, by the end of the second semester of the sophomore year. Students who have not yet declared a major by the fall semester of their junior year will not be eligible to register for future classes until they have declared a major. 2. A department may refuse a student admission to "regular" major status or dismiss a student from "regular" major status only in the following circumstances: a. If, after the end of the sophomore year, the student has not taken courses in the department, or has failed to attain a grade point average of at least 2.00 in those courses within the major. b. If the student has failed to meet other clearly defined academic criteria, approved by the Educational Policy Committee, for admission to or continuance in the major in the department. c. A maximum of eighty-five (85) students from any class may declare a major in Business, Organizations, and Society. 3. Departments will establish a "provisional major" category to which students are assigned when their circumstances fit the situations outlined in Item 2. The department chairperson notifies the Registrar when a student is made a "provisional" major or is granted regular major status. If a student fails to satisfy departmental criteria for major status after one semester as a "provisional" major, the student may be dropped as a major by departmental action. 4. A student is permitted to continue in College for one semester without a major after having been dismissed from a major. 5. Appeals from students concerning their major status may be made to the Committee on Academic Status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECIAL STUDIES MAJOR PROGRAM</head><p>The rules governing the Special Studies major program include the following: 1. A student must prepare a proposal that includes a succinct but accurate title for the major, a brief description and a list of courses, including course numbers and names and grades in any courses already taken. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OPTIONAL MINOR</head><p>The regulations for admission to an academic minor at Franklin &amp; Marshall College are: 1. Students may elect to pursue a minor in any department or program offering an approved minor program. 2. Approved minor programs consist of six course credits arranged by a department or program to constitute an integrated, cumulative academic experience. 3. Minors should be declared before the beginning of the senior year. 4. All courses in the minor must be taken for standard grades, and the student must pass all six course credits with at least a 2.00 grade point average overall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">At least four of the minor courses must be taken at</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College. 6. A student may officially declare only one minor. 7. To declare a minor, a student consults with the designated department or program chairperson and submits a minor declaration form to the Registrar's Office. 8. A student who has declared a Special Studies major may not apply more than three courses from that major toward a minor. 9. A student who has declared a Joint Major may not apply more than three courses from that major toward a minor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADDITIONAL SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUTORIALS</head><p>A Tutorial is a regular course (either one that is a permanent part of the curriculum or one taught as a "topics" course) taught on an individual basis. A student may register for a Tutorial with the consent of the instructor and the approval of the department chair. The student should complete an "Application for Tutorial" form available in the Registrar's Office and on its website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIRECTED READINGS</head><p>A Directed Reading is an investigation of a topic through readings chosen by a student with the agreement of the instructor. Assignments normally include multiple short papers as opposed to a thesis. A student may register for a Directed Reading with the consent of the instructor and the approval of the department chairperson. The student should complete an "Application for Directed Reading" form available in the Registrar's Office and on its website.</p><p>the "withdraw-without-record" deadline) during the second semester will result in a "W" on the student's transcript for both semesters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNSHIPS-FOR-CREDIT</head><p>Students may earn academic credit for an internship during the summer or academic year. An Internship-for-Credit ("IFC") has two primary components, both of which are expected to take place over the same time period. The first component involves on-site duties and responsibilities-the structured practical experience articulated through a Job Description provided by the employer or sponsoring organization. The second component is encompassed in an Educational Plan developed by the student in conjunction with his/her/their faculty sponsor, and includes a bibliography of related readings, a schedule of agreed-upon consultations between the student and faculty sponsor, and a description of the final graded work product (i.e. project, paper, or performance) the student will complete for the faculty sponsor. The faculty member will receive a brief appraisal of the student's performance from the on-site supervisor.</p><p>The following regulations govern Internships-for-Credit: 1. To apply for an IFC, students must: a. Have sophomore, junior, or senior status; b. Have a cumulative grade point average ("GPA") of at least a 2.0. Students whose GPA is less than 2.0 may petition the Committee on Academic Status for an exemption; c. Have secured an internship with an off-campus organization for which he/she/they are seeking credit. Internships encompassed in an off-campus study program that have previously been approved by the College (e.g. the Washington Semester program), may also qualify for credit at the discretion of the sponsoring department or program. d. Have identified and secured the agreement of an F&amp;M faculty member to serve as the faculty sponsor and adviser for the IFC experience. 2. All IFCs are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. Credit earned for passing an IFC will, accordingly, not count toward a student's major or minor. 3. Once the student has completed the IFC, the faculty sponsor may receive a brief statement of appraisal of the student's performance from the on-site Internship supervisor. However, the most important element in determining the grade will be those items specified on the Educational Plan for the IFC. 4. The cost of a summer IFC is not covered by regular tuition and must be handled directly with the Business Office. 5. Students may receive one-half, one, or two course credits for an IFC, depending upon the time commitment per week or the length of the project. Two-coursecredit IFCs occur over two consecutive semesters, or an entire summer and an adjoining semester with the summer counting as one semester. A one-coursecredit IFC must involve a minimum of 96 hours for the semester. Almost all summer IFCs are half-time or full-time over 10 -12 weeks. 6. Students who enroll for a two-semester IFC may not elect the "no grade/double grade" option. 7. Only two course credits from Internships may count toward the completion of graduation requirements. 8. Students may simultaneously receive compensation and credit for an internship. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMUNITY-BASED LEARNING SEMINARS</head><p>Community-Based Learning (CBL) seminars integrate experiential learning in the community with academic learning in the classroom. Coursework takes a critical perspective on the seminar's topic and requires significant reflection on the experiential learning. The experiential learning component varies from course to course: instructors may cultivate internships for the students or design a series of communitybased experiences.</p><p>The following regulations govern CBL seminars: 1. The expectation for classroom time is 2 -3 hours per week, and the expectation for experiential learning is 5 -6 hours per week, for a total range of 7-9 hours. 2. CBL seminars are either designated a course in the curriculum (and carry a departmental/programmatic prefix with the additional notation of "CBL") or be designated a CBL-IFC. Either way, the seminar requires the approval of the instructor's department/ program chair. 3. The courses are offered at the 200-, 300-, or 400-level. 4. There is no limit to the number of CBL seminars a student may take.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXCHANGE OPPORTUNITIES</head><p>The grade of "D+," "D," "D-," "F," or "NP," the repeat must take place at the same institution at which the course was originally taken. In particular, courses originally taken at Franklin &amp; Marshall that are eligible to be repeated may not be repeated at an exchange institution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EARLY COMPLETION OF THE DEGREE</head><p>In some cases, students may be able to complete their degree requirements in fewer than eight semesters at Franklin &amp; Marshall. Credits earned prior to matriculation through the Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or related systems, taking additional courses during summers, or taking course overloads during semesters may lead to early completion of the degree for some students. Students contemplating the completion of their degree in fewer than eight semesters should discuss this matter with their academic adviser as early as possible. For students who pursue this possibility, special advising resources are available to assist the student in creating a plan that is feasible and educationally sound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EVALUATION AND GRADES</head><p>It is College policy that members of the faculty judge the academic quality of students' work and assign a grade as a measure of their evaluation. This responsibility may not be delegated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RETURN OF STUDENT WORK</head><p>All work submitted by students for evaluation in a course must be returned to them as expeditiously as possible, usually within two weeks of submission. With the exception of term papers, work submitted prior to the final week of classes should normally be returned no later than the final class period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRIVACY POLICY</head><p>It is the policy of Franklin &amp; Marshall College to ensure that student grades are a private matter between student and faculty member, to be shared only with authorized officials of the College, unless the student signs a statement giving permission for his or her grades to be released to a third party, or as otherwise permitted by law. This policy entails the following:</p><p>1. All graded student assignments must be returned individually to students in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the grade and the privacy of the student. 2. In many cases, it is helpful for students to know the distribution of grades for an assignment without specific identification of grades for individual students. In cases where the instructor believes this to be appropriate to the goals and methods of a particular course, he or she should regularly inform students of the class-wide grade distribution on graded assignments. 3. Student grades may not be publicly posted; instead, grades must be communicated individually to students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADES</head><p>The letter grading system uses 12 passing grades ("A" through "D-," and "P") and two failing grades ("F" and "NP" Course rosters do not distinguish between students taking a course on a Pass/No Pass basis and students taking a course on a letter-graded basis. Faculty members report letter grades for all students, including those taking the course on a Pass/ No Pass basis. Grades of "A" to "C-" are converted by the Registrar to "P." Grades of "D+" through "F" are converted to "NP." Any questions concerning the Pass/No Pass option should be directed to the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INCOMPLETE GRADE</head><p>A temporary grade of Incomplete ("I") is given, only with the prior approval of a College House Dean, when a student is not able to complete the required work in a course within the normal time period. Incompletes are authorized only when there are extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control. An Incomplete is never justified when the student simply has neglected to complete course work on time.</p><p>There may be courses in which the content or format make Incomplete grades inappropriate. Moreover, if a student has been absent from a number of classes or has a substantial number of assignments outstanding, an Incomplete grade may also not be appropriate.</p><p>Incompletegrades are to be replaced by permanent grades no later than thirty days after the end of the final examination period in any semester. This deadline is subject to appeal to the Vice President and Dean of Student Affairs. In cases in which the course work is not completed by the assigned deadline, and an extension has not been requested and granted, the grade of "I" may be automatically converted to an "F" in the Registrar's office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE REPORTS</head><p>Grades are reported to students through their transcripts through Inside F&amp;M. In compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, Franklin &amp; Marshall College does not automatically send grades to parents. Students may authorize the regular release of grades to their parents by signing a formal release form available in the Registrar's Office. Transcripts may be withheld from the student if the student has an outstanding balance with the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RANK IN CLASS</head><p>All full-time students are ranked by cumulative grade point average at the end of each semester according to their anticipated graduation year as determined by the Registrar's Office. When students graduate, they are ranked with all other students who were awarded degrees at the same time. Rank in class is printed on students' official transcripts only after they have graduated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSCRIPTS</head><p>Official transcripts are released by the Registrar's Office to designated parties upon written request by the student. Current students may make these requests through Inside F&amp;M, or in person in the Registrar's Office. Transcripts are generally mailed within three working days of the receipt of the request. Students requiring same day service may be charged a fee. Former students may request a transcript by mailing or faxing the request form found at www.fandm.edu/registrar.</p><p>Official transcripts released directly to the student will be marked as such. There is no fee for this service if fewer than ten transcripts per academic year are requested. This service may be denied if the student or former student has an outstanding balance with the College or if there is a pending disciplinary matter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANGES IN A RECORDED GRADE</head><p>After a student's course grade is officially recorded, a change may be made only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Status through a petition from the faculty member stating good and sufficient reason for the change. Grade changes may not be requested on the basis of student work submitted after the official grading deadline.</p><p>A significant part of the Committee on Academic Status' rationale is that a change in a student's grade should be made only after grades for all students enrolled in that course have been reviewed, and the instructor is reasonably sure that no other student is affected unjustly by not having had an equivalent review of his or her reported grade.</p><p>The petition submitted by an instructor should include both an explanation of the reasons why the change is required and a description of how discrimination against other students has been prevented. A grade change petition form is available in the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPEAL OF A GRADE BY STUDENTS</head><p>Students are entitled to objective, professional evaluation of their academic work and to fair, equitable treatment in the course of their academic relationships with members of the faculty. These criteria are observed by members of the Franklin &amp; Marshall faculty as a part of their professional responsibilities. Misunderstandings have traditionally been resolved by direct discussion between students and professors, and this manner of resolving problems is normally both appropriate and sufficient. Should a student believe that he or she has a legitimate grievance regarding his or her grade for a course, the first step is thus to consult directly with the instructor for the course. Instructors may have explicit guidelines for how these appeals are to be registered, and students should follow those guidelines if they exist.</p><p>If the student then believes that the grievance has not been reconciled by this direct communication, he or she may pursue the matter by consultation with the department or program chair. In these instances, the student shall in a written statement provide a full, fair account of the incident or circumstances giving rise to the grievance. The chair shall review the statement, talk or meet with the student, and talk with the professor. (Note: if the department or program chair is also the instructor for the course, the student should consult directly with the Office of the Provost.) If, after this review, the chair finds that the matter does not merit further consideration, the chair shall inform the student and the professor of this conclusion.</p><p>If, however, the chair finds that the matter is not comprehended in established College regulations or for other reason merits further consideration, the chair will bring the matter to the Provost (or Provost's designee). If an instructor is no longer employed by the College, and does not respond to inquiries from the student and the department chair in a reasonable amount of time, the chair shall automatically bring the matter to the attention of the Provost (or designee). In addition, a student may appeal the department chair's decision not to pursue a complaint to the Office of the Provost.</p><p>In all cases where such a complaint about a grade reaches the Office of the Provost, the following procedure shall apply. The Provost (or his/her designee) shall consult with the department chair, and together they will review the student's statement, the conversations, and any other materials they deem necessary. The Provost (or designee) will also hold a direct conversation with the student, if the student so wishes, and with the professor if deemed necessary. The chair and the Provost (or designee) shall then jointly determine a resolution of the matter (which shall be submitted to the Provost in cases where the Provost him-or herself was not a party to the discussions). In all such cases, only the Provost has the ultimate authority to approve grade changes, and the Provost's decision shall be considered final. The Office of the Provost shall in all cases be mindful of the principles contained in the College's Statement of Academic Freedom and Tenure. If, in the judgment of the Provost, the grievance is of such gravity that its resolution would have an impact on the welfare of students generally or on the conduct of professional responsibilities in the College, she or he may consult with the Professional Standards Committee and/or the College's General Counsel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXAMINATION PROCEDURES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINAL EXAMINATIONS</head><p>Schedules of final examinations are prepared by the Registrar and published several weeks before the examination period begins. All final examinations are offered during three examination periods each day that are up to three hours in duration, scheduled as follows: 9 a.m. to noon; 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.; 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Prior to the exam period, there are four reading days, during which no assignment, paper, or project due dates or sessions that require attendance may occur.</p><p>Athletic competitions, including those for both intercollegiate and club teams, are not to be scheduled during the final exam period or the preceding "reading days." The exception to this policy is postseason competition associated with Franklin &amp; Marshall's membership in the Centennial Conference.</p><p>Examinations that cover a substantial portion of the semester's work, and that count a significant percentage of the semester grade, may not be given at a time other than the designated final examination period.</p><p>A student scheduled for three examination periods in a row (whether over one or two calendar days) may request a makeup time for the second of the three examinations scheduled. Such requests require a two-week advance approval by the Registrar's Office, which verifies the situation and notifies the professor involved. Faculty must honor approved requests.</p><p>Unless students are scheduled for three consecutive examinations, they are expected to take all finals as scheduled. Instructors are not permitted to make individual arrangements or exceptions.</p><p>When individual students are faced with extenuating circumstances beyond their control, a final examination may be rescheduled with the approval of the Registrar. This examination must be taken no later than two days before the official date for end-of-semester grades.</p><p>Instructors may not reschedule a final exam for an entire class without the approval of the Registrar. If the Registrar has approved the final to be rescheduled, the Registrar will notify the students and faculty member. If a final is rescheduled and no notification of official approval has been received, the students should contact the Registrar.</p><p>No re-examinations are permitted for the purpose of raising a grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROFICIENCY EXAMINATIONS</head><p>Proficiency examinations are available only to full-time students and may not be taken for any course in which the student registered during the previous calendar year or which he or she has completed with a grade (including "F" or "NP") at any time. A proficiency examination may not be taken for any course that is a prerequisite for a course in which the student has ever been enrolled. Students who are approved to take proficiency examinations should not expect the faculty to provide any special tutoring. Proficiency examinations are not intended to be taken so as to receive credit for work substantially undertaken at Franklin &amp; Marshall College but for which credit has not been received.</p><p>Students interested in receiving credit through a proficiency examination must adhere to the following procedures:</p><p>a. The student must secure permission from the department chairperson to take the examination; the chairperson has the right to deny such requests. If the chairperson grants the request, he or she completes an Application (available in the Registrar's Office) indicating the agreed-upon date of the examination. b. The student takes the Application to the Cash Handling office in the Steinman College Center, pays a nonrefundable proficiency examination fee of $100, and receives a receipt. The Application and receipt are returned to the chairperson. c. The chairperson sends the Application and receipt, with his or her signature certifying approval, to the Registrar and indicates the date the Registrar can expect the department's decision as to credit awarded. The chairperson also consults with the instructor of the course to determine the best time and place for the examination and notifies the Registrar of that decision. d. The student takes the examination on the assigned date.</p><p>The student may expect the results of the examination shortly after the deadline established by the chairperson for the results to be submitted to the Registrar. e. The chairperson notifies the Registrar's Office of both positive and negative results of all proficiency examinations. f. The Registrar's Office informs the student and his or her academic adviser of the results. Only results awarded course credit are recorded on the student's permanent record. No grade is assigned; the course does not count as either Pass/No Pass or a regularly graded course. Each credit earned through a proficiency examination reduces the student's 32-course-credit graduation requirement by an equivalent amount of course credit. Such course credits cannot count toward the 16 course credits that must be earned at Franklin &amp; Marshall College nor toward the 21 course credits that must be earned with standard grades. Students may not earn credit for courses in basic language in modern languages (normally the first four courses in the sequence) by proficiency examination.</p><p>For any approved proficiency examination in a course not in the Franklin &amp; Marshall curriculum, the student is responsible for any fees of outside examiners, in addition to the regular Franklin &amp; Marshall proficiency examination fee of $100 per course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSFER OF CREDIT POLICIES</head><p>All transfer students will be expected to adhere to all graduation requirements listed in this Catalog unless noted otherwise below.</p><p>Transfer credit is only considered for college courses that are documented on an official transcript sent directly to the Registrar's Office from the original institution.</p><p>Specific courses are approved for transfer credit based on the following considerations: a. Existence of comparable courses in the Franklin &amp; Marshall curriculum;* b. Accreditation of the institution offering the course (courses taken at institutions accredited by one of the regional accrediting commissions are generally eligible for transfer consideration); c. Intended field of concentration (including related courses); d. General Education requirements; and e. Grades earned ("C-" or better is required for courses taken prior to matriculation; "D-" or better is required for courses taken after matriculation; courses taken on a Pass/No Pass basis are generally not eligible for transfer credit). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSFER CREDIT PRIOR TO MATRICULATION (TRANSFER STUDENT)</head><p>College credit earned prior to matriculation at Franklin &amp; Marshall College is transferred on the basis of courses in which the student has earned grades of "C-" or better. The total amount of Franklin &amp; Marshall transfer credit is determined by dividing the total semester hours of approved credit by four (the number of credit hours per course at Franklin &amp; Marshall College). (Transfers from a quarter-hour system divide total quarter hours by six.)</p><p>A student must complete a minimum of 16 course credits at Franklin &amp; Marshall College regardless of the amount of credit transferred and even if all other degree requirements can be met with fewer than 16 course credits.</p><p>Grades in transferred courses are not included in the Franklin &amp; Marshall grade point average. Thus, they are not taken into account in the determination of College honors. Grades in transferred courses taken prior to matriculation are not posted on a student's Franklin &amp; Marshall transcript. Transfer credit for graded college courses will count toward the requirement that a student must pass 21 regularly graded credits to graduate from Franklin &amp; Marshall College.</p><p>Online courses may transfer upon approval of the appropriate academic department chairperson. They are awarded general elective credit only.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College grants credit for some nontraditional course work, such as the following: a. Armed Services Language Institutes (transcripts evaluated with approval of appropriate language department chairperson) b. Nursing degree (up to eight course credits) c. Advanced Placement Examinations (see pages 145-146) d. International Baccalaureate Diploma (see page 146) e. CLEP Subject Tests (see page 146) f. Proficiency examinations (see page <ref type="bibr">143, under</ref> Examination Procedures). Credentials from institutions outside of the United States are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may require the services of a course credit evaluation agency at the student's expense.</p><p>Courses in question are referred to the department chairperson, whose decision is the final authority.</p><p>Incoming transfer students are granted Franklin &amp; Marshall credit upon receipt of their final official transcript from their previous institution. This transcript must be mailed or sent via a secure electronic transcript service directly from the previous institution to the Franklin &amp; Marshall Registrar's Office.</p><p>Transfer credit for college coursework is part of a student's official education record. Once transfer credit is awarded for a course, the course cannot be removed from the student record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSFER OF CREDIT AFTER MATRICULATION</head><p>No credit may be transferred for courses taken during a fall or spring semester in which the student is enrolled at Franklin &amp; Marshall.</p><p>Transfer of credit requires approval of the appropriate department chairperson at Franklin &amp; Marshall College before the course is taken. Credentials from institutions outside of the United States are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may require the services of a course credit evaluation agency at the student's expense.</p><p>Transfer courses may not count toward the Natural Science in Perspective (NSP) requirement unless they are determined by the appropriate department chairperson to be the direct equivalent of an existing Franklin &amp; Marshall NSP course.</p><p>Online courses may transfer upon approval of the appropriate academic department chairperson. They are awarded general elective credit only.</p><p>The amount of transfer credit awarded for a successfully completed, approved course is determined only on the basis of the following equation:</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall course credits = number of semester hours divided by four, OR number of quarter hours divided by six (to the nearest .25, minimum: .25) By this formula, the following Franklin &amp; Marshall credit equivalencies can be made for a single course:</p><p>1 semester hour = .25 F&amp;M course credit 2 semester hours = .50 F&amp;M course credit 3 semester hours = .75 F&amp;M course credit 4 semester hours = 1.00 F&amp;M course credit 1 quarter hour = no F&amp;M credit 2 quarter hours = .25 F&amp;M course credit 3 quarter hours = .50 F&amp;M course credit 4 quarter hours = .75 F&amp;M course credit 5 quarter hours = .75 F&amp;M course credit 6 quarter hours = 1.00 F&amp;M course credit It is important to note that while the department chairperson determines what course a student can take to transfer credit and what specific course requirement at Franklin &amp; Marshall College will be met through taking the course (major, minor or elective), the chairperson cannot authorize a student to transfer credit according to any formula other than that explained above.</p><p>If Franklin &amp; Marshall credit is received for a specific course that was taken elsewhere, then the student may not retake the course at Franklin &amp; Marshall.</p><p>Transfer credit for college coursework is part of a student's official education record. Once transfer credit is awarded, it cannot be removed from the student record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADES FOR APPROVED TRANSFER AND STUDY ABROAD CREDIT AFTER MATRICULATION</head><p>1. In order to receive transfer credit, a passing grade must be earned ("D-" or above) and must be reflected on an official transcript sent directly to the Registrar's Office from the host institution. 2. All courses must be taken for a regular grade (not Pass/ No Pass grade of "D+", "D", "D-", "F", or "NP" was received may not be repeated at another institution. Students may petition the Committee on Academic Status for exceptions to this policy. Special policies and procedures apply for courses taken as part of a semester (or year-long) study abroad program or a domestic off-campus affiliated program. Interested students should consult the Office of International Programs for policies and procedures in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVANCED PLACEMENT</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. A student who takes an Advanced Placement examination is given college credit if the subject matter of the Advanced Placement course and examination is comparable to that covered in an elementary course taught by a Franklin &amp; Marshall department upon receipt of the student's official grade report sent from the College Board to Franklin &amp; Marshall.</p><p>The following Franklin &amp; Marshall course credits are currently awarded if a student achieves a test score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement subjects listed: †Students may earn credit for either Physics 1 or Physics 2, but not both. The maximum amount of credit awarded for PHY 101 is 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AP Subject Franklin &amp; Marshall Course</head><p>Advanced Placement examination subscores will be considered. Further details can be found at www.fandm.edu/ registrar/managing-credits/advanced-placement.</p><p>When a student is awarded credit and advanced placement, the fact, but no grade, is entered on the student's permanent record, and the number of courses required for graduation is reduced by the number of courses for which credit is given. Such credit will satisfy a major or minor requirement if the course is listed in the Catalog as satisfying that requirement. Whether a student is awarded credit for more than one semester's work in a single subject is determined by the department concerned.</p><p>These procedures do not permit the granting of two college credits for the same work (e.g., introductory calculus taken in high school and repeated at Franklin &amp; Marshall College). If a student is officially enrolled at the end of the second week of classes for a course at Franklin &amp; Marshall College for which Advanced Placement credit has been awarded, the student forfeits the awarding of this credit.</p><p>There is no limit on the number of Advanced Placement course credits a student may receive, but these credits cannot count toward the 16 course credits that must be earned at Franklin &amp; Marshall College nor toward the 21 course credits that must be earned with standard grades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLLEGE CREDITS TAKEN IN HIGH SCHOOL</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College will normally accept, in transfer, only those college credits taken while the student attended high school that are earned under all of the following conditions:</p><p>1. The course was taught on the campus of a college accredited by one of the regional accrediting associations; 2. The course was taught by a regular member of the college faculty; 3.

When a student is readmitted, the graduation requirements are those that were in place when the student originally matriculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASSESSMENT OF INSTRUCTION BY STUDENTS</head><p>At the end of each semester, students have the opportunity to provide the College with their assessments of the effectiveness of teaching in courses they have taken. These assessments of courses and instructors are submitted anonymously on a questionnaire, which includes some standard questions and some specific to the course. The questionnaires are completed in class every semester in courses taught by untenured faculty members and in alternate calendar years in the courses taught by those with tenure. The responses to these questionnaires are tabulated and the results are distributed only to the Provost and Dean of the Faculty, the Professional Standards Committee, the chairperson of each faculty member's department, and the faculty members themselves. This information is used, together with other evidence bearing on the quality of a faculty member's teaching, in making decisions on rehiring, promotion and tenure. Students are expected to take the responsibility of providing this information seriously by completing the questionnaires as thoughtfully and objectively as possible, and by following closely the details of the process by which they are administered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AT FRANKLIN &amp; MARSHALL</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College recognizes that technology plays a critical role in teaching, learning and research. We also recognize how essential a role technology does and will play in the lives of our students both while at F&amp;M and once they graduate. To this end, the College strives to provide the very best technology resources in support of the teaching and learning mission of the institution.</p><p>The campus is well equipped with technology. Nearly 100% of F&amp;M's classrooms are technology-enabled teaching spaces. The campus is 100% wireless enabled, including outdoor areas where students often gather and study. While not a requirement, nearly 90% of current students have followed the College's recommendation to bring a personal computer to campus. As well, there are public access computing facilities on campus where all students have access to F&amp;M provided computers, including both campus libraries and the Kreisel Innovation Zone on the lower level of the Patricia E. Harris Center for Business, Government &amp; Public Policy. These public computing spaces make available specialized software that students may not have on their personal computers such as statistical, mathematical and analytical applications. In addition to the public access computers, many of the academic departments have special-purpose computing labs. Access to printing is available to students across campus for a small fee per page.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall has adopted Canvas, a course/ instructional management system. Canvas is a web-based solution for online delivery of course-based instructional materials. Many F&amp;M faculty elect to use Canvas to provide access to course materials. The College provides a web-based campus-wide information portal called Inside F&amp;M. Through Inside F&amp;M, students can register for classes, examine progress toward their degree, and check their grades and other personal information. Faculty can manage their class rosters, guide advisees and submit grades. Franklin &amp; Marshall uses Google Apps for Education for email, calendaring, file storage and other services. Google Apps is the primary tool for student collaboration, file sharing and document management.</p><p>Providing general assistance in the use of all information technology resources is the responsibility of Information Technology Services (ITS). Students are encouraged to visit ITS at our service desk as well as our technology lending center (TLC) located in the Kreisel Innovation Zone on the lower level of the Harris Center for Business, Government and Public Policy. ITS can also be reached by phone at 717-358-6789.</p><p>The use of technology resources on campus is governed by a collection of documented policies, and most notably the College's Acceptable Use Policy. This policy defines the appropriate use of Franklin &amp; Marshall (F&amp;M) information assets. Those that violate this policy are subject to the full range of sanctions set forth in the Student Handbook, the Employee Policy Guide as well as local, state, and federal laws. At their discretion, the College Information Technology Committee reserves the right to modify these policies at any point in time. You can find all technology-related policies, including the Acceptable Use Policy, on the College website:</p><p>www.fandm.edu/college-policies/technology/.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College welcomes applications from students who seek to participate in an engaging liberal arts community. Students most competitive for admission are those who, in the judgment of the Admission Committee, will benefit from and contribute to both the academic and co-curricular programs of the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SELECTION</head><p>Selection is based upon several criteria, with the quality of the student's secondary school record as the most important. The best preparation for study at Franklin &amp; Marshall is a rigorous academic program that provides fundamental training in the arts, English language, foreign language, history, literature, mathematics and science. It is highly recommended that a student have some combination of four years of strong English language and literature courses, three to four years of a modern or classical foreign language, four years of mathematics resulting in a readiness for beginning college calculus, at least two years of historical study and three years of study in the natural sciences. The College also recommends students take at least five academic courses during their senior year.</p><p>Other factors considered in a student's evaluation are participation in extra-curricular activities, standardized test scores, recommendations and information concerning the student's personality and character. Students who do not believe their standardized test scores reflect their academic ability are welcome to apply to Franklin &amp; Marshall test-optional.</p><p>Students may elect to take advantage of our Standardized Test Option. Applicants choosing this option are required to submit two graded writing samples from their junior or senior year in lieu of their SAT or ACT scores. The writing samples may be creative or analytical essays written for English, humanities, or social science courses. International students who have not attended English-based instruction for more than three years must submit either a TOEFL or IELTS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head><p>Approximately 60% of the students at Franklin &amp; Marshall receive some form of financial aid from a variety of institutional, public and private sources. The College's financial aid policy reflects a desire to attract and retain a diverse student body of the highest possible promise. For those students to whom needbased aid is offered, the College strives to meet the majority of demonstrated need with grant funding. In most cases, the College packages several forms of financial aid, usually combining a grant with a student employment opportunity and loan.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall is a member of the College Board and the College Scholarship Service (CSS) and subscribes to that organization's principles of financial aid. Need-based grants are provided to students who have demonstrated financial need as determined from information submitted on the CSS/ PROFILE form, the Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA), federal tax documents (return, schedules, W-2s) and if applicable, the Noncustodial CSS/Profile form.</p><p>As the student is the primary beneficiary of the education, Franklin &amp; Marshall assumes that each family will first make a reasonable sacrifice in financing its son's or daughter's education before applying to the College for assistance. Students receiving financial aid from the College are expected to work during the summer to earn funds for their education. In addition, all applicants must apply for any state, federal, or other awards for which they may be eligible. Expected federal and state grants usually replace institutional grants. Failure to complete all applications for federal and state grants or to submit all materials by the appropriate deadlines could result in the loss of institutional funding.</p><p>For the purposes of awarding federal, state and institutional financial aid at Franklin &amp; Marshall College, the Academic Year is defined by the Academic Calendar and comprised of two 15week semesters. In addition to standard term awarding, students may receive federal or state aid for the summer terms, provided they enroll in at least two courses at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. They may also receive federal or state aid when attending other colleges in the summer, provided they enroll in the equivalent of six semester hours and complete a Consortium Agreement provided by the Office of Financial Aid.</p><p>Institutional financial aid may only be received for a maximum of eight semesters. Federal financial aid requires a student to meet the Federal Satisfactory Academic Progress standards that are listed on the Office of Financial Aid's website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>JOHN MARSHALL FELLOWS</head><p>The John Marshall Fellow Program supports a limited number of students who, during their first year at Franklin &amp; Marshall, have demonstrated unusual motivation, spirit of achievement and independence of thought. The program was created on the premise that bright, curious minds flourish best when challenged in an environment that gives highest priority to individual interests and abilities. The Marshall Fellow is eligible to apply for a $4000 research/travel grant to enhance the Fellow's ability to engage in unique and personal academic pursuits, for example, supporting an on-campus research project, doing research in another country, presenting research at a professional conference, or completing a public service project.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUITION REFUND INSURANCE</head><p>F&amp;M has partnered with GradGuard to provide families with tuition insurance by Allianz Global Assistance. This coverage expands the scope of our refund policy by ensuring reimbursement for tuition, room &amp; board and other fees for covered withdrawals at any time during the semester. Please</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUITION AND FEES</head><p>Each student is charged, on a semester by semester basis, fees that cover tuition, room, board and most College charges for activities, labs, and some special events. The cost to the College of educating the student, of course, is well in excess of these fees. The balance is provided principally by gifts from alumni and friends and by income from endowments. The schedule shown below indicates actual charges for academic year 2019 -2020 and is subject to change without notice: First-year and Sophomore students are required to purchase a meal plan, unless they are commuting students. See above for the meal plans that are available to First Years and Sophomores.

Please note-a convenience fee of 2.75% will be charged on all credit/debit card payments.</p><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall recognizes that full payment due at the beginning of each semester may present a challenge, so we have formed a relationship with Tuition Management Systems (TMS) to provide a monthly tuition payment plan. This plan provides a convenient alternative to lump sum semester payments.</p><p>Student accounts that remain unsettled at the end of a semester will be reviewed by the Committee on Student Financial Status. In the event that an account remains unpaid, the student may be placed on a Leave of Absence for Financial Reasons. If this occurs, payment in full is required in order for the student to enroll in a subsequent semester, the student may not be on campus during the leave period and the student is not eligible to take courses at another institution for transfer credit.

They also have a right to have copies of their records with a payment to cover the costs of duplication.</p><p>a. The Act contains exceptions to the general right of students to access to files and documents.</p><p>These exceptions are: 1) Confidential statements and letters placed in the files prior to January 1, 1975, and confined in their use to the purposes for which they were intended. 2) Confidential letters and statements to which students have waived a right of access. 3) Notes, statements, records, documents or other papers that are kept in the sole possession of the maker thereof and are not accessible to others (such as private notes made by professors, academic advisers, or administrators that are purely personal reminders of an event or fact that they may or may not use in a subsequent decision such as determining a grade in a course, advising as to courses, etc.). 4) Records and documents of the Department of Public Safety. 5) Records used in connection with the medical, psychological, or psychiatric treatment of the student. 6) Confidential financial records of students' parents or guardians. b. Waiver of Access. A student may waive a right of access to confidential statements and letters submitted as part of his or her admissions dossier, but this waiver does not apply if the letters or statements are used for purposes other than to make a judgment about the admission of the student to Franklin &amp; Marshall College. Students may also waive a right of access to confidential recommendations respecting admission to another college or university, a graduate or professional school, or for other opportunities such as internships. Authors of such letters will give the student an opportunity to waive a right of access to such letters of recommendation as they may write. Students may also waive a right of access to confidential recommendations concerning application for employment or receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. c. Access Procedure. Students who wish to review their records may do so by submitting an application to the appropriate officer of the College on a form provided for the purpose that shall identify what part of the education records the student wishes to review. Within 45 days of the submission of the application, a representative of the College office responsible for maintaining those records will provide the student with the records and documents to which the student is entitled and will provide such explanations or comments as the student may require for clarification. Should the student challenge any part of the folder, file, document, or record, the Provost (or designee) shall try to resolve the matter by such informal means as discussion and/or deletion of erroneous material, addition to the record of an explanatory statement, or such other remedy as is deemed appropriate in the judgment of the Provost (or designee) and the student. If the challenge to the content of the record cannot be resolved by such informal means, a hearing shall be held within a reasonable time to resolve the matter, and the decision of the hearing panel will be final. The hearing panel (all three members of which are to be drawn from the College community) will be made up of a member chosen by the student, a member chosen by the Provost, and a member chosen by the Provost's representative and the student's representative.</p><p>The decision of the hearing panel will be rendered within ten days of the hearing, will be in writing, and will be delivered to the student and the Provost. d. Record of Access. Those officers under whose care the records are kept shall maintain a log of the names of those who have requested or been granted access to a student's record, the dates of all such transactions, and the legitimate interest of each person in obtaining this information. e. Limited Scope and Purpose of Student Review of Records. It is not the intention of the Act or these procedures to provide a forum for challenging course grades, the decisions of the Committee on Academic Status, the Student Conduct Committee, or any other committee or office of the College assigned the responsibility to make judgments. Rather, it is the intention of the Act and these procedures to make known to students the informational base upon which decisions included in the education records are made and to allow corrections of that information or inclusion of explanatory statements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Administration of Policy and Procedures</head><p>The Provost shall have general oversight of the administration of the Act and the above procedures. Questions concerning the matters covered by these procedures and the Act should be directed to the Provost. Recommendations for changes and amendments to these regulations will be welcomed by the Provost, and such changes as experience demonstrates should be made will be made in a manner and at such times as conform to Franklin &amp; Marshall procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FERPA for Families</head><p>Franklin &amp; Marshall College recognizes the critical role that parents and families play in supporting their student's growth and development through college. With that in mind, the College has established the following policy with regard to the release of information from students' education records; the policy is intended to balance the autonomy conveyed by the Federal regulations to the student with the vital support system provided by parents and guardians.</p><p>As noted within the FERPA regulations above, the right to release information from their records transfers from parents to students upon their enrollment in a post-secondary institution, even when the student is under age 18. This means that, with a few exceptions, disclosures from the education records are to be made only upon the student's written consent.</p><p>One of the exceptions within the regulations is that the College may release information to the student's parents or guardians without the student's written permission when the student is determined to be a dependent according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1854, Section 154.</p><p>Though disclosure is permitted, in most cases Franklin &amp; Marshall does not release student records under this provision. The core of this policy surrounds our particular circumstances as a residential institution. It has been the College's belief in the importance of building a relationship of trust between the student and the institution, which becomes especially critical with the health and safety considerations that come into play in a residential environment.</p><p>Instances in which Franklin &amp; Marshall will release information to parents of dependent students: a. Change in a Student's Standing: 1) Franklin &amp; Marshall believes students are ultimately responsible for their academic performance. However, when a student is placed on advisory status at the end of a semester as a result of low semester and/or cumulative GPA, parents of dependent students will receive notification, so that they may provide support as the student develops a plan to improve for the subsequent semester. 2) Additionally, when a student is placed on academic suspension as a result of either failing all courses in a semester or failing to meet the appropriate cumulative GPA threshold, parents of dependent students will be notified, so that they may provide support as the student makes plans for their time away from F&amp;M. 3) Finally, parents will be notified when a student's change in status occurs as a result of disciplinary action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES: REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973, SECTION 504</head><p>In accordance with equal education opportunity laws, Franklin &amp; Marshall College arranges to provide reasonable academic accommodations for students whose disabilities limit their participation in academic programs for which they are qualified. Students are required to notify the College if they will need special services or accommodations in the classroom or if they want faculty, academic advisers, or administrative offices notified of a disability. Reasonable academic accommodations for students with disabilities are determined on an individual basis utilizing the required documentation of the disability. The College does not have a special program for students with disabilities. For example, there are no special classes or tutors for students with learning disabilities or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The academic support system for a student with a disability is the same as the academic support system for all students. The College has designated Alison Hobbs, Psy.D. as the Director of Student Accessibility Services. In this role, Dr. Hobbs coordinates services and accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities that limit their participation in the programs and activities of the College. Dr. Hobbs reviews all required documentation of disability and determines the reasonable academic accommodations for each individual student. Every student at the College has the opportunity to complete a Disability Notification Form available throughout the year at the Office of Student Accessibility Services The College considers information provided on this form as confidential and uses it to provide reasonable accommodations for qualifying students.</p><p>Students who wish to appeal an accommodation or file a complaint arising under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act should use the following procedures:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROCEDURE FOR APPEAL OF ACCOMMODATIONS OR FILING OF COMPLAINT UNDER THE REHABILITATION ACT OR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Jurisdiction</head><p>This procedure may be used by students to report discrimination based on disability in any College program or activity. Employees who wish to report disability discrimination should contact Human Resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Covered Conduct</head><p>1. Discrimination (including harassment): Individuals who experience negative or adverse treatment based on disability that is sufficiently serious to deny or limit their ability to participate in a College program or activity may file a complaint under this procedure. Examples of disability discrimination include verbal or physical harassment based on disability and disparate treatment based on disability. 2. Disagreements regarding accommodations: In some instances, concerns related to the provision of academic adjustments and auxiliary aids and services (commonly called accommodations or modifications) may constitute disability discrimination. Disagreements regarding the denial of requested accommodations and the sufficiency of approved accommodations, for example, may be raised under this procedure. 3. Retaliation: The College does not tolerate retaliation against individuals who complain about disability discrimination or otherwise assert their rights under Section 504 or the Americans with Disabilities Act. Individuals who experience retaliation, intimidation, or retaliatory harassment may file a complaint using the process outlined below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Time Frame for Filing</head><p>Complaints of disability discrimination should be made promptly. The passage of time between the date of the alleged discrimination and the filing of a complaint may impair the College's ability to look into the complaint and provide appropriate relief, as key witnesses and evidence may no longer be available. A student who wishes to appeal an accommodation because the accommodation is felt to be inadequate or inappropriate is encouraged to contact Student Accessibility Services within 90 days of receiving the accommodation to discuss their concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Informal Resolution</head><p>Individuals who experience disability discrimination, who disagree with an approved accommodation, or who have difficulty obtaining approved accommodations are encouraged to contact Dr. Alison Hobbs to discuss their concerns. If the actions of Dr. Alison Hobbs are at issue, individuals may choose to contact the Dean of Students. The informal process is voluntary. A complainant may conclude the informal process at any time and file a formal complain</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Formal Resolution</head><p>Complaints must be made in writing to the Office of Student Affairs within 90 days and should include a description of the nature of the alleged discrimination and the parties. If the participation of the Dean of Students in the process would create a conflict of interest, written complaints may be made to the Vice President and Dean of Student Affairs. Within 30 business days of receipt of the complaint, the Dean of Students or designee will look into the complaint and may conduct a formal investigation, as appropriate. This process provides for the prompt, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints, including an equal opportunity for the parties to present witnesses and evidence. Investigations generally will be completed within the aforementioned time frame.</p><p>Within 5 working days of the conclusion of the inquiry or investigation, the Dean of Students will provide written notice of the outcome to the parties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Appeal</head><p>Either party may appeal the outcome of the formal process by filing a written appeal within 15 days of the date that written notice of the outcome is sent to the parties. Appeals should be made to Margaret Hazlett, Vice President and Dean of Student Affairs. In the event that the participation of Dean Hazlett would present a conflict of interest, appeals may be filed with the Vice President for Finance and Administration, Paul Mutone.</p><p>Appeals will be decided within 30 days of the date they are filed. The appeal of an accommodation that involves the waiver of an academic requirement must be presented to the Committee on Academic Status in consultation with Student Accessibility Services. The parties will receive written notice of the outcome of the appeal process within 5 working days of the conclusion of the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. Role of the Section 504/ADA Coordinator</head><p>The Section 504 Coordinator will receive notice of any complaints that are filed under this procedure and will receive updates regarding the status of complaints. The Section 504 Coordinator will maintain documentation related to complaints, reports, and investigations of disability discrimination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. Anti-harassment Statement</head><p>In cases of disability harassment, the College will take prompt and appropriate steps to end a hostile environment if one has been created, prevent the recurrence of any harassment, and correct discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if appropriate. Individuals who experience disability harassment may receive interim remedies, as appropriate, such as academic assistance and other appropriate relief. The College takes seriously complaints of disability harassment and will take prompt disciplinary action against individuals who engage in disability harassment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. Confidentiality</head><p>The College will maintain the confidentiality of the parties to disability discrimination cases and related records, consistent with applicable federal and state laws. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This course introduces students to the history of the present-day U.S.-Mexico border region.

This course examines the development of economic, gender, and racial hierarchies from an archaeological perspective. Archaeology is well suited to address these questions because it examines change and development in social life over long periods of time. Prerequisite: ANT 200 or permission of instructor. What does it mean to be a person? This seminar explores the category of the person, one of anthropology's most enduring interests. From the early writings of Mauss to recent works on the "social life of microbiome" or the "the ethnography of robots," anthropologists have sought to better understand who (or what) counts as a person, and why. In some cultural settings, for instance, non-human animals, "inanimate" objects and spirits may qualify for claims of personhood to which some human beings may not be entitled. Readings will feature ethnographies from the Melanesian South Pacific, Amazonia and the United States, as well as selections from philosophical texts and science fiction.

Prehistory of the Near East. (NW) (S) (Culture Area) This course explores the cultural and social diversity of the ancient Near East, tracing cultural developments from early post-glacial times through the end of the Iron Age. Topics discussed will include the development of agriculture and Neolithic lifeways, the rise of the world's earliest cities, the development of social complexity, state formation and expansion, the development of writing systems, and the politics of cultural heritage, among others.

If these phenomena are not intrinsic then how, and in which contexts, do they arise?Smith 330. Anthropological Studies of Religion. (S) This course takes account of various aspects of religious and ritual practice, using material from both contemporary and classic ethnographies. Topics of special interest for the course will include, but not be limited to: cosmological constructions; initiation; possession; commensality; magic; witchcraft and sorcery; ritual aesthetics; and performance. Prerequisite: ANT 200. Same as RST 330. Bastian 333. Anthropology of Personhood. (S)This doctrine purportedly claims that all cultures are equal, that we cannot and must not judge values (or morals, or standards, or ways of living, or truths) of any one culture-even our own-as being superior. Is this a fair description of cultural relativism in anthropology? Do anthropologists really avoid judging practices such as human sacrifice and cannibalism? Where does this doctrine come from? What are its strengths and limitations? Is it as pernicious and incoherent as its critics assert? Prerequisite: ANT 200. Billig 345. Transitions to Capitalism. (S) Theoretical debates, historical analyses, and ethnographic studies about the rise of market exchange, private property, and the capitalist mode of production. Anthropological perspectives on the nature, origins, and culture of capitalism. Prerequisite: ANT 200. Billig 355. The Body. (S) Examines contemporary theoretical and ethnographic discussions relating to the human body. Topics covered will include social constructions of gender, reproduction and reproductive technologies, cultural ideologies of sexuality, social inscriptions on the body, "the body in extremis," cultural depositions of the corpse and what some might call hybrid, cyborg or even virtual bodies. Prerequisite: ANT 200 or permission of the instructor. Same as WGS 355. Bastian 360. Spatial Archaeology. (S) The analysis of ancient spatial orders has been central to the archaeological study of past social organization and dynamics. This course explores the ways in which archaeologists have studied spatial organization at various scales, from regions to buildings. Topics covered include landscape archaeology, social meanings of space, urbanism, the archaeology of community, archaeological approaches to the analysis of public architecture, and household archaeology. Case studies may include Classic period Maya, ancient Peru, Sub-Saharan Africa, Neolithic Britain, Egypt, the Levant, and North America. Prerequisite: ANT 200 or permission of the instructor.

This course proposes otherwise, that the Renaissance inaugurated an explosive new culture of consumption, fueled by urbanization, the unprecedented production of material goods, and the economic and social capital of cities. The result was a dramatically transformed society whose traces remain today. What was the Renaissance (and why should we care)? This course explores the cultural artifacts produced in this period-including city squares, buildings, paintings, furnishings, food and fashion-through the dynamic interplay of urban and rural economies, social and political institutions, and the intellectual movement of humanism. Focusing on the material production of this period, we ask what it tells us about the myths and realities of this new age. A chronological survey of painting, sculpture, and architecture in Europe and the United States from 1900 to the present with an emphasis on modernism.

(H)</head><label></label><figDesc>" Meets Pre-1800 requirement for Creative Writing and Literature majors and the 300-level literature requirement for majors in the literature track. Same as LIT 363. These regularly offered courses examine selected issues and ideas in the traditions of British and American literature in the historical periods after 1800. ENG 204 covers British literature in the 19th century; ENG 207 covers American Literature from the founding of the Republic to the Civil War; ENG 208 extends from the Civil War through World War II. ENG 210 treats 20th-century literature written in English; ENG 257 examines African-American Literature of the 20th century. The department also offers 300-level courses designated "Post-1800.What forces of the past shape the present of the individual, the community, the nation? What beliefs and practices must be changed, to give way to the new, the modern? What are the costs and benefit of progress? This course takes its keynotes from poet Wordsworth, natural historian Darwin and novelists such as Mary Anne Evans [pseud. George Eliot], Charles Dickens, and Thomas Hardy. Other texts may include Victorian children's literature, essays on The Woman Question by J.S. Mill and Florence Nightingale, Tennyson's poetic reinventions of myth, and Conrad's modernist novel, Heart of Darkness. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Frederick Douglass aren't usually considered "nobodies." Yet along with other American writers of the early nineteenth century, they experimented with, as Emily Dickinson puts it, being nobody. Being nobody could mean slipping out of one's life to watch it from the outside, or finding oneself mysteriously doubled, or conceiving of the self as a deeply passive structure, created by external events. We will study how a variety of literary texts propose unusual models for selves in general and American selves in particular. Meets Post-1800 requirement in the English major. (Post-1800) What is the power of one individual to resist oppression? Can a person's love conquer all? Or are we at the mercy of forces like biology, economics, and technology? For American writers at the turn of the twentieth century, these questions were paramount. Fascinated by new theories of nature and society, Mark Twain, Frank Norris, Edith Wharton, Charlotte Perkins Gilman and others experimented with narratives in which characters were pitted against powerful systems. We will study these narratives as well as the philosophical and cultural contexts in which they emerged. In this course, we'll explore how modernist writers-such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, W.B. Yeats, André Breton, and T.S. Eliot-rebelled against the literary conventions of their day. In stunning, iconoclastic verse and prose, these writers turned to surrealist mind games, stream of consciousness narration, Freudian psychology, experimental cinema, and jazz-inflected metapoems to question the meaning of literature In TheSouls of Black Folk (1903), the African American writer W. E. B. Du Bois introduces two concepts-the "veil" and "doubleconsciousness"-to explain the black experience in America. This course, which covers African American literature from Reconstruction to the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Aesthetic/Black Power movement and beyond, will examine the recurrence of the veil metaphor (and its synonyms) generally and engage Du Bois's formulation of the concept specifically in the cultural and historical contexts that frame this period's literature. We will explore how writers (Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, etc.) engage topics (race, gender, music, identity, etc.) that reinforce, expand and/or complicate Du Bois's metaphor.

Despite their content, the texts we study aren't dominated by horrific images. Instead, they approach their subjects through unconventional narrative forms. We'll work to understand how and why they do so-to come to terms with the complexities of stories about violent experiences. What is Caribbean literature? Some writers and scholars question the identity of a region of so many diverse languages, races, ethnicities, religions, and nations. At the same time, others argue for the coherence of a region marked by a history of European colonization and slavery. This course will focus on anglophone (English-language) Caribbean literature of the twentieth century, a rich and varied body of work that has recently produced two Nobel Prize winners, Derek Walcott and V.S. Naipaul. In this course, we will explore how this literature grapples with issues of race, gender, nationalism, independence, decolonization, the ethics of violence, the importance of vernacular expression, and the formation of a literary tradition. The Lord of the Rings is often described as one of the most important and influential novels of the twentieth century, yet it is commonly banished from the literary canon. Why is this? This course examines Tolkien's role as an author of popular fiction as well as of "great" literature, and will address the following questions: what is the relationship between Tolkien's scholarship and his fiction, between the medieval text that informed his intellectual life and his novels? To what extent do Tolkien's experiences during the Great War affect the mythology of Middle Earth?

The introductory-level courses stress communicative competency and the acquisition of listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. The intermediate courses reinforce and extend those skills through an interactive exploration of contemporary French and Francophone culture using a variety of authentic print and electronic sources.The French major provides a cohesive, integrated experience which gives students a solid background in language, literature and culture. Introductions, the three core courses required for the major, serve as a gateway to the major and a bridge from the intermediate to advanced levels of our program. These courses provide students with the tools to describe, debate, analyze and critique French literary and cultural texts, films, documents and other cultural phenomena, both orally and in writing. In the Développement stage of the French major, students choose from advanced courses in the following categories: Racines (historical, literary, or cultural ideas, movements and icons across time); Hors Hexagone (literature, ideas, and concepts from several regions of the French speaking world); Monde Contemporain (literature, ideas, or figures associated with France during the last one hundred years); and Perfectionnement et Pratique (development of written and/or oral skills at an advanced level). In the final year of the major, students will take one Approfondissement course, an advanced level seminar which is an in-depth study of an author, genre, era, or phenomenon. All majors, in consultation with their adviser, will also create and present a portfolio of their work in French. This presentation will take place during the student's final semester, before a group of department members and other French majors.All French majors work closely with a departmental adviser to ensure the coherence and integrity of their major course of study.In consultation with their advisers, French majors may take one cognate course outside of the department for credit in the major.

Prerequisite: GER 301. Offered every Spring. is probably not the first word that comes to mind when most people think about what Germans are like, but German literature is full of men and women in love. This course features novels, plays, novellas, films and lyric poetry that offer insight into whether love is, indeed, a kind of "temporary insanity," as American thinker Ambrose Bierce suggested. The course begins with an exploration of love relationships in Germany in the former GDR and the Federal Republic before and after reunification, followed by works from the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries, where social class and gender roles play a different role in constructing love relationships from the way they do in the twenty-first century. Prerequisite: GER 302. This course explores the history of German cinema since its origins in the 1920s. Why do black-and-white silent films like Caligari, Nosferatu, and Metropolis continue to resonate with film enthusiasts in the twenty-first century? What is so visually compelling about a Nazi propaganda film? What happened to German movie production after twelve years of misuse by Hitler's cultural ministry? What marks did the forty-year division of Germany leave on film in the united nation? How has immigration of new populations affected German film? And where, after all, are the boundaries between "global" film and "German" film today, when so many directors, actors, and studio artists work in more than one country? Prerequisite: GER302. Are Germans as hard-working as everyone thinks? How can such a small country be a top exporter of manufactured products with workers getting at least five weeks annual vacation? This course explores how today's attitudes and practices of work in united Germany emerged from older traditions as set down in written texts, folk songs, films, and graphic arts. We examine traditional and contemporary interrelationships of work and gender, work and ethnic identity, work and social class, as well as the specific vocabulary of German work. Prerequisite: GER 302. Redmann This course examines a selection of topics that are part of the contemporary German cultural and political landscape, including Germany in the European Union, relations between east and west Germans, sports and German national identity, social challenges posed by Germany's aging populace, and minorities in German society.

This course examines the doctrinal and political conflicts between the Roman Catholic Church and the "reformed" religions of northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, focusing on the impact on the visual culture of the period. The course examines "high" art and architecture, but pays particular attention to the attitudes towards images more broadly, the ideologies that drive them, and their operations across all sectors of society. Same as ART 335 and RST 335. This course is intended to prepare German majors to conduct research and write formal literary analyses on literary topics. Since the course focuses on writing in English, students read important longer works from the German literary tradition in English translation, along with secondary literature in English. The course also gives students a summary overview of the major periods of German literary and intellectual history. Equally importantly, students have the opportunity to develop their writing skills in literary analysis. Each student prepares a significant research project on a longer work of German literature of their choosing and presents a formal presentation 6on this work at the end of the semester.

Everett390. Independent Study.Independent study directed by the Government staff. Permission of chair. This seminar focuses on the health care system in the United States with attention to political structures shaping public policy on health and to substantive areas of health policy debate. The seminar explores the role of the presidency and the executive branch, Congress, and the states in the evolution of health policy. Biotechnology, health care disparities, and political struggles over providing health care are among the substantive areas the seminar examines from the perspectives of cost, access, and quality. This course examines the role that individual politicians, particularly American presidents, play in American politics. We examine concepts such as presidential leadership and presidential character. A primary goal of the course is to understand what types of individuals are likely to become president and which individual traits successful presidents are likely to possess. This seminar is designed to explore issues related to party politics, particularly in the United States but with some comparison to party systems in other democracies. Students will explore the role of parties in democratic systems of government, various models of parties and party systems, and the history of parties in the United States. The majority of the semester will be spent examining three aspects of parties that scholars have generally used to describe what political parties are and what they do-the party-as-organization, the party-in-the-electorate, and the partyin-government. After completing the course, students should have a better understanding, from both a normative and empirical perspective, of the role played by parties in the American political system. Liberal, conservative, libertarian, neoconservative, populist, progressive, green, Tea Party-these and many other ideological labels are tossed around with abandon in contemporary American politics. But what is a political ideology and what are all these various factions actually arguing about? Why do some people hold a particular ideology and others a different one-or no ideology at all? How does ideology affect the way people-both ordinary citizens and elites such as members of Congress, presidents, and Supreme Court justices-think and act politically? How do the political parties differ in their ideologies? Is the United States becoming more polarized ideologically? These questions will be explored through the study of contemporary American political discourse, opinion surveys, and campaigns and elections. This seminar highlights some of the major debates about the role, practices and problems of national intelligence and explores the issues facing the U.S. intelligence community in the 21st century. Topics include the role intelligence plays in support of policymaking, the sources of past intelligence "failures," and the questions of congressional oversight and intelligence reform.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">388.

The course begins with an overview of the most well-known and debated theories of development, Hebrew is sometimes called the holy language (leshon hakodesh), since it is the original language of the Hebrew Bible. Today, it is also a modern spoken language and the official language of the state of Israel. The study of Hebrew confers many benefits, including the ability to function in and understand modern Israeli society, and a more nuanced comprehension of ancient texts. Franklin &amp; Marshall offers three years of Hebrew language instruction as part of the Judaic Studies minor (see JudaicStudies), an Area Studies minor, or to fulfill the College's general language requirement. Hebrew classes are designed not only to develop listening, reading, speaking, and writing skills, but also to emphasize appreciation for the culture and history connected with the language.

In his epic tale of man's journey to redemption, Dante Alighieri created a masterpiece that continues to challenge our assumptions about good and evil, love and life. From Geoffrey Chaucer to Dan Brown, abolitionists to Romantics, Dante's work has inspired generations of authors and artists, and stands today as one of the great pillars of Western literature. Through close readings of Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise, as well as class discussions and presentations, we will situate Dante's work within the social and religious context of the late Middle Ages.

Prerequisite: JPN 301 or permission of instructor.The Judaic Studies program is designed to introduce students to the religion, history and literature of the Jewish people and to their interactions with the other peoples among whom they have lived. In the Western world, Jewish thought has been foundational to our common culture, yet the experience of the Jewish people, like that of other excluded minorities, has often diverged profoundly from that of the majority. The study of Judaism and of the varieties of Jewish experience can thus be both a complement and a corrective, to any course of study examining the history and culture of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the Americas. The program for minors provides a comprehensive introduction to the religious, cultural and political traditions of Jewish life from its origins to present day.A major in Judaic Studies may be arranged through the Special Studies Program described in this Catalog. A Joint Major consists of eight Judaic Studies courses in addition to designated courses from any department/program offering a major. At least two of the Judaic Studies courses must be Hebrew language.Students minoring in Judaic Studies may pursue one of two tracks: Jewish History and Culture, or Hebrew Language and Literature. Both consist of six courses. In addition to expanding their knowledge of Hebrew grammar through the study of more complex structures, students in this course will read contemporary fiction in its historical and socio-cultural context. In particular, the course will examine the interplay between Hebrew literature and life in Israel in the work of such authors as Savyon Liebercht, Etgar Keret, Meir Shalev, and Avigdor Dagan. Course topics will include literary representations of the Israeli landscape, the tension between Israel and the diaspora, and the development of Post-Zionist literary sensibilities. This course will focus on a number of classical texts ranging from the biblical period to the present early modern times. With the exception of a few selections, all have had their impact on Jewish culture in the Hebrew language. The chief aim of the course is to immerse students in the questions the texts raise, thus exposing them to continuity and change in Jewish self-understanding over time. The desired outcome is that the students become aware of certain key concepts (e.g. covenant, chosenness, prophecy, exile, redemption, Jewish law) and the continuing debates around them. Same as RST 112. This seminar examines major debates and new trends in Jewish historiography, especially focusing on recent historical writing on the Holocaust and the State of Israel. Same as HIS 405. Hoffman490. Independent Study.The student pursues an in-depth investigation of a topic of special interest, under the direction of an adviser.

This course focuses on the mountainous Andean region of South America and provides an overview of Andean society from AD 1500 to present. We will examine the colonial matrix in which Iberian and Andean social, political, and cultural forms came together. This course uses ethnographies, contact period chronicles, indigenous narratives, novels, testimonials, and film about contemporary Andean society to address issues of colonialism, race, class, ethnicity, gender, and human-environment relationships. Geographically, this course focuses on the region encompassed by the modern nations of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Prerequisite: ANT 100, ANT 102, or permission of the instructor. The rest of the course will be dedicated to a survey of the politics of several countries from different areas of Latin America. Begins with historical backgrounds of indigenous societies as well as Spain, Portugal, and Africa before 1492, followed by an examination of the conquest and colonial period through independence. The course focuses on the contributions of these major cultural groups in the formation of colonial Latin American society and culture. Formerly HIS 231. Shelton Focuses on comparative history and political economy, U.S.-Latin American relations, and cultural forces. The course introduces students to the major trends, problems, and forces that have shaped current-day Latin American societies since the late colonial period.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_95"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The study of Public Policy is available to students as a Joint Major, where the Public Policy Core forms one component and at least eight additional courses, determined by an existing academic department that offers its own major, form the balance of the program. Pre-approved Joint Major programs are currently available with Business, Organizations, and Society; Economics; Sociology; Government; Public Health; and Environmental Studies. Joint majors with Public Policy have also been approved with American Studies, Anthropology, History and Philosophy. Students wishing to combine Public Policy in a Joint Major with another existing major should first contact the Public Policy chairperson to determine the feasibility of the proposed Joint Major program and the appropriate course requirements. The usual rules for Joint Majors apply in the case of all Public Policy majors. During the last few years, Public Policy students have successfully interned in local government, at departments of health in Philadelphia and Connecticut and at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, Pa. This interdisciplinary course, taught by a local Drug Court Judge will introduce students to the world of Problem Solving Courts, including Drug Courts and Mental Health Courts. This will include a hands-on/ experiential examination of traditional courts, Drug Court models, and addiction issues. A major component of this course will involve community-based learning (CBL). Students will be required to interact directly with Drug Court participants and members of the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas Adult Drug Court Team. Permission required. Same as PBH 303. The course provides an overview of current U.S. environmental laws, beginning with the National Environmental Policy Act (1969). Students will be introduced to the origin and implementation of major environmental laws that safeguard public health and protect the environment, including the Clean Air and Water Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the 1980s legislative agenda developed to address hazardous waste, including the Superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Toxic Substance Control Act, and the Community Right-to-Know Act. Students study original legislation and explore landmark court cases by way of which political and economic pressures have influenced subsequent amendments to the original intent of these laws.

Public Health Research: You Are What You Eat?</head><label></label><figDesc>This seminar is an introduction to health policy in the United States. Health has emerged as a crucial and enduring issue on the nation's policy agenda. How political culture, political structures, and policy processes in the American political system shape health policy is the object of our attention. Two questions infuse our deliberations: what can government do to shape the health of individuals and what should it do? Pondering health as a public policy issue and the political system's responses to public expectations for health care should tell us much about government and about ourselves in the twenty-first century. Same as PBH 410. In this interdisciplinary seminar, students explore the complex relationships between food, nutrition, and health. Students will navigate scientific literature as well as information available via popular media, evaluate both for veracity and practicality, then share their own conclusions (and new questions arising from this evaluation!) during class discussions and course assignments. Students will also discuss issues related to conducting research, then explore known and/or hypothesized relationships between economic, behavioral, biological, sociopolitical, cultural, and environmental variables and food-related behaviors. Students will design and conduct research centered on food, nutrition, and health. Prerequisites: PBH 354 or PBH 351 and one course fromBIO 210, MAT 216, BOS 250,  or PSY 230 and permission.

Elementary Russian I.</head><label></label><figDesc>The 20th century was a time of unprecedented upheavals and profound changes in Russian society, politics and culture. Russia and its successor state, the Soviet Union, suffered revolutions, wars, bloody civil strife, collectivization and purges. During those unstable and dangerous times and despite official suppression, Russian writers, artists and filmmakers produced outstanding works. In this course we will study the 20th-century Russian experience through its literature and other art forms. All readings will be in English, with special assignments for those able to read in Russian. For students with no knowledge of Russian. Introduction to the contemporary Russian language. The course presents the fundamentals of Russian grammar and syntax with equal emphasis on speaking, writing, reading, aural comprehension, and cultural awareness. Audio and video exercises, simple readings, short compositions, conversational drills. Building upon the foundation developed in Intermediate Russian, this course provides a more detailed and nuanced engagement with Russian language and grammar with particular emphasis on developing advanced reading and writing skills and adding breadth and depth to speaking skills. We will utilize many more examples of "real" Russian texts and materials to become comfortable with Russian as it is used by Russians. Prerequisite: RUS 202 or placement. Through an exploration of the literary, artistic, social, and political context, this course will introduce the major aspects of Russian life and culture. By becoming acquainted with the stories of such typically Russian characters and their worlds, we will better understand Russian culture and identity. This course begins with an intensive overview of themes and works seminal in the development of Russian literature, art, history, and politics. The final three weeks of the course will be spent in Russia (primarily St. Petersburg and Moscow) where these themes will be investigated more extensively through a variety of classes, activities, and excursions.</figDesc><table><row><cell>301.

Duke awards the professional degree of Master of Forestry (M.F.) or Master of Environmental Management (M.E.M.) to qualified candidates at the end of the second year. The student must complete a total of 60 units at Duke. The M.F. degree is in Forest Resource Management. Eight options are available for the M.E.M. degree: Coastal Environmental Management; Conservation Science and Policy; Ecosystem Science and Management; Energy and the Environment; Environmental Health and Security; Global Environmental Change; Environmental Economics and Policy; or Water and Air Resources.Concurrent degrees may be earned alongside the M.F. or M.E.M. in Business (M.B.A.), Law (J.D.), Public Policy (M.P.P.), or Teaching (M.A.T.) through formal agreements between the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences and other professional schools at Duke.Alternatively, some students prefer to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree at Franklin &amp; Marshall before entering Duke. The requirements for these 4-2 students are essentially the same as those for students entering Duke after the junior year.Interested students should consult the coordinator, Dr. Timothy Sipe, Associate Professor of Biology, early in their careers at Franklin &amp; Marshall, about appropriate course scheduling, so that the necessary prerequisites for admission to Duke can be completed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INDEPENDENT STUDIES</head><p>An Independent Study consists of an extensive research project completed under the supervision of a faculty member.</p><p>The following rules govern Independent Studies:</p><p>1. An Independent Study must be approved by a faculty adviser and the department chairperson. 2. An Independent Study must culminate in a thesis or performance. 3. The student and the adviser for the Independent Study should agree in advance whether the project will extend over one or two semesters, for one-half, one or two course credits. 4. The deadline to register for an Independent Study is the end of the first week of the semester in which the Independent Study is undertaken. 5. To register for an Independent Study, a student completes the "Application for Independent Study" form and returns it to the Registrar's Office. 6. If an Independent Study is to be considered for Departmental Honors, the additional guidelines described in the section on Departmental Honors should also be observed. The regulations governing grading options for an Independent Study are as follows: 1. If the student elects the standard letter grade option, the student registers under normal procedures and presents the required Independent Study application with the department or program chairperson's approval. It should be noted that this is the only one of the grading options that is automatic. Each of the others requires additional input to the Registrar from the student, the department chairperson, or both. 2. The student may elect the Pass/No Pass option in the first semester of a two-semester Independent Study. In this case, the student completes the Independent Study application and a Pass/No Pass form, including the signature of the chairperson, and files it with the Registrar before the add deadline. This procedure differs from the normal Pass/No Pass regulations in that the instructor (i.e., the Independent Study adviser) knows about the use of the option and reports the grade directly as Pass or No Pass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">In some cases the department requires the Pass/No</head><p>Pass option in the first semester of a two-semester Independent Study. In this instance, the chairperson notifies the Registrar in writing prior to the add deadline. This note must include the name of each student involved. The chairperson should also indicate this requirement on the approval form given to the student when the student requests permission for Independent Study. 4. If the student elects the "no grade/double grade" option, then no grade and no course credit are awarded at the end of the first semester and two grades and two course credits are awarded at the end of the second semester. The use of this option must be approved by the chairperson of the department or program. This option must be indicated on the Independent Study application and cannot be selected after the two-week deadline. In other words, this option is viable only for an Independent Study originally designed to cover two semesters and for which it is not realistic to assign a grade halfway through the Independent Study. 5. For Independent Studies under the "no grade/double grade" option, the deadline to withdraw without record is the "withdraw-without-record" deadline for regular courses during the first semester. A withdrawal beyond that date, but during the first semester, will result in a "W" (withdrawal with record) on the student's transcript for only the first semester. <ref type="bibr">Withdrawal (after</ref> </p></div>			</div>
