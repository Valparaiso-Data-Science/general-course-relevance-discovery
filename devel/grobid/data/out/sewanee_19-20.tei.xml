<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sewanee students are encouraged to confront ultimate questions, to consider matters of the heart and spirit as well as intellect. They participate actively in the creation of both art and knowledge, and in so doing, gain abilities and attributes that will serve them well regardless of where their journeys take them. At Sewanee, we believe that rigorous study in the liberal arts offers students the best preparation for a life of leadership, service, and learning.</p><p>Before their senior year, and mostly within their first two years, students take a variety of general education courses that offer exposure to a variety of academic disciplines as well as training in written communication. They also take two non-credit courses in physical education, to acknowledge the importance of fitness and overall wellness in development of the whole person. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Requirements</head><p>To earn a bachelor's degree (bachelor of arts or bachelor of science), a student must:</p><p>• Complete 32 full academic courses (equal to 128 semester hours), plus two physical education credits; • Earn one PE credit by the end of the first year and an additional one by the end of the sophomore year 1 ; • Meet the general education requirements of the college before the beginning of the senior year 2 ; • Of the 32 academic full courses (128 semester hours) presented for a bachelor's degree, no more than 13 full courses (52 semester hours) may be presented in any single subject. Students and their advisors are strongly encouraged to develop a program of study for the junior and senior year that reflects breadth of involvement in disciplines beyond their principal academic interest; • Complete an academic major; • Attain a grade point average of at least 2.00 on all academic work at Sewanee; • Spend at least four semesters in residence, including the final two semesters; • Earn a minimum of 64 semester hours of credit at Sewanee. • Additionally, a student must satisfy all financial obligations to the University. The University will neither confer a degree nor provide transcripts to any student or former student who has unsatisfied financial obligations to the University.</p><p>During the first two years, many of the student's courses are options listed within prescribed categories of general education. During the last two years, a student's courses are usually selected from those offered in a major field of study but also include ample electives.</p><p>The College offers a broad undergraduate education in the arts and sciences rather than highly specialized training. Toward this end, and to fulfill the aims suggested by the fourth item listed above, no major is allowed to require more than 11 courses in the major field. In keeping with our liberal arts tradition and values, we recognize that our unique intellectual experience depends upon immersive engagement in the greater Sewanee academic community. Accordingly, degree-seeking students are required to engage in full-time residential study, and spend the final two semesters in residence (that is, not on a study-away program). It is in these final semesters that students are best situated to benefit from faculty mentoring, to pursue advanced research and study, to engage with their peers, and to contribute to the intellectual vitality of the University. During the final year, each student is required to pass a comprehensive examination in the major field before graduation. A student who at the time of the comprehensive examination does not have at least a 2.00 grade point average is not allowed to take the exam until the grade point average has been raised to that required level. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Exceptions may be made by petition to the College Standards Committee. A student must request and receive College Standards Committee approval to meet any general education requirement outside the time frame specified. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Typically, general education courses are taken and passed in the College of Arts and Sciences. Transfer students' coursework taken prior to admission to the college may be evaluated as possible substitutions for prescribed courses. Matriculated students may use coursework taken as part of a Sewanee-taught or Sewanee-approved study-abroad/study-away program to satisfy up to a maximum of two general education requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements for a Bachelor of Science</head><p>In addition to satisfying all requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, a candidate for the bachelor of science degree must:</p><p>• Complete a major in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, forestry, geology, mathematics, natural resources and the environment, neuroscience, physics, or psychology;</p><p>• Present four courses outside the major field from biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, physics, statistics, or those courses in environmental science, forestry, neuroscience, and psychology designated as meeting the general education requirement for observing, experimenting and modeling. • At least two of the four courses must be laboratory courses and all four must be taken at Sewanee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education Requirements</head><p>The overarching goals of Sewanee's general education requirements and the broader curriculum are congruent with the University's mission of encouraging students to grow in character as well as intellect. Sewanee trains students to be citizens prepared for a lifetime of leadership and compassionate service and provide opportunities in their classes and on this campus to take responsibility for their own lives and the lives of peers. Students are challenged to cooperate and collaborate, to engage in civil dialogue, and to analyze complex problems and produce creative solutions. The thoughtful engagement of students in coursework and other learning endeavors, on campus and beyond, builds the foundation for their active citizenship and for lives of personal fulfillment involving commitment to service, achievement, and a reverent concern for the world.</p><p>Sewanee's general education curriculum encourages intellectual curiosity and exposure to significant traditions and ways of seeing the world that our disciplines and interdisciplinary programs present. General education requirements are typically accomplished in the first two years of enrollment. 1 Mentoring of students by faculty, which includes close discussion of available courses and programs, offers solid footing for the student's choice of major and the longer-term rewards of lifelong learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Objectives 2</head><p>Learning Objective 1. Reading Closely: Literary Analysis and Interpretation. One course.</p><p>The ability to read closely provides a foundation for informed and reflective critical analysis that is fundamental to lifelong learning and literary experiences of lasting value. Instruction in reading closely equips students to pay careful attention to the constitutive details and stylistic concerns of significant works of literature so as to arrive at a meaning that can be defended with confidence. In addition to promoting responsible ways of taking a literary work of consequence on its own terms, courses satisfying this requirement enable students to become proficient at identifying, interpreting, and analyzing new ideas, perennial topics, universal themes, and vivid descriptions of sensory and internal experiences.</p><p>Approved courses for Learning Objective 1 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g1/). Learning Objective 2. Understanding the Arts: Creativity, Performance, and Interpretation. One course.</p><p>The need to create, experience, and comprehend art is a defining human activity. Learning in the arts fosters aesthetic development, self-discipline, imaginative insights, and the ability to make connections between seemingly disparate ideas and issues. Many courses provide insight into the discipline, craft, and creative processes that go into making a work of art, while others focus on analyzing and interpreting the products of that artistic creativity. Developing the ability to think in intuitive, non-verbal, aural, or visual realms enhances creativity, and provides students a way to address problems that do not have conventional solutions.</p><p>Approved courses for Learning Objective 2 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g2/). Learning Objective 3. Seeking Meaning: Wisdom, Truth, and Inquiry. One course.</p><p>The quest to answer fundamental questions of human existence has always been central to living the examined life. Through this learning objective, students examine how people in diverse times and places have addressed basic human questions about the meaning of life, the source of moral value, the nature of reality and possibility of transcendence, and to what or whom persons owe their ultimate allegiance. Courses that explore texts and traditions dedicated to philosophic questions and ethical inquiry, or that examine religious belief and practice as a pervasive expression of human culture, encourage students to develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be human.</p><p>Approved courses for Learning Objective 3 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g3/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Objective 4. Exploring Past and Present: Perspectives on Societies and Cultures. Two courses.</head><p>Curiosity about society and its institutions is central to the engaged life. In addition, informed citizens should have an understanding of individual and collective behavior in the past and present. To address the challenges facing the world today, citizens must understand how these challenges arise and the roles that individuals, communities, countries, and international organizations play in addressing them. Learning how to pose appropriate questions, how to read and interpret historical documents, and how to use methods of analysis to study social interaction prepares students to comprehend the dynamics within and among societies. These skills enable students to examine the world around them and to make historically, theoretically, and empirically informed judgments about social phenomena.</p><p>Approved courses for Learning Objective 4 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g4/). Learning Objective 5. Observing, Experimenting, and Modeling: The Scientific and Quantitative View. Three courses. One must include substantial quantitative, algorithmic, or abstract logical reasoning. One must be a science course with a substantial experiential or experimental component.</p><p>The study of the natural world through careful observation, construction and testing of hypotheses, and the design and implementation of reproducible experiments is a key aspect of human experience. Scientific literacy and the ability to assess the validity of scientific claims are critical components of an educated and informed life. Scientific and quantitative courses develop students' ability to use close observation and interpret empirical data to understand processes in the natural world better. As they create models to explain observable phenomena, students develop their abilities to reason both deductively and inductively.</p><p>Approved courses for Learning Objective 5 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g5/).</p><p>Approved courses for the Quantitative, Algorithmic, or Abstract Logical Reasoning component of Learning Objective 5 (http://ecatalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g5q/).</p><p>Approved courses for the Experiential or Experimental component of Learning Objective 5 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/artssciences/degrees/general-education-program/g5e/). Learning Objective 6. Comprehending Cross-Culturally: Language and Global Studies. One 300-level or higher foreign language course OR foreign language through the 200 (3rd semester) level together with one course in a related culture.</p><p>The cross-cultural comprehension requirement at Sewanee helps to prepare students for full citizenship in our global society. Upon completion of this requirement, students have developed a range of communicative strategies in a foreign language, recognition of another cultural perspective, and the capacity for informed engagement with another culture. These skills lead students to understand a variety of texts: oral, visual, and written. Students practice writing, public speaking, conversing, critical thinking, and textual analysis. Success in a foreign language gives students knowledge that they can apply broadly to academic and non-academic settings. The study of at least a second language is and always has been a hallmark of liberal arts education, providing not just access to the thought and expression of a foreign mentality and culture, but also a useful way to reflect on one's own mentality, language, and culture.</p><p>Approved courses for Learning Objective 6 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-education-program/g6/). Approved culturally-specific courses for Learning Objective 6 (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/generaleducation-program/g6cultures/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing-Intensive Course. Students complete a foundational writing-intensive course by the end of sophomore year.</head><p>A Foundational Writing-Intensive Course is built around casting thoughtful academic writing as a critical component of the thinking and learning processes. Not just an end goal, writing in these courses is seen as integral to discovering connections between and among ideas as well as offering creative and continual engagement with the course material. As any department might offer a Foundational Writing-Intensive Course, the structures of writing instruction may differ from course to course. However, all students will be expected to write at least 20-25 pages of prose that communicate what they have discovered in a clear and compelling manner. Moreover, any GFWI course will devote significant and dedicated class time throughout the semester to writing instruction, including argument and organization, use of evidence, mastery of academic English grammar and style, consideration of a piece's intended audience, and will prioritize strategies for responding to feedback through careful revision practices.</p><p>Approved Foundational Writing-Intensive Courses (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/general-educationprogram/gfwi/). Physical Education and Wellness. Two courses, not counted among the thirty-two full academic courses required for graduation, are required. One of these must be completed by the end of the first year and the second by the end of the sophomore year.</p><p>As the Greeks and Romans understood, healthy bodies and minds are closely connected and need to be cultivated together. Students are expected to take these courses in order to learn about the proper care of the body, the value of regular exercise, or to obtain an appreciation of individual and team sports. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Courses judged to be suitable for general education are tagged with one or two attributes (G1-G6), each attribute corresponding to one of learning objectives 1 through 6. Listing of the relevant attribution(s) for every qualifying courses can be found online, within the full roster of currently-offered courses on the Registrar's webpage, and this list is updated every semester. It should be remembered that, under the new general education model, students can continue to fulfill certain of their distribution requirements by taking courses in the interdisciplinary humanities program. While credit for courses offered in the School of Theology and approved by the College of Arts and Sciences may be applied to undergraduate degrees in the College as elective credit, such courses may not be used to satisfy general education requirements. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Students who perform exceptionally well on Advanced Placement exams (scores of 4 or 5), high-level International Baccalaureate exams (scores of 5, 6, or 7), or A-level exams (grade of B or higher) are considered to have fulfilled appropriate learning objectives. More information is available here (p. 167).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Majors Major Fields of Study</head><p>To receive a bachelor's degree, a student must declare and complete the requirements for a major field of study. A major consists of more than a collection of courses. Each department or committee offering a major helps students plan a coherent program of study. Having the deadline for declaring a major allows this planning. In addition, before graduation, a student must pass a comprehensive examination in the major, demonstrating critical and creative abilities as well as an understanding of the principles of the subject. Comprehensive examinations are graded either using the usual pattern (A+, A, A-, <ref type="bibr">B+, etc.)</ref> or Pass/Fail, as each major department or committee chooses. Those using Pass/Fail grading may also choose the category "Pass with Distinction."</p><p>During the second semester of the second year, a student selects a major field of study under the following guidelines.</p><p>1. To be accepted as a major in a particular field of study, a student must have maintained at least a 2.00 GPA in the courses already taken in that field. A student who has completed two years of study and is in good academic standing, but who has not achieved a 2.00 GPA in the intended major field of study, may be permitted to register for one additional year. A student who, at the end of an additional year, is still not qualified to declare a major will not be permitted to enroll again. 2. Each candidate for a degree must complete a writing-intensive component in the major that exposes the student to the conventions of writing and research expected in a given discipline. 3. Each candidate for a degree must pass a comprehensive exam in the major field of study. To be eligible to take the comprehensive exam, a student must have a 2.00 GPA in the major field and have been accepted as a major at the beginning of the semester before the semester in which the exam is to be taken. 4. No more than two courses (eight semester hours) used to satisfy requirements for a major may be used to fulfill requirements for another major, minor, or certificate of curricular study.</p><p>There are thirty-seven majors from which to choose. For information on requirements for specific majors, please refer to Programs A-Z (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences-programs/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special (Student-Initiated) Majors</head><p>Certain interdisciplinary majors, individualized to meet a student's needs and goals, may be initiated by students. Such majors must provide benefits not obtainable through established majors. After consultation with the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs, a student may complete a form designed for special majors and submit this for consideration by the Curriculum and Academic Policy Committee. If the proposal is approved by the committee, it goes on to the faculty for approval.</p><p>A specified faculty coordinator, with other participating faculty (usually two additional), is responsible for advising students and administering comprehensive exams in each independent major. These majors adhere to the rules of other majors. No Pass/Fail courses can be included in the independent major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors and Certificates of Curricular Study</head><p>A student may choose to complete a minor field of study or, where appropriate, a certificate of curricular study in an academic discipline, but doing so is not required for graduation. A certificate recognizes a program of coursework that involves a relatively large proportion of practicum training and requires a capstone project. A certificate is mostly intended to encourage mastery of a particular skill germane to liberal arts study; it is typically more specialized than either a major or minor field of study.</p><p>A minor or certificate is designated on the student's permanent record and transcript in addition to the required major. A student may declare a minor or certificate in the fourth semester, but no later than the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of W in the student's last term of enrollment prior to graduation. At the time of declaration, the student must have maintained at least a 2.00 GPA in the courses already taken in that subject. In addition, the student must graduate with at least a 2.00 GPA in the minor or certificate.</p><p>Each department or program has the option of requiring or not requiring a comprehensive examination in the minor subject or for the certificate. Should a scheduling conflict between a student's major and minor comprehensive examinations arise, this is resolved by rescheduling the examination in the minor or certificate.</p><p>No more than two courses (eight semester hours) used to satisfy requirements for a minor or certificate of curricular study may be used to fulfill requirements for a major or another minor or certificate of curricular study.</p><p>There are forty-six minors/certificates from which to choose. For information on requirements for specific minors/certificates, please refer to Programs A-Z (http://e-catalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences-programs/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second Degrees, Majors, and Minors</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for a Second Bachelor's Degree</head><p>Students who have already received either the B.A. or the B.S. degree may wish to obtain the other bachelor degree. In order to receive that other degree, the student must successfully complete all requirements for the other degree (including a major) and at least eight additional full courses while enrolled as a regular full-time student in the college for two additional semesters. Students may not receive two B.A. degrees or two B.S. degrees from Sewanee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Earning an Additional Major, Minor, or Certificate of Curricular Study after Graduation</head><p>Students who have already received the B.A. or B.S. degree and wish to earn an additional major, minor, or certificate of curricular study may do so by successfully completing at least eight additional full courses while enrolled as a regular full-time student in the college for two additional semesters and by fulfilling all requirements for the additional major, minor, or certificate of curricular study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees with Honors, Valedictorian, and Salutatorian</head><p>For degrees conferred prior to May 2021: A student who fulfills the degree requirements with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.75 graduates summa cum laude. A student with a GPA of at least 3.50 and less than 3.75 graduates magna cum laude. A student with a GPA of at least 3.25 and less than 3.50 graduates cum laude.</p><p>For degrees conferred in May 2021 or thereafter: A student who fulfills the degree requirements and is in the top five percent of his or her class graduates summa cum laude. A student in the top fifteen percent of his or her class (but not in the top five percent) graduates magna cum laude. A student in the top twenty-five percent of his or her class (but not in the top fifteen percent) graduates cum laude.</p><p>In addition, a student deemed worthy of special recognition in the department or program of the academic major graduates "with honors" in the major. (This is generally separate from a "with distinction" evaluation on a comprehensive examination, although departments and programs establish their own criteria for graduation "with honors.")</p><p>The College Standards Committee declares class valedictorian and salutatorian. These students must be members of the Order of the Gown and must have pursued a full college course of study (128 credit hours) at Sewanee. Exceptions may be made for students spending no more than two semesters at an officially sanctioned off-campus program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departments and Interdisciplinary Programs</head><p>Students at Sewanee may select from thirty-seven major programs. Student initiated majors are also possible. Interested students should see the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs. Students are assigned a faculty advisor in their major and come to know other students in the program. Seniors in the same major celebrate the completion of their comprehensive examinations, the capstone experience of the major.</p><p>A major consists of more than a collection of courses. Each department or committee offering a major helps students plan a coherent program of study. The Office of Career and Leadership Development and faculty advisors in the major help students make the transition between Sewanee and life beyond the Mountain.</p><p>Although students interested in careers in business, education, engineering, law, or medicine cannot major in these subjects at Sewanee, they will receive excellent preparation for the world of work or post-graduate study through careful selection of courses and by taking advantage of internships, research opportunities, advising, and co-curricular events such as lectures and networking with alumni. <ref type="bibr">African</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African and African American Studies</head><p>Website: African and African American Studies (https://new.sewanee.edu/programs-of-study/african-and-african-american-studies/)</p><p>African and African American studies offers an interdisciplinary minor that encompasses the study of Africa and its peoples, the global dispersal of Africans as enslaved labor or voluntary immigrants, and the historical and contemporary experiences of African Americans in the United States. The minor consists of courses drawn from across the spectrum of academic opportunities offered in the humanities and social sciences at Sewanee. It encourages students to reflect on the significance of race and its intersection with class, gender, ethnicity, religion, and sexuality in shaping the historical and contemporary experiences and contributions of peoples of African descent. Students pursuing the minor choose one of two tracks: a) an Africa and the African diaspora track that focuses on the peoples of the African continent; or, b) an African American studies track that encompasses the history and culture of black peoples in the United States.</p></div>

The major is typically assembled from the fields of history, literature, anthropology, politics, religion, and art history. The Junior Seminar for majors introduces students to important methodological and theoretical problems in the study of American culture. During the first semester of the senior year, students undertake an independent and interdisciplinary research project.

Many of our courses provide opportunities for this kind of research on campus and in neighboring towns. Additionally, every student majoring in anthropology is required to complete a semester-long field methods project either in the United States or abroad. Students interested in cultural anthropology are especially encouraged to study abroad as they will gain invaluable experience and expertise in cross-cultural interaction and research through such experiences.</p><p>Field methods credit may also be obtained through completion of an archaeological field school through the University of the South or other pre-approved program in the United States or abroad. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Certificate</head><p>Although a major or minor is not currently offered in creative writing, students, regardless of the major field of study, may earn a certificate of curricular study in creative writing. Students are expected to declare the certificate before the Spring semester of their junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Certificate in Creative Writing</head><p>This certificate of curricular study requires successful completion of the following: English majors must present a single literature course offered through a department of classical or modern languages that has the prior approval of the director of the certificate in creative writing. The course may be either in the original language or in translation; if the course is in the original language, the course must surpass the minimal standards of the College's general education requirements. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The capstone project could be a sheaf of poems or short stories, a more substantial single piece of fiction such as a novella, or a one-act play. Students must present the capstone project before the end of the first semester of their senior year, demonstrating thereby their mastery within and critical self-consciousness regarding a particular genre. Because the successful completion of the capstone project requires careful planning and supervision, we strongly advise that students declare the certificate before the Spring semester of their junior year.</p></div>

The program's spread of curricular options enables majors to develop not only depth of exposure to certain fields and methodologies of study, but also cross-disciplinary breadth of understanding. This broad-gauged outlook is crucial for graduates looking to address the inherently interdisciplinary challenges of environmental study in today's world.</p><p>A major asset of the Environmental Studies program at Sewanee is the unparalleled opportunity for field study available throughout the University's 13,000-acre land-base, commonly known as "the Domain," and its "living laboratory" for inquiry. This extensive tract includes extensive woodlands, lakes, trails, caves, and bluffs that surround the central campus and encompass the residential village of Sewanee. </p></div>

Students pursuing the certificate take a range of courses that focus on water resources and watershed science. In addition to hydrology, students take at least one half-course in applied watershed science, and choose additional watershed science courses from a list that contains offerings in a variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, forestry, geology, and environmental studies. Each student completes the certificate with the watershed science capstone course, a multidisciplinary, project oriented course in which students address issues related to two or more of the following topic areas: the interaction of biological processes and watershed function, chemical processes in streams and watersheds, the relationship between forested landscapes and hydrologic systems, or geological processes in terrestrial aquatic systems. The capstone project may be a semester project created solely for the capstone, or may begin as a watershed-related summer internship project that is further developed by the student during an academic semester.</p><p>Students who obtain the certificate will be better prepared to pursue graduate training in watershed science and other hydrologic disciplines, or to begin careers associated with watershed science and management.</p><p>Students deciding to pursue the certificate should contact one of the faculty members of the Watershed Science Certificate Organizing Committee to develop his or her study plan. The organizing committee is also available to help a student identify his or her area of emphasis and primary faculty supervisor for the ESCI 430; together the student and primary supervisor identify the second discipline and arrange to work with a faculty member in that area.</p></div>

First, it offers an interdisciplinary grounding in environmental science and policy. Second, it examines how the areas of environmental arts and humanities inform and are informed by the perspectives of environmental science and policy. Finally, as the defining core of the major, students explore how the arts and humanities enrich our understanding of humanity's complex, evolving relation to the world we inhabit and inform our responses to the many dimensions of environmental issues.</p></div>

The minor in religion and environment encourages students to integrate religious insights and spiritual experience with the natural and social sciences to better understand how religion and the natural world affect one another. Accordingly, the minor includes coursework in natural and social environmental science along with coursework in religion. Because the minor encourages students to reflect on their own spiritual experience and beliefs as they relate to the environment, it culminates in a capstone experiential course involving environmentally-related service or action along with reflection on the meaning of that engagement.</p><p>The minor is offered by interdisciplinary faculty in conjunction with the environmental studies program and the Center for Religion and Environment and is administered by the Center's director.</p></div>

The seminar interrogates the question: What do historians do? It does so by exploring three interrelated questions: a) What approaches or categories do historians employ to study the past? b) How do historians talk to each other? and, c) How do historians write history? These questions are investigated with reference to texts, both ancient and modern, chosen at the individual instructor's discretion, that allow students to gain an appreciation for multiple categories of historical analysis (e.g., gender-based, environmental, materialist, military, cultural); for the practice of historiography; for the multiple categories of source materials and the methods involved in selecting, processing, and evaluating historical evidence; and for the varied rhetorical or narrative styles of history writing. In addition, the seminar asks students to engage in a substantial amount of writing, on both individual and multiple texts.

The seminar will guide students towards this goal, through individual, group, and class work, by emphasizing the multiple steps required in such a serious undertaking. These steps include the articulation of a clear and effective research question, the gathering of secondary and primary sources, the choices and opportunities involved in different writing styles, and the necessity of multiple drafts, especially a formal rough draft that will be due two thirds of the way through the semester. The seminar instructor will provide substantial assistance to students at every step of the research and writing process, including extensive comments on the rough draft.</p><p>Students will need a grade of C or better on their senior research paper to be eligible to undertake an oral presentation and defense. In awarding a grade lower than C, the seminar instructor will consult with at least one other member of the history department. Such students will be given a specific set of recommendations for revision. Once their papers have reached a C-level, they will be eligible for the oral presentation and defense. Each student will have the opportunity to present their paper in a condensed form to a panel of history department members, who will then engage the student in a question and answer period.

The program will accept a total of three elective courses from a semester abroad, and four elective courses from a year abroad, as well as any language courses taken. In the rare case where a student is unable to study abroad, the student must petition the international and global studies program committee by the spring of their junior year to be allowed to fulfill this requirement by taking one extra course in their geographic area at the 300-level or above plus one extra language course in any non-English language.</p></div>

Students who take Physics and Astronomy courses develop a robust understanding of fundamental physical principles-the essence of "how the world works"-as well as valuable reasoning, problem-solving, and experimentation skills. Physics majors also delve into advanced theoretical topics, utilize research-grade instrumentation and data analysis tools, participate in faculty-led and independent research projects, both on campus and at other institutions, presenting their findings at department seminars and national conferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Observatory</head><p>The Cordell-Lorenz Observatory is an instructional laboratory for astronomy courses offered by the department of physics and astronomy and also for public observations. Programs throughout the year and open hours every Thursday evening from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. (weather permitting) while classes are in session, encourage both academic and enrichment activities.</p><p>Sewanee's largest telescope for public observations is a 10-inch Schmidt-Newtonian reflector. There are also other 10-inch and one 3.5-inch telescopes which are often used, as well as large binoculars. The dome houses a classic 6-inch refracting telescope crafted by Alvan Clark and Sons in 1897. It has been restored to its original quality and historical appearance by Dr. Francis M. Cordell Sr. of the Barnard Astronomical Society.</p><p>For research purposes, one 0.35 and five 0.30 meter (14 and 12 inches) telescopes on computer controlled mounts are housed in several small roll-off sheds on the roof of Carnegie Hall. These telescopes have sensitive CCD detectors which are used to monitor newly discovered asteroids, comets, supernovas, gamma ray bursts, and variable stars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Politics</head><p>Website: Politics (https://new.sewanee.edu/programs-of-study/politics/)</p><p>Politics majors critically engage with competing values and interests that guide and orient politics. Students learn about concepts, theories, and principles that deal with the nature, purpose, and characteristics of government and political change, which they apply in the analysis of politics. The major encompasses the theoretical and empirical study of government institutions, leadership, conflict resolution between and within states, political ideas and ideologies, political culture and discourse, political economy, and the politics of gender, race, and class. While introductory courses help to ground students in fundamental theories and concepts used in the study of politics, seminars and many 300-level courses provide students opportunities to develop their research and analytical skills while also introducing students to how to write within the discipline. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Major in Politics</head><p>The major requires successful completion of the following: Students contemplating professional careers in international affairs are encouraged to take several upper-level courses in economics (for example, microeconomics, macroeconomics, and international economics). Students considering graduate work in politics are encouraged to take POLS 407, several economics courses, statistics, and at least one semester of upper-level coursework in political theory. Those students interested in pre-law are strongly urged to take courses in Anglo-American history and constitutional development, political theory, economics, and logic. The Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) is required for all schools and should be taken early in the senior year. 2 A course may fall into more than one concentration, but students may apply it toward satisfying only one of their chosen concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>A 400-level seminar course may be applied either to one of the politics concentrations or to the electives required to reach the eleven-course minimum requirement. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For the comprehensive examination, students must respond to one question from a panel of questions for each of their three selected concentrations. Independent studies and honors projects will be placed in appropriate categories by the chair of the department. The public affairs internship course (POLS 445) is excluded from coverage on the comprehensive examination and counts as a course outside the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>Students who have taken a minimum of six politics courses, including POLS 300,with a departmental grade point average of at least 3.40 may request enrollment in POLS 450 during the fall of their senior year. As a condition for enrollment, a preliminary research proposal must first be approved by the department's faculty. Departmental honors are awarded to a student who maintains a grade point average of 3.40 or higher in departmental courses, submits an honors paper of at least B+ quality, and receives distinction on the comprehensive exam. Candidates for honors also make an oral presentation of their honors paper to an audience of departmental faculty and students.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-professional Programs</head><p>Sewanee offers pre-professional programs in five areas of study: business, education, engineering, health professions (including dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, and nursing), and law. Students interested in a pre-professional program should meet with an advisor soon after matriculation to plan appropriate courses of study and to learn more about graduate school admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Business</head><p>The Wm. Polk Carey pre-professional business program prepares students for careers and leadership positions in business, finance, and entrepreneurship. The program embraces three key components: the business minor, the Babson Center for Global Commerce, and the Carey Fellows program. The business minor offers a program of academic study meant to provide both practical skills and a deeper understanding of the business environment. Business minors can apply during the fall of their sophomore year to become Carey Fellows.</p><p>The designation as a "Carey Fellow" signifies that the student has qualified for the honors track in the business minor and brings with it both a mark of distinction (including a certificate of recognition and scholarship assistance to defray costs associated with the off-campus internship) and a more in-depth and rigorous curriculum for the student.</p><p>The Babson Center for Global Commerce provides advice and guidance to pre-business students, works with the Office of Career and Leadership Development to facilitate internship opportunities, and manages the transition of graduates to business-related jobs and careers. The Center also hosts campus visits of distinguished business leaders and speakers, and supports various business-related programs and events at the college.</p><p>For more information about the Carey Fellows program, please refer to the page for the b (p. 54)usiness minor (p. 54).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Education</head><p>Sewanee offers a minor in education that prepares students for graduate programs in teaching, research, administration and other areas of education. Sewanee and Peabody College of Education at Vanderbilt University have formalized an agreement that allows students who carefully plan their coursework at Sewanee to complete M.Ed. degrees and teaching licensure requirements in secondary, elementary, special education, and additional fields in as little as three semesters. A trip to Peabody each fall helps familiarize students with opportunities for graduate studies in education.</p><p>For more information, please refer to the minor in education (p. 78) program page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineering</head><p>Engineers put the discoveries of science to practical use, often altering our way of life with their work. Because of the narrow scope of many engineering programs, several leading engineering schools cooperate with selected liberal arts colleges to combine the professional training found in the usual four-year engineering curriculum and the breadth of education given in liberal arts colleges. Such a program requires five years -three years in the liberal arts college and two years in the engineering school.</p><p>The University of the South offers such programs in association with the following institutions: Columbia University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Vanderbilt University, and Washington University in St. Louis.</p><p>Sewanee has a four-member faculty committee that works closely with these institutions to advise prospective engineering students on their academic programs and help them decide whether engineering is an appropriate professional choice. After successful completion of three years of academic work recommended by the Sewanee Pre-engineering Committee, the student is eligible for admission to one of the above engineering schools, on recommendation by the committee. After two years in engineering school, the student receives baccalaureate degrees from both Sewanee and the engineering school. Alternatively, some students may opt to complete four years of work at Sewanee, and then go to engineering school.</p><p>The program is compact, and it is not always easy for a student to arrange a schedule in such a way as to include all necessary preprofessional courses as well as all courses that Sewanee requires for the degree. Entering students who are considering engineering as a profession should consult a member of the engineering committee before registering for their first classes. In general, all first-year students in this program take a foreign language, PHYS 101, PHYS 102, MATH 101, and MATH 102. (Those students who plan to study chemical engineering or some related field may choose to take CHEM 120 or CHEM 150 in their first year.)</p><p>A student in the pre-professional engineering program may major in chemistry (p. 56), computer science (p. 108), mathematics (p. 110), or physics (p. 121).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Health Program</head><p>Students interested in medicine, dental medicine, or veterinary medicine should register with the chair of the Health Professions Advisory Committee soon after matriculation. Meetings with the chair of this committee benefit students who seek academic advice, summer program recommendations, permission to take courses at other institutions, and other help in preparing for a career in these fields.</p><p>Since entrance requirements may vary from one medical/dental/veterinary school to another, the student should become acquainted with the requirements of likely candidate schools for graduate work. The following materials available on reserve in the duPont Library and in the office of the committee chair list requirements for these three types of schools: 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>) Medical School Admission Requirements, United States and Canada; 2) ASDA's Guide to Dental Schools: Admission Requirements; and, 3) Veterinary Medical School Admission Requirements in the United States and Canada.</head><p>Students should also consult the requirements posted on the website or consult the Dean of Admissions at the schools that you plan to attend.</p><p>Students who expect to apply to professional programs in the health sciences during their senior year must take the appropriate admissions test before the beginning of their senior year. Preparation for both the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and the Dental Admissions Test (DAT) includes two semesters of biology with a laboratory component (usually BIOL 133 and BIOL 233 and an advanced biology course chosen in consultation with the chair of the Health Professions Advisory Committee), a year of general chemistry (CHEM 120 and an upper level laboratory chemistry course like biochemistry), a year of organic chemistry (CHEM 201 and CHEM 202), and a year of physics (PHYS 101 and PHYS 102). These courses need to be completed prior to the senior year so that the student can take the MCAT before the fall of that year. Although not required, additional courses in biology can provide excellent preparation for the MCAT. The MCAT also requires one semester each of introductory psychology (PSYC 100), introductory sociology (MHUM 110), and statistics (STAT 204). Students who are planning to take the Veterinary Admissions Test (VAT) may postpone physics until the senior year, since physics is not required for the VAT. Preveterinary students should note, however, that many veterinary schools require the MCAT or the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) instead of the VAT.</p><p>Courses that medical and dental schools are most likely to require, in addition to the eight listed above, include math (or calculus), two English courses (writing across the curriculum does not meet this requirement), and biochemistry. Courses that veterinary medical schools are most likely to require, in addition to the ones above, are microbiology, biochemistry, and animal science. A student who expects to apply to a school with an animal science requirement needs to consult the chair of the Health Professions Advisory Committee about methods of meeting this requirement. For admission to schools requiring animal science courses, a student may attend summer school at, or take a correspondence course from, a university with a program in this field. The student should receive approval of the veterinary school that he/she is applying to before enrolling in a summer school or correspondence course. In addition to completing these courses, premedical students are expected to complete the general requirements of the college and the requirements of their major.</p><p>Students should be aware that medical schools generally expect a letter of evaluation from the Health Professions Advisory Committee in addition to any individual letters that a student may have submitted on their behalf. During the spring semester of the junior year or the fall semester of the senior year, all students applying to professional schools will be interviewed by members of the committee. This process is intended to assist the student in preparing for interviews at professional schools and to help the committee in preparing a letter of evaluation.</p><p>Students in the college who plan to register with the Health Professions Advisory Committee for its evaluation and who plan to take at another institution any of the courses required for admission to a professional school must consult the chair of the University Health Professions Advisory Committee and the Sewanee Registrar to obtain their approval.</p><p>A suggested sequence of courses for pre-health students: At least one year of biology, two years of chemistry, and one year of physics should be completed by the end of the junior year in order to take most admissions tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Nursing Program</head><p>Under the Vanderbilt Liberal Arts-Nursing 4-2 Program, a student spends the first four years of college at Sewanee and the remaining two calendar years at Vanderbilt studying in one of the nursing specialty areas that Vanderbilt offers. In addition to a bachelor's degree from Sewanee, students successfully completing the program earn a master of science in nursing from Vanderbilt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Law</head><p>The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) does not prescribe specific courses or activities for preparation to study law. The undergraduate is best advised to concentrate on areas of study aimed at developing oral and written expression, language comprehension, critical understanding of the human institutions and values closely related to law, and a logical and systematic approach to solving problems.</p><p>The choice of a major field of study is far less important than the choice of courses designed to achieve these ends. The pre-law advisor consults with students interested in a career in law about appropriate courses of study and about specific law schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology</head><p>Website: Psychology (https://new.sewanee.edu/programs-of-study/psychology/)</p><p>Psychology is a diverse discipline that borders on the biological and social sciences. It is at once a science and a means of promoting human welfare. Reflecting its historical roots in philosophy, physiology, and clinical practice, it embraces a variety of theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and areas of study. The Department of Psychology at Sewanee provides majors and non-majors with the basic principles of psychology within the context of a liberal arts education through a curriculum that emphasizes scientific thinking and equips majors with multiple perspectives and research methods with which to understand behavior and mental processes.</p><p>The major in psychology combines a broad grounding in psychology with opportunities for depth in selected areas. Majors in psychology begin with an introduction to empirical psychology, organized topically, and a course in research methodology that prepares students to design and carry out research. Students also choose survey, seminar, and upper-level laboratory courses in areas such as abnormal, behavior modification, cognitive, developmental, gender, industrial, personality, physiological, and social psychology.</p><p>Advanced students may study independently or conduct research under faculty supervision, work as laboratory assistants, or aid faculty members with research. Summer internships are available through the Tonya Public Affairs Internship Program (http:// careers.sewanee.edu/internships/endowed-internship-funds/) for those who are interested in gaining experience in business or public service. For those students planning to do graduate work in psychology, STAT 204 is highly recommended. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sewanee-at-Yale Directed Research Program</head><p>For more than ten years, undergraduates from Sewanee have spent six to eight weeks working in a research laboratory during summer internships at the Yale Child Study Center in New Haven, Connecticut. Through this experience, students have been exposed to research in a clinical setting and to the day-to-day workings of a behavioral neuroscience research laboratory. They have worked with school-aged children participating in developmental studies, administered developmental and cognitive assessments, and learned about database management. Over the summer months, only a small number of students have had sufficient time to complete a small project from the steps of gathering data to completing the analysis and writing a research manuscript. The Sewanee-At-Yale Directed Research Program is intended to provide directed research experience for Sewanee students who wish to be exposed to an active developmental and behavioral neuroscience research laboratory in a medical school setting and to have the experience of carrying through a directed research project in greater depth over a somewhat longer time frame. Although participation in the program is not restricted by year or major, we expect it will be particularly appealing to students majoring in biology or psychology and to pre-medical students with other majors; participation during the junior or senior year is generally recommended.</p><p>During their time at Yale, students will typically work on one or more research projects, participate in weekly research meetings, and participate in a research methods seminar and at least one upper-level seminar offered by the Child Study Center. Each student will be sponsored by a Sewanee faculty member, who will serve as advisor, set the requirements, and assist the student in developing a written plan of study. The student should work collaboratively with his or her Sewanee faculty advisor, the directors of the program at Sewanee and at the Yale Child Study Center, and any other designated Yale faculty mentors to insure that the written plan of study can feasibly be completed at the Child Study Center. Normally, the minimum final requirement for the program will be a written report of the completed research; individual faculty advisors may set alternative equivalent requirements.</p><p>For any given student, the typical program duration will be one semester plus a summer, in either order. During their time New Haven, students are expected to be involved in data gathering and data analysis. The written report of the work could be completed in New Haven, or after leaving New Haven while maintaining active contact with the program director and other faculty mentors at the Child Study Center. More information about the program is available at: sewanee.edu/academics/psychology/programs/sewanee-at-yaledirected-research-program.php (http://sewanee.edu/academics/psychology/programs/sewanee-at-yale-directed-research-program.php).</p><p>To be accepted into the program, students typically complete the following: </p></div>

Religious studies courses are designed to raise and reflect upon the central and abiding questions that challenge us all: What is the nature of religion? How does religion live in so many different and interesting ways in human culture? How do human beings throughout history express their deepest beliefs, concerns and faiths? Where do we find and how do we make sense of the Holy? What are our moral commitments and obligations? As citizens of the new millennium, how then shall we live in light of computers and in the shadow of concentration camps? From antiquity to postmodernity, China to Chattanooga, religion is encountered as shaping human experience. At Sewanee, the Department of Religious Studies, students and faculty together, through formal classes, independent study, and co-curricular activities, investigate the role of religion and the many faces it presents.</p><p>Religion is not one field of study but many; by nature the study of religion is a multi-disciplinary effort that requires investigation of history, culture, values, sacred texts, theology, and philosophical thought. Such study requires familiarity with methods of historical analysis, literary criticism, phenomenological description, and cross-cultural, comparative study. For this reason the study of religion complements well other majors, the women's and gender studies minor, and curricular interests.</p></div>

Majors will study the methods and theoretical paradigms of feminist and queer research, focusing on how theorists and scholars in the interdisciplinary field of women's and gender studies have critically engaged, challenged, and revised categories of philosophical and political thought, including liberalism, socialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, and post-colonialism. They will learn how feminist methodologies have reshaped the ways we approach knowledge in the traditional disciplines and how they form the basis of gender, sexuality, queer, and masculinity studies. Students are encouraged to investigate historical and contemporary contributions of women as well as the significance of gender as a cultural construction in the social and natural sciences, in the arts and literature, and in religion. They will also analyze the multiple ways in which gender influences our individual and collective assumptions in local and global contexts and informs diverse political and social debates. </p></div>

We will examine 1) the changing historical meanings of these myths from the colonial period to the twentieth century and 2) the gender aspects of these myths. Not open to new first-year students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 346 Contemporary Social Movements (4)</head><p>This course examines 1) some of the major social and political ideologies of the 20th century (such as liberalism, socialism, nationalism, feminism, environmentalism); 2) theories of social and political movements in modern societies and market democracies; and 3) concrete examples of such social and political movements in the contemporary world. Not open to new first-year students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 358 Gender and Human Rights Seminar (2)</head><p>An examination of the legal and institutional structures developed to advance women's human rights and capabilities globally, and the barriers to securing these rights. Scholarship and case studies from the U.S. and other countries and regions, especially in Uganda and East Africa, invite students to examine the strengths and weaknesses of a legal approach to addressing issues such as reproductive rights and justice, abuses during incarceration and detention, violence against women and girls, land rights, and bodily integrity and autonomy.</p><p>Prerequisite: Only open to students admitted to the Uganda summer field study program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 359 Gender and Human Rights: Field Study in Uganda (2)</head><p>Field study in Uganda provides students with the opportunity to examine gender and human rights from an East African perspective. In this two week study abroad course, students engage with and learn from East African faculty, policy specialists, and experts on human rights issues of greatest concern to women and girls in the region. Three years of college preparatory mathematics (two years of algebra, one of geometry) are considered the minimum preparation for a student to attempt the required mathematics course at Sewanee; most entering students have taken four years of math.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Entrance Examination Options</head><p>Applicants must submit either SAT or ACT scores, or apply as a test optional candidate. Information on the SAT and ACT is available from the applicant's secondary school or counselor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test of English as a Foreign Language</head><p>To be competitive with other applicants, non-native English speakers should present a minimum internet-based TOEFL score of 90 or a minimum International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score of 7. The University does not offer a conditional admission program for students lacking fluency in English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homeschooled Applicants</head><p>Sewanee welcomes applications from homeschooled students. The Coordinator for Homeschool Admission asks that such applicants complete additional steps so that the talents, strengths, and accomplishments of each applicant may be fully understood.</p><p>• The Common Application's Homeschool Supplement allows the homeschool supervisor to explain educational philosophy, grading scale, and outside evaluation. • A letter of recommendation from a teacher, tutor, or professor outside the applicant's immediate family provides insight into the rigor of curriculum. • SAT and/or ACT results provide the Committee on Admission with a standardized reflection of the applicant's preparation for Sewanee's rigorous curriculum. • An interview with a member of the admission counseling staff may be conducted in person, by phone, or via teleconference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Campus Visits</head><p>Campus visits for prospective students are not required for admission but are strongly recommended. The campus visit is one example of student-initiated interest in the University that the Committee on Admissions considers when making admission decisions. A typical visit includes a group information session with an admission counselor and a student-led tour with optional opportunities for attending a class, meeting with a faculty member or coach, or an informational interview with a current student. Other special visit opportunities include residential life tours, specialized facility tours, and lunch with a student host.</p><p>Students may schedule a visit by registering at the Office of Admission's website (http://www.sewanee.edu/admission/visit/on-campusvisits/). Group information sessions and campus tours are available year round and non-evaluative interviews are available during the academic year. Campus tours are offered regularly throughout the year in both the morning and afternoon. On select Saturday mornings during the academic year, a group information session with campus tour is offered at 10:30 a.m. All non-evaluative interviews are conducted by carefully selected and trained seniors in the college, and provide a formal opportunity for prospective students to engage with a current student. Interviewers are interested in learning about not only the student's academic achievements, but also about their extracurricular activities and interests.</p><p>Group information sessions and campus tours are available year round and non-evaluative interviews are available during the academic year.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Decision Plan</head><p>Early Decision is an option for those students who consider Sewanee their first choice. If admitted under the Early Decision plan, an applicant agrees to withdraw all applications to other colleges and universities and enroll at Sewanee. There are two Early Decision opportunities for which students may apply. Early Decision candidates are eligible to be considered for all potential financial aid awards through both the academic scholarship and/or need-based financial aid processes.</p><p>Applicants who are NOT admitted under Early Decision are released from their binding agreement and may be deferred to the regular admission cycle. These deferred candidates must submit a completed Mid-Year Grade Report, along with any additional supporting documentation, if applicable, in order to receive full consideration under regular admission.</p><p>The student applying for Early Decision should:</p><p>1. Indicate "Early Decision I" or "Early Decision II" on the Common Application. Complete and submit the binding Common Application Early Decision Agreement. 2. Submit all required documentation on or before November 15 for Early Decision I, or January 15 for Early Decision II. If all documentation requirements are not met by the respective application deadline, the application will be treated as a regular decision application. 3. A student admitted to the University under either binding Early Decision plan agrees to withdraw any applications to other colleges and to enroll at Sewanee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Admission After the Junior Year</head><p>Students may apply for admission after the junior year of high school. Although Sewanee does not encourage early admission to the college, this plan is sometimes appropriate for select students. The Early Admission candidate should have exhausted most of the academic courses offered by his or her high school and be ready academically, emotionally, and socially for the college environment.</p><p>An Early Admission candidate must complete the same requirements and meet the same deadlines as a regular candidate with the following additions:</p><p>1. An interview is required on campus with either a member of the admission staff or a member of the Committee on Admissions.</p><p>2. Written recommendation and approval must be received from the candidate's counselor, principal, or headmaster for Early Admission action, including a statement that the student is prepared emotionally, academically, and socially for success in the college environment. 3. The candidate should present academic credentials as strong as or stronger than the average student who typically enrolls at Sewanee (i.e., an A-/B+ average in academic courses from high school and at least 1860 on the SAT or 28 on the ACT). 4. The candidate must state (in writing to the Committee on Admissions) why he or she wants to forego the senior year in high school and enter college as an Early Admission student.</p><p>Although the committee prefers that the candidate meet all requirements for the high school diploma, this is not a requirement for acceptance as an early admission candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Applicants</head><p>Students seeking to transfer to the college from other accredited colleges must complete the Common Application for transfer students, the College Instructor Evaluation form, and the Registrar's Report. In addition, transfer applicants must submit a final high school transcript, official transcripts from each college attended, and either official SAT or ACT exam scores.</p><p>Quarter hours are converted to semester hours at two-thirds face value. Thus five quarter hours equal three semester hours.</p><p>To receive a degree, students transferring from other institutions must meet the college's graduation requirements. Each such student must spend at least four semesters in residence in Sewanee enrolled on campus as a full-time student. Because each student must earn at least 64 semester hours of credit at Sewanee, transfer credit is limited to 64 semester hours.</p><p>The application deadline for transfer candidates is April 1 for the fall semester and November 15 for the spring semester. Decision notification for both deadlines is on a rolling basis. Students entering in the 2019-2020 academic year are subject to the Sewanee pledge. Under this pledge, students who meet Sewanee's academic and social expectations will graduate (with one major) in four consecutive years; those that do not and have met the necessary expectations will be provided up to one additional year of study tuition-free.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition and Fees</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2019-2020 Fees for Full-Time Undergraduate Students</head><p>The guaranteed comprehensive fee schedule remains in effect for undergraduates matriculating in prior years: <ref type="bibr">2017-2018, $58,000; 2016-2017, $54,500.</ref> In planning for college expenses, families should also take into consideration such items as books, supplies, personal items, and travel; the cost of these expenses is estimated to be anywhere from $2,200 to $3,000 per year.</p><p>A $500 reservation deposit is paid by incoming transfer and first year students. The semester tuition bill is reduced by payment of this deposit. The deposit is not refundable after published refund dates, except for serious illness, loss of financial aid, or academic suspension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fees for Part-Time Undergraduate Students</head><p>Tuition for part-time undergraduates initially matriculating in the 2019-2020 academic year is $1,470 per semester hour. For part-time undergraduates who matriculated earlier, the per-semester-hour fee is as follows: <ref type="bibr">2018-2019, $1,425; 2017-2018, $1,425; 2016-2017, $1,375</ref>. Part-time students auditing an undergraduate course are charged tuition of $370 per semester hour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Fees</head><p>Some courses carry additional fees, which are published in the schedule of classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment</head><p>One-half of yearly fees (tuition, activities fee, room, and board) is due by July 31 prior to the Advent (fall) semester with the second half due by December 31 prior to the Easter (spring) semester. Payment for the semester, less reservation deposit and financial aid actually awarded, is due in its entirety by the dates above. Failure to pay by these dates results in a late penalty which is 1.25% of the past due amount.</p><p>Because of the substantial amounts that must be paid in July and December, the University offers the following ways to assist families in making payments:</p><p>1. Financial aid and loans are available to students who qualify. 2. Parents may utilize the federal parent loan for undergraduate students in addition to a four-or five-month payment plan. 3. Electronic checks and credit cards are accepted for tuition through the payment plan option at Tuition Management Systems (https:// sewanee.afford.com/).</p><p>Students and parents are strongly advised to seek further information about financial aid and loans from the Office of Financial Aid. Completed applications for financial aid and loans should be submitted in accordance with deadlines established by that office so that funds are available and applied to students accounts by the payment due dates.</p><p>Any balance remaining on the student bill, after credit for financial aid or deferred payment plans, must be paid in full by the due date; the University accepts monthly or other deferred payment only by means of the plans mentioned above. Satisfactory handling of a student's account is necessary to register and obtain a transcript of grades.</p><p>Tuition bills and monthly statements will be available through students' Sewanee Afford accounts, where payment may be made via electronic check or credit card. Payments may also be mailed to the Cashier's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refunds</head><p>A student may withdraw from the University only through consultation with the Office of the Dean of Students. Withdrawal is official only upon approval by that office and the withdrawal date indicated by that office is used to determine the nature and extent of any refund. The following policy applies:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Recipients without Federal Title IV Aid and Non-aid Recipients</head><p>Refund of fees is made only for reasons of illness and if the percentage of the term completed is 60% or less. The refund is calculated by prorating fees for the period from the date of withdrawal to the end of the semester. The amounts to be prorated are one-half of the semester's total tuition and room charges, and three-fourths of the board charge. No refund is made for any other fees or if more than 60% of the term has been completed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Recipients with Federal Title IV Aid</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Financial Matters</head><p>Students should take precautions to protect personal belongings from theft, fire, water damage, or other loss. University insurance does not cover personal losses; however, family homeowner's insurance may provide coverage for such losses.</p><p>A student using a personal automobile for a class field trip or other University business should have a valid and appropriate driver's license and vehicle liability insurance. The University does not cover the vehicle, owner, driver, or passengers if an accident occurs.</p><p>A student who participates in athletics must use his or her family insurance to pay for injury that occurs during practice, play, or travel. In such instances, University insurance may cover a portion of medical expenses in excess of family coverage. University insurance does not, however, cover medical expenses for injuries incurred in a student activity or in off-campus programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>The College of Arts and Sciences follows the principle of assisting students based on a combination of financial eligibility and academic qualifications. Sewanee provides more than $24 million in institutional aid each year. Eligibility for financial aid is determined by an analysis of the family's financial situation (income, assets, and allowances against those) and the student's academic qualifications, using procedures established by the federal government and the institution.</p><p>Sewanee allocates a number of aid funds to provide the maximum number of students with assistance. No student should hesitate to apply for admission to Sewanee for lack of personal and family funds.</p><p>In determining eligibility for aid, a student's total budget is considered, including tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies, personal expenses, and travel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How to Apply for Need-Based Financial Aid</head><p>All new and returning students begin the need-based aid application process by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available at www.FAFSA.gov (http://www.FAFSA.gov). The required Title IV code for Sewanee is 003534. Tennessee residents applying for HOPE scholarship funds must file a FAFSA to be considered for HOPE funds.</p><p>The priority deadline for applying for Financial Aid is February 1 for all college students, current and prospective. Institutional applications must be postmarked and the FAFSA submitted to the processor by March 1 to ensure consideration for aid for the following academic year.</p><p>Whenever possible, students should apply for scholarships from local sources or other programs to augment Sewanee's aid. All applicants are required to apply for relevant state grants and for the Pell Grant awarded by the federal government. Failure to apply for aid from outside sources may result in the loss of eligibility for assistance from Sewanee. Receipt of aid from any source or of any type (including loans) must be reported to the Office of Financial Aid at Sewanee.</p><p>Financial aid awards are made to prospective student applicants during March and April. Returning students notifications begin after grades are posted for the Easter (spring) term.</p><p>Details are available through the Office of Financial Aid (http://admission.sewanee.edu/financial-aid/) and on the University's Website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renewal of Aid</head><p>All need-based scholarship and Hope Scholarship recipients must reapply for aid each year. The procedure for reapplying is the same as outlined above. The priority deadline for renewal of aid applications is February 1 prior to the academic year for which aid is required.</p><p>Continuing students, with complete financial aid applications, receive their financial aid awards in June. Awards are made in sequential order based on the date all financial aid materials received.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions for Renewal and Continuation of Aid</head><p>1. The student must enroll and complete a minimum number of hours during each semester for which aid is received. For scholarships this minimum is twelve semester hours. For all other financial aid programs, this minimum is six semester hours. It should be noted that retention standards of the College are separate and can be found under Student Classification, Progress, and Status. 2. The student and family must reapply and establish eligibility for each academic year.</p><p>3. The student must make satisfactory academic progress defined as: a) maintenance of a minimum GPA of 2.00 average on a 4.00 scale; b) achievement of a passing grade for semester hours attempted; and, c) completion of a degree in not more than eight semesters. 4. All fees and charges due the University must be paid prior to the beginning of each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Awards</head><p>Need-based financial aid awards consist of a combination of scholarship, grant, loan, and work-study assistance. The University participates in the following U.S. Department of Education financial aid programs 1 . These programs are fully described on the Office of Financial Aid Website (http://admission.sewanee.edu/financial-aid/).</p><p>In addition, the University awards scholarships from University appropriations and annual gifts, and participates in two tuition exchange programs, the National Tuition Exchange (http://www.tuitionexchange.org/) and the Associated Colleges of the South (http:// colleges.org/). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Payment Programs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ten-Month Payment Plan</head><p>The University participates in an installment payment plan whereby parents can pay the annual cost of a Sewanee education over a ten-month period. Information on this installment payment plan may be obtained from Tuition Management Systems (https:// sewanee.afford.com/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scholarships</head><p>Sewanee scholarships come from over 200 endowed scholarship funds, annual gifts, remissions of tuition, and additional amounts budgeted from the University's operating funds. As previously mentioned, many of these scholarships are awarded on the basis of calculated need-based eligibility, and applicants are automatically considered for these scholarships as part of the normal need-based financial aid award process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for Scholarships</head><p>First-year students who wish to apply for scholarships should do so through the Office of Admissions. The deadline for applying is December 1. Selections are made on a competitive basis. A limited number of awards are available to non-first-year students and recipients are selected by the individual academic departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for Need-Based Scholarships</head><p>All new and returning students begin the need-based aid application by completing the FASFA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) (https://fafsa.gov/). Details are available through the Office of Financial Aid (http://admission.sewanee.edu/financial-aid/) and on the University's Website. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies and Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Advising</head><p>Although each student has ultimate responsibility for becoming familiar with and meeting graduation requirements, the College believes that conscientious and well-informed advising on an individual basis is an important part of the academic program. Each student is assigned an advisor from the faculty or administration whose responsibility it is to help plan and supervise the student's academic program and to be available on other matters. An academic advisor approves the student's schedule of courses at registration and should be consulted with regard to any subsequent changes.</p><p>Academic advisors work closely with the director of advising, the dean of the College, the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs, the dean and associate deans of students, the University counselors, and the registrar. Students are frequently referred to these and other offices for advice and assistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Year</head><p>The academic year is officially defined as encompassing the Advent (fall) and Easter (spring) semesters. For those who enroll in summer school, the academic credit is associated with the preceding terms as part of the same academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assistance for Students with Disabilities</head><p>The University of the South is committed to fostering respect for the diversity of the University community and the individual rights of each member of its community. In this spirit, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University seeks to provide students with disabilities reasonable accommodations that are needed to ensure equal access to the programs and activities of the University. The University provides a number of services to support the academic work of all its students (including tutoring and study skills programs). Additional accommodations can be made through the University's Student Accessibility Services (SAS) specifically for students with learning disabilities, mobility limitations, certified visual and hearing impairments, and other functional limitations as defined by the ADA. Students are expected to discuss the accommodations recommended by SAS with their professors at the beginning of each semester.</p><p>In addition to accommodations, Student Accessibility Services (SAS) provides consultation and advocacy for qualified students with disabilities. SAS values relationships with students, seeks to promote pride in the value of one's disability-related experience, and empowers students to self-advocate by providing them with necessary skills and support. Students may contact Student Accessibility Services by phone at (931) 598-1325 or email at sas@sewanee.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head><p>The University expects all students to engage fully in the educational process and to contribute actively to the intellectual environment. Accordingly, the University considers class attendance an essential component of student engagement: students are expected to attend every scheduled meeting of a class, including laboratories and other required meetings. Any student who fails to attend a class has the absolute obligation of communicating with the instructor prior to the missed class (or, in unusual cases, within 24 hours of having missed the class).</p><p>Instructors have the prerogative to set attendance policies for their individual classes and to determine what absences are "excused" or "unexcused," and they can determine at what point tardiness or other inappropriate behavior is better defined as "absence." Instructors will outline their policies in their syllabi. Still, as a whole the faculty follow these principles:</p><p>1. A student may be excused for University business (authorized extracurricular activities) as long as he or she has contacted his or her instructors in advance; if not, the instructor will ordinarily consider the absence "unexcused." For example, athletes should communicate with faculty before traveling to away games, and volunteer firefighters should inform faculty at the beginning of the term that they may be called to duty at unexpected times. 2. According to a policy approved by the director of athletics, the University Advisory Committee on Athletics, and the College Faculty:</p><p>normally, varsity athletes should not miss more than three 50-minute class meetings (or the equivalent) per course per semester to attend varsity sporting events. Athletes should not miss any classes or labs because of practice. 3. A student may be excused at the discretion of the instructor for illness and/or a family emergency. Any student who misses multiple days for such reasons should also contact the dean of students to explain the circumstance (and the instructor should also inform the dean of students of the need to intervene). Examples of unexcused absences include oversleeping, forgetting a class, missing a ride, having travel arrangements that preclude attending class, and attending a social event. 4. Certain days are classified as "no cut" days: students who are not members of the Order of the Gown who are absent for any reason on the last day before or the first day after a break are placed on attendance warning for the remainder of the semester. 5. Students are responsible for all work discussed, including announcements, even when the absence is excused. 6. Should a student be absent from a class during which an examination is to be given or a paper is due, or at the time of a final exam, the instructor ordinarily gives a zero.</p><p>At any point when an instructor in any course (including physical education) has decided that the attendance or general performance of any student (including members of the Order of the Gown) is unsatisfactory, the instructor may request the dean of students to issue a warning. This warning specifies that not more than one unexcused absence may be taken after the warning is issued. Any additional unexcused absence results in automatic exclusion from the course. A student who has been dropped under these circumstances is marked WF and the grade counts in the grade point average as an F. A student on attendance warning may not withdraw from a class voluntarily after taking a second unexcused absence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exam Rescheduling</head><p>With the approval of the teacher or teachers involved and the associate dean of undergraduate academic affairs of the College, students may arrange their exam schedules so that they are not compelled to take three examinations on one calendar day or more than three examinations on any two consecutive calendar days in the examination week. Every such arrangement must be completed by the last day of the semester. Whenever possible, the morning examination will not be changed. Permission will not be granted to schedule an examination outside the regular examination week, except in case of illness. If a student has a course under an instructor who teaches more than one section of the course, the student may take the final examination with another section if the instructor gives permission.</p><p>Regarding comprehensive examinations:</p><p>1. Students will not be excused from classes in order to prepare for a comprehensive exam.</p><p>2. No student shall be required to miss class in order to take a comprehensive exam. Students whose comprehensive exam (in whole or in part) is scheduled in conflict with a scheduled class should approach their department chair about rescheduling the comprehensive exam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Registration</head><p>The Office of the University Registrar produces a schedule of classes and establishes dates and times for registration each semester. All students are expected to give thoughtful consideration to the selection of courses before consulting their faculty advisor. Students are considered registered if they appear on the course roster as indicated specifically in Banner. Further, individual students assume full responsibility for compliance with all academic requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adding and Dropping Courses</head><p>Students may drop and add courses subject to the following policies and procedures:</p><p>1. During the first 10 days of a semester, students may add and drop courses online. After that, schedule changes are made by submitting a completed schedule adjustment form to the University Registrar's office. 2. During the first five class days of a semester, a student may add a course with the approval of his or her advisor. After the fifth class day, the student must also secure the approval of the instructor in order to add a course. 3. A course dropped during the first four weeks of classes is not entered on the student's record. 4. A course dropped after the fourth week of classes, but before the Tuesday following the first Monday in November (for the Advent semester) or the Tuesday following the first Monday in April (for the Easter semester) is recorded on the student's record with a grade of W, which does not count in the grade point average. 5. A course dropped later than the first Monday in November (for the Advent semester) or the first Monday in April (for the Easter semester) will be recorded on the student's record with the grade of WF, which is counted as a grade of F. 6. Students are responsible for the accuracy of their course registrations. They may check their course schedule online at any time through their student account. No change in registration is official until it has been submitted and accepted online or until the proper form, bearing the appropriate signatures, has been received and recorded by the Office of the University Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auditing Courses</head><p>Some students, particularly non-degree-seeking students, may wish to audit or "sit in" on a course for the sake of learning. To register for an audit, a non-degree-seeking student must apply and register online (https://engage.sewanee.edu/register/non_degree_app/). Degree-seeking students who wish to audit a course should first determine if such an arrangement is agreeable to the instructor. Next, the student must register for the course online following the standard procedure. Once registered, the student must complete a schedule adjustment form obtained through the Office of the University Registrar and have that formed signed by the course instructor and the student's advisor. The student's record will then reflect a grade of AU. If the student has more than 19 hours for that semester, a request for credit overload in the College (http://registrar.sewanee.edu/downloads/forms/Request_for_Credit_Overload_Form.pdf) must be submitted.</p><p>Auditors are expected to attend course regularly. The extent to which an auditor participates in graded exercises (e.g., submits papers, takes tests) and the extent to which an instructor grades an auditor's work are determined by mutual agreement between the instructor and the auditor. Although neither formal academic credit (semester hours) nor grade is given for auditing, the designation AU may be recorded on an official college transcript for a registered auditor whose instructor indicates that the student has met the instructor's expectations for auditing by submitting to the registrar an AU designation on a grade sheet provided at the end of the term in which the audited course occurred. The course add deadline applies for audited courses as well as for courses taken for semester hours credit. In other words, a student cannot initiate the auditing or change the status of a course being taken for credit to that of auditing after that deadline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Courses</head><p>Students planning to repeat a course previously completed should indicate this fact at the time of pre-registration/registration. Failure to do so can result in an inaccurate record or a change of credit hours; and may delay graduation. Though hourly credit is awarded but once, when a course is repeated both grades are shown on the permanent record card. Only when the earlier grade was lower than C-will both grades be calculated into the cumulative grade point average. However, in order to achieve the 2.00 grade point average required for graduation or the average required to re-enroll, a student may elect to repeat any course where the grade earned is below C-. For the purpose of computing these averages (for internal use) only the latter grade will count even if it is a lower grade. A student with C-or above in a first (or only) taking of a course will have only that grade counted in the Sewanee grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System</head><p>Student work is evaluated according to the following system: A for excellent, B for good, C for satisfactory, D for passing, F for failing, I for incomplete work (see below), W for withdrawn, WF for withdrawn failing, and P for passing in a Pass/Fail course. Grades are recorded in the Office of the University Registrar, and, with the exception of I, may not be changed except in cases of clerical error. Such changes -i.e., those based on a clerical error should be made no later than the semester following the one in which the original grade was given.</p><p>The grade I (incomplete) is given only when a professor deems that a student has failed to complete the work of a course for legitimate and unavoidable reasons. The incomplete must be replaced with a grade within one week after final examinations. An extension exceeding one week requires that a student supply very clear evidence of extenuating circumstances to the associate dean of undergraduate academic affairs of the College. Such extensions can be granted only by that office. Class standing and eligibility for graduation are determined by the number of semester hours and cumulative grade point average a student has earned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeal</head><p>A student who believes that he or she has been assigned a course grade which is unfair or inappropriate, and who has been unable to resolve the matter with the faculty member directly, may appeal to the College Standards Committee. Appeals should be initiated no later than the semester following the one in which the grade in question was given. Such appeals are made by letter to the committee via the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs and are taken up as regular agenda items at the next scheduled meeting. The associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs informs the faculty member involved of the appeal and invites this faculty member to respond to the student's claim.</p><p>The concept of academic freedom as practiced at the College prohibits the committee or any administrative officer from forcing a faculty member to change a grade. Therefore, an appeal serves more as a form of peer review than an appeal per se. The committee may suggest a solution to the dispute, may request that both the faculty member and the student justify their positions, and may require the faculty member to review a grade in light of clearly new and substantial information. The committee may also recommend legislation to the faculty that might prevent conflicts from occurring in the future.</p><p>All faculty members should be aware that they may be asked to justify their personal grading procedures and should keep adequate records of class performance. In addition, faculty should not request grade changes later than the semester following the one in which the grade in question was given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/Fail Courses</head><p>A degree-seeking student may elect to have up to 8 semester hours (the equivalent of 2 full courses) graded on a Pass/Fail basis, with no more than 4 semester hours so graded in any given term. Courses utilizing only Pass/Fail grading and courses transferred from other institutions do not count toward the 8-semester-hour maximum.</p><p>• A grade of D-or above converts to "P" (Pass), which is not computed in the student's GPA.</p><p>• Courses converted to the Pass/Fail grading option may not be used in fulfillment of requirements for a major, minor, or certificate of curricular study but may be used to satisfy general education and elective degree requirements. • Some professional and graduate schools insist that certain courses required of applicants be taken on a graded basis.</p><p>• Converted grades are used in calculating the student's transcript GPA, which will be used in determining eligibility to enroll, receive financial aid, and graduate; course grades originally issued by the instructor will be used in determining class rank as well as eligibility for the Dean's List; Order of the Gown; Phi Beta Kappa; graduation, departmental, and athletic honors; membership in academic honor societies; awards and prizes; and in most other instances where grade point average is among the criteria considered. • The decision to convert a course to the Pass/Fail grading option may not be revoked; once the change has been made, the original grade does not appear on the student's transcript and cannot be sent by the Office of the University Registrar to any third party including graduate and professional schools. • A course may not be designated as Pass/Fail if a final grade of F has been assigned by the instructor or as the result of an Honor Code sanction.</p><p>Students may designate a Pass/Fail grading option through the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of W in the last term of enrollment prior to graduation, whether the course is one still in progress or one in which a grade has already been recorded. Such designation is made through the Office of the University Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dean's List</head><p>To qualify for the Dean's List, a student must have a semester average of 3.625 or higher after completing a semester with credit for at least three and one-half academic courses, at least three of which were taken for a grade. This list is published each semester by the Office of the Dean of the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honor and Recognition Societies</head><p>The following honor and recognition societies have active chapters at the University.</p><p>• Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776 and the nation's oldest honor society, promotes the values of the liberal arts and sciences by inducting into membership the most outstanding arts and sciences students in the nation's leading colleges and universities, and by advocating academic excellence, freedom of inquiry and expression, informed deliberation and understanding, and active engagement with important issues. The University's Phi Beta Kappa Chapter, Beta of Tennessee, was installed in 1926. Students are eligible for election to the Society after six consecutive semesters. • Omicron Delta Kappa, Alpha Alpha Chapter, is a national leadership society. It chooses members from the Order of the Gown who have distinguished themselves in scholarship, athletics, or publications. • Pi Sigma Alpha, Gamma Sigma Chapter, is the national political science honor society that encourages intellectual interest and action in government. The chapter sponsors occasional lectures and events related to political science during the course of the year. • Sigma Pi Sigma, the national physics honor society, accepts members from physics and related fields who attain high standards of scholarship, professional merit, and academic distinction. • Omicron Delta Epsilon, Gamma Chapter of Tennessee, is the national honor society of economics. Students with outstanding records in economics are selected for membership.</p><p>• Sigma Delta Pi, Kappa Chapter, is the national Spanish honor society. Members are elected based on academic merit and interest in Hispanic culture. • Alpha Epsilon Delta, Tennessee Epsilon Chapter, is the national premedical honor society. It rewards excellence in premedical scholarship. Associate members are welcome from all the pre-health professions, including premedical, predentistry, prenursing, and preveterinary fields. Members are elected from junior and senior associate members. • Phi Alpha Theta, Alpha Delta Gamma Chapter, is the national history honor society. Members are elected based on the study, teaching, or writing of history. • Delta Phi Alpha is the national German honor and recognition society. Members are elected based on academic merit and interest in Germanic culture. • Psi Chi is the national honor society in psychology, founded in 1929 for the purposes of encouraging, stimulating, and maintaining excellence in scholarship, and advancing the science of psychology. Membership is open to students who have distinguished themselves in scholarship and are majoring or minoring in psychology or a program that is psychological in nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Status, Academic Progress, and Student Classification Enrollment Status</head><p>A full-time student is one who is enrolled in at least three full courses or their equivalent (12 semester hours). Degree-seeking students are required to be enrolled on a full-time basis during the Advent (fall) and Easter (spring) semesters, even in cases where fewer than 12 semester hours are required to complete degree requirements.</p><p>A part-time student is one who is enrolled in fewer than three full courses or their equivalent (fewer than 12 semester hours). Degreeseeking students are not permitted to enroll on a part-time basis during the Advent and Easter semesters, even in cases where fewer than 12 semester hours are required to complete degree requirements.</p><p>Degree-seeking students are also required to engage in full-time residential study and spend the final two semesters in residence (that is, not on a study-away program); for more about the residency requirement and other degree requirements, please see http://ecatalog.sewanee.edu/arts-sciences/degrees/degree-requirements/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progress for Degree-Seeking Students</head><p>All degree-seeking students are expected to enroll in four full courses or their equivalent (16 semester hours), and those eligible for and seeking to take advantage of the Sewanee Pledge must maintain such a course load to remain eligible. Degree-seeking students must maintain full-time status as defined above.</p><p>Academic progress standards are checked at the end of every academic term, including the summer term. A student who fails to meet these standards may be placed on warning, suspended, or dismissed from the University.</p><p>Decisions about academic status, including eligibility for academic warning, suspension, or dismissal, are based on objective evidence and may not be appealed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good standing:</head><p>Degree-seeking students who meet the following standards for satisfactory academic progress are in good standing and are eligible to reenroll the subsequent academic term (whether the Advent or Easter semester or the summer term):</p><p>• Students who have earned up to 35 semester hours in residence in college (that is, not counting examination credit 1 ) must have a cumulative GPA of at least 1.85 and a semester GPA of at least 1.0; • Students who have earned more than 35 semester hours in residence in college (that is, not counting examination credit) must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00 and a semester GPA of at least 1.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic warning:</head><p>Students who do not meet standards for satisfactory academic progress yet meet these conditions will be placed on academic warning:</p><p>• Students who have earned up to 35 semester hours in residence in college (that is, not counting examination credit 1 ) who meet either of these conditions:</p><p>• Cumulative GPA at least 1.85 but semester GPA below 1.0 (but above 0.00; see below); or, • Cumulative GPA below 1.85 but semester GPA at least 1.0; • Students who have earned more than 35 semester hours in residence in college (that is, not counting examination credit 1 ) who meet either of these conditions:</p><p>• Cumulative GPA at least 2.0 but semester GPA between 1.0-1.49; or, • Cumulative GPA below 2.0 but semester GPA at least 1.5.</p><p>Students will be informed of their status by the dean of the College. While not in good standing, they may re-enroll the following academic term, and upon their return in the next academic term (whether the Advent or Easter semester or the summer term), these students will be required to meet with both their advisor and an associate dean of the College to develop an academic plan that addresses the deficiencies and outlines specific steps for improvement.</p><p>Students will receive only one warning semester before being suspended. Any student on academic warning who does not achieve good standing by the end of the next immediate academic term of enrollment (whether the Advent or Easter semester or the summer term) will be placed on academic suspension immediately. As well, any student who is placed on warning, then performs well enough to return to good standing, but then in a later semester fails to meet progress standards will be suspended immediately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic suspension and dismissal:</head><p>Students who meet these conditions will be placed on academic suspension or, if appropriate, dismissed from the University:</p><p>• Any student earning a semester GPA of 0.00, regardless of hours earned or cumulative GPA; • Students who have earned up to 35 semester hours in residence in college (that is, not counting examination credit) who have both a cumulative GPA below 1.85 and a semester GPA below 1.0; • Students who have earned more than 35 semester hours in residence in college (that is, not counting examination credit) who meet either of these conditions:</p><p>• Cumulative GPA below 2.0 and semester GPA below 1.5; or, • Semester GPA below 1.0, no matter the cumulative GPA.</p><p>Students who qualify for academic suspension are suspended for one semester on the first occasion. Such students may apply for reinstatement and, if reinstated, will be allowed to return on academic warning and will have one semester to meet stated standards.</p><p>Students who qualify for academic suspension a second time will be either suspended for two full semesters or, if the cumulative GPA is below 1.5, dismissed permanently. Students who qualify for academic suspension for a third occasion will be dismissed permanently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Classification</head><p>A first-year student has earned fewer than 32 semester hours (eight full academic courses or their equivalent).</p><p>A second-year student, or sophomore, has earned at least 32 semester hours (eight full academic courses or their equivalent), but fewer than 64 semester hours (16 full academic courses or their equivalent).</p><p>A third-year student, or junior, has earned at least 64 semester hours (16 full academic courses or their equivalent), but fewer than 96 semester hours (24 full academic courses or their equivalent).</p><p>A fourth-year student, or senior, has earned at least 96 semester hours (24 full academic courses or their equivalent).</p><p>1 "Examination credit" includes credit earned through Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and British A-level examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawals, Leaves of Absence, and Reinstatement</head><p>The University expects that students who have matriculated in the College will remain enrolled as full-time students each semester, either at the University or on an approved study away program, until graduation. However, for a variety of reasons, a student or the University may determine that the student's enrollment at the University should be interrupted or cease altogether: students may seek a formal leave of absence, or they may withdraw voluntarily, or they may be withdrawn involuntarily as when suspended for academic, disciplinary, or other reasons. The registrar notes leaves of absence and withdrawals on students' transcripts. By definition, a leave of absence is meant to be temporary. Depending upon circumstances, a withdrawal may be considered temporary, and, after fulfilling any conditions predetermined by the University, the student may apply for reinstatement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leaves of Absence</head><p>The college may grant a leave of absence, for up to two semesters, for intellectual or personal development, including participation in an approved study away program (whether foreign or domestic). Students wishing a leave must submit a formal request for leave, stating their specific plans for the period of absence and the planned date of return, via an online form. (Students pursuing a formal, recognized study away program will work directly with the Office of Global Education.) A dean will review the request and communicate with the student, explaining any conditions of the leave, before formally confirming the leave of absence. A student who meets the conditions may return as planned as a full-time student without applying for reinstatement. Students who have not met the conditions at the conclusion of the leave of absence are withdrawn from the college and must apply for reinstatement as described below.</p><p>The deadlines for submission of leave of absence applications for the Advent and Easter semesters are August 1 and January 1, respectively. Students who do not meet these deadlines but spend a semester or more away from Sewanee forfeit any deposit, are considered "withdrawn," and must apply for reinstatement. A second reservation deposit is necessary to reserve a space in the college for the semester of planned re-entry.</p><p>Normally, students returning from an approved leave of absence do not have to apply for reinstatement but instead need only complete a "return to campus" notification by April 1 for the following Advent semester or November 1 for the following Easter semester. Students who do not meet these deadlines will be re-classified as "withdrawn" and must apply for reinstatement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voluntary Withdrawals</head><p>Voluntary withdrawals include those for medical or other personal reasons either during a semester or following a semester (i.e., between semesters). All voluntary withdrawals during a semester must be reviewed by the dean of students and only become official when the dean of students, after consultation with relevant offices, so designates. The dean of students will confirm the withdrawal with the student and will communicate any conditions for departure and reinstatement. (Students who indicate they are not returning after the conclusion of a semester are classified as "not returning"; see below.) When a student's withdrawal takes place during a semester, then the student receives no credit for the semester and the student must leave within twenty-four hours of notification of withdrawal. For any withdrawal, the student may return to the Domain only with written permission from the Office of the Dean of Students. Students seeking information on the University's refund policy should contact the treasurer's office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Withdrawals:</head><p>Students who seek to withdraw during a semester to receive treatment for any health-related concern should contact an appropriate medical provider for supporting documentation in order to have the medical withdrawal approved by the dean of students. Such students must apply for reinstatement. The dean of students will confirm the withdrawal with the student and will communicate any conditions for departure and reinstatement. At the time of application for reinstatement, an appropriate medical professional must confirm with the University Wellness Center that the student clearly demonstrates readiness to return and safely resume academic work at the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal Withdrawals:</head><p>Students who choose to leave the University during a semester for non-medical reasons must meet with the dean of students for an exit interview and to confirm the voluntary withdrawal in writing (through an online form). The dean will confirm the student's intentions and status. Such students who want to return must apply for reinstatement.</p><p>"Not returning": A student in good standing who, having completed a semester, does not return to the University for the subsequent semester will be classified as "not returning" and will have to apply for reinstatement. Students are asked to communicate their intentions to the dean of the College via the online form rather than simply not show up the next term. Students who are "not returning" will have their status confirmed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Involuntary Medical Withdrawal Policy</head><p>Student well-being is highly valued at The University of the South. The University of the South is committed to providing equal access to educational programs to all students, as well as reasonable and appropriate accommodations to students with disabilities to allow them equal access to those programs. However, when situations arise where a student is unable or unwilling to carry out substantial self-care obligations, or a student's medical condition or effects of a medical condition pose a significant risk to the health or safety of others, or create significant disruption to and interference with the rights of other students or to the ability of the University to function efficiently, the University will consider whether the student will be administratively withdrawn.</p><p>The determination will include an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence, to ascertain both the probability, nature, duration, and severity of the disruption, threat, or impairment as well as whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures can mitigate the risks of allowing the student to remain enrolled. When this assessment indicates that a student poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others; or poses an actual risk to their own safety not based on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities; and the student does not want to take a leave voluntarily, the vice president for student life and dean of students, with appropriate consultation, has the authority to administratively withdraw the student.</p><p>Students who are withdrawn through this process may apply for reinstatement. At the time of application for reinstatement, the student must provide appropriate medical documentation to demonstrate a readiness to return and safely resume academic work at the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Involuntary Withdrawals (Suspensions)</head><p>In certain cases the University may require a student to withdraw. This latter practice is also known as suspension, and the University reserves the right to suspend and in some cases expel a student who is not fulfilling minimal academic standards of performance or who has violated the Honor Code or the Code of Conduct, as per the EQB Guide.</p><p>Students who are suspended are required to remain off-campus for the remainder of the semester, if the withdrawal occurs during a semester. Furthermore, students who are suspended for violating the Honor Code or Code of Conduct (or who voluntarily withdraw in the face of allegations of such violations) may be required to remain off-campus for one or more entire semesters and may return to the Domain only with written permission from the dean of students.</p><p>In some cases a student may be required to meet one or more additional conditions to be considered for reinstatement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinstatement</head><p>Students who withdraw or who are suspended from the College may apply for reinstatement unless specifically indicated at the time of withdrawal. (Students returning from an approved leave of absence should see that section above.) Applications for reinstatement are available through the Sewanee Website. Students must return the completed application and any required materials by April 1 for the following Advent (fall) semester or November 1 for the following Easter (spring) semester. Reinstatement during summer terms is not normally permitted. Students returning from an approved leave of absence must confirm their intent to return by the same deadlines.</p><p>Reinstatement is never guaranteed and is never automatic. A faculty-staff committee meets in the weeks following each deadline and makes its decision after reviewing the application with all supporting materials as well as the student's academic and conduct records at the University. The committee reserves the right to require additional documentation that the student is qualified and ready to return to rigorous academic work and abide by community standards. At its discretion, the committee may require an on-campus or phone interview. Furthermore, reinstatement decisions are always pending available space, and applicants should know that decisions regarding financial aid are made separately from the reinstatement process.</p><p>The committee looks for evidence that an applicant is ready to return to all aspects of college life and be successful. The committee will not reinstate students if required progress toward graduation is not feasible, or if continued separation is considered to be in the best interests of the student, the University, or both. The decision of this committee is final; there are no appeals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit New First-Year Students</head><p>Because academic success at the University of the South almost always requires four full years of high school preparation, the University does not normally award transfer credit for college courses earned at another college or university prior to a student's graduation from high school. Students may be considered for placement in higher-level courses on the basis of such course work.</p><p>Students wishing to transfer college credits earned during the summer prior to enrollment at the University of the South must have those courses approved for transfer in advance by the Office of the University Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and A-level Credit</head><p>Graduation credit in fulfillment of general education requirements and for elective courses may be obtained through many of the Advanced Placement (AP), and International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level tests and GCE A-level examinations. Credit will be awarded subject to the following guidelines: A student earning a 4 or 5 on a given AP examination, or a 5 or higher on IB higher level tests or a grade of B or higher on A-level examinations may be deemed to have met one general education learning objective aligned with that AP examination, as determined by the Curriculum and Academic Policy Committee and the College Faculty.</p><p>• Students may earn a maximum of eight course credits (32 semester-hours) for satisfactory AP, or IB or GCE A-level examination results. • A maximum of one elective course credit (four semester hours) may be awarded for a score of 4 or 5 on an AP examination or a score of 5, 6, or 7 on a higher-level IB examination or a grade of B or higher on an A-level examination in most subject areas as identified in the lists below. • If a student presents satisfactory scores on AP, and IB and A-level examinations in the same subject area, credit is awarded for only one examination except if a student presents satisfactory scores on two distinct examinations in the subject areas of economics, history, or politics where a maximum of two elective course credits (eight semester hours) may be awarded in those areas.</p><p>A current list of alignments follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AP Examination Satisfies IB Examination Satisfies A-Level Examination Satisfies Art History G2</head><p>Anthropology <ref type="formula">G4</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>The College allows some transfer credits for students who have been enrolled as degree seekers at another college or university prior to enrolling at Sewanee. The Office of the University Registrar assesses transfer work on a course-by-course basis to determine comparability to courses offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and applicability toward a University of the South program of study. Academic work with a grade of C or above from other institutions is generally accepted for credit hours only. (No credit will be accepted for a grade of C minus or lower.) Grades for such courses appear on the transcript, but they are not figured for GPA, final class ranks, academic honors, or eligibility for membership in the Order of the Gown. As each degree-seeking student must earn at least sixty-four semester hours of credit at Sewanee, transfer credit is limited to sixty-four semester hours.</p><p>Quarter hours are converted to semester hours at 2/3 their face value (example: five quarter hours equal three semester hours).</p><p>The University of the South does not award transfer credit for course work taken on a non-credit basis or for "life experiences."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students planning to take courses during a summer session at another institution must obtain permission from the Office of the University Registrar to attend and approval of specific courses to be taken. Forms are available in the Office of the University Registrar.</p><p>Students seeking to enroll in a Summer study abroad program other than a Sewanee summer abroad program must also have the approval of the associate dean for global education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Credit for Internships</head><p>A student awarded academic credit for a supervised internship through an approved off-campus program of study (e.g., study abroad), who also has prior approval from the major department to count the internship as part of the major, is normally allowed to transfer this academic credit to count toward a degree at Sewanee. This transfer of credit is subject to the approval of the associate dean of undergraduate academic affairs. Internships that are associated with such programs of study but are outside the discipline of the major are considered on a case-by-case basis by the College Standards Committee. Public affairs internships may serve as the basis of enrollment in POLS 445 through which credit may be earned. Internships offered independently of programs of study do not receive academic credit unless the internship has been recommended for credit by the Curriculum and Academic Policy Committee and approved by the College Faculty. Students may seek Independent Study (444) credit when required by the internship site/sponsor and may consult the associate dean of undergraduate academic affairs.</p></div>

All students are invited to participate in Center activities, including its "Earthkeepers" gatherings and "Opening the Book of Nature" program. On occasion, the Earthkeepers group takes observational field trips accompanied by interested faculty members. The group also meets weekly to discuss major themes related to the environment in Christian scripture and theology, as well as how these themes bear on concepts in the natural and social sciences. The character of this university-wide Center for Religion and Environment, associated also with The School of Theology, is virtually unique in American higher education.</p></div>

Generous grants and gifts from alumni and friends enable the University to fund more than 250 internships per year. • Resources and Support -The University's Career and Leadership Development staff and alumni network can help a student find, arrange, or even create an internship opportunity. • Flexibility -Sewanee's well-established internship program offers a history of positive relationships with internship sponsors and the flexibility to fit student interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Landscape Analysis Lab</head><p>The landscape analysis lab (https://www.sewanee.edu/offices/lal/) provides opportunities for students to participate in interdisciplinary environmental research, education, and outreach. Faculty in the lab come from the Departments of Biology, Economics, Forestry, Philosophy, Politicals, and Religious Studies. The lab offers internships and independent studies in which students work with faculty on research projects, engage in outreach to local schools, and collaborate with government, non-profit institutions, and corporations. These activities center around the lab's state-of-the-art geographic information systems computer network which contains detailed spatial information about land use, biodiversity, and socioeconomic factors for the Cumberland Plateau and the southeastern United States.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Opportunities</head><p>A number of opportunities are made available, during the summer as well as in regular academic terms, for students to pursue original research projects in collaboration with professors or with faculty guidance.

During their four years here, Sewanee students explore multiple directions, wear a variety of hats, and cross disciplinary boundaries to shape identities for themselves; they are vibrant members of our shared community.</p><p>The Office of Student Life provides numerous opportunities for students to live out this potential and also provides support to help students as they navigate campus and college life. Information on campus activities and programs of support are available through the student life web pages. (http://www.sewanee.edu/student-life/)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Organizations</head><p>All students are invited and encouraged to become involved in one or more of the University's student organizations. A wide variety of academic, athletic, political, recreation minded, religious, and wellness focused groups are available.</p><p>All of Sewanee's student organizations can be found on the University's student engagement portal (https://sewanee.campuslabs.com/ engage/organizations/). Here students can find events, programs, and volunteer opportunities. They can search for student organization information, including a calendar of events, and can also fill out event requests, publicity forms, and more. Currently enrolled students use their Banner credentials to access the portal (https://sewanee.campuslabs.com/engage/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Opportunities</head><p>In addition to co-curricular programs for students, Sewanee provides unique academic opportunities such as, internships, servicelearning and community engagement, and undergraduate research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and Recognition</head><p>Sewanee celebrates successful students in a variety of ways, including through the University's honor and recognition societies. The Academic Policies and Procedures page of the catalog offers links to information about the Dean's List and Honor and Recognition Societies and the Student Governance page to learn about the Order of the Gown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Expectations and Policies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Community of Honor</head><p>The University's motto-Ecce Quam Bonum (or EQB)-summarizes the principle that as members of the Sewanee community, we have a responsibility to live with respect for one another and in healthy relationships. Students are expected to live with honor day and night, in the classroom and in the residence halls, on the athletic field and in social spaces, on campus and off-in short, in every facet of life.</p><p>When we commit to living in community with one another, we necessarily agree to accept limitations on our own actions for the benefit of all, with the parallel expectation that we will not be injured, maligned, or otherwise negatively affected by the actions of others. Those who insist upon living outside the expectations of the Sewanee community will understandably be held accountable for their choices by the Honor Council, the Student Conduct Board, or other disciplinary bodies, and may in certain circumstances be removed from the Sewanee community. Matriculation and/or continued enrollment at Sewanee is a privilege, not a right. Additionally, students are expected to comply with federal, state, and local laws in their conduct whether on or off campus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community Commitments</head><p>The commitments below provide an outline of what Sewanee students can expect of their community experience with a focus on the implications of living honorably. Any sense of honor requires that each individual living within the community has the responsibility to take action to support the health and well-being of the greater community: we all must hold each other to our shared standards of honor. This responsibility can be made manifest in many ways: for example, students actively preserve their own integrity as well as the reputation of the University's academic programs when they refuse to tolerate academic dishonesty in any form; they actively respect the dignity of all when they refuse to participate in behavior that demeans others and instead take steps to end such behavior in others; they actively promote an environment of shared trust and support when they alert authorities to threats to the safety of others. We encourage students to support the community values by reporting violations and other concerns.</p><p>• Living with personal integrity • Respecting the dignity of all • Valuing freedom of thinking and expression • Demonstrating self-control • Developing trusting relationships More information about our expectations, our commitments, and our student conduct policies can be found in the full EQB Guide (http://www.sewanee.edu/student-life/dean-of-students-office/eqb-guide/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Living Together in Community</head><p>More than 98 percent of College of Arts and Sciences students live on campus, and the Office of Residential Life provides programs, professional staff, and student staff support in order to provide a welcoming, thriving, and healthy living environment. Policies regarding campus living, including the Residential Guide to Living, can be found at Residential Life (http://www.sewanee.edu/studentlife/residential-life/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Organization Expectations</head><p>Sewanee believes in empowering its students to make a difference in the lives of those around them. One way students do this is through leadership in student organizations. To help guide students through organization policies and best practices, the University provides the Student Organization Handbook. (https://www.sewanee.edu/student-life/dean-of-students-office/student-organization-handbook/)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Health and Immunization Requirements</head><p>All students at Sewanee are required to meet certain public health standards for the protection of the Sewanee campus community; these requirements must be completed before the student arrives on campus. The University Wellness Center gathers the information it requires through the completion of a health form specific to the student's program. This health form verifies that students have received the necessary immunizations and have provided the University with health information required by State and Federal law and is provided to each student upon admission.</p><p>New student requirements including information on accommodations, athletes, health forms, immunizations, and insurance coverage can be accessed through the University Wellness Center (http://www.sewanee.edu/student-life/university-wellness-center/new-studentrequirements/).</p><p>Questions should be directed to University Health Services at (931) 598-1270 or healthservice@sewanee.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Governance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honor System</head><p>The concept of honor -One shall not lie, cheat, or steal.</p><p>For more than a hundred years the Honor System has been one of Sewanee's most cherished institutions. The Honor Code is an attempt to formulate that system. But no code can adequately define honor. Honor is an ideal and an obligation. It exists in the human spirit and it lives in the relations between human beings. One can know honor without defining it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honor Code</head><p>Resolutions which have been adopted by the student body from time to time to further an understanding of the Honor System include the following:</p><p>First, that any adequate conception of Honor demands that an honorable person shall not lie or cheat or steal.</p><p>Second, that membership in the student body carries with it a peculiar responsibility for the punctilious observance of those standards of conduct which govern an honorable person in every walk of life.</p><p>Third, that, since the integrity of the degrees granted by the University must depend in large degree upon the Honor Code, all students in every class must regard themselves as particularly bound by their honor not to cheat in any form, and as likewise bound in honor not to fail to report any cheating that comes to their knowledge.</p><p>Fourth, that plagiarism is a form of cheating because the plagiarist copies or imitates the language and thoughts of others and passes the result off as an original work. Plagiarism includes the failure to identify a direct quotation by the use of quotation marks or another accepted convention which delimits and identifies the quotation clearly, paraphrasing the work of another without an acknowledgement of the source, or using the ideas of another, even though expressed in different words, without giving proper credit.</p><p>Fifth, the same paper may not be submitted in more than one course without the prior permission of the instructors in those courses.</p><p>Sixth, because the preservation of equal access to scholarly materials is essential in any academic community, it is a violation of the Honor Code to fail to check out a book taken from the library, or to remove from the building without proper authorization noncirculating materials such as reference books, periodicals, or reserved books.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Pledge</head><p>Upon entrance to the University every student agrees to abide by this Honor System and is asked to sign a form signifying acceptance of this Honor Code. Each examination, quiz, or other paper which is to be graded carries the written pledge: "I hereby certify that I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this paper. (Signature)." The abbreviation "Pledged" followed by the student's signature has the same meaning and may be acceptable on papers other than final examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honor Council</head><p>An important part of Sewanee's Honor System is its maintenance and administration by the students. For this purpose students elect an Honor Council consisting of four seniors, four juniors, three sophomores, and one first-year student. All members are elected by their respective classes. Following the election of new members in the spring, current and newly elected members of the Honor Council shall elect a chair, vice chair, and secretary. The council may invite a student from the School of Theology to participate, without vote, in its proceedings.</p><p>The election and organization of this council, its jurisdiction, its rules of procedure, and other relevant matters are subject to oversight by the Order of the Gown and the Student Government Association, which may recommend changes to the council from time to time. Before becoming effective any changes are submitted to a referendum vote by the entire student body and must receive approval of twothirds of those voting, and of the vice-chancellor. The jurisdiction of the Honor Code is not restricted to matters occurring on the Domain of the University. Cases may arise, however, because of distance or other circumstances, for which a fair hearing is impractical. The council shall release case-related statistics, mindful of the students' right of confidentiality, to be made available to the student body.</p><p>Although it is each student's responsibility to know the content of the Code, the chair of the Honor Council undertakes each year to familiarize new students with its meaning and significance and to remind the faculty and staff of their responsibility to support the Code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rules of Conduct for Hearings Before the Honor Council, Appeals, and Penalties</head><p>The Honor Council Rules of Procedure (http://www.sewanee.edu/academics/about/the-honor-code/rules-of-conduct-for-hearings/) were adopted and approved on May, 1984, and subsequently amended. There are also rules for the operation of the Honor Council (http://www.sewanee.edu/academics/about/the-honor-code/rules-for-summer-school/) during summer school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Order of the Gown</head><p>Among Sewanee's many customs, none perhaps is more distinctive than the wearing of the gown by students and faculty. Gowns were originally authorized to be worn by all students in 1871, and the Order of the Gown (OG) was established in 1873 at the instigation of Chaplain William Porcher DuBose. The students who are members of the OG have worn the gown as a badge of academic distinction ever since. The OG was the original and only form of the student government until the 1960s, when the Delegate Assembly was created. Even at that time, all parts of the student government, including the Delegate Assembly, the Honor Council, the Pan-Hellenic Council, the Student Vestry, and the Discipline Committee, were all directly responsible to the Order. In the 1970s and the 1980s, this was changed; however, the Order remains the oldest and premier branch of the student government.</p><p>Today, the Order works parallel with the Student Government to voice student opinion. It is also uniquely charged with the maintenance and promotion of the spirit, traditions, and ideals of the University. In addition, the OG runs the Election Committee, which is composed of all Proctors and is chaired by the President of the Order. Undergraduates earn membership in the OG as seniors (students with 96 or more hours) if their academic average for the previous two semesters at Sewanee is 3.00; as juniors (students with 64-95 hours) if their academic average for the previous two semesters is 3.20; as sophomores (students with 32-63 hours) if their academic average for the previous two semesters is 3.40.</p><p>In accordance with faculty legislation, students must be inducted into the Order to be considered a member; students who cannot be present for the induction ceremony because they are abroad are inducted in absentia. Students who have not earned the GPA to be a member of the Order, but who have passed their comprehensive examination, are automatically inducted into the Order as de facto members once they have passed their comprehensive examinations.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Student Government Constitution, the OG serves as a force for channeling student opinion to promote positive change. Besides the OG's substantial legislative authority through its appointment power to student and faculty</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assistance for Students with Disabilities</head><p>The University of the South is committed to fostering respect for the diversity of the University community and the individual rights of each member of its community. In this spirit, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University seeks to provide students with disabilities reasonable accommodations that are needed to ensure equal access to the programs and activities of the University. The University provides a number of services to support the academic work of all its students (including tutoring and study skills programs). Additional accommodations can be made through the University's Student Accessibility Services (SAS) specifically for students with learning disabilities, mobility limitations, certified visual and hearing impairments, and other functional limitations as defined by the ADA. Students are expected to discuss the accommodations recommended by SAS with their professors at the beginning of each semester.</p><p>In addition to accommodations, Student Accessibility Services (SAS) provides consultation and advocacy for qualified students with disabilities. SAS values relationships with students, seeks to promote pride in the value of one's disability-related experience, and empowers students to self-advocate by providing them with necessary skills and support. Students may contact Student Accessibility Services by phone at (931) 598-1325 or email at sas@sewanee.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discrimination and Misconduct Policies and Procedures</head><p>The University of the South stands firmly for the principle that its employees, students, and participants of university-sponsored programs have a right to be free from discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, pregnancy and childbirth, and genetic information, and free from sexual misconduct in its educational programs and activities and with regard to employment. The University is committed to sustaining a community in which the dignity of every individual is respected. Key to this value are efforts to nurture an environment of civility and mutual respect and to foster a culture of reporting concerns so that the University can respond promptly and equitably whenever an incident occurs. All employees, students, and participants of university-sponsored programs also have the right to be free from harassment and retaliation. • Updates from the Provost's Office on Diversity, Inclusion, and Cohesion (http://www.sewanee.edu/provost/diversity-inclusion-andcohesion/) • Information and links on Reporting a Concern or Complaint (http://www.sewanee.edu/provost/report-a-concern-or-complaint/)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African and African-American Studies (AFST)</head><p>AFST 150 Introduction to African and African American Studies (4) An introduction to how historical and contemporary analyses of cultural, political, and social forces in America, the Atlantic world (Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean), and Africa have influenced the experiences of people of color. To illuminate those life experiences, the course employs the concept of race (as a theoretical, historical, and critical category), historiography, social analysis, and cultural critique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFST 160 Introduction to Black Women's Studies (4)</head><p>This introductory course explores the interlocking forms of oppression circumscribing Black women's lives in the United States, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which their lived experiences and social realities are influenced by constructions of race, gender, class, sexuality, and other markers of difference. It contextualizes Black women's struggles for social justice historically within the broader narratives of Black freedom struggles and the Women's Rights Movement. It underscores the ways in which despite their marginalized status, Black women have used their agency within both the private and public realms to interrogate, challenge, and resist their subordination and subvert the status quo, particularly as it is reinforced in negative constructions of Black female identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFST 450 Africa and the Diaspora: Texts and Contexts (4)</head><p>This comparative and interdisciplinary course investigates the social, economic, intellectual, cultural, and political achievements of people of African descent as well as the challenges faced by them. It considers the Black experience globally and analyzes the ways in which intersections of race, gender, class, and other markers of difference complicate that experience. The course examines concepts, theories, and themes central to the African Diaspora and engenders a critique of the ways in which knowledge is disseminated and produced. Through exploration of the seminal texts in the Black literary tradition, the course promotes a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline, its core concerns, and its methodologies. Open only to seniors pursuing minors in african and african american studies. Prerequisite: AFST 150.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies (AMST) AMST 251 Black Masculinity in the United States (4)</head><p>This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of constructions of Black masculinity in the United States from the twentieth century through the present. Autobiographical accounts are used to examine historical and current definitions of Black manhood that challenge and reinforce understandings of what it means to be both Black and male.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 255 Imagining Africa (4)</head><p>This course examines popular notions of Africa and its relationship to a global African diaspora. Literature is used to question how Africa has served historically as a metaphor for exoticism, sexuality, and savagery in western discourse and, in the contemporary world, as an imagined site of seemingly insoluble problems such as genocide, famine, and the collapse of the state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 333 Junior Seminar (4)</head><p>Reading and discussion of significant texts from various disciplines including important theoretical analyses of American cultural and intellectual life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 340 African American Women's Short Stories (4)</head><p>Focusing on the literary contributions of 20th century African American women fiction writers, this course specifically examines the shared and distinctive ways in which Black women writers represent the politics of Black womanhood in their short stories. This genre is an essential part of the Black women's literary tradition that is often left unexplored. Collectively, these texts contribute to a radical literary tradition that implores readers to consider the way(s) in which race, gender, class, and/or sexuality inform the fictional lives of Black women and the lives of the writers. In addition to analyzing representations of Black female identity within the works of several prominent writers, the course traces specific themes such as power, privilege, and perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 351 Toni Morrison (4)</head><p>This course explores selected fiction by Toni Morrison and some of the literary criticism that surrounds her work. It examines Morrison's treatment of race, class, gender, and sexuality in her fiction, and also considers some of her nonfiction, interviews, and speeches to gain a clearer understanding of her contributions to the American literary canon and the African American literary tradition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 370 The Civil War and Reconstruction in the South Carolina Sea Islands (4)</head><p>This course examines the secession movement, plantation slavery, the impact of invasion and war, and the consequences of military defeat and emancipation, focusing on the South Carolina Sea Islands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 371 Conquest and Emancipation on the Sea Islands of South Carolina (4)</head><p>The course incorporates the study of history, archaeology, literature, religion, and film and popular culture in historic Beaufort, S.C., one of the crucial sites in America's Civil War. It considers the rich and long history of the people who explored, colonized, and thrived in this coastal region and focuses on the momentous period from 1850 to 1880. The course includes field expeditions to nearby historical sites and opportunities to interact with local experts on the region's history and culture. Prerequisite: Only open to students who have completed AMST 370 and been admitted to the South Carolina Sea Islands program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 420 Senior Research Seminar (4)</head><p>This seminar is designed to prepare and guide senior American Studies majors in the preparation of their senior theses. Weekly class meetings will be devoted to various topics related to their projects, including theoretical and practical problems of research, interpretation, analysis, and writing. Students will prepare regular written and oral submissions, and read and critique each other's work. They will deliver a final oral presentation on their completed project. Open only to students pursuing majors in American studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMST 444 Independent Study (2 or 4)</head><p>An opportunity for students to explore a topic of interest in an independent or directed manner. Open only to students pursuing majors in American studies. Prerequisite: Instructor prerequisite override required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropology (ANTH) ANTH 104 Introductory Cultural Anthropology (4)</head><p>This introduction to the methods and concepts of cultural anthropology will emphasize how action, thought, and belief combine to form coherent cultural patterns. The intensive study of a few cultures will be set within the larger perspective of sociocultural evolution and the anthropological sub-fields of political, psychological and economic anthropology, kinship, religion, and linguistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 106 Introductory Physical Anthropology and Archaeology (4)</head><p>An introduction to the processes of human and cultural evolution. Physical anthropology will focus on hominid evolution, genetic processes, primatology, and physiological characteristics of modern human populations. Archaeology will trace cultural evolution from foraging societies to the great civilizations of ancient times. Both course segments will include a review of pertinent methods and theories. This course is not open for credit to students who have received credit for ANTH 107.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 109 World Prehistory (4)</head><p>An introduction to world prehistory, this course begins by examining human origins in Africa and the spread of hominid populations across Africa, Asia, and Europe and considers the origins and spread of agriculture and complex societies, beginning with those in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China. Course topics also explore transitions from tribal societies to chiefdoms and protostates in pre-Roman Europe. The course concludes by examining the varied paths to state-level societies in North America, Andean South America, and Mesoamerica. Not open for credit to students who have completed ANTH 202.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 222 Celtic Culture and Archaeology (4)</head><p>Grounded in the anthropological perspective, this course will explore ancient Celtic society through archaeology, ethnohistory, linguistics, and a focus on myth and religion. Our study initially focuses on the people of the European Iron Age (800 B.C. to the Roman conquest). Further course components consider the continuity and influence of Celtic traditions though the Middle Ages to the present in areas least impacted by Roman rule (Ireland, Scotland, and parts of Wales), and the contemporary cultural phenomena known as Celtic Revivalism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 290 Women in Cross-Cultural Perspective (4)</head><p>This course enables students to challenge common misconceptions about gender and sexuality in the global south. Students learn to deconstruct the analytic categories of "woman," "man," and "sex" so that the culturally diverse construction of these categories can be recognized. Key lessons from this course are that people in the global south are agents involved in the reproduction and transformation of their own societies. Prerequisite: ANTH 104 or WMST 100 or INGS 200.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 298 Ecological Anthropology (4)</head><p>This course will examine human-environmental relationships from the anthropological perspective. Consideration of theoretical approaches and practical applications will be supplemented by archaeological, ethnographical, and ethnohistorical case studies. We will consider various ecosystems and landscapes as palimpsests that reveal cultural footprints to the archaeologist and human choices to the ethnographer. We will explore how an understanding of both can greatly inform ecological studies and further new thinking about environmental policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 301 American Culture (4)</head><p>An anthropological study of the United States using community studies and topical essays to explore regional differences and national continuities. Symbols of self, home, community, and nation are used to interpret technology, the economy, leisure, popular culture, and social class, and patterns that typify America in general, and, in particular, the region of Appalachia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 302 Southern Cultures (4)</head><p>An anthropological study of the southern United States emphasizes cultural continuity in both mountains and lowlands. The course uses community studies and literature to explore how indigenous interpretations fit within and react against national patterns and how locality, race, status, and gender act as social principles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 303 The Anthropology of Europe (4)</head><p>This course surveys the major monuments, population migrations, and cultural patterns of continental prehistory; examines how Christianity's arrival shaped myriad chiefdoms, kingdoms, and states into the Europe we recognize today; explores ethnicity and the historical origins of ethnic conflicts; and considers the cultural impacts of European Union membership and 21st-century immigration issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 304 Peoples and Cultures of Africa (4)</head><p>A brief survey of geography, prehistory, and history followed by an evaluation of modern African cultural groups. Special topics considered include African women, labor migration, urbanization, associations, and elites. The overarching theme of the course is the differential effects of modernization on Africa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 305 Cultures of Latin America (4)</head><p>This class is an anthropological investigation into Latin American cultural traditions that are the product of cultural hybridization between African, European, and Amerindian traditions first brought together by the Spanish conquest. We will explore the dividing practices associated with colonization and nation-building, as well as the diverse ways in which gender, race, and class are conceptualized and experienced across the region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 306 American Indians (4)</head><p>A consideration of North American native peoples that involves origins and culture areas and the study of several specific groups as to history, economy, kinship, authority, and world view. Special attention will be given to problems of conquest, reservation life, and U.S. government policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 311 Gender and Class in Latin America (4)</head><p>This course examines the social construction of gender and social class, along with race/ethnicity and sexuality in various Latin American contexts. We pay special attention to the historical dimensions of intersecting identities, hegemonic discourses related to identity, and human experiences and negotiations of these identities. Prerequisite: ANTH 104 or INGS 200 or WMST 100. ANTH 312 Place, Ritual and Belief (4) An upper-division seminar designed to enhance students' research skills and engage students in thoughtful examination of the relationship between religious beliefs and practices, and natural environments. While including the major religious traditions, the course will focus on indigenous, historic and prehistoric traditions within band, tribe, chiefdom and state societies. The course will focus on religious syncretism due to historical conquest or latter 20th century globalization as it impacts human-historical conenvironmental relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 314 Gender, Colonialism, and Culture in Greater Mexico (4)</head><p>Starting from the premise that the region encompassing northern Mexico and the southwestern United States can be viewed as a single cultural region, this course examines how colonizing processes mobilized gendered and racialized identities to consolidate new social hierarchies in this part of the world. We learn about the historic interactions between Indigenous, European, and African peoples thrown together by the acts of exploration, conquest, and enslavement, and the hybridized cultural social forms which resulted. With these historical legacies in mind, we move to see how contemporary racialized and gendered identities are constructed and contested in the context of "Greater Mexico.". Prerequisite: ANTH 104 or INGS 200 or WMST 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 316 Archaeology of the Cumberland Plateau (4)</head><p>This course examines the cultural history of the Cumberland Plateau through anthropological archaeology. After a brief consideration of the subject's environmental context within one of the most biologically diverse regions on earth, the class investigates the Plateau's rich prehistoric and historic archaeological record, which spans at least 12,000 years. In addition to ethnohistorical research, students actively engage in laboratory analysis of artifacts from the University Domain. Students also participate in site visits and field survey to explore both the Native American and European American record left as rock art, as well as that found in open habitation, cave, and rockshelter sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 317 The Anthropology of Development (4)</head><p>An examination of the basic assumptions of mainstream modernization approaches. Students explore key aspects of "modernity," as this term has been understood in Western European thought, and explore anthropologists' critiques of the exportation of these key aspects to other contexts. Detailed ethnographic case studies from diverse world regions, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America help students to understand the impact of development thinking in Third World contexts. The professor's investigation of development in the war-torn context of Medellin, Colombia, is an ongoing source of material for reflection and debate. Prerequisite: ANTH 104.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTH 318 North American Archaeology (4)</head><p>This course reviews Pre-Columbian and Historic Era histories and social landscapes north of Mesoamerica. The course considers the timing and process of the initial peopling of the continent, food production, regional systems of exchange, development of social hierarchies, the rise and fall of chiefdoms, and colonial encounters between Europeans and Native Americans.</p></div>

In investigating the city's place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, its historic importance for Muslim and European imperialists, its long status as a tourist and pilgrimage destination, and its significance in Israeli and Palestinian nationalism, the course asks whether the myriad understandings of the city can co-exist or is Jerusalem destined to always be "a golden bowl filled with scorpions.".

The course examines the cultural creation and reworking of the nuclear family by a diverse range of historical actors within an increasingly global context. How did individuals invent shared pasts that legitimized non-traditional concepts of marriage and the family? Topics include Victorian, socialist and fascist families, the modification of marriage, and challenges to family structures posed by person of alternate sexual, immigrant, and gendered identities. Prerequisite: One course with attribute G4 including AP or IB credit.</p></div>

The Oxford Movement did not arise in a vacuum, so the course begins by exploring the 18th century High Church and Evangelical background. Nor did the Movement exist in a vacuum, so its interaction with the U.S. and the late 19th century "crisis of faith" is seen. Finally, the Movement's successors are examined: slum priests in rapidly growing cities, the Liberal Catholics, and the Gothic revival in architecture and worship.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIST 491 European Life in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance (2)</head><p>This course begins with an examination of the organization and character of the Western Catholic Church before the Reformation. It considers the distinctive systems of belief that were fostered and seeks to understand how particular beliefs prompted distinctive behavior in the later fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Visits to medieval churches in Oxford and environs facilitate an exploration of what was being commissioned and built by different classes of lay men and women before the Reformation, the better to understand the tenor of faith and pious activity at that time. The course continues through the reign of the Tudors, and the evolution of the Reformation in Britain, Italy and the Mediterranean, and Northern Europe. This course is only available through the European Studies Program.</p><p>Prerequisite: Only open to students admitted to the European Studies program.</p><p>HIST 493 The Civil War and American Historical Memory (4) This seminar examines, through a variety of texts, the impact of the Civil War on American historical memory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIST 495 War and Society in Ancient Greece and Rome (4)</head><p>This course explores war and society from the Greek Archaic Age in the eighth century B.C. to the crisis of the Roman Empire in the third century A.D. It looks at changes in the groups who fought wars, and the ways in which these related to larger social, economic, and political movements. It also considers how participants and non-combatants thought about war, and how these attitudes shifted over time. Archaeology is of prime relevance, but literary texts provide the most important evidence. These are examined to provide new angles on well-known writers, such as Thucydides and Plato, as well as to introduce fascinating, but lesser known, authors including Aeneas Tacticus and Frontinus. Artistic evidence, both public and private, is also central to this course. This course is only available through the European Studies Program. Prerequisite: Only open to students admitted to the European Studies program.</p></div>

It also introduces students to the rise of Christianity as a world religion within the Roman Empire, leading to its eventual domination in Western Europe, and to its interaction with medieval Judaism and emerging Islam. The course combines the study of religion with that of history, precisely because one of the features of the Middle Ages was the centrality of religion to politics, society, and culture. The study of primary sources, including, among others, the writings of Sidonius Apollinaris, Rabia of Basra, Bede, Einhard, Hildegard of Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Christine de Pisan and Petrarch, underpin the structure of the course. This course is only available through the European Studies Program. Prerequisite: Only open to students admitted to the European Studies program.</p></div>

It looks at why and how major socio-economic, cultural, and political changes associated with the history of "the West" (c. 1500 to the present), involved a preoccupation with vision and its effects. The course hones in on artists and "scientific observers", many of whom were directly involved in colonial and commercial projects. Topics of focus include: the uses of instruments (such as the microscope) for mediating sight and producing new knowledge about nature: the ordering, politics, and display of visual objects in collections, and more.</p><p>HUMN 217 Imitation, Quotation, Appropriation, and Genre (4) Imitation, quotation and appropriation are fundamental creative strategies-in the visual arts, writing, music, and filmmaking. Imitation is how you learn your craft, quotation how you demonstrate expertise, and appropriation a strategy, often with political and legal implications. Forms of expression generated in one context and culture are translated and appropriated for new audiences and purposes. This course examines a diverse range of key monuments, texts, and practices, including the theorization of art in the Italian Renaissance, twentieth-century feminist retellings of "classic" tales, and the international exchange of plots and the formal language of storytelling between the Hollywood Western and Japanese samurai films. The course considers the pleasures and parameters of genre, the conception of intellectual property, and the politics of appropriation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 203 Sociolinguistics of Africa (4)</head><p>This course introduces learners to key concepts and topics in sociolinguistics with a regional focus of Africa. The concept of globalization is at the core of this course, specifically looking at how African languages and cultures have been impacted by sociopolitical and economic forces of globalization such as colonialism, urbanization, mass and social media, formal education and marketeconomy. The course also focuses on the role of language in the formation of nation-states in Africa, the structural effects that African languages have on "foreign" languages like English and French, and what speakers of African languages think of their utility in the context of globalization. Reading materials focus on language communities living in Africa, in the diaspora and in the technology-mediated "virtual" world. No prior knowledge of sociolinguistics is required in order to enroll in this course, but some knowledge about African languages and cultures is an added advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 204 Representing Egypt (4)</head><p>This course studies the role of representation in the negotiation of identity and power by mapping efforts across a variety of media to express and evaluate the dramatic developments in Egypt leading up to, and since, the "revolution" of 2011.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 301 The Global Financial Crisis: Causes and Effects (4)</head><p>This course introduces students to some prominent ways of theorizing the contemporary global financial architecture. It foregrounds global financial crisis in order to chart the historical role of finance, or investment capital, in shaping the economic forces of globalization. Exploring the theoretical and practical role that financial investment plays in capitalism and economic growth, the course investigates whether this role has changed with the greater economic integration and capital mobility associated with "neoliberal globalization." This course has a strong theoretical and political economy orientation, while remaining in conversation with approaches represented in cultural studies, human geography, gender and postcolonial studies. Students can thus understand "capital investment" not merely as a financial bet on the future, but as an emotional and psychological one as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 302 Global Cities (4)</head><p>This course reviews recent literature regarding the emergence of "global cities" as central nodes in the global network economy. Whether conceptualized as hubs for information technology circuits or as points of financial and cultural exchange and mediation, cities are being increasingly understood and analyzed in their own right, in a framework that foregrounds "the urban" as the primary unit of analysis (as opposed to the "national" or "international."). The city, as a central site of socio-spatial transformation, is thus envisioned to be a central feature of globalization. This course considers the literature on "global cities" as well as writings that use "the urban" as a lens for analyzing global processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 304 Politics and Society in Modern India (4)</head><p>This course introduces and contextualizes some major issues pertinent to understanding how politics and society function in contemporary India.

Polish cinema also serves as starting point for a broader discussion of the possibilities and limits of artistic representation of nations, cultures, historical events, and gender/class/ ethnic relation. Finally, the course reviews basic film theory terms, main critical approaches to film criticism, and ways of writing about film.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 308 Body Film: Representing the Body in Contemporary World Cinema (4)</head><p>An exploration of diverse ways of representing and conceptualizing the human body in contemporary world cinema. Starting with the premise that the body is both the material reality experienced each day as well as an enigma impossible to capture through the intellectual discourses of philosophy/science or the creative endeavors of literature/arts, the course invites students to analyze the myriad of body images supplied by twenty-first-century films from around the globe. Main topics of interest are the body and mind/soul dichotomy, gendered bodies, body and the discourse of desire, body as text, body and cognition, body and trauma, politics of the body, metamorphoses of the body, persons and things, and bodies in the cybernetic age. The course's theoretical component includes reading by Bakhtin, Baudrillard, Butler, Bourdieu, Foucault, Goffman, Grosz, and Haraway.</p></div>

The course also considers the efforts of contemporary Muslim environmental activists to change the relationship of humanity to natural resources and surroundings with reference to the Islamic faith.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INGS 312 Africa and the West Since 1800 (4)</head><p>This course surveys the historical relationship between Africa and the West from the age of Abolition in the early 19th century through the colonial and post-colonial periods. Several broad questions are addressed including: What were the political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual implications of this relationship? To what extent and in what ways is this historical relationship implicated in Africa's postcolonial, but some would argue, neocolonial present?

The Neuroscience program at Sewanee provides students with the depth of core Neuroscience knowledge, but also breadth of training outside of Neuroscience in the natural sciences, psychology, mathematics, and philosophy resulting in multidisciplinary discourse.</figDesc><table><row><cell>1</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Neuroscience</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Overview</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Website:</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Title</cell><cell>Semester</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Hours</cell></row><row><cell>Course Requirements 1</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>MUSC 101</cell><cell>Music of Western Civilization</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>or MUSC 151</cell><cell>Song, Symphony, Stage: Music in Western Civilization</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>MUSC 260</cell><cell>Introduction to Part Writing</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Select one course in ensemble participation and/or applied study of an instrument or voice 2</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Select three additional courses in music (MUSC)</cell><cell>12</cell></row><row><cell>Total Semester Hours</cell><cell></cell><cell>24</cell></row></table><note>2Faculty Professors: Bachman, Berner, Miles, Peterman, Yu, Zigler Associate Professors: Bateman (Chair), Kikis, Pongdee, Seballos, Shibata, A.

Starting from the premise that the region encompassing northern Mexico and the southwestern United States can be viewed as a single cultural region, this course examines how colonizing processes mobilized gendered and racialized identities to consolidate new social hierarchies in this part of the world. We learn about the historic interactions between Indigenous, European, and African peoples thrown together by the acts of exploration, conquest, and enslavement, and the hybridized cultural social forms which resulted. With these historical legacies in mind, we move to see how contemporary racialized and gendered identities are constructed and contested in the context of "Greater Mexico.".

Topics include the relationship between scientific theories and the temperance movement, gender roles, and scientific racism. Consideration of how the medical was political runs throughout the course as the challenges of microbes, diet, climate, and shifting definitions of 'race' and 'citizen' are explored. Course readings highlight the intersection of science, politics, race, and gender during this foundational period in American History. Taking a historical approach towards understanding gender and sexuality in South Asia, this course focuses particularly on the history of women in the region. As is suggested in the translated title of one of India's most celebrated writers Rabindranath Tagore's novel, Home and the World, this course's themes also pivot around questions of women's belonging in circumscribed spaces. From this center it reaches out to offer an understanding of the great diversity and heterogeneity of women's experiences in India, an analysis of women's movements, forays into women's voices, and colonial policies towards women. Apart from a robust historiographical literature, this course introduces students to poems, fiction, literature, plays, art, and cinema from India. This course examines Supreme Court cases related to equality: by situating cases within varying theories of constitutional interpretation, and by assessing the socio-political implications of those decisions. Civil rights are specific governmental provisions to secure individual entitlements, as exemplified by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of "equal protection of the laws." Claims centering on race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability are examined, along with other claims of equality arising from the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition of voting discrimination. The course emphasizes, above all, the political role of the judiciary. This course may not be taken by students who have taken POLS 332.

Organized around four major regions-Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Far East-the primary texts are examined through several angles. Texts are analyzed for their rhetorical and poetic effects, the historical and political contexts in which literary discourses surrounding questions of ethnicity, culture, and race develop, and the conditions under which they are marketed to, or suppressed from, different groups of readers.

But to speak of the Qur'an as a "text" does not begin to address the numerous ways in which it is and has been perceived and experienced for many centuries. While the Qur'an is indeed contained in a physical book, it is also regarded as the eternal word of God, an oral tradition, an historical event, a body of words to be recited for worship, a moral message, a major cultural component of Islamic civilization, and a linguistic accomplishment. This course offers a survey of those different aspects of the Qur'an.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELG 211 Sensational Religion (4)</head><p>How does religion make sense? How do we make sense of religion? Drawing on the rich array of meanings evoked by the word "sense," this course introduces and examines these "sensational" dilemmas. Drawing on a variety of case studies in the sensory cultures of religion, it explores how religious images, artifacts, practices, and spaces are historically connected to and help reproduce a dynamic human sensorium, and it investigates religion as a sensual practice, as a sensationalized contention, and as a category through which humans endeavor to make sense--of themselves and of the world.</p></div>
