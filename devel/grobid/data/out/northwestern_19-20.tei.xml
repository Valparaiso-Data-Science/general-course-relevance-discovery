<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement to Provide Emergency Information</head><p>For the safety and security of our students, Northwestern requires all new students to provide the following emergency information in our student information system, CAESAR (https://caesar.northwestern.edu) and confirm it annually:</p><p>• Emergency Notification Phone Number (required): A phone number where the student themselves can be reached in the event of a campus emergency -most likely a cell phone number. The University will send recorded voice and text messages to this number if necessary.</p><p>• Current / Local Address (required): Where we can find the student in the event of a local emergency.</p><p>• Emergency contact (required): Someone who can make medical decisions on the student's behalf.</p><p>• Missing Person Contact (optional): The best person for the University to contact if we believe the student to be missing.</p><p>Students must enter, update or confirm the three pieces of required emergency information by the deadline (usually in mid-September) each year to avoid a registration hold. Registration holds prevent students from registering for classes or changing registration until the required three data elements are up to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Title IX Compliance</head><p>Northwestern University does not discriminate or permit discrimination by any member of its community against any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, parental status, marital status, age, disability, citizenship status, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classification protected by law in matters of admissions, employment, housing, or services or in the educational programs or activities it operates. Further prohibited by law is discrimination against any employee and/or job applicant who chooses to inquire about, discuss, or disclose their own compensation or the compensation of another employee or applicant. Harassment, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based on any of these characteristics is a form of discrimination.</p><p>Northwestern University complies with federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination based on the protected categories listed above, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination based on sex (including sexual misconduct) in the University's educational programs and activities. In addition, Northwestern provides reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants, students, and employees with disabilities and to individuals who are pregnant.</p><p>Any alleged violations of this policy or questions with respect to nondiscrimination or reasonable accommodations should be directed to:</p><p>Northwestern's Director of Equal Opportunity and Access and Section 504 Coordinator 1800 Sherman Avenue, Suite 4500 Evanston, Illinois 60208 847-491-7458 eeo@northwestern.edu</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>Candidates for admission should demonstrate a level of performance in curricular and extracurricular areas that indicates they will be able to succeed in a competitive academic environment. In the selection of students, careful attention is given to the ability of each candidate as evidenced by academic records and the results of entrance tests as well as by character and personal qualities. The University attempts to select students who are committed to scholarship and who have shown a willingness to become involved in their expressed interest areas. In determining whether to accept a candidate, the University considers • Secondary school record • College record (required for transfer candidates)</p><p>• Recommendations from school officials and other persons who have information pertinent to the candidate's probable success at Northwestern</p><p>• Results of required tests (All candidates must submit either SAT or ACT scores. The writing sections for these tests are optional. Candidates for certain special admission programs and all homeschooled applicants must submit the SAT Subject Tests specified below. SAT Subject Tests are optional for other candidates.)</p><p>• Music audition (required of Bienen School of Music candidates)</p><p>• Candidate's written statements</p><p>• Any other information received by the University that bears on the candidate's readiness for study at Northwestern</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Proficiency for International Applicants</head><p>In addition to meeting all regular admission requirements, international students are required to present evidence of their ability to speak, read, and write the English language. International applicants whose first language is not English or whose schooling has not been in English are required to submit the results of either the Test of English as a Foreign <ref type="bibr">Language (TOEFL)</ref> or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAT Subject Tests</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required for Special Admission Programs and Home-Schooled Applicants</head><p>• Honors Program in Medical Education: Mathematics Level 2 and Chemistry • Integrated Science Program: Mathematics Level 2, Chemistry or Physics, and an additional science • Home-schooled applicants: Mathematics Level 1 or 2 and two other SAT Subject Tests of the applicant's choice from different subject areas (i.e., not two science, two foreign language, or two history, etc.)</p><p>• All other applicants: SAT Subject Tests are optional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Subjects</head><p>A broad academic experience in high school is the best preparation for admission to Northwestern. Whatever fields of study students follow, the best foundation consists of reading, writing, and mathematics. The value of thorough training in fundamental subjects cannot be overemphasized.</p><p>In considering the academic record of a candidate for admission, the Office of Undergraduate Admission notes the subjects studied, the rigor of coursework taken, and the grades received. The student's record should include a minimum of 16 units. (A unit represents a course studied for one year.)</p><p>The subject recommendations in the following list represent the minimum requirements for entrance to the University. Allowances are made to permit students to pursue special areas of academic interest. Most applicants present more academic subjects than the minimum. Credit in other subjects should bring the total to 16 units or more, including 4 units of English and work in social studies and foreign languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommended Units</head><p>Applications for admission may be submitted before candidates take the standardized tests required for college admission.</p><p>• Arrange with the officials of their high school to complete and forward the Secondary School Report to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. All candidates should have their records through the sixth semester sent to Northwestern as early in the senior year as possible. Regular Decision candidates should have seventh-semester grades sent as soon as they are available.</p><p>• Submit standardized tests as outlined in the General Requirements for Admission (p. 11) section and, if applicable, the English Proficiency for International Applicants (p. 11) and/or SAT Subject Tests (p. 11) sections in this chapter. Testing deadlines can be found in the Application and Testing Deadlines (p. 12) table.</p><p>Applicants may self-report SAT and ACT scores, taking care to report their highest individual sections of the SAT and/or highest ACT composite score. Applicants are not obligated to report scores from all test dates, though are welcome to do so. Admitted students who choose to enroll will be required to submit official SAT or ACT test scores prior to matriculation. English proficiency scores may not be self-reported; these should be submitted officially via the testing company at the applicant stage.</p><p>• Present a music audition if applying for admission to the Bienen School of Music; follow the audition guidelines specified at https:// music.northwestern.edu/admission/undergraduate/auditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application to Dual Bachelor's Degree Programs</head><p>A student interested in taking advantage of the opportunity to receive bachelor's degrees from two different Northwestern undergraduate schools in five years must apply to both schools. It is possible to be admitted to only one or both schools since applicants are considered for each school separately.</p><p>Dual degree programs available include the following:</p><p>• BA/BS in Liberal Arts and Engineering </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Admission Programs</head><p>The following undergraduate programs at Northwestern have special application requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Program in Medical Education</head><p>The Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME) provides simultaneous admission to undergraduate study and the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern. Interested students must preapply by the due date. Those whose preapplications qualify receive the special HPME application to submit in addition to their regular Application for <ref type="bibr">Admission</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated Science Program</head><p>A student wishing to be considered for Weinberg College's Integrated Science Program, which provides a rigorous background in the major scientific disciplines and mathematics and can lead to a bachelor of arts degree in three years, must complete the special ISP application (available at isp.northwestern.edu/admissions/applying/). Applicants to the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Sciences may also submit an ISP application, but doing the additional major in ISP along with engineering does not accelerate completion of the bachelor of science degree. Either the Common Application or the Coalition Application is also required of applicants.</p><p>For more information on ISP, see the Integrated Science Program (p. 286) section in the Weinberg College (p. 181) chapter of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences</head><p>A student interested in Weinberg College's program in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences (MMSS), which is designed for students with high mathematical aptitude and strong interest in social problems and issues, must complete the special MMSS application (https:// www.mmss.northwestern.edu/admission/first-year-application.html). Either the Common Application or the Coalition Application is also required. For more information on MMSS, visit this website (https:// www.mmss.northwestern.edu).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>In nearly all areas Northwestern awards credit for Advanced Placement Examination scores of 5; in some cases credit is also awarded for scores of 3 and 4. Specific questions concerning Northwestern's advanced placement policies should be addressed to the Office of the Registrar or the school adviser. In some fields advanced placement and/or credit can be earned through appropriate performance on examinations administered by Northwestern departments.</p><p>Northwestern may award credit for distinguished performance on certain foreign national examinations, and the higher-level examinations of the International Baccalaureate. Students will receive credit only once for the same course of study even if mastery is demonstrated on multiple exams (e.g., mathematics AP and IB exams). Also, credit is awarded only for exams taken prior to matriculation at Northwestern.</p><p>Northwestern also may award credit for college courses taken by incoming first-year students before they enter the University. To qualify for such recognition, the courses must be similar to courses offered at Northwestern, must have been completed at a college or university whose accreditation is recognized by Northwestern, must not have been submitted in partial fulfillment of the normal secondary school graduation requirement, and must have been taken primarily by bona fide college students (i.e., high school graduates pursuing a college degree).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Candidates</head><p>Students may be considered for admission as transfers from another college or university provided they have completed one full year of university studies by the application deadline, are in good standing at their postsecondary institution, and have maintained at least a B average in rigorous academic courses. If students have been enrolled full-time at any institution except Northwestern, they cannot be considered for admission as first-year candidates and must meet the criteria to apply as transfer candidates. Undergraduate schools at Northwestern enroll transfer students in the fall quarter only, and admitted transfer students may not defer their enrollment to any subsequent fall. Transfer students must meet the relevant provisions of the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (p. 27).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Admission Procedure</head><p>To be considered for admission, transfer students must complete the following steps:</p><p>• Complete the Common Application or the Coalition Application. Submit online at commonapp.org or mycoalition.org.</p><p>• Arrange with the officials of the high school to forward the complete high school report to the Office of Undergraduate Admission.</p><p>• Submit results of the SAT or the ACT. Writing sections are optional. Applicants may self-report SAT and ACT scores, taking care to report their highest individual sections of the SAT and/or highest ACT composite score. Applicants are not obligated to report scores from all test dates, though are welcome to do so. Admitted students who choose to enroll will be required to submit official SAT or ACT test scores prior to matriculation. English proficiency scores may not be self-reported; these should be submitted officially via the testing company at the applicant stage.</p><p>• Arrange with the registrar of each college previously attended to forward transcripts of record to the Office of Undergraduate Admission.</p><p>• Request a statement of good academic and social standing from the dean of students at the college from which the student is transferring.</p><p>• Present a music audition if applying for admission to the Bienen School of Music (for audition guidelines, see https:// music.northwestern.edu/admission/undergraduate/auditions/ programs).</p><p>• Submit application for admission before the March 15 deadline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Credits</head><p>Transfer candidates who are accepted by Northwestern will receive a preliminary evaluation of the credits they have earned to date before matriculation, assuming all pertinent transcripts have been received. An official evaluation of credits earned will be made by the Office of the Registrar when an admitted student matriculates. To read the transfer credit policy, go to www.registrar.northwestern.edu/graduation/ transfer_and_test_credit.html.</p><p>The school allows adults with a college degree, or some college credit and good standing, or a high school diploma but no prior college work to enroll in courses as students at large. Students who wish to earn a degree or a certificate should speak with an academic adviser about admission.</p><p>More information about the school is available on its website, sps.northwestern.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Students</head><p>Properly qualified persons who demonstrate a need for certain courses required for their academic or professional advancement may apply to the University as special nondegree-seeking students. Applicants must present official transcripts of previous study and show evidence of successful academic achievement. Persons who do not meet these requirements should not apply.</p><p>Enrollment as a special student does not constitute admission to any degree program at the University, and credits earned as a special student may not be counted toward a degree at Northwestern. (Exception: Special students who subsequently become eligible for admission into the School of Professional Studies may apply these credits toward a degree.) Special students are granted academic credit for coursework satisfactorily completed, and these credits may be transferred to another institution.</p><p>Special students are admitted with the understanding that they may register only after students working toward Northwestern degrees have registered. Some classes will be closed, and some schools or departments may not accept nondegree students. These restrictions do not apply to Summer Session.</p><p>Special students are not permitted to enroll in 399 or 499 Independent Study courses.</p><p>All tuition and fees for special students are charged at the undergraduate rate. Complete instructions and application forms may be obtained from the:</p><p>Office of Special Students Northwestern University 405 Church Street Evanston, Illinois 60208</p><p>For more information see sps.northwestern.edu/main/nondegree-specialstudents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission Withdrawal</head><p>If we do not receive your final transcript and official test scores by the start of classes, or in cases where an admitted student's academic performance falters seriously as indicated by a final transcript, an offer of admission may be withdrawn. Additionally, an offer of admission may be withdrawn in cases where official test scores do not corroborate selfreported scores on an application. Northwestern also reserves the right to rescind an admission offer if we receive information that, in our judgment, reflects negatively on a student's character or fitness for study and/or participation in the Northwestern community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head><p>The University provides financial aid on the basis of need as determined by the financial circumstances of the family. Federal loans or private scholarships are provided according to their own criteria and sometimes regardless of financial need. Financial aid consists of scholarships, part-time employment, and loan funding. These funds come from state, federal, institutional, and private sources. Students must apply for financial aid each year and might qualify for a combination of funds. Aid awards will be relatively consistent assuming the family financial circumstance is also relatively consistent.</p><p>For new first-year students, financial aid is available for a maximum of four years of full-time enrollment or its equivalent. Students admitted to a five-year dual degree program are eligible for a maximum of five years of full-time enrollment or its equivalent. The five-year dual degree programs approved for aid include liberal arts and music, communication and engineering, communication and music, education and music, engineering and music, or journalism and music. Students must be enrolled in the dual degree program by the end of their sophomore year. A student who later decides to pursue only one degree reverts to a maximum eligibility of four years. Students pursuing other dual degree opportunities that are not approved for aid would be eligible for federal and state funding only after using fours years of institutional aid. Transfer students are eligible for up to three years of university financial aid.</p><p>Regardless of whether a student receives financial aid in a given quarter or year, all enrollment counts toward the maximum time frame. Those needing aid beyond their maximum timeframe must submit a request to the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid. Those requests must be submitted at the time that the additional quarter is needed.</p><p>For information consult undergradaid.northwestern.edu/information-for/ prospective-students.html.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Application Who Should Apply</head><p>Students who believe they cannot afford the full cost of a Northwestern education should apply for financial aid. International students might wish to apply for need-based financial aid, although financial need may factor into a final admission decision (whereas the review process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents). For more information see admissions.northwestern.edu/tuition-aid/internationalstudent-aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Procedure</head><p>Applicants apply for financial aid at the same time as they are submitting the application for admission. Eligibility for aid cannot be determined until the University has admitted an applicant. Candidates should do the following:</p><p>• File the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid PROFILE (CSS PROFILE) and request that the information is sent to Northwestern.</p><p>• Submit parent and student federal tax returns to the College Board's Institutional Documentation Service.</p><p>• File the applications as soon possible but not later than the dates indicated in the table titled Application and Testing Deadlines: Notification Plans (p. 12).</p><p>Returning students should consult the website undergradaid.northwestern.edu for reapplication instructions, deadlines, and updated policies.</p><p>Students are expected to consult their CAESAR account to verify that all required applications and additional information have been received by the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Eligibility</head><p>For financial aid purposes:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Status Units</head><p>Full-Time 3 to 5.5 units Half-time 2 to 2.99 units Less than half-time fewer than 2 units (Note: students who register for more than 5.5 units may be subject to overload tuition charges, and some schools require these students to obtain the approval of the dean before registering.) All quarters of fulltime registration are counted toward the maximum amount of financial aid eligibility (4 years in most cases). Each quarter of half-time status counts as .5 quarter toward the 4-year maximum. Any quarter of less than half-time status is not counted toward the maximum.</p><p>Students enrolled less than half-time are not eligible for financial aid from Northwestern but may have limited eligibility for federal aid. Students awarded aid at full-time status who enroll at a lower level will have their aid reduced accordingly. Students will not receive additional university aid to pay any overload tuition charges they incur.</p><p>Students considering a change of registration status should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine how the change might affect their aid awards or amount of eligibility. A detailed explanation of aid eligibility and policies is provided on the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid's website, undergradaid.northwestern.edu.</p><p>Students must maintain satisfactory academic (SAP) progress to remain eligible for financial aid. For Northwestern students, SAP means the successful completion of at least 67 percent of the course units attempted in an academic year (e.g., a student who registers for a total of 12 quarter-courses a year must complete at least 8). Withdrawn, incomplete, and repeated courses are counted as attempted course units.</p><p>In addition, students must attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better by the end of their second academic year and every year thereafter in order to meet SAP requirements. This GPA minimum may differ from a school's academic requirements, which are outlined in those chapters in this catalog.</p><p>Students can receive financial aid only for a maximum time frame, which is 150 percent of the program's published length as measured in academic units. All transfer credits are counted toward the maximum time frame. The total number of units required for a bachelor's degree is specified in each school's chapter in this catalog; the website of the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid notes the maximum time frames calculated in terms of credits required for degree completion.</p><p>Financial Aid Eligibility office. In some cases, an appeal will not be considered until the student has met with his or her academic adviser to determine an academic plan for completing the degree.</p><p>Those students whose appeals are approved will be placed in a probationary status. While on probation, students are eligible for one quarter of aid. At the end of the probationary period, students must then be meeting the cumulative standards of SAP. Students who are required to submit an academic plan must meet the conditions of the plan to remain eligible. Students who fail to meet these requirements as of the end of the probationary quarter will be ineligible for financial aid from that point forward.</p><p>More detailed information regarding satisfactory academic progress is available on the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid's website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prepayment Plan</head><p>The University provides a tuition and fee installment prepayment plan, 9PAY (https://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/payments/methods/9PAY), which offers the benefit of prepaying the educational costs for the academic year in nine monthly payments without incurring finance or interest charges.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Obligations</head><p>Students whose University bills are overdue may not be given an academic transcript and/or a diploma until all financial obligations are paid in full. Students whose accounts are overdue must pay a $200 late payment penalty fee. The director of student finance may cancel or prevent the registration of a student whose bills are past due. A student is liable for any costs associated with the collection of his or her past-due account, including but not limited to collection agency costs, court costs, and legal fees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition Benefit</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Enrollment Benefit</head><p>Students who are unable to complete bachelor's degree requirements in 12 quarters of enrollment due to circumstances beyond their control, and who have paid full-time tuition to Northwestern for 12 quarters, may petition the Registration Requirement Appeals Committee to enroll in their final quarter at no additional tuition charge. Transfer students who have paid full-time tuition to Northwestern for 9 quarters are also eligible.</p><p>The Supplemental Enrollment Benefit is not available for students who choose a program that may take more than 12 quarters to complete, such as a dual degree program, or for students who have graduated. A final quarter at no charge is also not available for students whose pursuit of an optional program, such as study abroad, a double major, a minor, or extra coursework beyond that normally required for the degree, is the cause of the additional term(s) of enrollment. The benefit is intended to help students meet degree requirements only.</p><p>Appeals are considered by the Undergraduate Enrollment Committee, which consists of the associate provost for undergraduate enrollment, the associate provost for undergraduate education, the University registrar, a senior member of the financial aid staff, and two associate or assistant deans from different undergraduate schools. The deans serve three-year terms on a rotating basis. The Committee convenes on a regular basis to review appeals.</p><p>Students should consult their academic adviser(s) to discuss whether their situation is appropriate for this benefit or an appeal to Undergraduate Financial Aid. For instructions on preparing an appeal for the benefit, see the Office of the Registrar's website at https:// www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration-graduation/graduationpreparation/supplemental-enrollment-benefit-appeal.html</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal Refunds</head><p>Tuition deposits are not refundable under any circumstances. Tuition, less the tuition deposit, and refundable fees are refundable depending on the percentage of time the student was enrolled in the quarter. The following policy applies to withdrawals: Residence and meal contracts are signed for the full school year. Students who leave a residence before the end of the year are liable for the entire year's rent or for charges up to the date another student takes the vacated space. Meal charges are assessed until the end of the week in which withdrawal is in effect. Adjustments may be made at the discretion of Residential Services for students who for financial reasons must make room and board arrangements other than those for which they first contracted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Percent of Term</head><p>Financial aid recipients who withdraw from the University may be required to return a portion of their Title IV funds to the federal programs as well as some of their state assistance, outside scholarships, and/or institutional financial aid. Three different calculations-the Institutional Refund, Return of Title IV Funds, and Return of Non-Title IV Funds-are used to determine such repayments. Students may request samples of the applications of these refund policies from the Office of Student Accounts or the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES Degrees, Academic Options, and Requirements</head><p>Undergraduate degree requirements are established by the faculties of each school. While the requirements consequently differ significantly by school, all students must pursue at least one major (their degree major) in their home school to earn a Northwestern undergraduate degree.</p><p>Students often also elect to pursue additional majors (p. 34), minors (p. 31), certificates (p. 29), and other special programs in schools other than their own, in addition to those from their home school. A program like this results in a single undergraduate degree with multiple majors.</p><p>Students may also apply and be admitted to multiple schools that offer pre-approved dual degrees (p. 36). A program like this results in two different undergraduate degrees conferred by the two different schools and often requires an additional year of study.</p><p>All undergraduate students must also meet the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (p. 27).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Advising</head><p>Academic advising is an essential component of an undergraduate education. All incoming students are assigned an academic adviser through their school. Returning students may obtain academic advice through their major department and from the dean's office of their school.</p><p>In addition to meeting with an academic adviser on a regular basis, students should routinely check their academic requirements-accessible via the CAESAR degree progress report and McCormick MAS-to ensure that they are meeting their degree requirements; students should promptly discuss any concerns about progress or discrepancies in the report with an adviser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses and Credit</head><p>Although the course listings in this catalog are as complete and exact as is possible at the time of publication, some changes may occur later, and courses may be dropped or added. The class schedule for each quarter is posted on CAESAR and contains a complete and updated listing of classes offered each quarter. The University reserves the right to cancel classes when necessary, including those for which there is insufficient enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Course Credits and Quarters</head><p>Traditional undergraduate work in all the schools on the Evanston campus is on the quarter system. In a quarter-long course, students and faculty meet at least three hours per week, and students are awarded 1.0 unit of credit. Exceptions are courses that meet less than three hours per week, which carry less than 1.0 unit, and 15-week courses, which carry 1.5 units.</p><p>For purposes of transfer to other institutions or for certification stated in credit or semester hours, a quarter-long course bearing 1.0 unit of credit is generally the equivalent of 2 2/3 (2.66) semester hours. In quarter hours, 1 quarter-long course is equal to 4 quarter hours of undergraduate credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit for Repeated Courses</head><p>When courses designed to be taken once are repeated, all attempts remain on the student's record and all grades are used to compute the cumulative grade point average. However, credit is awarded only once, following the attempt that resulted in the highest grade. Similarly, when courses that allow more than one completion are repeated more than the maximum number of allowed times, all attempts remain on the record but credit is not awarded for units taken in excess of the maximum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numbering System</head><p>A three-part alphanumeric code denotes all courses. PHYSICS 135-1 General Physics, PHYSICS 135-2 General Physics, PHYSICS 135-3 General Physics may be used as an example:</p><p>• The first part is the subject code indicating the area of study (PHYSICS in the example).</p><p>• The subject code is followed by the three-digit course number indicating the level of study:</p><p>• 100-199 (as in the example) denote courses primarily for first-year students and sophomores, usually without college prerequisite.</p><p>• 200-299 denote courses primarily for first-year students, sophomores, and juniors, sometimes with the prerequisite of a 100-level course in the same or a related department.</p><p>• 300-399 denote courses primarily for juniors and seniors, with the prerequisite of junior standing or a 100-or 200-level course in the same or a related department.</p><p>• 400-499 denote courses or seminars, primarily for graduate students, in which the major part of the work is not research;</p><p>they may be open to advanced undergraduate students with permission.</p><p>• 500-599 denote graduate courses or seminars in which the work is primarily research.</p><p>• The third part usually indicates whether the course is part of a sequence.</p><p>• -0 = one-quarter course • -1,2 = two-quarter sequence</p><p>• -1,2,3 = three-quarter sequence (as in the example) Special characters identify certain groups of courses. If a course is taught only through a Northwestern study abroad program, the designation SA is included with the course number. Other designations may be used by the individual departments; see departmental listings for details.</p><p>• The dates of registration for each quarter are announced in advance. Late registration is permitted only through the fifth full day of classes in any quarter.</p><p>• Students will not earn credit for courses in which they are not officially registered. Degree-seeking students may not audit (p. 25) courses.</p><p>• At the time of registration, students receive a warning message when enrolling in a class that they have already taken. Repeated courses all calculate in the GPA but credit is typically awarded only once.</p><p>• Waiver of prerequisites for admission to a course may be sought from the course instructor or department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes of Registration</head><p>Changes in registration in fall, winter, and spring quarters are subject to the following provisions:</p><p>• In no case may a course be added after the fifth day of classes. No course may be dropped after the sixth Friday of classes.</p><p>• In courses designated with "Student Option" grading, undergraduate students may elect to change from quality grade to the pass/no credit (P/N) option or vice versa through the third Friday of the quarter. Check regulations of the individual schools for specific information on the P/N option and how courses completed P/N may be applied to academic requirements.</p><p>• To add a class, students must log on to CAESAR and add the course to their record. Consent of the department or instructor may be required. See the class schedule for specific course information.</p><p>• To drop a course, students must log on to CAESAR and drop the course from the record. In most cases no special consent is required.</p><p>• A course dropped by the sixth Friday of a quarter does not appear on the permanent academic record, and no grade is recorded.</p><p>• Failure to drop a course within the time allowed may result in a failure and may be recorded with a grade of F.</p><p>See also Withdrawal Refunds (p. 17) and Change of <ref type="bibr">Registration and Bills (p. 17)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration in the School of Professional Studies</head><p>Northwestern University School of Professional Studies, with locations in Evanston, Chicago, and the Chicago Loop, offers courses designed primarily for working adults. Students enrolled in an undergraduate school at Northwestern may take SPS courses for credit only with the approval of their school's dean or their faculty adviser. SPS students have priority, so enrollment of non-SPS undergraduate students in SPS courses is capped. Registrations are processed on the first day of the quarter, and priority is given to students who need a course to complete a major.</p><p>To register for SPS courses, students must • Pick up a Dual Registration Form from the Office of the Registrar in Evanston.</p><p>• Secure the required approvals.</p><p>• Turn in the form at the Office of the Registrar in Evanston as soon as possible before classes start.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exams and Attendance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regular Examinations</head><p>Regular course examinations are held during the last week of each quarter at the times indicated in the quarterly class schedule, accessible via CAESAR and at https://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/calendars/ final-exam-schedules/index.html. Summer Session examinations are usually held at the last class meeting. Students are responsible for knowing the time and location of each examination. Early examinations policies are determined by each school. Both the instructor and the dean may permit a student to be absent from the final examination for cause beyond the student's control; normally such permission must be secured in advance of the date of the examination and an incomplete grade is awarded. Students planning to graduate within that time frame must complete courses and receive grades before graduating. Incomplete grades remaining at the time of degree conferral will be changed to final grades of F (failure).</p><p>Please also see the policy on incomplete grades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance and Absence</head><p>Students are expected to attend all sessions of the courses for which they are registered. Excessive absence is cause for failure in the course. Some courses require attendance at the first class meeting; students may be dropped for nonattendance. Such courses are designated in CAESAR as "First Class Mandatory."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal Withdrawal from the University</head><p>Students who wish to withdraw from the University, either temporarily or permanently, after registering for classes must file a withdrawal form (available at the Office of the Registrar) and have it approved by appropriate school and/or Student Affairs officials, and then submitted to the Office of the Registrar.</p><p>If the request is submitted before the term begins (i.e. the first day of classes), registration is cancelled and removed from the student's record. Cancellation of registration also cancels all applicable tuition and fees for that quarter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Coursework Eligibility for Incomplete Grades</head><p>Northwestern University expects students to finish their coursework on time or remove themselves by dropping or withdrawing. When situations outside a student's control arise that prevent timely course completion, Northwestern designates two different incomplete grades, X and Y to designate what work is outstanding. X grades indicate that a student missed the final exam or did not submit the final assessment, but all other work in the term was complete. The assignment of Y grades is governed by the policy below.</p><p>Northwestern undergraduate students may request an incomplete grade of Y only in a course in which they have substantially completed the work, including any requirements of attendance or engagement. The university minimally requires that more than 50% of the course requirements must be complete in order for the course to be "substantially completed." Students must also be passing the course based on the materials submitted thus far to be eligible for an incomplete Y grade.</p><p>This policy allows but does not compel incomplete Y grades in the above circumstances; Grading is the purview of the faculty, as governed by school policies, and they may choose to deny requests for incomplete grades in cases where this policy allows them.</p><p>Individual schools may also require approval by staff in the deans' offices in order for an incomplete grade to be assigned (see the Weinberg College incomplete approval process (https://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/ undergraduate/courses-registration-grades/incompletes.html)). Schools may consider a number of other factors when considering approval or denial of incomplete grades, such as the number of incompletes a student has requested and whether any are outstanding.</p><p>Students must consider the school offering the course, not their own school, to determine the process by which an incomplete grade is requested and assigned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Incomplete Grades</head><p>As the tables above illustrate, both X and Y grades bear 0.00 grade points. As such, schools factor incomplete grades into enrollment, probation and dismissal decisions, and students should be sure they understand how incomplete grades affect academic standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resolving Incomplete Coursework</head><p>The student must complete the course and the grade must be changed no later than the end of the following like term, or the incomplete will be changed to a final grade of F (failure). This University deadline to change an incomplete grade is the maximum amount of time allowed: Instructors are free to establish an earlier deadline and students are bound by that agreement.</p><p>Students planning to graduate before the standard grade change deadline (the following like term) must complete courses and receive grades before graduating. Incomplete grades remaining at the time of degree conferral will be changed to final grades of F (failure). Grade changes are not permitted after a degree has been conferred.</p><p>For additional information, see https://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/ registration-graduation/graduation-preparation/index.html.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Conferral</head><p>Undergraduate degrees are conferred at the end of each quarter, including summer. The official conferral date for each term is the Friday after exams end and grades are due. All programs for which a student has completed requirements are conferred simultaneously at the end of the student's career. Once the degree(s) are posted to the student's record, it is closed and no changes or further enrollment as an undergraduate are permitted.</p><p>The appropriate credential documenting degree completion and majors, minors and certificates completed is an official transcript with notation of an awarded degree. Diplomas are considered by Northwestern University to be ceremonial documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Honors Honors and Prizes Graduation with School Honors</head><p>Degrees with honors are determined by grades in all work at Northwestern University and are awarded to the top 25 percent of the students in each school who complete graduation requirements. Spring quarter graduates in the highest 5 percent of the school's class are awarded degrees summa cum laude; those in the next 8 percent, magna cum laude; and those in the next 12 percent, cum laude. Graduation honors are not announced before Spring Commencement, and the GPA cutoffs for each level of honors based on the stated percentages are not made public. Students who complete degrees in the summer, fall, or winter quarter are awarded school honors based on the GPA cutoffs established by the prior spring quarter's graduating class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation with Departmental Honors</head><p>Departmental honors may be granted to graduating seniors who have done outstanding work in a department in connection with a research project or work of an integrative nature. Students are nominated for these honors by their departments. The faculty of the school concerned makes the final awards. See the school sections of this catalog for more information on departmental honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honorary Organizations and Prizes</head><p>Students who qualify by reason of superior scholarship or other outstanding achievement are eligible for membership in certain honorary societies. Some of these recognize outstanding performance within one of the undergraduate schools, while others recognize distinction in a specific field of study, certain extracurricular options, or other endeavors.</p><p>In addition, several prizes established through gifts and endowments are awarded each year to undergraduate students. Some are all-University prizes, and others are available only to students in the school, department, or program that administers the awards. Prizes may recognize past achievements or provide students with funding for research projects or creative activities. First-year student less than 11 units complete • Graduate student: has a bachelor's degree or equivalent and has been admitted to a graduate program • Special student: is not working toward a degree at Northwestern but is working for credit Disciplinary Actions to fulfill degree requirements within a reasonable period of time, the student may be dismissed from the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Status</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of Students</head><p>The following are ordinarily placed on academic probation:</p><p>• Students who have received final grades below C in 2 or more courses in any term • Sophomores, juniors, or seniors who have a cumulative academic record below a C average on all work attempted at Northwestern University • Students who have failed to complete at least 3 quarter-courses or the equivalent in each of 2 consecutive quarters • Students who, on account of dropped courses, failure, or uncompleted courses, have failed to earn credit for an average of 3 quarter-courses per quarter after 6 quarters of residence • Students who have failed to maintain a C average in the major or a professional field of study</p><p>The faculty of each school may impose such additional conditions of academic probation as they may deem appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Removal from Academic Probation</head><p>Students on academic probation are ordinarily removed from probation if the deficiencies that resulted in probation have been remedied during the next succeeding quarter in residence. Students are rarely removed from probation on the basis of a program consisting of less than 4 courses graded on a basis other than the pass/no credit option.</p><p>If students on probation who receive grades of X or Y are not dismissed, probation continues until they have completed all courses or until the end of the next quarter in residence, when the students' records are again subject to scrutiny.</p><p>In no case are students removed from probation at the end of a quarter in which they have failed any course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>The following is a partial list of categories of students who may be dismissed for academic deficiencies (in every case the decision is determined in part by the student's cumulative academic record):</p><p>• Students on academic probation whose academic records have not improved significantly during the period of probation (which will not normally exceed 2 consecutive quarters)</p><p>• Students not on academic probation who fail in half the work in any quarter or Summer Session • Students who demonstrate flagrant neglect of academic work at any time • Students who do not make satisfactory progress toward completion of degree requirements</p><p>As a matter of general policy, the probation period for a first-year student may be extended to the third quarter of residence if such extension appears to be in the best interests of the student and the University. Such consideration is not granted to a first-year student whose record clearly discloses lack of aptitude or flagrant neglect of work.</p><p>Academic dismissal from the University is noted on official transcripts at the end of the relevant term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dual Degree Students</head><p>Dual degree students are held separately to the academic standing policies of both schools. Therefore, depending on respective performance in the academic work required by each school, students may have different standing up to and including academic dismissal in one school but not the other. School officials communicate each term to ensure colleagues are informed of the standing of all students pursuing degrees in their respective schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disciplinary Actions Disciplinary Suspension/Expulsion</head><p>Students suspended from Northwestern by the University Hearing and Appeals System may not receive Northwestern credit for academic work pursued at any other institution during the period of suspension.</p><p>Student Conduct findings that result in dismissal from the University are noted on official transcripts at the end of the relevant term. Expulsion is recorded on the transcript; suspension is not. Details about disciplinary policies and records can be found at http://www.northwestern.edu/ student-conduct/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Returning to the University Readmission to the University</head><p>Undergraduate students who have not registered for one or more quarters of an academic year must file an application to reenter with their school dean's office no later than six weeks before the first day of registration of the quarter in which they plan to return. Students who seek credit for course work taken at another institution must submit an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar, as well as have the transfer credit approved by relevant Northwestern departments and officials in their home schools.</p><p>Application to reenter is not required if students have registered during the spring quarter and intend to return in the fall.</p><p>If a student interrupts a program of study for an extended period of time and degree requirements are changed during this period, the new requirements normally must be met. Any modification of the requirements is made by the appropriate administrative officers of the school in which the student is registered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcripts Northwestern University Transcripts</head><p>Students who have satisfied all financial obligations to the University may request an official transcript of their academic record from the Office of the Registrar in person, by fax, or through CAESAR (https:// caesar.northwestern.edu). Northwestern provides transcripts either on paper or in the form of a certified PDF that may be distributed securely. A fee is charged for all official transcripts (see Fees under Tuition and Fees). Current students may print unofficial copies for their personal use from CAESAR.</p><p>Except for internal educational uses or as otherwise required by law, Northwestern issues official transcripts only upon written authorization of the student concerned. Requests for transcripts initiated by persons or agencies other than the student or appropriate educational agencies will not be filled until written authorization has been secured from the student. When these requests can be anticipated, students can avoid delay by providing such authorization in advance. Because of the confidential nature of a student's record, telephone or email requests for transcripts will not be accepted.</p><p>Former students may order an official transcript by following the instructions at www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/ obtaining_a_transcript.html. The site provides full information on the University's policies and procedures governing academic records.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcripts from Other Institutions</head><p>Northwestern neither releases nor certifies copies of transcripts or other academic documents received from other schools or institutions. This includes test score reports and transcripts submitted to Northwestern for admission or evaluation of transfer or study abroad credits. Students who study abroad and subsequently need a transcript of their coursework must request it from the institutions they attended or through their study abroad programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>Per the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (https:// www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration-graduation/graduationpreparation/undergraduate-registration-requirements.html), students must complete a minimum number of Northwestern credits and quarters in order to complete a Northwestern degree. These minimums also affect the numbers of Advanced Placement (AP), transfer credit, and/or other external credit (such as International Baccalaureate) that may be applied toward the undergraduate degree. The requirement varies depending upon whether a student enters as a freshman or transfer student, and whether the degree program is a four-year program or a dual bachelor's degree program. Students should review the requirement (https://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration-graduation/ graduation-preparation/undergraduate-registration-requirements.html) when attempting to transfer credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Credit</head><p>Eligible Advanced Placement (AP) and higher-level International Baccalaureate (IB) scores may be applied to a bachelor's degree. Northwestern may also award credit for distinguished performance on certain foreign national examinations. The type and level of test credit awarded is standardized across the undergraduate schools, though each school has separate rules regarding the use of test credit to fulfill particular degree requirements. Refer to the schools' websites for details.</p><p>Students may not receive duplicate credit in one area of study. For example, a student who takes the AP and IB exams in calculus and receives eligible scores on both will be granted credit for only one set of results. Students may only earn credit for exams taken prior to matriculation at Northwestern University, or matriculation at another post-secondary institution before transferring to Northwestern.</p><p>An updated test credit policy is published annually for the incoming class. For further details see the Office of the Registrar's website: https:// www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration-graduation/transferand-test-credit/advanced-placement-and-international-baccalaureatecredits.html.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Types Work at Other Institutions</head><p>Students who wish to transfer credit for work taken elsewhere during an absence from Northwestern must obtain advance approval of their proposed course of study. Procedures vary depending upon whether the study is part of a study abroad program or simply enrollment at another institution. Students should consult https:// www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration-graduation/transferand-test-credit/transfer-credit-after-enrolling-at-nu.html for policies and procedures, including the appropriate petition for credit for non-Northwestern courses. An official signed and sealed transcript documenting that work must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar in order for credit to be applied to the student's record.</p><p>Students may not register concurrently at Northwestern and at another institution and receive transfer credit for work taken at the other institution unless permission is granted in advance by the office of the dean of their schools. This applies to traditional and online or blendedformat courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>Transfer students are defined as students who have completed at least one full academic year at a postsecondary institution prior to entering Northwestern. Once admitted, the Office of the Registrar conducts an evaluation of credit earned at the student's previous institution and makes an initial determination of appropriate Northwestern credit to award. Transfer students are held to a different Undergraduate Registration Requirement (https://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/ registration-graduation/graduation-preparation/undergraduateregistration-requirements.html) than students who enter Northwestern as first-year students; otherwise, all academic policies apply equally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Registration Requirement</head><p>The Undergraduate Registration Requirement (URR) applies to students seeking a bachelor's degree and must be completed in addition to the degree requirements established by the school faculties. Each school specifies a minimum number of units of credit needed for a bachelor's degree (42 or more, depending on the degree and school). The URR specifies the number of quarters a student must be registered at Northwestern and how much credit must be earned at Northwestern. It is predicated on the principle that when a student receives a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University, the majority of the student's academic work is completed at the University.</p><p>For the purposes of the URR, the following definitions apply:</p><p>• Being "registered at Northwestern" for a quarter means that during that quarter the student is registered for and completes Northwestern coursework worth at least 2 full units of credit under the supervision of Northwestern faculty members. Eligible coursework includes, for instance, the practicum in the School of Education and Social Policy and the Journalism Residency in the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. It does not include the Walter P. Murphy Cooperative Engineering Education Program or most study abroad credits (see exception below).</p><p>• For counting number of quarters, a credit-bearing course is considered completed if a student receives any of the following grades: A, B, C (including pluses and minuses), D, F, P, N, X, Y, K, or W.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>Undergraduate Registration Requirement</p><p>Courses in which the student receives an NR are not included. The NR is an administrative notation rather than a grade.</p><p>• Only credits earned (not just attempted) count toward the minimum units of credit needed. Thus, only courses in which the student receives an A, B, C (including pluses and minuses), D, or P are included.</p><p>The provisions of the URR are as follows:</p><p>• A student entering as a first-year student in a four-year degree program must be registered at Northwestern for at least 9 quarters and earn credit for courses worth at least 32 units at the University.</p><p>• A student entering as a first-year student and completing a dual bachelor's degree program involving two schools must be registered at Northwestern for at least 11 quarters and earn credit for courses worth at least 42 units at the University. See the Dual Bachelor's Degrees (p. 36) section for information on approved dual bachelor's degree programs. This provision does not apply to students completing two BS degrees within McCormick; see <ref type="bibr">Options &amp; Support (p. 123)</ref> in McCormick for the specific requirements covering this situation.</p><p>• A student entering as a transfer student in a four-year degree program must be registered at the University for at least 6 quarters and earn credit for courses worth at least 21 units at the University.</p><p>• A student entering as a transfer student and completing a dual bachelor's degree program involving two schools must be registered at Northwestern for at least 9 quarters and earn credit for courses worth at least 32 units at the University. See the Dual Bachelor's Degrees (p. 36) section for information on approved dual bachelor's degree programs. This provision does not apply to students completing two BS degrees within McCormick; see <ref type="bibr">Options &amp; Support (p. 123)</ref> in McCormick for the specific requirements covering this situation.</p><p>• Students who complete at least 2 full units of credit in SA-designated courses in a quarter are considered to be registered at Northwestern for that quarter, and this credit will count toward the minimum needed to satisfy the URR. Transfer credit for study abroad courses that do not carry Northwestern course numbers and the SA designation will not be counted toward the URR, with the exception of HPME students as detailed below.</p><p>• HPME students, who are subject to all other URR provisions for students entering as first-year students in a four-year degree program, have the option to use 1 quarter of study abroad via a program approved by the Global Learning Office toward the 9-quarter URR requirement, if they earn the transferred equivalent of at least 2 units of Northwestern credit. Such students may not use these credits toward the required 32 units of Northwestern credit.</p><p>• ISP students in Weinberg College are subject to the following special URR provisions: • Students must register for at least 6 quarters and complete at least 23 units of credit at Northwestern.</p><p>• The remainder of the 38.7 minimum units required of ISP students may be a combination of test and approved transfer (including study abroad) credit.</p><p>A student may appeal for a URR variance to the Registration Requirement Appeals Committee, which consists of the associate provost for undergraduate enrollment, the associate provost for undergraduate education, the University registrar, and two associate or assistant deans from different undergraduate schools. The deans serve three-year terms on a rotating basis.</p><p>The student should submit a written petition to an adviser familiar with his or her situation. The adviser writes a letter of support and submits both documents to the Office of the Registrar for the committee's consideration. The appeal must be specific and document any unusual or mitigating circumstances, such as illness, family hardship, or a death in the family. The Registration Requirement Appeals Committee convenes on a regular basis to review petitions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BSJ/BMus Course Requirements</head><p>Since study abroad often requires special language or other preparation, interested students should consult with study abroad advisers early in their Northwestern careers. Other resources include information sessions, an annual study abroad fair, GLO Student Ambassadors, and detailed information on study abroad programs and policies on the GLO homepage (https://www.northwestern.edu/abroad). Northwestern undergraduates win an array of national and international fellowships. Such awards fund study, research, and service opportunities in the United States and around the globe. The Office of Fellowships works with students in group and individual advising sessions to identify fellowships that fit their educational, professional, and personal goals. The office offers guidance on the preparation of written applications and conducts practice interviews.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study (399)</head><p>Many departments offer seminars and independent studies for qualified undergraduates. An independent study, typically numbered 399, in any department enables a student to engage in individual special study and research, which may involve work in a laboratory or library, fieldwork outside the University, or the creation of a work of art. The maximum credit a student may receive for 399 (or equivalent independent study) during any quarter is 2 units.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support for Undergraduate Research Endeavors</head><p>undergradresearch.northwestern.edu globalresearchopportunities.northwestern.edu</p><p>The Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) awards more than $1.3 million annually to students pursuing research and creative projects across all fields of study. OUR uses an advising-centric model that focuses on helping students learn how to get started and how to write successful grant proposals; OUR advisors meet one-on-one with more than 500 students a year, totaling over 1,200 advising appointments.</p><p>OUR has three core programs. The Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (URAP) allows faculty to apply for funding to hire students to help with their own projects in a formal mentoring environment designed to foster rapid development. The program focuses on assisting students just getting started in research and prefers disciplines where funding for undergraduates is hard to get, such as in the humanities or creative arts. The Undergraduate Research Grant (URG) program funds independent research and creative projects across all disciplines. The 35+ member faculty review committee is currently charged with offering a strictly merit-based review of grant proposals. This process means that the committee can fund any and all projects that they feel are worthy. If a student has a solid idea, works with faculty mentors, and uses the Office's advising to learn how to write a successful grant proposal, then the competition is not between students, but rather challenges the individual student to discover what is needed in a field and create a project to potentially address this need to gain funding. These grants regularly transform a student's experience of college and beyond. Finally, OUR runs the Undergraduate Research and Arts Exposition, an annual showcase of student work through oral presentations, posters, and a Creative Arts Festival. For all participants, OUR runs workshops designed to help students develop strong and effective communication skills, specifically for an audience that isn't already familiar with their field of interest.</p><p>Other OUR grants provide support for intensive language study or for conference travel. An annual $9,500 award-the Circumnavigators Travel-Study Grant, jointly funded by Northwestern University and the Circumnavigators Club Foundation-enables one undergraduate researcher to undertake around-the-world travel during the summer before senior year. In addition, OUR manages the Global and Research Opportunities website, allowing students easy, searchable access to opportunities within and beyond Northwestern, and OUR collaborates to other schools, departments, and units who also provide funds to support undergraduate research experiences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>One of the oldest degree-granting music institutions in the United States, Northwestern University's Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music combines a nationally ranked music program of conservatory-level intensity with the academic rigor and scholarly resources found only at a world-class private research university. Entering first-year undergraduates show the highest level of achievement in music as well as academics. The school believes that by carefully developing outstanding musicianship and keen intelligence, while nurturing a curiosity about the world, we can best encourage the emergence of each student's unique creative voice.</p><p>Key to all performance majors is intensive one-on-one training with a celebrated faculty that includes members of the Chicago Symphony and Lyric Opera of Chicago Orchestras, internationally acclaimed soloists, sought-after conductors, and distinguished scholars and clinicians. Students work in small classes with these dedicated teachers and artists in a curriculum that comprises music history and theory, aural and piano skills, instrumental and voice lessons, and advanced electives. Special programs include a five-year dual-degree curriculum-enabling students to earn a degree in music as well as one in communication, education and social policy, engineering, journalism, or arts and sciences-and the ad hoc (self-designed) major. Additionally, the world-class music making and other cultural resources of downtown Chicago provide exceptional opportunities for learning outside the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facilities</head><p>The Bienen School of Music occupies three lakefront buildings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music Library</head><p>Among the nation's largest music libraries, the Northwestern University Music Library supports all areas of musical study with a broad collection of books, scores, sound recordings, periodicals, and online resources. The facility, located in historic Deering Library, offers a reading room rich in reference materials, a music listening center, and a computer lab equipped with specialized music hardware and software. The Music Library is also distinguished internationally for its extensive collection of contemporary music, which includes one copy of nearly every score published since 1945 as well as many original manuscripts by prominent composers such as Pierre Boulez, John Cage, George Crumb, and Iannis Xenakis. The Music Library's collections and staff serve the Bienen School of Music, the entire Northwestern University community, and researchers from around the world. For more information see www.library.northwestern.edu/music.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs of Study</head><p>The Bienen School of Music offers programs leading to the professional degrees of bachelor of music, master of music, and doctor of musical arts. The school also offers two nonprofessional degrees, the bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music.</p><p>The curriculum allows flexibility for students while providing an education that is foundational for all musicians. Applicants in all areas who are accepted by the Bienen School enter directly into a program of specialization that begins in the first undergraduate year. The music core studies, taken by all students, require the acquisition of fundamental competencies and provide fundamental and essential experiences that complement the specialized studies in the declared major. Students are also required to complete studies in a number of allied subjects throughout the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Music (BMus)</head><p>Courses of study leading to the bachelor of music degree include majors in piano, strings, voice, winds and percussion, jazz, music cognition, music composition, music education, musicology, and music theory. Candidates for the degree of bachelor of music must complete a minimum of 48 units. For bachelor of music degree requirements, see the program page specific to the area of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts in Music (BAMus) and Bachelor of Science in Music (BSMus)</head><p>The bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music are nonperformance degrees that offer a broad liberal arts education with a major in music. The requirements of the BAMus are essentially identical to those for the BA in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; the requirements for the BSMus are the same as those for the BAMus except that the BSMus has no foreign language requirement. Within these degrees' focus on music, there are a wide range of possibilities for study; students may choose to specialize in one of the available academic areas (music cognition, music composition, music education, musicology, or music theory) by fulfilling their Music Electives with courses in their area of interest, they may choose not to specialize (in which case the Music Electives are fulfilled with any music courses), or they may design an ad hoc specialization, consisting of 10 units which substitute for the Music Electives category below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading</head><p>Music majors must earn a grade of C or above in all courses required in the major, including all music core requirements and all specialization courses, in order to count those courses toward graduation requirements. A grade of D or above (including P grades for non-dual degree students) may be used to fulfill distribution requirements and electives. If a student receives a D in a major course, then takes that course a second time and receives a C grade or above, the initial D grade remains on the permanent record and cannot count toward elective requirements. The second (improved) grade does not replace the first, and the same course cannot be counted twice in the degree.</p><p>A maximum of six courses in non-music subjects taken under the P/N grade option may be counted toward the degree. Music students may not take music courses under the P/N grade option, except for those courses graded solely with P/N grades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance Policy</head><p>Students are expected to attend all sessions of courses and ensembles for which they are registered. It is the responsibility of students enrolled in the Bienen School of Music to acquaint themselves and comply with the attendance policy of their departments, class instructors, and ensemble conductors. In addition, students who are absent from classes for three or more consecutive days because of illness are required to notify the Bienen School's Office of Student Affairs.</p><p>Outside professional opportunities may arise for music students. If such an opportunity directly interferes in any way with curricular responsibilities, students must first obtain permission from the faculty of record for courses potentially affected, including classes, rehearsals, and performances, along with the signature of the program coordinator and a signature from one of the co-chairs of the Department of Music Performance. Noncompliance may be cause for failure in the courses or ensembles for which a student is registered during that quarter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Music Study</head><p>Bachelor of Music degrees require four years of individual instruction for performance majors in piano, strings, voice, winds and percussion, jazz, and in composition. One year is required for academic majors in music cognition, musicology, and music theory; three years are required for music education. Concurrent registration in a major ensemble (https:// www.music.northwestern.edu/academics/ensembles) is required in each quarter of applied study, with the exception of piano majors and composition majors. Applied study must be with a faculty instructor in the program area to fulfill degree requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Music Courses</head><p>Students in degree programs outside of music may have a limit on the number of applied music courses that are allowed to count toward those degrees. The list below specifies courses offered by the Bienen School that are considered to be applied music. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Majors</head><p>Students may earn a double major in four years by fulfilling the requirements of both majors. Typically, the double major within the Bienen School of Music combines a specialization in a performance area with one in an academic area, although double majors in two academic areas are also possible. A double major in two performance areas is not permitted.</p><p>Four-year music students may also complete a second major outside the music school but may earn only one bachelor's degree. Second majors from the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences are available to Bienen School of Music students without transferring into that school. Majors in the other four undergraduate schools at Northwestern may only be completed by students in that school; in these cases, interested music students may either pursue a dual degree with the second school, or transfer to the other school and complete the music major as a second major, in which case no degree from the Bienen School is awarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ad Hoc Majors</head><p>It is possible to design an ad hoc (self-designed) major that cuts across specializations to meet a particular student's needs and career ambitions. Bachelor of Music degree students may design an ad hoc major as a second major; 12 units are required, and may not be double counted in the primary major. Bachelor of arts in music and bachelor of science in music degree students may pursue an ad hoc concentration within the degree; 10 units are required for the concentration. Ad hoc programs are designed in consultation with faculty with expertise in the particular area of interest. Specializations have included areas such as arts administration, music criticism, and popular musicology.</p></div>

We seek to improve the practice of communication, whether on the stage or screen, at the podium, in the clinic, or in everyday life.</p><p>The school is committed to building the basic and applied sciences of communication; developing theoretical and critical perspectives on communicative performances; creating new technologies for communication and new modes of artistic expression; and helping students to be more effective in their work, at home, and in civic life by applying principles of communication. Undergraduates work in partnerships with world-class faculty to create new understandings and develop new approaches to human communication. The curriculum provides students with a solid liberal-arts education that broadens and enriches their studies of human expression and interaction.</p><p>Founded by Robert Cumnock in 1878, the School of Communication is now the third largest of Northwestern's six undergraduate divisions. It annually enrolls approximately 1,200 undergraduate majors and 400 graduate students.</p><p>Originally, the curriculum and its related activities were concerned with public speaking and interpretative reading as performing arts.</p><p>As the field grew, the school added instruction in theatre, speech pathology, audiology, radio, television, film, and other specialties in oral communication. Throughout its history the school has often been a pioneer in new fields of study, including film and audiology.</p><p>Today the five departments of instruction represent the diverse spectrum of study in the field of communication: communication sciences and disorders; communication studies; performance studies; radio/television/ film; and theatre (including dance </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Requirements</head><p>The School of Communication grants the degree of bachelor of science in communication upon:</p><p>1. the satisfactory completion of 42 course units;</p><p>2. the fulfillment of the distribution requirement of the student's major department; and 3. the completion of an approved major in communication and related fields suited to the student's special interests and needs.</p><p>If students interrupt the program of study for an extended period of time and degree requirements are changed during this period, they are normally held to the new requirements.</p><p>In addition to, and independent of, the requirements set by the School of Communication, students must satisfy the Undergraduate Registration Requirement.</p><p>The Departments of Communication Studies, Performance Studies, Radio/Television/Film, and Theatre (including dance) offer the bachelor of arts in communication. The requirements for this degree are identical to the requirements for the bachelor of science in communication with the addition of a foreign language requirement. (Regardless of whether the BA or BS is sought, the required programs of study for majors in the Departments of Communication Studies and Radio/Television/ Film include specific foreign language requirements; for details, see the major requirements for each of those programs.) To earn the bachelor of arts in communication, students-in addition to completing the degree requirements for the bachelor of science-must demonstrate two-year proficiency in a classical or modern foreign language. Proficiency is defined as competence in the work covered through the final quarter of a college-level second-year language course sequence (or equivalent as determined by each foreign language department). Students who enroll for course credit to satisfy the proficiency requirement must earn a grade no lower than C-in the final course of the second-year course sequence. This proficiency is established in precisely the same manner as in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; see the Weinberg College (p. 181) section of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Requirements</head><p>Of the 42 units of credit required for all major programs in the School of Communication, 35 must be completed with grades of A, B, or C (grades of C-do not satisfy this requirement).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>communication.northwestern.edu/departments/csd</head><p>The Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders offers a major in human communication sciences, providing undergraduate students with a foundation for the study of disorders of hearing, speech, language, and learning. The department's classroom, clinical, and research facilities are located in the Frances Searle Building on the Evanston campus. The undergraduate program emphasizes the basic science principles underlying all human communication and cognition and introduces students to clinical issues and research findings that pertain to disorders of communication and learning. The major in human communication sciences is particularly appealing to students who plan to attend graduate or professional school in fields such as speech and language pathology, audiology, learning disabilities, medicine, dentistry, and biomedical engineering. It is an attractive major for students admitted to the Honors Program in Medical Education, providing opportunities for students to connect their study of basic scientific principles to research and clinical activities as well as real-life issues. Students who do not pursue medical, clinically based, or research graduate degrees may enter careers in health-related private industry or the public sector.</p><p>Undergraduate majors in human communication sciences have the option of pursuing a general course of study, typical for most premed students, or of choosing among three areas of concentration: audiology and hearing sciences, learning disabilities, and speech and language pathology.</p><p>Audiology and hearing sciences encompasses the study of hearing, hearing disorders, and the treatment of hearing disorders. Emphasis is on basic communication science, including study of the anatomical, physiological, and physical bases of hearing. Undergraduate courses present information on normal communication processes and provide an introduction to audiologic assessment and hearing loss management.</p><p>Learning disabilities is concerned with learning processes and their dysfunctions, including disorders of perception, memory, language, and conceptualization. Such disorders lead to problems in the acquisition and use of oral language, reading, writing, and math skills that require specialized remediation. Undergraduate coursework stresses theoretical, scientific, clinical, and educational issues as a foundation for advanced training.</p><p>Speech and language pathology introduces students to the psychological, linguistic, neurological, acoustic, anatomical, and physiological bases of normal speech and language behavior. As their knowledge of normal speech, language, learning, and hearing processes increases, students are introduced to the communicative disorders that result from the disruption of these processes. Advanced undergraduate courses are concerned with the nature, recognition, and management of common communicative disorders and present issues related to administration and public policy.</p></div>

The courses explore an interdisciplinary range of literary, cultural, and personal texts in performance. The department has particular strengths in the study of literature through solo performance; the ensemble adaptation and staging of poetic, narrative, and nonfictional texts; intercultural performance; performance art; cultural studies and the ethnography of performance; and performance theory and criticism.</p><p>Internships and field study for performance studies majors extend and deepen their classroom work with experiential learning. Extracurricular work provides students with a variety of opportunities to perform, adapt, and direct, enabling their creative work to reach an audience outside the classroom.</p><p>Performance studies majors have been successful in many professions that require intelligence and imagination as well as critical and creative skills. In addition to pursuing careers in professional theatre and arts development, many graduates teach literature, theatre, humanities, and performance studies. Majors have found performance studies an excellent preparation for law school and complementary to their interests in creative writing, communication, new media, anthropology, dance, literature, or social work. Performance studies can be thought of as a major that bridges artistic expression and conceptual analysis, theory and practice. Performance, in its manifold forms, is the subject and the method of study. </p></div>

Of all the performing arts, none draws on the rich variety of human experience more fully than theatre. Theatre communicates the drama of life-whether the past, present, or future, and whether real or imagined -with immediacy, excitement, and eloquence. The student of theatre, therefore, must be a student of human society and must understand how social forces impinge on human behavior. To paraphrase Boswell, students of the theatre take as their subject the entire system of human life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introductory Course (1 unit)</head><p>For this reason students who major in theatre at Northwestern combine a liberal arts education with intensive training in the theories and arts of the theatre. At the heart of the theatre program lies the idea that the best theatre artist is the one who combines a broad knowledge of the literature and theory of the field with highly developed skills in its practice.</p><p>Students spend approximately one-third of their program studying in the Department of Theatre, including courses in history, literature, and criticism; acting, voice, and movement; directing; devising theatre; stage production; design; playwriting; dramaturgy; creative drama and theatre for young audiences; and dance. Students develop the ability to approach problems and issues from a variety of perspectives while developing skills in research and writing, laboratory work, group discussion, oral presentation, performance, and production. Another third of the program comprises distribution requirements outside the department, and a final third is devoted to elective courses selected from a wide spectrum of University offerings.</p><p>A major in dance (p. 94) is also available within the Department of Theatre. The dance major prepares students for further advanced academic work or a wide range of positions in professional dance. The major's comprehensive curriculum emphasizes the study of dance as well as the act of dancing. Students are prepared for lifetime involvement in the field and for continued development intellectually, artistically, and professionally within the dance world. In addition to dance technique and choreography, the program provides students with opportunities for writing, research, and analysis in the field.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POLICY</head><p>sesp.northwestern.edu</p><p>The mission of the School of Education and Social Policy is to understand and improve learning communities, defined as groups of people working together in structured social and/or technical environments that influence human development. Learning communities include not only schools and classrooms but also workplaces, families, neighborhoods, and other societal arrangements where learning takes place. Through broad-based interdisciplinary research, teaching, and outreach activities, SESP's faculty strive to better understand how social, psychological, and economic factors shape human development and learning and how innovations in pedagogy, technology, and social policies can benefit lives. They learn to understand human development and improve learning in its various social contexts by applying the social and behavioral sciences.</p><p>The school provides undergraduates with an interdisciplinary curriculum, practical experiences, and research activities that are closely linked to its faculty and graduate programs. Five concentrations lead to the degree of bachelor of science in education and social policy. The intellectual core of the human development in context and social policy concentrations comes from SESP's human development and social policy graduate program. The intellectual core of the learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and secondary teaching concentrations is grounded in the school's learning sciences graduate program.</p><p>The five concentrations offer preparation for a number of career options. Students are encouraged to design their concentrations with career objectives or graduate and professional school admission policies in mind. They enroll with a wide variety of academic and career goals. Some intend to go immediately to graduate and professional schools, while others plan to enter a profession upon graduation.</p><p>Students in Northwestern's other schools may choose to complete the requirements of SESP's secondary teaching concentration in order to qualify for teacher certification.</p><p>SESP offers advanced degrees and programs in elementary and secondary teaching, higher education administration and policy, learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and human development and social policy.</p></div>

The concentrations in human development in context, learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and social policy have similar distribution and core requirements, though each has different major courses; the secondary teaching curriculum is markedly different, largely due to Illinois Board of Education requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade and Registration Requirements</head><p>The following requirements concerning grade point average (GPA) and registration apply to all students seeking the bachelor's degree:</p><p>• 42 course units are required for graduation.</p><p>• Students are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in all work presented for the degree. To qualify for teacher certification, students must earn a minimum grade of C in all professional core courses and maintain minimum GPAs of 2.5 overall and 3.0 in teaching subject-area courses. Students in the human development in context, learning and organizational change, learning sciences, and social policy concentrations must earn a minimum grade of C-in all distribution requirements, core courses, and concentration courses.</p><p>• Full-time students may elect to enroll in some Northwestern courses with the understanding that they will not receive a regular letter grade but the notation P (pass) or N (no credit). They may elect 1 unit per quarter under the P/N option, which may be used only toward elective requirements.</p><p>• Not more than six of the grades in courses taken at Northwestern and presented for graduation may be P's and D's.</p><p>• Students may double-count up to 3 course units from their concentration toward a second major and up to 2 units toward an adjunct major or a minor. Required related courses in Weinberg College are not subject to these limits.</p><p>• Coursework taken at institutions other than Northwestern that is to be counted toward SESP requirements must be approved in advance by the student's adviser; if a course taken for credit is outside SESP's curriculum, the relevant academic department at Northwestern must also approve. Students taking community college courses must earn a grade of B or higher for SESP to accept the credit.</p><p>• A student typically may not have more than a total of three majors plus minors: three majors, two majors and one minor, or one major and two minors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program of Study</head><p>LRN_SCI 309-0 Inclusive Making (1 Unit) Excitement for the Maker Movement continues to grow. Part of this growth stems from the idea that Making provides a means for democratization of fabrication and invention. While this is true, in part, the practices and people that are typically included under this brand are limited. In particular, issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity are seldom at the forefront of the design and implementation of Makerspaces, the tools used or the artifacts created. Hence, the purpose of this course is to bring issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity to the forefront. In particular, the goals of this course are to push students to 1) critically explore Making as a practice that promotes democratization, 2) develop interfaces that allow a broader population of students to participate in digital fabrication and 3) design artifacts that positively impact accessibility and inclusivity. The course will include guest speakers, laboratory portions and a projects that encourages students to develop publishable scholarship and/or functional prototypes, as they work in interdisciplinary teams. This is a hands-on project course. All students will design and implement interactive technologies. For this reason you will be expected to do computer programming and digital fabrication. However, all projects can be completed in teams. Hence, it is not essential that all students come with prior knowledge in computer programming and digital fabrication. Additionally, a portion of class and office hours will be devoted to helping students gain familiarity in basic digital fabrication and computer programming. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biomedical Engineering</head><p>mccormick.northwestern.edu/biomedical</p><p>Biomedical engineers solve problems in the life sciences and clinical medicine by applying engineering and mathematical techniques. This approach has been fruitful where a descriptive approach is no longer adequate for studying complex systems involved in the body's transport, regulation, and information processing. Equally important has been the development of devices used inside or outside the body to replace or supplement physiological functions and to enhance the quality of diagnosis and care.</p><p>The interplay among the physical sciences, engineering, biology, and the medical sciences takes many forms. The traditional study of complex systems-whether for power transmission, communications, or the operation and control of industrial processes-provided engineers with a number of concepts and techniques that proved valuable in analysis and design. These principles expressed in mathematical form are applicable to a wide range of phenomena, including those in biological processes. Information theory, statistics, and computer technology have opened new areas for exploration of sensory and central nervous activity as well as patient handling and diagnosis. Theories for feedback controls, transport processes, materials science, and mechanics have provided new insight into homeostatic physiological processes. Analysis of heat transfer, fluid flow, and chemical-process control in living organisms requires competence in both engineering and the life sciences. Current studies further understanding of many physiological processes, which in turn leads to improvements in clinical practice, diagnosis, and patient care.</p><p>Northwestern was among the first schools to recognize the value of a biomedical engineering background. Today the Department of Biomedical Engineering offers one of the largest and broadest programs in the country at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Most students interested in the field follow its program, but other engineering departments also offer biomedical options.</p><p>The biomedical engineering program provides biomedical training that is quantitative, emphasizes problem solving, and treats phenomena from the molecular to the systems levels. The curriculum prepares students for careers in dentistry, medicine, or research or with healthcare corporations. Required courses in mathematics, engineering, and science establish a strong foundation on which the student builds a self-selected area of specialization.</p><p>A minimum of 18 course units in engineering design and engineering science, as well as substantial training in design, are required for a biomedical engineering degree.</p><p>Those seeking admission to dental or medical school should be familiar with the entrance requirements of schools to which they intend to apply. Many professional schools require courses in physics, organic, and/or physical chemistry and laboratory biology, in addition to courses required by the biomedical engineering program. These requirements may be satisfied by judicious use of electives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biomedical Engineering Electives</head><p>Students seeking depth in one particular area of biomedical engineering may choose to focus their electives in one of the following three areas:</p><p>• Biomechanics and rehabilitation</p><p>• Biomaterials and regenerative medicine • Imaging and biophotonics Alternately, students may choose a broader approach to the curriculum, selecting electives from two or all three of these areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs of Study</head><p>• Biomedical Engineering Degree (p. 127)</p><p>BMD_ENG 101-0 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering (0 Unit) Information to 1) help students determine if BME is the right major for them and 2) learn how to make the most of their undergraduate experience. The field of biomedical engineering, career and research opportunities, ethics.  Chemical engineering is concerned primarily with the principles and processes involved in the conversion of raw materials into products vital to modern civilization. The products of the chemical and process industries range from antibiotics to zirconium, from petroleum to pharmaceuticals, from agricultural chemicals to plastics and synthetic rubber. The rapid introduction of new products gives chemical engineering its characteristic concern with the management and development of innovation. Chemical engineers have always played a pivotal role in the field of energy and more recently have become key players in sustainability and biotechnology.</p><p>While clearly rooted in chemistry, chemical engineering is a distinct discipline that makes significant contributions to society. Concerns about efficient utilization of raw materials, cost-effective and safe processing strategies, and environmental impact have shaped the evolution of the field. Chemical engineers are uniquely skilled in understanding molecular transformations; working over a wide range of scales, from molecular to global; analyzing quantitatively; and viewing, synthesizing, and analyzing large, complex systems.</p><p>Preparation for careers in the field requires a comprehension of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering principles. The chemical engineering curriculum provides broad fundamental training and prepares graduates for the chemical and process industries or for advanced study.</p><p>The program aims at developing graduates who can plan, design, and operate new processes, who can contribute to the development of new chemical products, and who have potential for managerial responsibility in highly technical industrial enterprises.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Civil Engineering</head><p>Civil Engineering is an international profession that provides solutions for pressing societal challenges for both the natural and built environment. Civilian infrastructure systems provide safe and efficient transportation systems for people, food, and manufactured goods; safe and energy efficient residential and commercial buildings; support the ecological and human health by protecting the quality of water, air, and land; and support the energy sector with power plants and their support structures.</p><p>Civil Engineering bridges science and society, and thus plays a leading role in planning, designing, building, and ensuring a sustainable future. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) defines sustainability as a set of economic, environmental and social conditions in which all of society has the capacity and opportunity to maintain and improve its quality of life indefinitely, without degrading the quantity, quality or the availability of natural resources and ecosystems. The civil engineering profession recognizes the reality of limited natural resources, the desire for sustainable practice (including life-cycle analysis and sustainable design techniques), and the need for social equity in the consumption of resources.</p><p>Civil Engineers are the stewardess of our natural resources and the built environment that support commerce, recreation, health, and other necessities of modern social economies. They design, construct, and manage these systems as well as the taller, longer, lighter, and more elegant structures at the end nodes, such as airports, sky scrapers, bridges, etc. everywhere on the planet and even in space. Each system has unique characteristics that challenge civil engineers to combine engineering knowledge with initiative and creativity to meet project objectives, protect the well-being of society and our finite natural resources, and meet budget constraints.</p><p>In addition to the applications of mathematics, physical, natural, and engineering sciences, Civil Engineers must incorporate excellent communication and people-skills, social, economic, managerial sciences, and collaborate with architects, public officials, owners, contractors, material suppliers and the public during various phases of a project. Their work may extend to materials science to develop new building materials; using advanced sensors and communication devices to monitor performance of bridges, tunnels, buildings in real time, over long distances, and under extreme conditions. Civil engineers have designed infrastructures that stretched the limit of materials, performance, and human desire while preserving our natural resources.</p><p>The most unique aspects of civil engineering are: the close interaction with the citizens of a community, influence of political policy, and the ability to execute sustainable designs and constructions that have tremendous impact to the social, economic, and welfare of every member in the world. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Engineering</head><p>Is the water safe to drink? Is the air dangerous to breathe? Should we eat the fish we catch or the crops we grow? Do our living and work spaces pose special threats to our health? Environmental Engineers are the technical professionals who identify and design solutions for environmental problems. They provide answers to the above and other questions about the potentially harmful interrelationships between human civilization and the environment. Environmental engineers apply scientific and technological knowledge to eliminate or reduce environmental problems. They seek to shield the environment from the harmful effects of human activity, protect human populations from adverse environmental events such as floods and disease, and restore environmental quality for ecological and human well-being. Traditionally, environmental engineering includes:</p><p>1. The identification and measurement of potentially harmful physical, chemical, and biological agents in the environment, 2. The transport and fate of these agents, 3. The effects of these agents on people and the environment, and 4. The design and operation of engineered systems for the maintenance and improvement of the quality of our environment.</p><p>Historically, it was the sanitary and civil engineers who made cities livable for large populations. However, the role of environmental engineering has been expanding in the past few decades. Increasingly, environmental engineers are being called upon to expand the focus of their efforts to address the challenges associated with alternative energy, sustainability, climate change, ecological restoration and emerging public health threats.</p><p>Northwestern has developed an interdisciplinary approach to the education of environmental engineers. The four-year curriculum provides the students with a sound fundamental knowledge of environmental engineering principals and an opportunity to integrate other aspects such as basic science, social science, humanities, and public policy to their knowledge. Environmental Engineers stand at the threshold between natural environmental systems and human societies! Graduates in environmental engineering will have many career opportunities in a spectrum of business sectors and government agencies. These include engineering consulting firms that offer challenging employment in environmental planning, design, and management. The manufacturing and chemical industries, utilities, the pollution control industry, and others need engineers for the development and management of research and environmental control programs. Engineers in governmental agencies are responsible for planning and assessment of control strategies and measures to assure a clean and healthful environment. Universities and research organizations afford additional avenues of career development.</p><p>Our recent graduates hold positions as engineering designers, business analytics, and staff engineers of regulatory agency. Sample of their employers include MWH, Ch2M, Jacobs, EPA, Black &amp; Veatch, McMaster Carr, 3M, and many energy start-ups. Many of our graduates continued their education in schools of engineering, law, medicine, public health, and management. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science</head><p>The discipline of materials science and engineering has expanded rapidly in response to growing demand for materials that make improved use of existing resources or are needed for new technologies. The program at Northwestern is broad based, offering educational and research opportunities in polymer science, ceramics, metallurgy, surface science, biomaterials, nanomaterials, and electronic materials. Engineers, scientists, and technologists who work on these different materials all basically apply the same scientific principles governing the interrelation of processing, structure, properties, and material performance. A key theme of the Northwestern program is the integration of these principles in the systematic design of new materials.</p><p>The department offers an undergraduate program leading to the BS degree and participates in the co-op and BS/MS programs. The curriculum centers on basic engineering and materials coursework but also provides the flexibility to focus on different areas of concentration as described below. The student's educational experience is broadened by courses in the humanities, arts, sciences, and other areas of engineering. The undergraduate program culminates in the senior project, in which the student carries out a research/development project with a faculty member and his or her research group.</p><p>Students who complete the BS program will be well prepared for professional work or graduate study in the application, production, processing, or research and development of materials. Graduates find opportunities in many areas, since materials expertise is important in various engineering fields as well as in medicine, physics, and chemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Areas of Concentration</head><p>The undergraduate program at Northwestern offers a close relationship between students and faculty. Every effort is made to tailor specific programs to needs and interests. Several broad areas of concentration are described below. Students are encouraged to create other areas that fit particular interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biomaterials</head><p>The growth of biotechnology has stimulated interest in the interface of the life sciences and materials science. The field of Biomaterials spans three broad areas: biomedical implant materials to replace natural structures; biomimetic materials applying biological concepts to the design of new engineering materials; and application of materials science principles to the understanding of structure and function in biological systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Manufacturing</head><p>This concentration is especially appropriate for those planning a career in industry, where engineers typically work in teams on projects requiring experience with design and manufacturing. It builds on the design content in the materials science curriculum and provides additional interdisciplinary design experience. The concentration also develops industrially relevant strengths in the areas of materials selection, computational tools, materials processing, and failure analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electronic Materials</head><p>As microelectronics enters the era of ultra-large-scale integration, materials scientists face new challenges in developing materials and processes for integrated circuits with components of nanometer dimensions. New scientific principles, materials fabrication techniques, and improved instrumentation will be needed to exploit electroniclevel structure/property relations in devices and their components. New electronic materials must be developed to meet requirements in a growing range of application areas, such as spintronics, optical computing, and fuel cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Energy Materials</head><p>Materials play a key role in a variety of energy-related areas, including the search for new and efficient energy sources as well as energy storage and efficient energy utilization. Specific topics covered in this specialization include fuel cell materials, hydrogen generation and storage, solar energy conversion, lithium-ion battery materials, and lightweight energy-efficient structural materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metals and Ceramics</head><p>The ability to design increasingly higher-strength alloys allows for lighter structures, and higher-temperature materials provide energy efficiency. Heat-treatable and toughened ceramics exploit advanced knowledge of solid-state phase transformations and reactions. Exciting developments are taking place in high-performance composite combinations of these and other materials for structural and electronic applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nanomaterials</head><p>The area of nanomaterials, focusing on materials with sizes in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers, is an increasingly important research topic as nanotechnology industries develop. Examples of nanomaterials include ultrahigh-strength materials with nanometer-range structural features and structures designed and self-assembled atom by atom or molecule by molecule. Machines smaller than the tip of a pin can be built using either semiconductor materials processing or biologically inspired processing technology. This specialization is designed to give students the knowledge needed to work at the nanoscale, including design and synthesis, characterization, and theory/modeling/simulation of nanomaterials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polymeric Materials</head><p>Synthetic polymers offer the engineering community an ever-expanding array of materials having properties tailored by chemical and physical processing. New developments are opening up applications for polymers as high-strength, low-weight materials; optoelectronic components; and key materials in other revolutionary areas.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical</head><p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a broad range of programs leading to the bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering.</p><p>Mechanical engineering has always meant engines and machinery, but the character of modern engines and machinery has changed enormously because of the ever-increasing demands of performance, compactness, reliability, and productivity. The early devices were built by ingenious mechanics who possessed the know-how to reduce ideas to practice. In an increasingly competitive world, traditional know-how and creative ability are as necessary as ever but no longer sufficient. It is also necessary to know why things occur and thus be able to guide the earliest stages of planning. With finite resources and increasing awareness of the environment, mechanical engineers must cope with the undesirable effects of pollution as well as the traditional concerns of efficiency and safety. The tools they need must be more sophisticated.</p><p>Mechanical engineering plays a dominant role in a wide spectrum of industries, among them transportation (automotive, rail, air, and marine), heavy machinery (machines producing other machines), the power industry, the environmental industry (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), robotics, light precision-machine enterprises (optical, prosthetic devices, mechanical instruments, and the like), and numerous commercial-product industries.</p><p>Preparation for a career in mechanical engineering requires a basic understanding of the mathematical, physical, and engineering principles essential to planning, designing, and manufacturing new equipment. The curriculum provides a broad fundamental preparation for direct entry into industry as well as for further professional study. The first part of the curriculum is devoted to mathematics, physics, and chemistry. With this background, fundamental mechanical engineering subjects, such as dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamics, are studied, followed by specialized subjects, such as manufacturing, heat transfer, and automatic control. During the final two years design courses, laboratory courses, and project courses allow students to acquire a taste for the complex task of designing, analyzing, and building a piece of "hardware." In particular, students become aware of the relationships among conceptual design, subsequent analysis (mathematical modeling), manufacturing, systematic experimentation, and final testing. Supporting courses in allied fields of science and engineering broaden technical proficiency, while the elective courses in social sciences, fine arts, history, and philosophy enlarge the background in the problems of humanity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elective Concentrations</head><p>The program in mechanical engineering is designed to appeal to students with a wide variety of interests and professional goals. By choosing the 4 required elective courses wisely, students can develop a highly personalized curriculum. Some areas of concentration are computeraided design and manufacturing, fluid mechanics, robotics, systems and control, and tribology. In addition, there are seven concentrations: biomedical engineering, design, energy, intelligent mechanical systems, manufacturing, nanotechnology/MEMS, and solid mechanics.</p><p>The biomedical engineering concentration is open to students interested in the biological and medical applications of mechanical engineering procedures. Students in this concentration can also satisfy the entrance requirements of medical schools.</p><p>The design concentration focuses on product design with related conceptual and manufacturing processes.</p><p>The energy concentration emphasizes the mechanical aspects of energy conversion and management.</p><p>The intelligent mechanical systems concentration focuses on the design of devices featuring mechanical hardware interfaces with electronic hardware and software.</p><p>The manufacturing concentration is directed toward planning and selecting manufacturing methods, design for manufacture, computeraided flexible automation and robotics, and increased efficiency and productivity of current and emerging manufacturing technologies.</p><p>The nanotechnology/microelectromechanical systems concentration focuses on engineering at nanometer-and micrometer-length scales, including properties of materials and design and fabrication of devices.</p><p>The solid mechanics concentration focuses on the study of stress and strain in solid bodies, along with the application of computational methods for stress analysis.</p><p>A listing of courses that satisfy the elective requirements may be found in the department office.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arts and Sciences Requirements (17 units)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>JUDD A. AND MARJORIE WEINBERG COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES</head><p>weinberg.northwestern.edu</p><p>The Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences-oldest of Northwestern's 12 schools-has been the center of the University's academic and intellectual life since the 1850s. Weinberg College offers a liberal arts education that combines broad exposure to the insights and methods of multiple academic disciplines with focused study in one or more areas. The approximately 650-member college faculty is dedicated to superior teaching informed by advanced research. Nearly all members of the faculty, including the most senior, regularly teach undergraduates in a curriculum that includes more than 2,200 courses each year, as well as tutorials, supervised laboratory experiences, internships, and other individualized forms of instruction. The more than 4,000 undergraduates and 1,400 graduate students in arts and sciences enjoy a great deal of choice, with access to departments and programs offering 41 majors, 6 adjunct majors, and more than 50 minors. Among these are several majors and minors that are interdisciplinary within the College and a growing number that represent curricular collaboration across schools.</p><p>A liberal arts education in Weinberg College emphasizes the ability to reason clearly, to extract the essential significance of large bodies of information, to apply general principles in new contexts, to communicate effectively, and to be sensitive to human creativity and diversity. Required coursework provides an overview of the complexity of the world and different ways of apprehending and solving problems. Students examine how scholars from many backgrounds confront fundamental issues and how social conditions shape their inquiries. Proficiency in writing and competence in a foreign language build communication skills and expand the capability to study and understand another culture, while intensive coursework in a required major and optional minor develops an understanding of advanced concepts and lays the groundwork for original research. Many areas of the curriculum encourage interdisciplinary study that integrates the approaches of different fields and enhances the ability to address questions that cross traditional academic boundaries. A period of study abroad is encouraged in order to develop firsthand knowledge of other cultures and greater intellectual and personal independence. Students are also encouraged to undertake independent research projects that help them move beyond coursework and synthesize what they learn in their majors.</p><p>Weinberg College promotes participatory learning that begins in the first year of study in required first-year seminars and continues in laboratory experiences, internships, professional linkage and senior seminars, and other small-group or individualized instruction. Students can experience the excitement of discovery in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences not only through lectures by faculty working at the forefront of their fields but also through special projects developed under faculty guidance or by assisting faculty in their research. Northwestern's strong undergraduate preprofessional schools and its graduate and professional schools offer liberal arts students enhanced opportunities to extend their interdisciplinary studies and to pursue applied work in several areas. In some cases this may lead to a minor or a certificate. The University's outstanding libraries and its research centers further support and enrich the educational pursuits of liberal arts undergraduates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts</head><p>Weinberg College offers courses of study in the arts and sciences leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. Students have extensive flexibility in structuring their academic programs within a framework of general education and major requirements specified in this catalog. Guidance in planning a coherent curriculum is available from several sources; see Academic Advising (p. 184).</p><p>Students earning the bachelor of arts degree must complete 45 units of credit (p. 183) and fulfill the course and grade requirements (p. 183) described below. These include completing 2 first-year seminars (p. 181), demonstrating proficiency in writing (p. 181) and in a foreign language (p. 181), satisfying distribution requirements (p. 182) in six major areas of intellectual inquiry, and completing the requirements of a major (p. 182) in one of the departments or programs of Weinberg College. They must also complete a specified amount of their coursework within Weinberg College (p. 183).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-Year Seminar Requirement</head><p>First-year students must complete two seminars. Offered by nearly all departments and programs in Weinberg College, these are small, discussion-oriented courses designed to develop basic intellectual skills: how to read critically, think logically, and communicate effectively, typically through the investigation of a specific theme or issue. Firstyear seminars are limited to 15 or 16 students to encourage discussion, and each seminar requires considerable expository writing-usually a minimum of 15-20 typed pages. These seminars ordinarily supplement rather than replace standard introductory courses and usually do not provide the preparation necessary for advanced work in a field. P/N registration (see Grade <ref type="bibr">Requirements (p. 183)</ref>) is not allowed in firstyear seminars.</p><p>Except for students in HPME (p. 35), ISP (p. 286), and MMSS (p. 301), who may take their seminars in winter and spring, incoming first-year students are assigned to a fall seminar based on preferences they submit to the Weinberg Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising during the summer. The first-year seminar instructor also serves as the students' academic adviser for that quarter. Also during the summer, first-year students are informed of the quarter in which they are to take their second seminar. First-year students also have the opportunity through the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program (p. 285) to take small seminars linked to larger lecture courses focusing on a common broad theme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing Proficiency Requirement</head><p>Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in writing. This may be achieved in a number of ways. First-year seminar instructors make the initial evaluation of writing in their courses. Students who do not write sufficiently well in their first-year seminars or in other courses may be asked to take ENGLISH 105-0 Expository Writing. Courses in expository writing and intermediate composition (p. 368) are available for all students who wish to increase their skill and confidence in writing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign Language Requirement</head><p>Before graduation students must demonstrate proficiency in a classical or modern foreign language equivalent to the work covered in a secondyear college-level course. Language proficiency may be shown in any of these ways:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>• Achieving a designated score on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination</p><p>• Passing a placement examination given online during the summer and/or at Northwestern during Wildcat Welcome before fall classes start and periodically during the school year (language departments may limit the number of times a placement examination may be taken)</p><p>• Providing other evidence of proficiency, such as documentation that secondary schooling was completed in a language other than English</p><p>• Successfully completing designated Northwestern coursework (these courses may not be taken under the pass/no credit option, and a grade of C-or higher must be earned in the last course in a sequence fulfilling the foreign language requirement)</p><p>Students who believe they are proficient in a language not regularly taught at Northwestern may petition to take a placement examination in that language. Petitions are available in the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising and must be submitted prior to or during a student's first quarter.</p><p>Students with professionally diagnosed disabilities related to foreign language acquisition should contact AccessibleNU about possible accommodations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution Requirements</head><p>To ensure breadth of education, Weinberg College students must take 2 courses 1 in each of the six distribution areas listed below. The lists of courses that satisfy the distribution requirements are established by a Weinberg College committee. Current lists are available on the college website, and eligible courses for each quarter are identified on the registrar's website.</p><p>• I. Natural sciences Courses introduce methods of inquiry and fundamental concepts in the natural sciences.</p><p>• II. Formal studies Courses introduce concepts, methods, and use of formal rules of inference in mathematics, statistics, computer science, logic, linguistics, and other areas by showing how objects of thought and experience and their relationships can be analyzed in formal terms.</p><p>• III. Social and behavioral sciences Courses introduce the theories, methods, and findings of empirical research on human behavior and its relation to social, cultural, economic, and political influences, groups, and institutions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Study Requirement</head><p>All students must fulfill the requirements of a Weinberg College major, which should be declared by the end of sophomore year. Majors are declared by meeting with a designated department or program adviser to discuss opportunities and requirements, develop a course plan, and complete a Declaration of Major Form. All courses counted toward a major must be passed with grades of C-or higher. Grades of P (pass) are not acceptable in major and related courses. (See also Grade Requirements (p. 183)) Students may pursue two or more majors by completing each department's major requirements. With limited exceptions, the same course may not be applied to the major requirements of two departments. However, a course used as a department or program course in one major may also fulfill a related course requirement for another major.</p><p>A student's total number of majors plus minors may not typically exceed three. Exceptions require permission from the Weinberg College Advising Office and cannot be granted during the first year.</p><p>Transfer students normally must complete at least four 300-level courses at Northwestern in the major department or program.</p><p>A student may elect a major from among the following options:</p><p>• Departmental major Each Weinberg College department offers one or more majors.</p><p>Requirements are described in detail in the respective department sections of this catalog.</p><p>• Area or interdisciplinary major The college offers many interdisciplinary majors that apply the approaches of several departments to certain scientific, cultural, and political areas. Most are open to all students. American studies, integrated science, legal studies, and mathematical methods in the social sciences are limited-admission majors that require a special application, as does the English department's creative writing major. African studies, geography, global health studies, international studies, mathematical methods in the social sciences, and science in human culture are available only as adjunct majors and must be completed with a second major that is not an adjunct major. Requirements for area and interdisciplinary majors are described in detail in their respective sections of this catalog.</p><p>• Ad hoc major Occasionally students with well-defined interests are led to programs of study that do not fit neatly into the mold of a traditional major. They may develop an ad hoc major in astrobiology or medical ethics, for example, by bringing together courses from various departments. Ad hoc majors must be approved by the faculty's Curricular Review Committee. For more information contact the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration Requirements: Number of Courses and Quarters</head><p>All Weinberg College students, except those in the Integrated Science Program, the Honors Program in Medical Education, and the dual bachelor's degree programs (BA/BMus and BA/BS), must successfully complete coursework earning at least 45 units of credit in order to graduate. Students must be degree candidates in Weinberg College during the last three quarters before receiving the BA degree. They may take courses in any other Northwestern school, but a limited amount of such coursework may count toward the degree. For details see Number of Weinberg College <ref type="bibr">Courses (p. 183)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to and independent of the requirements set by Weinberg College, all students must satisfy the University's Undergraduate Registration <ref type="bibr">Requirement (p. 27)</ref>. This requirement addresses the number of quarters for which a student must be registered at Northwestern and the minimum number of units of credit that must be completed at the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Requirements</head><p>Students must achieve an overall grade point average of C (2.0) or higher in courses used to meet degree requirements. They must earn at least a C-in all major courses and all minor courses, including all related courses for a major. If a major or minor has prerequisites, students must earn at least a C-in these courses as well. To complete the foreign language proficiency requirement through Northwestern coursework, students must earn at least a C-in the third quarter of the second-year language sequence.</p><p>Full-time students in Weinberg College are permitted to enroll in a limited number of courses with the understanding that in place of a regular letter grade they will receive the notation P (pass) or N (no credit), neither of which counts in the grade point average. No more than 1 course a quarter and 6 courses in all may be taken under this P/N option. Courses used to satisfy first-year seminar, distribution, foreign language, major, or minor requirements may not be taken P/N. No more than one-fifth of the total courses taken at Northwestern and offered for graduation may have grades of P or D. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Weinberg College Courses</head><p>Weinberg College students may take advantage of courses offered by Northwestern's other schools, but a minimum of 34 units must be earned in Weinberg College disciplines. These include the following: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taking Courses at Other Institutions</head><p>Students must secure prior approval from the Weinberg College Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising before taking courses at other US institutions that they will submit for Northwestern credit. University, College, and department and program rules govern how many courses taken at other institutions a student may count toward requirements, where they may be taken, in which areas of study they may be, and which requirements they may fulfill. Information about credit from other institutions is available from the Office of the Registrar. Courses taken at other institutions but not accepted for credit by Northwestern cannot count toward a Weinberg College degree.</p><p>Many Weinberg College students spend time studying abroad, most often for a summer or for part or all of junior year. The University's Global Learning Office (GLO) is an essential source of information about programs around the world as well as about the rules and process for going abroad. Advisers in GLO, the College's Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising, and the departments and programs can help students select programs that fit their academic needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Awards and Honors</head><p>Each year Weinberg College awards several prizes and honors to exceptional students. Recognition is given for outstanding writing in first-year seminars and outstanding academic achievement in certain areas of study. Each quarter the college's Dean's List honors students with sufficiently high grades. Each spring the Northwestern chapter of the liberal arts honorary society Phi Beta Kappa elects juniors and seniors to membership. Seniors whose grade point averages meet certain criteria graduate with college honors. In addition, many departments and programs recognize outstanding achievement by their students. This includes recommending students for graduation with department or program honors (see Honors in the Major under Academic Options and <ref type="bibr">Support (p. 184)</ref>).</p><p>The college also awards funds to students working on research projects and creative activities; see Research Funding under Academic Options and Support (p. 184) for information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Organized Seminars</head><p>Students who desire to study topics in arts and sciences that are not covered in the College's course offerings may initiate their own courses under the supervision of sponsoring faculty members. Enrollment in these seminar courses is limited to 20 students. The student organizer or organizers must, in consultation with the faculty sponsor, prepare a plan for the seminar and submit it to the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising before the middle of the quarter preceding the quarter in which the seminar is held. The plan must include a topic description, a reading list, specification of the work that will be graded (such as term papers and written examinations), prerequisites, and the meeting schedule. Students may enroll in only 1 Student-Organized Seminar (GEN_LA 298-0) a quarter, and enrollment must be on the P/N basis. Weinberg College students interested in organizing a seminar should consult the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs for further details.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Advising</head><p>Weinberg College provides an integrated academic advising structure centered in the college's Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising, where faculty advisers are available throughout the year to assist students in all aspects of academic and career planning. Each first-year student is assigned an adviser who in nearly all cases is the student's instructor in a fall-quarter first-year seminar. At the end of fall quarter each student is assigned a Weinberg College adviser, who will continue to be that student's adviser through graduation. In addition, each Weinberg department and program has a corps of faculty advisers who counsel all undergraduates about course selections, majors and minors, and research and career opportunities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arch Scholars Program</head><p>The Arch Scholars Program is a suite of programs designed to welcome, engage, and support students who attended high schools with little or no AP/IB options or who were among the first in their families to attend college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bio&amp;ChemEXCEL</head><p>A pre-orientation program for admitted students thinking about STEM disciplines such as biology, chemistry, or neuroscience, especially if they are interested in learning more about science research at Northwestern. Students take BIOL_SCI 100-0 and CHEM 100-0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bridge</head><p>Bridge I is a two-part pre-orientation program. In the first part students take a pair of courses, MATH 100-BR, and HUM 100-1-BR. In the second part students focus on an academic discipline and take CHEM 100-BR, ECON 100-BR, HUM 100-2-BR, or JOUR 190-BR). Bridge II is open to rising sophomores intending to enroll in either organic chemistry or upper-level economics courses. The Bridge II course options are CHEM 199-BR or ECON 299-BR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NU Bioscientist</head><p>A two-quarter program for first-year students interested in conducting research in the biological, biomedical, neurobiological, chemical, or social sciences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Program in Medical Education</head><p>The Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME) is designed for exceptionally well-prepared high school students who seek a career in medicine or medical science. It provides a plan whereby undergraduate students entering Northwestern are admitted simultaneously to the Feinberg School of Medicine. HPME students in Weinberg College spend the first three or four years in undergraduate study and the last four years in the Feinberg School, potentially reducing the period of formal training by one year. Students must meet or exceed the required units of credit and quarters of enrollment described for HPME by the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (p. 27). Students who remain in good standing under the rules of the HPME program follow the same degree requirements as other students in Weinberg College, with some exceptions (outlined below). Students who do not complete the HPME program are not eligible for the exceptions described below.</p><p>• Students must complete 36 units of credit for the bachelor's degree. Up to four credits transferred from a Northwestern-approved study abroad program may be applied towards the 36 required units, but no other transfer credits and no test units (such as AP credit) may be applied. Courses with the "-SA" suffix offered on Northwestern study abroad programs are not considered transfer credit and are not subject to this limit.</p><p>• Transfer credits and test credits posted to the Northwestern record may be used towards the BA degree requirement that students have 34 units in Weinberg College disciplines (for definition see Requirements section (p. 181)) and are also eligible to be counted towards major or minor requirements in accordance with the rules of the academic department or program.</p><p>• Only one eligible unit of test credit may be applied towards distribution requirements (for description of distribution requirements see Requirements section (p. 181)). A waiver (described below) may not be applied in the same distribution area that a test credit is being applied.</p><p>• Students may apply a maximum of three independent study units (usually numbered 399) toward the 36 required units.</p><p>• A total of up to four individual course unit requirement waivers are permitted in the following three requirement categories.</p><p>• First-year seminar: 1 unit.</p><p>• Distribution requirements: 1 unit, or 2 units if they are in different distribution areas. A waiver cannot be applied to a distribution area if a test credit is being counted towards that area.</p><p>• Major and minor requirements: 2 units in a major, or 1 unit in a major and 1 in a minor or second major, subject to department or program approval. In some disciplines no waivers or only one waiver may be applied. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accelerated Master's Programs</head><p>Undergraduate students doing outstanding work may be accepted into one of the accelerated master's programs approved by the Graduate School. These students may receive permission to double-count some courses toward both bachelor's and master's degrees. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Cross-School Options</head><p>Weinberg College students participate in many academic opportunities outside of the college, sometimes taking individual courses of interest and sometimes completing a formal program of study. Many possibilities are included in this catalog. <ref type="bibr">Certificates (p. 29)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in the Major</head><p>Each major in Weinberg College offers a program that may lead to the award of honors in the major to graduating seniors with outstanding records of achievement. Criteria vary by major, but all share certain features. Students recommended for honors in the major must</p><p>• Complete with distinction the regular courses required for the major and at least two quarters of 398 or 399 or their equivalent, or 400-level courses, or some combination thereof. (These courses may count toward major requirements in some departments and programs.) Majors set different GPA criteria.</p><p>• Complete a research project or other type of integrative work under the guidance of a faculty adviser. The project must result in a research report, thesis, or other tangible record; coursework by itself is not sufficient. Simple data collection, computer programming, analysis of data with canned programs, and summaries of primary or secondary sources are not by themselves bases for the award of honors in the major.</p><p>Each major has an undergraduate honors committee responsible for administering its honors program and for preparing the final recommendations for honors submitted in May to the Weinberg College Committee on Undergraduate Academic Excellence. The faculty adviser proposes a student for honors and writes a letter describing and evaluating the student's project. A faculty member typically unconnected with the project must submit another letter giving independent and substantive judgments. The departmental honors committee reviews nominations during spring quarter and takes a separate recorded vote on each candidate. Approved nominations are reviewed by the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Excellence, which makes the final decision.</p><p>Information on procedures for students pursuing separate honors in two departments or programs, or interdisciplinary honors spanning two majors, is available from the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising and at weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/honorsawards/departmental-honors.html.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study and Undergraduate Seminars</head><p>Registering for 399 Independent Study allows students to earn course credit by working on a research or creative project under the supervision of a faculty member. 399 is generally open to juniors and seniors, and department consent is required; in some cases sophomores may qualify. During the quarter before enrolling in 399, students must submit for departmental approval a detailed description of the work they will undertake and the basis for its evaluation. Upon completion of the course, they must submit an abstract of the completed work to the department, where the description and the abstract are filed.</p><p>By departmental invitation seniors may take 398 (a senior-year seminar) in one or more quarters, up to a maximum of 4 units.</p><p>Students may not register for more than 2 units of 399 in a quarter or take 399 to make up for credit they lack as a result of failure or uncompleted courses. No more than 9 units of 398 and 399 may be presented as credit for graduation. Certain independent study courses offered by some departments with course numbers different from 398 and 399 are also subject to these restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>Internships Many students seek to enrich their education with practical experiences gained off campus. Chicago Field Studies (p. 224) administers several programs that combine seminars taught on campus with internships typically at Chicago-area organizations. Other Weinberg College departments and programs also offer opportunities for off-campus work. These are described in their sections of this catalog. No more than 6 units of credit earned through internship-linked coursework may count toward a Weinberg degree. See the college website for a list of options counting toward this limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors</head><p>Students may choose from more than 50 minors offered at Northwestern; among these are Weinberg College minors, interschool minors, and minors offered by some of Northwestern's other undergraduate schools (see <ref type="bibr">Minors (p. 31)</ref>  Students may not count any course toward both a minor and a major unless the catalog description of the minor explicitly permits this or the course fulfills a related course requirement for the major. A course may not count toward more than one minor. All courses counted toward a minor, including prerequisites for the minor, must be completed with a grade of at least C-.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preprofessional Study</head><p>Weinberg College offers excellent preparation for subsequent training in professions such as law, medicine, and management. Each year many graduates pursue professional study in these areas. Other students enter the workforce directly.</p><p>All majors can furnish suitable preparation for professional schools, provided appropriate courses are taken. No major, however, is intended solely as preprofessional training. The college advisers in the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising help students design academic programs that combine the breadth of a liberal arts education with adequate preparation for further professional study. Northwestern Career Advancement is another resource; several career counselors specialize in helping Weinberg students identify career goals and paths toward achieving them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Linkage Seminars</head><p>Undergraduates may take specially designed linkage seminars (designated on the transcript by "-LK") that approach social and workrelated concerns through the eyes of an accomplished nonacademic professional with an affinity for the liberal arts and a gift for intellectual inquiry. These seminars link liberal education to professional issues, illustrating how theory and practice affect and enrich one another and thus focusing on the transition from the academic to the nonacademic world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Funding</head><p>Weinberg College is committed to facilitating student research and to helping undergraduates immerse themselves in challenging, intense explorations through well-focused projects. The college, as well as some of its departments and programs, awards competitive grants to support research and creative projects of students working under faculty guidance. Academic-year awards cover some research expenses, and some summer awards also provide assistance with living expenses. Conference travel grants help fund travel to professional conferences to present research or creative work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Organizations</head><p>Many departments and programs within the college sponsor student organizations. Some are honorary organizations, recognizing students who have achieved distinction within their fields of study. Others provide opportunities for students with common interests to come together for academic, social, career-focused, and service activities that complement classroom experiences.</p><p>The Weinberg College Student Advisory Board is the primary source of student advice to the dean and the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs. Members also serve on several college committees. The board includes representatives from every Weinberg College department and program offering a major or a minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>Weinberg College students are encouraged to study abroad. The philosophy of the college is that the best foreign study experience combines continued work in a student's chosen course of study with significant opportunities for immersion in the culture of the host country. For example, a political science student might study the European Union in France. The college encourages participation in full-academic-year programs that include extensive study of languages and culture. The Office of the Provost offers grants for intensive summer foreign language study abroad. As early as the first year, interested students should discuss study abroad plans with their advisers and obtain information from the Global Learning Office (https://www.northwestern.edu/abroad).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African American Studies</head><p>afam.northwestern.edu</p><p>The study of black lives, cultures, and experiences has a long and distinguished history in the United States and abroad. Interdisciplinary from its beginnings, the field has developed exciting insights and firm intellectual and empirical foundations to systematically study the social, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of race both domestically and internationally. With these strengths and traditions, the Department of African American Studies provides opportunities to explore the richness and diversity of black life in a meaningful and coherent way.</p><p>The department offers courses that focus on people of African descent in the United States and other regions of the Americas and the African diaspora-the communities created by the dispersion of peoples from the African continent. By comparing the black experience in various parts of the world, students learn to analyze identity, race, and racism as formations that change over time and space. This broad study of the black experience is one of the key features that distinguish the department from similar departments at other institutions. Major themes in the curriculum include the nature of colonization and its impact on the colonizer and the colonized; racism and its effects on society as well as on scholarship; the importance of oral language, history, and tradition in the black experience; the roots and development of black music, literature, and religious styles; analysis of key social, political, and economic institutions such as families, churches, and labor markets; and the traffic of people, ideas, and artifacts throughout the African diaspora.</p><p>African American studies provides excellent preparation for graduate work in the social sciences, the humanities, and the professions, as well as for jobs and careers in a variety of fields. Education, law, journalism, urban planning, healthcare delivery and administration, business, social work, and politics are only a few of the fields for which African American studies provides an excellent background. In addition, as scholars and political leaders pay increased attention to global economic, political, and social phenomena, African American studies touches on issues of farreaching national and international significance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in African American Studies</head><p>Majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors must notify the director of undergraduate studies during fall of senior year. To qualify for honors, a student must complete a substantial senioryear research project. With the director, the student selects a thesis adviser, who need not be a member of the department. Completion of the thesis ordinarily requires at least two quarters of research and writing. During one or both of those quarters students may register for AF_AM_ST 399-0 Independent Study with the thesis adviser. This course counts as either 1 of the 6 required "elective courses" in the major or as the senior-course requirement.</p><p>Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>africanstudies.northwestern.edu</head><p>In 1948 the distinguished scholar Melville J. Herskovits organized the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, and the program remains a model of Africanist study and research. Through sponsorship of multidisciplinary courses with African content, language training, and promotion of Africa-based study, it supports and enlivens the undergraduate study of Africa while serving as the University's "headquarters" for formal and informal interaction among interested students, faculty, and visitors. The program brings undergraduates studying Africa together with faculty and other experts in many areas of inquiry-across disciplinary boundaries and regional specializationsfor lectures, seminars, workshops, conferences, and research programs. Northwestern's Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, an unparalleled resource for Africanist study, attracts students and scholars from all over the world. Over the years the program has remained in active contact with its counterparts in Africa and elsewhere, while expanding its role in the University and off-campus communities.</p><p>The program offers both an adjunct major and a minor. Although there is no formal language requirement for either, students are strongly encouraged to study a non-English language that is spoken in Africa or its diaspora, such as Swahili, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. Competence in a foreign language can facilitate individual research projects, widen understanding of particular topics, and increase study abroad opportunities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African Studies Adjunct Major</head><p>The adjunct major is structured to serve two broad aims.</p><p>First, students are exposed to the geographical and disciplinary breadth of African studies. To that end, all students take 200-level core courses in African history, anthropology, literature, and/or politics, as well as 7 elective courses chosen from an array of disciplines, including African studies, African American studies, anthropology, history, political science, religious studies, and several language and literature departments.</p><p>Second, students engage in in-depth research or immersion practicums, the products of which they develop in a capstone senior research seminar. Practicums often involve a central research component, but other proposed practicums of acceptable quality, depth of immersion, etc., may be approved. Among the experiences that may satisfy this requirement with appropriate content are study abroad in Africa, research connected to the Program of African Studies, internships, and independent study and senior capstone projects.</p><p>Students must also complete the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (p. 27) and the degree requirements of their home school. There is also a required research or immersion practicum experience (see below)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjunct Major Requirements (11 units)</head><p>• The 11 courses must be selected from at least three departments.</p><p>• At least 3 courses must be at the 300 level.</p><p>• All adjunct majors require completion of a stand-alone major as well.</p><p>• At most 2 courses counted toward the African studies adjunct major may be double-counted toward another major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in African Studies</head><p>Majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors should submit an application to the director of undergraduate studies during spring of their junior year. In addition to the AFST 395-0 Senior Research Seminar, at least 2 of the following must be included among the 11 courses for the adjunct major: AFST 399-0 Independent Study, AFST 392-1 Herskovits Undergraduate Research Award, AFST 392-2 Herskovits Undergraduate Research Award, or an approved graduate seminar. A report on original research or some other integrative capstone project, such as organizing a relevant conference or exhibition, is also required.</p><p>Students whose capstone projects and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African Studies Minor</head><p>The minor in African studies approaches the study of African societies, cultures, histories, and arts across disciplines in the humanities, social sciences, and professions. Students earning a bachelor's degree in Weinberg College or another Northwestern school may complete the minor. In addition, undergraduates in all disciplines are welcome to participate formally or informally in the program's activities, which advance the training of Africa specialists at Northwestern and promote awareness of Africa in a wider context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies</head><p>amstp.northwestern.edu</p><p>The American Studies Program is interdisciplinary, comparative, and internationally oriented. The competitive-admissions major examines the development and expressions of national culture alongside those of borderland and diasporic American cultures and amongst global cultures. It draws on a broad range of faculty from the humanities and social sciences so that students can examine components of US culture and the diverse experiences of Americans and others affected by Americans locally, nationally, and globally. Students are allowed a wide-ranging yet disciplined exploration that crosses the boundaries of traditional academic fields. All students write a thesis explicitly dealing with the United States in a comparative or global dimension.</p><p>Because this selective honors program has more applicants than available space, admission depends in part on academic distinction and on demonstrated interest in comparative American cultures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>anthropology.northwestern.edu</head><p>Anthropology is the study of humankind from a broadly comparative and historical perspective. Anthropology advances understanding of human biological and cultural diversity around the world and across time. In a changing world, anthropology provides for cross-cultural comparative analysis of diversities and inequalities. Understanding cultural, biological, and linguistic differences and similarities is central to almost any career, and students gain a critical understanding of ethical issues at play in a diverse, globalized world.</p><p>Anthropology draws on the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences to answer compelling questions about humankind, including how the species evolved, how biology, language, and culture became its defining characteristics, and how and why cultures change over time.</p><p>Anthropology's breadth makes the major ideal for students seeking a strong liberal arts and sciences education. Students are prepared for careers not only in anthropology and archaeology but also in a range of fields including medicine, public health, law, journalism, marketing, international development, and business.</p><p>The department's faculty bring together the four subfields of anthropology (archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology) to develop a holistic understanding of human diversity.</p><p>Students are encouraged to participate in a variety of departmental field and laboratory research projects in archaeology, ethnography, and human biology that offer the opportunity to conduct original research, which can be an integral part of a senior thesis project.</p><p>ANTHRO 390-SA Topics In Anthropology (1 Unit) Advanced work in areas of developing interest and special significance. May be repeated for credit with different topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTHRO 391-0 Archaeology, Ethics, and Contemporary Society (1 Unit)</head><p>Why study of the past is relevant to the present; examination of ethical issues in archaeology as they arise during the fieldwork experience. Prerequisite: ANTHRO 321-0. Students must also complete the Undergraduate Registration Requirement (p. 27) and the degree requirements of their home school. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentration in Human Biology</head><p>The human biology concentration is a good option for students interested in pursuing careers in the health sciences or graduate work in the biological sciences. The concentration combines a core foundation in basic science with an integrative perspective on the human organism, drawing on both the biological and the social sciences. Coursework emphasizes the study of human biology and health from a comparative and evolutionary perspective.</p><p>In their first and second years students complete the introductory (200-level) anthropology requirements as well as foundational courses (which are also premedical school requirements). Junior-and senior-year coursework includes 300-level courses in biological anthropology/human biology and related courses from other departments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Anthropology</head><p>Majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing original research in anthropology during their senior year are encouraged to submit an application to the honors coordinator by spring of junior year to write a senior honors thesis. The thesis requires completing ANTHRO 399-0 Independent Study in the fall quarter and ANTHRO 398-0 Senior Seminar in the winter quarter of senior year. ANTHRO 398-0 Senior Seminar (but not ANTHRO 399-0 Independent Study) may be counted toward the 300-level requirements for the major.</p><p>Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For additional information review the department website, consult the honors coordinator, and see Honors in the <ref type="bibr">Major (p. 184</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropology Minor</head><p>The minor in anthropology provides students in other fields with a framework to pursue a particular focus within the discipline. Such a focus might be within a subfield of anthropology (e.g., biological anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology), in area studies (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, the United States), or in a specific topic (e.g., ethnicity, gender, the origins of the state, urban studies). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art History</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>arthistory.northwestern.edu</head><p>Art history studies the world's arts and architecture from antiquity to the present. It analyzes visual objects from multiple perspectives, including their aesthetic and historical contexts, use of technology, relationship to science, ideological or social function, and visual and spatial characteristics. It studies individual artists or makers, cultural institutions, audiences, and intercultural exchanges. Because the field is inherently interdisciplinary, it often engages anthropology, philosophy, political science, history, literature, film, performance, theater, and theories of race, gender, class, and sexuality.</p><p>The study of art history provides knowledge of geographically and historically diverse artworks and related cultural practices. Departmental course offerings explore these works and practices with varying intensity and specialization. The major is an essential platform for those interested in the classic art history careers. (Curatorial work in museums normally requires at least a master's degree, and college and university teaching and research require a PhD.) With its liberal arts emphasis on informed and critical reading, writing, speaking, and looking, and with its broad historical, cultural, geographic, and methodological range, the major also offers an excellent foundation for specialization in law, medicine, business, international relations, politics, education, and other areas. The Department of Art History offers a major and a minor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Art History</head><p>Majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors must submit an application to write a senior honors thesis to the director of undergraduate studies by the end of junior year. The thesis is written in the senior year, and submitted for evaluation near Spring break. Honors also requires:</p><p>• Successful completion of 2 independent study courses (ART_HIST 399-0 Independent Study), 1 of which may count toward the major (taken in fall and winter quarters of senior year)</p><p>• Participation in the departmental senior thesis colloquium Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art Theory and Practice</head><p>art.northwestern.edu</p><p>As its name suggests, the Department of Art Theory and Practice explores both the making of contemporary art and the ideas and theories that drive it. Faculty and students pursue the visual arts as a theoretical discipline that pushes the boundaries of aesthetic and cultural experience. The department offers a range of courses that apply traditional approaches, adopt newer media, or use alternative strategies. The study of art practice in traditional media, such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography, is the core of the undergraduate course structure, enabling students to develop a solid foundation in the field's traditions and established forms. Studio art classes address both technique and critical thinking about contemporary art; these are complemented by classes in contemporary art theory. Other courses expressly look forward, exposing students to experimental approaches and a foretaste of future developments in visual art making. This dynamic curriculum incorporates digital technology, video, and conceptual art practice, thus blending new trends with traditional practices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>asianamerican.northwestern.edu</head><p>Asian American studies is a vital component of a liberal arts education that seeks to broaden awareness and appreciation of the world. Asian American studies deepens understanding of the multiracial history and character of the United States and also provides an opportunity to place the American experience within a larger global context.</p><p>Northwestern's Asian American Studies Program aims to provide students with an understanding of Asian American experience as fundamental to the ongoing development of American society and linked to the experiences of other racial minorities in the United States and of Asian migrants across the world. The program thus encourages students to develop informed, far-reaching perspectives that facilitate responsible participation in a rapidly changing world. As an interdisciplinary program, Asian American studies develops investigative, analytic, and critical skills while also promoting the intellectual and creative powers students need to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p><p>Both the major and the minor in Asian American studies offer an opportunity to pursue a coherent study of Asian American communities and the experiences of Asian Americans in the United States. Students pursuing the major or minor engage in the interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and migration within the modern global historical development of nationalism, imperialism, and colonialism.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asian Languages and Cultures</head><p>alc.northwestern.edu</p><p>The Department of Asian Languages and Cultures focuses on Asian humanities and languages past and present. Its courses provide students with opportunities to attain linguistic and transcultural competence in one or more of four language areas and to better appreciate Asia as a dynamic site of cultural and linguistic interaction.</p><p>The department offers a major in Asian languages and cultures with five areas of focus (Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, Korean, and comparative), as well as two minors: The Advanced Asian Languages Minor (formerly the Asian Languages Minor), which emphasizes language training while allowing students to learn more about the culture of their area of linguistic focus <ref type="bibr">(Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, Korean)</ref>, and the Asian Humanities Minor, which allows students explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the Asian humanities without additional language training. Students majoring in Asian Languages and Cultures (non Comparative tracks) may also earn an Advanced Asian Languages Minor in a separate Asian language or an Asian Humanities Minor, provided they do not double-count courses toward both the major and the minor.</p><p>When they graduate, Asian Languages and Cultures majors and Advanced Asian Languages minors will have proficiency in the four core skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing in an Asian language. They should be able to understand spoken language in conversations and a variety of media; read literature, newspapers, and magazines; and speak and write in formal and informal language. In addition to these core linguistic skills, students will gain sophisticated understanding of the culture of their area or region of focus. Cultural literacy includes knowledge of classical and modern literary texts and visual culture; the ability to analyze and interpret texts orally and in writing; understanding and experience of cultural practices; and the ability to conduct independent research.</p><p>Students are encouraged to study abroad, though it is important that they consult with both the study abroad coordinator for their area as well as the director of undergraduate studies before leaving Northwestern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asian Languages and Cultures Major</head><p>The Asian Languages and Cultures major is designed for students who wish to combine proficiency in an Asian language or languages <ref type="bibr">(Chinese, Hindi-Urdu, Japanese, Korean)</ref> with rigorous training in the humanistic study of an Asian culture or cultures (China, Japan, Korean, South Asia or Comparative). In addition to developing the four core linguistic skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing), students will acquire the cultural literacy necessary for effective communication and sophisticated understanding of at least one cultural sphere or region of Asia. The humanities component of the major is designed to introduce students to advanced methods of critical reading, viewing, interpretation and academic writing through training in literary studies, film and media studies, gender studies and cultural studies, among other approaches. While most Asian Languages and Cultures majors focus on one Asian language and area of focus, the major is also designed to accommodate students who wish to work comparatively withing or between regions. For example, students may combine the study of Korean and Japanese language and culture or explore colonial and post-colonial experiences in East and South Asia. Students interested in pursuing a comparative focus will work closely with the director of undergraduate studies to develop a coherent course of study.</p><p>Students may apply for (but are not guaranteed) language credit towards the major for courses taken while studying abroad (Placement test upon return in required.) Pending departmental review of relevant course materials and the approval of the director of undergraduate studies, up to 2 humanities courses taken while studying abroad may also be counted toward the major.

Courses are carefully designed to give a rigorous introduction to chemistry for both science and nonscience students.</p><p>The broad applicability of phenomena and rigorous methodology of chemistry provide a wide range of career options for students who pursue a major, minor, or advanced coursework in chemistry.</p><p>The department meets the needs of students with diverse career objectives--including professional chemistry, medicine, and teaching--by offering:</p><p>• a foundation in mathematics, physics, and related sciences • a core curriculum introducing the fundamental areas of organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry • concentrations in six different areas of chemistry • opportunities to participate in research</p><p>Options are also provided for Northwestern's engineering, biological sciences, and pre-health professional programs.</p><p>The chemistry faculty is actively engaged in a wide spectrum of original research in which undergraduates are encouraged to participate along with graduate students and visiting scholars from around the world.</p><p>Undergraduates have opportunities to use modern instrumentation and to participate in seminars, colloquia, and informal contacts with scholars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Teaching of Chemistry</head><p>Weinberg College students pursuing a major in chemistry who also wish to be certified for secondary teaching must be admitted to the Secondary Teaching Program (p. 110) in the School of Education and Social Policy and complete all requirements as outlined in the SESP chapter of this catalog. Students are urged to contact the Office of Student Affairs in SESP as early as possible in their academic careers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Chemistry, Advanced Placement, and Course Credit</head><p>Entering students may receive advanced placement in chemistry by means of the College Board's AP Chemistry examination, the International Baccalaureate HL Chemistry examination, or the department's placement examination taken on entry to Northwestern. Depending on their scores, they will be advised to register in one of the following:</p><p>• CHEM 110-0 Quantitative Problem Solving in Chemistry</p><p>• CHEM 151-0 Accelerated General Chemistry 1</p><p>• CHEM 171-0 Advanced General Inorganic Chemistry (with credit for Chem 1X0 listed on their transcript)</p><p>• Organic Chemistry, either CHEM 210-1 or CHEM 212-1 (with 1 credit for each Chem 1X0, 1X1, and 1X2, and with 0.34 credit for each Chem 11X and 12X on their transcript) Students may not start any general chemistry sequence with CHEM 131-0, CHEM 152-0, or CHEM 172-0 regardless of their AP or IB credit. Questions should be directed to the director of undergraduate studies in chemistry.</p><p>Students may not retain both AP/IB credit and credit for a course at a lower level than placed by the test score. For example:</p><p>• Students who receive 1 test credit listed as Chem 1X0 may take CHEM 151-0 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both.</p><p>• Students who receive 1 test credit listed as Chem 1X1 may take CHEM 171-0 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both.</p><p>• Students who receive 1 test credit listed as Chem 1X2 may take CHEM 172-0 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both.</p><p>• Students who receive 1 test credit listed as Chem 11X may take CHEM 181-0 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both.</p><p>• Students who receive 1 test credit listed as Chem 12X may take CHEM 182-0 for credit, but they may not retain credit for both.</p><p>Due to overlap in content, the following restrictions apply: Students whose AP, IB, or chemistry placement exam scores place them into organic chemistry but who choose instead to begin with CHEM 171-0/CHEM 181-0 must also complete CHEM 172-0/CHEM 182-0 before taking organic chemistry. Students who place into organic chemistry may not take CHEM 110-0 or CHEM 151-0/CHEM 161-0.</p><p>The laboratory components of general and organic chemistry courses require separate registration and bear separate credit. When such a course is listed as a prerequisite for another course, the associated lab is also a prerequisite. </p></div>

Where more than one distribution area is listed for a course, the student may choose to where to apply that one unit of credit. More information about distribution requirements and Interdisciplinary Studies distribution courses may be found on the page describing College <ref type="bibr">Requirements (p. 181)</ref>.</p><p>CFS 291-0 Analysis of Field Experience (0.25-1 Unit) This online course requires students to read, reflect upon and discuss work and workplace issues. Students examine the structure and purpose of organizations as well as workplace inclusion (race, age, ethnicity, nationality), teamwork and productivity, leadership styles and the ways that we influence each other. Students intern 10 to 40 hours a week in firms and organizations throughout the world.</p><p>Classics majors may pursue a concentration in Latin, Greek, or both languages. For a classics minor, students may choose a concentration with readings in Latin or in Greek or a classical studies concentration with sources in English translation only. Additional information about classics programs and courses is available on the department website or in the department office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Teaching of Latin</head><p>Weinberg College students pursuing a major in classics who also wish to be certified for secondary teaching (p. 110) of Latin are urged to contact the Office of Student Affairs in the School of Education and Social Policy as early as possible in their academic careers. For information about teaching careers in Latin and opportunities for mentoring and classroom observation, see the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Classics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>The department strongly encourages students to undertake study abroad for a summer, a term, or the academic year at, for example, the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, Arcadia University in Athens, or the summer program at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. Interested students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in fall of the previous year to ensure sufficient time to prepare applications and plan for appropriate credit toward the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Placement</head><p>Students must either complete the 100-level language sequence before enrolling in GREEK 201-1 Introduction to Greek Literature or LATIN 201-1 Introduction to Latin Literature or test into the 200-level courses. Completion of the 200-level series or permission of the instructor is a prerequisite for enrollment in 300-level language courses. Placement results may not be counted for credit toward the total number of courses required, e.g., the 6 additional courses for the major. More advanced coursework must be completed instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classical Traditions Courses</head><p>Offered in departments other than classics, classical traditions courses give significant attention to ancient Greece or Rome, or to the use of Greek or Roman culture in some later tradition. They may be used to satisfy certain major and minor requirements. To determine which current courses meet the criteria, students should consult the director of undergraduate studies. Courses that have recently met the criteria include: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses with Readings in Latin</head><p>LATIN 101-1 Elementary Latin (1 Unit) Classical Latin vocabulary, grammar, and syntax with graded readings for translation. Course one of three.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>The major in classics offers students three paths of study. Although no previous knowledge of Latin or Greek is required, all students are required to achieve competence in one of these ancient languages in order to work with primary sources in the original. Some may choose to complete advanced work in both languages.</p><p>With concentrations in Latin, Greek, or both languages, the major requirements allow some flexibility. Classics majors develop familiarity with the broad sweep of ancient history and literature and key analytical skills necessary to examine the record of Greek and Roman culture. They complete a demanding and distinctive course of study that stresses the development of important intellectual sensibilities-close reading, analytical clarity, thorough research, evaluation of evidence, logical analysis, effective writing, appreciation of nuance and subtleties, historical variability, and cultural differences. All majors complete a research project under the direction of a faculty member in a small 1quarter seminar. Seniors pursuing honors will undertake an additional 2 quarters of research.</p><p>Each of the three tracks-Greek and Latin, Latin, or Greek-requires a minimum of 12 courses beyond the language prerequisites.</p><p>All majors are required to undertake a research project in connection with CLASSICS 395-0 Research Seminar. Topics vary from year to year. Instruction will be included in the use of traditional as well as digital research tools. Students may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute research conducted for a study abroad program. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Classics</head><p>Majors with strong academic records and an interest in pursuing honors should speak with the department's honors coordinator during spring quarter of junior year. They should come with ideas about a topic for honors work and the name of a faculty member with whom they propose to work. (Interested students completing a junior year abroad should be in contact with their intended faculty advisers during spring quarter of junior year.) By the end of reading week of spring quarter, they must submit to the honors coordinator a short research proposal supported by a preliminary bibliography. During senior year students should enroll in 2 quarters of CLASSICS 399-0 Independent Study, which may count toward the major, and complete a senior thesis.</p><p>Students whose theses and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information consult the department website (https:// www.classics.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/honors-and-awards/ honors.html) or the director of undergraduate studies, and see Honors in the <ref type="bibr">Major (p. 184</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classics Minor Concentrations</head><p>Students may earn a minor in Latin, Greek, or classical studies. Each option allows students either to survey aspects of classical culture and traditions or to take a more focused cluster of courses. Unlike the Greek and Latin minors, the classical studies minor does not require study of an ancient language. Instead, it provides a framework for examining any aspect of Greek and Roman antiquity or its traditions and reception in medieval through contemporary Western culture.</p><p>Students majoring in classics may also earn a minor in classical studies, provided they do not double-count courses toward both the major and the minor, and they do not count toward the minor any courses in the language(s) of their major at or below the prerequisite level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minor requirements: Latin concentration (6 units)</head><p>Prerequisite Cognitive science is the scientific study of the mind with the goal of understanding the nature of thought. Students learn the ways in which converging sources of evidence may be integrated to discover the mechanisms underlying the complex adaptive properties of human cognition. The major in cognitive science gives a broad foundation in this interdisciplinary field, encompassing cognitive psychology, linguistics, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and related disciplines. Required introductory courses survey basic phenomena and approaches; basic methodology courses impart the methods of cognitive science; core courses provide foundations of disciplines within cognitive science; and elective courses allow students to pursue more advanced study in particular disciplines. A proseminar focuses on ongoing research in the field by Northwestern faculty.</p><p>For additional information about the Program in Cognitive Science see the program director. <ref type="bibr">Learning</ref>  Other 300-and 400-level courses may be counted as advanced electives with consent of the cognitive science adviser.</p><p>Independent study (399) in cognitive science or in one of the departments listed above, which is strongly recommended, may count as an advanced elective.</p><p>For students pursuing honors, the second quarter COG_SCI 398-2 Senior Thesis Seminar may count as an advanced elective.</p><p>• At most 5 courses counted toward the cognitive science major may be double-counted toward another major. Courses used to meet major requirements may not be double-counted toward a minor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Science Minor</head><p>The minor in cognitive science broadens the academic background of students majoring in related fields, providing them with the methods and foundations for understanding cognitive issues in an interdisciplinary framework. At least 3 must be at the 300 level.</p><p>At least 3 must be outside the student's major department or program.</p><p>At least 1 must be chosen from the core courses listed in the cognitive science major requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative Literary Studies</head><p>complit.northwestern.edu</p><p>The Comparative Literary Studies Program is an interdepartmental, interdisciplinary program for the study of literature across national and linguistic lines. Those who work in the field of comparative literature hold that language is not an indifferent medium of expression but an integral dimension of every expressive act. Drawing on faculty from the various literature departments as well as from disciplines such as art history, film studies, music, and philosophy, the CLS program examines literary texts within the context of diverse literary traditions and other cultural phenomena. CLS encourages students not only to read and interpret works of literature but also to reflect on the assumptions and methods that shape literary and other humanistic studies.</p><p>In contrast to studying one culture's literature over a specific time period, CLS juxtaposes literatures of different cultures and epochs, studying the themes, conventions, and movements shared by distinct literary traditions as well as those features that distinguish them from each other. Building on comparative literature's traditional basis in Euro/American and western classical literatures, Northwestern's CLS Program offers students the opportunity to pursue programs of study in the literatures of South and East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, as well as courses offered through Native American and indigenous studies. By engaging in cross-disciplinary scholarship across languages and historical eras, students encounter the literary</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>Comparative Literary Studies achievements of people with vastly different histories, frames of cultural reference, and poetic traditions.</p><p>Their course of study provides CLS students with a range of innovative theoretical approaches to literary texts, movements, and genres, along with a strong commitment to traditional literary interpretation, philological methods, and critical analysis. In considering theoretical texts ranging from the classics of ancient Greece and Roman to contemporary critical theory, students not only learn to understand specific literary works but also raise questions about their relations to other forms of discourse and about the nature of literature itself. To this end, the CLS program emphasizes the study of a diverse body of literary theories (in domains ranging from poststructuralist, psychoanalytic, feminist, and historicist approaches, to world literature, translation studies, critical race theory, and the environmental humanities) alongside the theoretical and methodological concerns of related disciplines (such as anthropology, history, philosophy, gender and sexuality studies, and sociology).</p><p>Finally, the CLS Program considers literary texts in relation to other forms of creative and cultural production. The relationship of literature to cultural practices and the arts, among them music, visual culture, fashion, and new media, is an important focus of interest in many courses, and students are encouraged to take classes in other disciplines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>The Program in Comparative Literary Studies encourages all majors who qualify to consider a year or a term of study abroad as juniors.</p><p>Students pursuing a program of study in comparative literature need to be acquainted with at least two literary traditions. They choose a first literature, normally that written in their native tongue, and a second literature written in another language. They take at least 2 courses in each. They also take at least 2 courses in non-Euro/American literature, either in translation or in the original language.</p><p>The core 200-level CLS courses provide students with a range of theoretical approaches to literary texts in particular and the study of culture in general. Advanced or 300-level CLS courses build on these core courses, allowing students to use their linguistic skills to further explore literary themes, movements, genres, and periods on a comparative basis.</p><p>During their junior year, majors in CLS should meet with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) to ensure they are on track to complete requirements for the major, including literature courses taken in different genres, periods and regions, as specified by the major description. By spring of their junior year, students must choose a faculty advisor and begin to outline a senior research project.</p><p>All majors are required to take COMP_LIT 398-0 Senior Seminar in fall quarter of senior year, during which they write a substantial senior paper (which may be based on a previous paper written for another course). Students meeting the necessary requirements may opt to pursue honors in the major, by enrolling in COMP_LIT 399-0 Independent Study in the winter quarter of their senior year, and expanding their senior essay into an Honors Thesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Requirements (12 units) 2 courses required for all majors:</head><p>• COMP_LIT 200-0 Introduction to Literary Theory</p><p>• COMP_LIT 398-0 Senior Seminar (taken during Fall quarter of senior year) 10 literature courses, which must encompass the following categories (a single course may fill multiple requirements):</p><p>• 200-level COMP_LIT courses: 2 core courses in comparative literary studies, chosen from: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Comparative Literary Studies</head><p>Majors with strong academic records may be recommended to pursue honors based on the strength of their senior essays. Recommended students expand their senior essay into a senior thesis (at least 30 pages long) during 1 quarter of independent study (COMP_LIT 399-0 Independent Study), preferably in winter quarter. The COMP_LIT 399-0 Independent Study enrollment does not count toward the 12 courses required for the major. Students whose theses and grades meet program criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors. For more information consult the program website and Honors in the Major (p. 184).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>World Literature Minor</head><p>The minor in world literature, like the major in comparative literary studies, examines literary, aesthetic and cultural production beyond the boundaries of one national or linguistic tradition. It is designed for students who are interested in the global and comparative dimensions of literary study, but unable for whatever reason to complete the comparative literary studies major requirements, for example, because they may not have the language skills necessary for the major. Unlike the major, the minor in world literature does not have a language requirement. Students are encouraged to read literary texts in the original language but can also take courses where literature is read in English translation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>09/30/19</head><p>Comparative Literary Studies BA/MA</p><p>The minor allows students to study literatures from different parts of the world as well as different periods. Students take courses from at least two different cultural traditions and are encouraged to examine the relations between them-particularly between Euro/American traditions and those of the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and South America. In so doing students discover how literary texts circulate transnationally and thus become part of "world literature." This crossing often involves some kind of translation, so the minor, while allowing students to read literary texts in English translation, also makes translation a primary object of investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minor Requirements (7 units)</head><p>• At least 2 COMP_LIT courses, of which 1 is COMP_LIT 201-0 Reading World Literature and the other is a 300-level course.</p><p>• 5 additional literature courses from at least two different cultural and linguistic traditions. • Courses may be from CLS, English, or any of the foreign language departments or area-studies programs.</p><p>• At least 2 courses must be at the 300-level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative Literary Studies BA/MA</head><p>Students with a strong record in their major courses and an interest in graduate study are eligible to apply for the BA/MA program in comparative literary studies once they are within 4 courses of completing their undergraduate degrees. The application requires a statement of purpose, a plan of study, and two letters of recommendation from department faculty.</p><p>BA/MA students fulfill MA requirements by choosing 9 graduate courses in consultation with the director of graduate studies. These may be from CLS, the student's first and/or second literature, and/or another discipline of interest (such as philosophy or film studies). They must include COMP_LIT 410-0 Theories of Literature. Three of the 9 units may count toward the undergraduate major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Science</head><p>The Program in Computer Science offers students the opportunity to study computer science within the context of Weinberg College's focus on liberal arts and sciences, as distinct from the engineering context in the McCormick School's Department of Computer Science. The computer science requirements are identical in the two programs. Faculty and courses for the program are drawn from the McCormick CS department, which has extensive computing facilities for student use.</p><p>Computer science is a highly interdisciplinary field. The department maintains links with other programs at Northwestern, including cognitive science, psychology, learning sciences, communication studies, radio/ television/film, computer engineering, and the Transportation Center.</p><p>The computer science requirements include the following five parts.</p><p>Undergraduates are encouraged to participate in research projects and to take advanced courses.</p><p>• Background or related courses: fulfill the general requirements of the University and school and provide the necessary background for study in computer science • Core courses: basic introduction to computer science • Breadth requirements: areas of computer science to which every CS graduate should be exposed • Technical electives: opportunities to explore selected computer science topics in detail </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Earth and Planetary Sciences Minor</head><p>The minor offers students in any major outside the department a flexible path to knowledge of Earth and Planetary Sciences. The program in economics enables students to understand the basic concepts, theories, and techniques of economics as they apply to economic problems and policies. These may focus on macroeconomics, applied microeconomics, quantitative economics, or economic history. Whatever courses students take, they will become familiar with the way economists think about problems and devise solutions to them. Although the program does not offer specialized professional training in economics, it provides excellent preparation for graduate work in economics, the study of law, and careers in business or government. Students should consult a department adviser about field courses that fit their needs.</p></div>

With the exception of particular courses for first-year students they are open to all students-from any year, any school, any major-at Northwestern.</p><p>The humanities are a broad and interdisciplinary collection of fields that differ from the physical, biological, and certain of the social sciences by concentrating on the study and interpretation of human thought and culture. The humanities include literature, philosophy, history, law, art, and music, as well as other cultural forms and practices such as film, dance, theater, television, media, and religion. Certain scholars in sociology, psychology, anthropology, and political science also pursue humanities research.</p><p>The humanities pose big questions about the meaning of life and examine assumptions about how we make sense of our complex and globalized world. Studying them permits us to examine ourselves and what it means to be human-here and now, as well as elsewhere and in the past. The humanities foster a critical perspective on human artifacts and records of human experience <ref type="bibr">(verbal, visual, aural)</ref>, enabling us to learn, through a combination of interpretative and analytical research, how to think creatively about questions that often do not have set answers.</p><p>Humanities courses offered by Kaplan feature themes that span the humanities and other domains; link the classroom to the world beyond through experiential field study; feature team-taught offerings; and combine inquiry with digital tools to allow students to go beyond textual sources to integrate multimedia, content analysis, and user interfaces into humanities subjects. Each course may feature unique methods, but all humanities courses emphasize critical reading, speaking, and writing skills; examine subjects from multiple perspectives; and provide training in synthesizing competing forms of evidence and developing complex opinions and arguments.</p><p>Humanities courses are open to students from any school at Northwestern (with the exception of Weinberg College First-Year Seminars). Many of the classes are small-enrollment, 300-level seminars taught by faculty from every humanities discipline, from history to philosophy, African American studies to performance studies, and dozens of departments in between.

Very few humanities courses have prerequisites, and many fulfill distribution requirements.</p><p>Kaplan Global Humanities Labs (https:// www.humanities.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/global-humanitieslab) are quarter-long seminars that feature an international field study component. And the Humanities Plunge (https:// www.humanities.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/humanities-plunge) is a spring break immersion in Chicago's theatre, art, music, architecture and dance, guided by artists and scholars to help students learn to analyze and interpret these cultural riches.</p><p>A note: Many students think that humanities courses are only open to Kaplan Humanities Scholars; not so! Kaplan encourages and welcomes students from any major or field of study to enroll in humanities courses.</p><p>Humanities training-in deliberation, analysis, and judgment-enables students to process the human experience from varied perspectives, which is valuable preparation for any scholarly or career pursuit.</p><p>Since all courses are not offered every year (or in the same quarter from year to year), make sure to check CAESAR each quarter for specific course descriptions that are fitted under the broad "umbrella" categories listed in the humanities course list.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses in the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program</head><p>Specific topics in these courses will vary as different professors participate. The Integrated Science Program is a highly selective curriculum of natural sciences and mathematics presented predominantly in small classes at an accelerated pace. Courses emphasize the common base and relationships between the traditional sciences, including the importance of mathematics and the development of first principles, leading to interdisciplinary topics at the forefront of science today. The goal is to provide students who are interested in careers in science and mathematics with a broad quantitative background that will give them superior preparation for further work in graduate or professional schools or permanent employment. The curriculum is composed of 25.7 units, up to 3 of which may be independent research, as well as a regular seminar series. Most students take advantage of the opportunity to pursue research in world-class laboratories at Northwestern and are able to publish peer-reviewed papers in professional journals. For Weinberg College students ISP may lead to a three-year bachelor of arts degree if, by the end of the third year, the student has completed 38.7 or more units and satisfied all other college requirements.</p><p>Students must be accepted to Northwestern to be eligible for admission to ISP, which requires a separate application to the program director. For more information on admission procedures, see Special Admission <ref type="bibr">Programs (p. 11)</ref>. Also see the ISP website for the required AP and achievement tests.</p><p>The ISP curriculum consists of specially designed courses taught by faculty members of science and mathematics departments. Course descriptions are found in the appropriate departments in this catalog. Though listed in a three-year format, the program is often spread over four years, particularly if a student wishes to combine an ISP major with a second major in a traditional department, such as biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, environmental sciences, earth and planetary sciences, materials science, mathematics, neuroscience, physics, psychology, or in an engineering field.

The Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences Program (MMSS) was created to give undergraduate students an opportunity to combine the study of social sciences with training in formal analytical methods.</p><p>MMSS students pursue a double course of study: a common mathematics/quantitative methods sequence and the social science major of their choice. (In some cases, students choose their joint major from outside the social sciences.) The program is for students with high mathematical aptitude and strong interest in social problems and issues, including policy and research implications.

For example, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov probe philosophical, social, political, and psychological issues that are central to the modern experience and fundamental to Western culture. Majors may choose to concentrate in "Russian Language, Literature and Culture" or "Russian and East European Studies". Some students seek a deep knowledge of Russian culture and literary tradition, while others are more interested in acquiring international knowledge and language proficiency for use in such fields as government, law, business, or journalism. The major (or minor) may complement study of history, political science, health, or other disciplines. Minors in "Russian and East European Studies" gain a broad understanding of Slavic literature and culture. They may focus on Czech, Russian, or Polish studies without a language prerequisite.</p><p>The department strongly recommends that students study abroad. Programs take place in Prague, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vladimir and Almaty. Students should consult the undergraduate adviser in the department or an adviser in the Global Learning Office (https://www.northwestern.edu/abroad) to learn more about study abroad options.</p></div>

The building also houses the departmental and faculty offices of the Departments of Theatre and Performance Studies.</figDesc><table><row><cell>). All departments offer graduate courses. The School of Communication sponsors dance, debate, media arts, and theatre arts divisions of Northwestern's National High School Institute. This wide range of educational activities takes place in buildings across the Evanston campus. The fifth floor of the Ryan Center for the Musical Arts houses the school's administrative offices and two departmental offices. The Frances Searle Building houses administrative offices, two departmental offices, and laboratory and research spaces. Other facilities include the school's original building, Annie May Swift Hall; two former residences on Chicago Avenue; the Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts; and John J. Louis Hall, a state-of-the-art studio production facility. In 2008 Northwestern opened a branch campus in Qatar, where programs in communication and journalism are offered. (See Campuses and Schools in The University chapter of this catalog.) Facilities The School of Communication provides outstanding facilities in which students and faculty work, perform, pursue research, engage in media ventures, and connect with their community. The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Annie May Swift Hall-a beautifully restored legacy of Northwestern's early days that once housed all of the school's programs-is now home to the Department of Radio/Television/Film as well as the department's film library and the Peggy Dow Helmerich Auditorium. Students in this department also have access to the Fisk Digital Media Studio, the Kresge Digital Media Lab, and John J. Louis Hall-home to production and postproduction facilities, the film equipment center, the studios of WNUR-FM, and the Barbara and Garry Marshall Studio wing, a film soundstage. The Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts, recently renovated to increase student performance and rehearsal space, houses the Josephine Louis Theater, a 369-seat proscenium theatre; the Ethel M. Barber Theater, a 439-seat thrust theatre; two black box spaces, the Hal and Martha Hyer Wallis and the Mussetter-Struble Theaters; and production facilities, including scene and costume shops. In addition, the Department of Theatre sponsors occasional productions in Cahn Auditorium, a 1,000-seat proscenium space. The Marjorie Ward Marshall Dance Center features two dance studios. The Frances Searle Building is home to the School of Communication's science and research programs, including the Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and the Department of Communication Studies. Across the street is the state-of-the-art facility for the school's Center for Audiology, Speech, Language, and Learning, which serves the community's communication health needs. Additional communication studies offices are located at 1815 Chicago Avenue. Next door, Hardy House provides a home to the Northwestern Debate Society. On Northwestern's Chicago campus are offices for the School of Communication master's program in communication and health and for its treatment programs in voice, speech, and swallowing disorders.</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Program sites expose students to the breadth and depth of issues and activities within a field. They experience new skills and responsibilities through the projects they carry out from start to finish. Their supervising mentors meet with them individually for at least one hour per week.The prerequisite course-SESP 372-0 Methods of Observing Human Behavior-teaches students how to take and analyze notes for a field study. Students complete a qualitative field study of their practicum experiences.Open to freshmen, sophomores, and juniors in any school at Northwestern, the Civic Engagement Certificate Program increases students' understanding of community needs and assets and fosters ongoing civic engagement by connecting community service experience with an academic component. Spanning five academic quarters, the twoyear program requires a total of 5 units of coursework and 100 hours of community engagement.The programs in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, manufacturing and design engineering, materials science and engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (abet.org). For further information on ABET standards and course partitioning visit www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/academics/undergraduate/abet/ With the proper use and combination of requirements, options, and electives, students may prepare themselves for graduate work in engineering or for postbaccalaureate degrees in medicine, law, business, or other areas. Bachelor of science degrees are also awarded in approved ad hoc integrated engineering studies (p. 120) programs.Graduate programs of study are available in all of the above fields as well as in analytics, applied physics, biotechnology, engineering design and innovation, engineering management, information technology, manufacturing management, product design and development, project management, robotics, technology and social behavior, and theoretical and applied mechanics. Programs leading to degrees at the master's and doctoral levels are described in detail in publications of the Graduate School and engineering graduate programs.</figDesc><table><row><cell>ROBERT R.

Integrated planning of coursework makes it possible to take graduate-level courses during the third and fourth years. The requirements remain unchanged for the two degrees. The McCormick requirement for the BS is 48 units, and the requirement for the MS is specified by the individual department (9-12 units). No course used for the MS requirement may be counted toward the BS requirement.Application for admission to concurrent BS/MS study must be approved by the appropriate department and the Graduate School. A department may require that students do additional work beforehand. students may earn bachelor's degrees from two different undergraduate schools in Northwestern. Five years of full-time study are usually required. Students may pursue dual bachelor's degree programs between the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, the Bienen School of Music, or the School of Communication.For additional details on these programs see Dual Bachelor's Degrees (p. 36). For information on applying to one of these programs see Application to Dual Bachelor's DegreePrograms (p. 12).McCormick students are able to pursue the following minors in addition to a bachelor's degree.

Their positions include project engineers, project managers, field engineers, and designers. Some graduates join the business sector as business analysts, technical consultants, and derivative traders. Sample of their employers include Amazon, Boeing, Accenture, ARCADIS, Mass Electric Construction, General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division, National Forest Service, SOM, WSP, Thornton Tomsasetti, Jacobs, and MWRD. Others went directly to graduate school. Most mid-career civil engineers hold supervisory or administrative positions such as project engineers.</figDesc><table /><note>At Northwestern, the Civil Engineering curriculum is designed to satisfy students' diverse interest and professional goals. Students develop study plans suited to their unique interest, including extensive options for courses such as Architectural Engineering and Design Certificate, Environmental Engineering Minor within our Department and Kellogg School of Management Certificate program for undergraduates to address the social, physical, and financial challenges of constructing and managing the nation's infrastructure. While Civil engineering graduates typically work in engineering consulting firms, city and county public works, state departments of transportation, construction companies, various branches of federal government, and engineering material product industries, some of our graduates work in the aerospace industry, Wall Street, medicine, laws, politics, and policy development. A majority of Northwestern graduates receive at least one advanced degree. About half of these received advanced degrees are in other professional fields such as aerospace, business administration, medicine, and law. Others may work in research and development, and teaching.</note></figure>

Few in the news media recognized the political forces that led to Donald Trump's election and energized Republican efforts to reshape the national landscape.

The following is a sample; a list of courses being taught this academic year is available on the program website</head><label></label><figDesc>jewish-studies.northwestern.eduJewish Studies refers to the study of Judaism, Jewish history, Jewish identity and Jewish culture over time and around the world. Our professors rely on tools of historical research, textual analysis, ethnography, political science, and more as they seek to understand and teach these topics. Jewish Studies is truly an interdisciplinary way of analyzing and understanding the world! Jewish Studies courses (https://www.jewish-israel-studiescenter.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/courses) are open to students of all backgrounds. While some of the students who take our classes are Jewish, many are not. We offer a major and a minor for anyone looking to go deeper into the study of Jewish experience. On the other hand, if you are just looking for something a little different from what you usually study, you will be glad to know that many of our courses satisfy Weinberg College distribution requirements. Jewish Studies also partners with Middle East and North African Studies (p. 312) (MENA) to provide Hebrew language classes (https:// www.jewish-israel-studies-center.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/ hebrew-studies.html), which are offered at three levels. (https://www.jewish-studies.northwestern.edu/ undergraduate/courses/yearly-planner.html): Analysis and discussion of the literary, visual, and filmic images of the communal life developed by Eastern European Jews and inseparably associated with them. GERMAN 266-0, JWSH_ST 266-0 and YIDDISH 266-0 taught together; students may receive credit for only one of these. Literature Fine Arts Distro Area Analysis of modern Yiddish literature before the Holocaust as well as literary work that emerged from Yiddish-speaking writers who survived the Second World War.

This field encompasses diverse communities and nationalities while also offering critical attention to transnational dynamics or to how Latinas and Latinos relate and connect to cultural or geographical origins across the Americas. Similar to other race/ethnic studies fields, Latina and Latino Studies has origins outside of universities. To a large extent, it originated in social movements led by organizers, thinkers, artists, students, workers and teachers who were opposed to legacies of racial injustice, ethnic prejudice, exploitation, criminalization and neglect. Latina and Latino Studies represents the academic branch of this dynamic political culture. As an interdisciplinary field, it sustains this activist impulse by honoring the diverse mediums and methods through which Latinas and Latinos have advocated for social justice and dignity. Latina and Latino Studies produces ways of knowing and seeing that challenge normative and stereotypical representations of Latinas and Latinos in U.S. society. In solidarity with other race/ethnic studies interdisciplines, Latina and Latino Studies unsettles traditional and Eurocentric modes of knowledge production in order to recuperate, speculate and illuminate other possible worlds.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Introduction to Latina and Latino Literature</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>LATINO 342-0</cell><cell>Latina and Latino Social Movements</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>LATINO 391-0</cell><cell>Topics in Latina and Latino History</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>LATINO 392-0</cell><cell>Topics in Latina and Latino Social and Political Issues</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>LATINO 393-0</cell><cell>Topics in Latina and Latino Text and Representation</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Political Science</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Course</cell><cell>Title</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>POLI_SCI 353-0</cell><cell>Politics of Latin America</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Spanish and Portuguese</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Course</cell><cell>Title</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>PORT 396-0</cell><cell>Topics in Lusophone Cultures</cell><cell>2</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 231-0</cell><cell>The "New" Latin American Narrative</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 232-0</cell><cell>Discovering Jewish Latin America</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 260-0</cell><cell>Literature in Latin America before 1888</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 261-0</cell><cell>Literature in Latin America since 1888</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 340-0</cell><cell>Colonial Latin American Literature</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 341-0</cell><cell>Latin American Modernismo</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 343-0</cell><cell>Latin American Avant-Gardes</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 344-0</cell><cell>Borges</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 345-0</cell><cell>Reading the 'Boom'</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 346-0</cell><cell>Testimonial Narrative in Latin America</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 347-0</cell><cell>Literature and Revolution in Latin America</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 348-0</cell><cell>Readings in Latin American Short Fiction</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 350-0</cell><cell>Visual Culture in Latina/o America and Spain</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 361-0</cell><cell>Latin America: Studies in Culture and Society</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>SPANISH 380-0</cell><cell>Topics in Film: The Silver Screen in Latin America</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>and/or Spain</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Course When relevant to Latin America, the Caribbean, and/or US Latina/os: Title ANTHRO 390-0 Topics In Anthropology</cell><cell>SPANISH 395-0 SPANISH 397-0</cell><cell>Topics in Latin American, Latina and Latino, and/or 2 Iberian Cultures Topics in Latin American, Latina and Latino, and Iberian Literatures and Cultures 2</cell></row><row><cell>ANTHRO 490-0</cell><cell>Topics in Anthropology</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>2</cell></row><row><cell>History 1</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Course</cell><cell>Title</cell><cell>Latina</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

They then take PHIL 398-1 in spring quarter of junior year and PHIL 398-2 in fall quarter of senior year; neither counts toward major requirements. (Students may petition to begin this thesis sequence in fall quarter of senior year, so that their sequence moves forward a quarter, respectively.) Near the end of the second quarter (i.e. PHIL 398-2), students submit completed senior theses, which are evaluated by the undergraduate committee in terms of level of research and philosophical reflection. In the spring, students present their research results at a conference open to the public.</p><p>Students whose papers, presentations, and grades meet department criteria are recommended to the college for graduation with honors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy Minor</head><p>The minor in philosophy requires students to be well-grounded in the history of philosophy, especially ancient and early modern, covering the major texts of ethical and political theory as well as the major texts of epistemology and metaphysics. The emphasis on argument and logical structure in philosophy requires familiarity with contemporary logic, at least up to the level of the first-order predicate calculus. Beyond this foundational requirement, students take 4 courses tailored to their individual interests and, typically, to complement work being done in their major. To provide the greatest latitude, only 3 of the 4 remaining courses need be at the 300 or 400 level. </p></div>

Students generally begin the major with 200-level courses, which provide a general introduction to subfields of political science as well as background for 300-level courses. Majors should choose 200-level courses from at least two subfields: American politics, comparative politics, international politics, and political theory.</p><p>While some students choose courses from within one or two subfields, most take a wide variety across different areas. Concentrations are not required; however, majors may consult with department advisers to design programs of study. Students might design concentrations around, for instance, themes such as race, ethnicity, and politics; global transformation; representation and law; social and economic inequalities; terrorism and national security; and citizenship studies. Restrictions on eligible credits and substitutions include the following:</p><p>• At most 1 unit of Chicago Field Studies (chosen from CFS 391-0, CFS 394-1, CFS 396-0 or CFS 397-0) may substitute for one course.</p><p>• At most two units of POLI_SCI 399-0 may count toward the 300-level requirement for the major.</p><p>• Only one additional POLI_SCI 395-0 credit beyond the one credit required may count towards the 300-level requirement for the major.</p><p>• Honors thesis seminars POLI_SCI 398-1 and POLI_SCI 398-2 do not count toward the major.</p></div>

The methodological techniques are often transferable to research problems in government and business. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes about substitutions and restrictions:</head><p>• At most one course from study abroad may count toward the minor.</p><p>• At most two units of POLI_SCI 399-0 Independent Study may count towards the minor.</p><p>• Courses taken P/N cannot be counted toward the minor (this is a Weinberg College rule; for details see Grade <ref type="bibr">Requirements (p. 181)</ref>).</p><p>• Receiving a 5 on an AP exam (either American Government or Comparative Politics) can place students out of the equivalent 200-level course, but test credit awarded cannot be substituted for the courses (6) required to complete the minor. Thus, instead of taking POLI_SCI 220-0 or POLI_SCI 250-0, the student must take an additional 300-level course. Students wishing to use their AP credit in this fashion must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to place the request.</p></div>

The department's approach is fundamentally multidisciplinary, drawing from a variety of fields and critical perspectives: anthropology, history, philosophy, ethics, sociology, and literary and cultural studies, among others.</p><p>The wide variety of undergraduate courses range from large introductory classes to advanced seminars, and there are also independent studies and a senior thesis program for qualified students. The courses cover aspects of Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, African American and Native American religions, new religious movements, and religion and culture in America. Several courses are structured comparatively or thematically and address religious ideas and phenomena across cultures and contexts.</p><p>The department offers a major and minor in religious studies and a minor in Catholic studies.</p><p>In consultation with a department adviser, students majoring in religious studies select one of four concentrations:</p><p>• Global study of religion in comparative perspective • Religion, health, and medicine • Religion, law, and politics • Religion, sexuality, and gender</p><p>The concentrations are designed to complement academic interests and enhance professional goals.</p><p>The minor in religious studies provides a balanced set of departmental courses, including work on general theories of religion and on the historical development of religions and their social manifestations. In the interdisciplinary minor in Catholic studies, students take courses from both religious studies and other departments and choose an area of focus within Catholic studies. </p></div>
