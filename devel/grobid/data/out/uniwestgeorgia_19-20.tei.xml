<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The University System of Georgia</head><p>The University System of Georgia's Board of Regents was created in 1931 as a part of a reorganization of Georgia's state government. With this act, public higher education in Georgia was unified for the first time under a single governing and management authority. The governor appoints members to the Board, who each serve seven years. Today the Board of Regents is composed of 19 members, five of whom are appointed from the state-at-large, and one from each of the 14 congressional districts. The Board elects a chancellor who serves as its chief executive officer and the chief administrative officer of the University System. The Board oversees 26 colleges and universities that comprise the University System of Georgia and has oversight of the Georgia Archives and the Georgia Public Library System. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vision and Mission Statements for University System of Georgia</head><p>"The University System of Georgia will create a more educated Georgia, well prepared for a global, technological society, by providing first-rate undergraduate and graduate education, leading-edge research, and committed public service."</p><p>The mission of the University System of Georgia is to contribute to the educational, cultural, economic, and social advancement of Georgia by providing excellent undergraduate general education and first-rate programs leading to associate, baccalaureate, masters, professional, and doctorate degrees; by pursuing leading-edge basic and applied research, scholarly inquiry, and creative endeavors; and by bringing these intellectual resources, and those of the public libraries, to bear on the economic development of the State and the continuing education of its citizens. Each institution in the University System of Georgia will be characterized by:</p><p>• A supportive campus climate, leadership and development opportunities, and necessary services and facilities to meet the needs of students, faculty, and staff; • Cultural, ethnic, racial, and gender diversity in the faculty, staff, and student body, supported by practices and programs that embody the ideals of an open, democratic, and global society; • Technology to advance educational purposes, including instructional technology, student support services, and distance education; and • A commitment to sharing physical, human, information, and other resources in collaboration with other System institutions, the public libraries, state agencies, local schools, and technical colleges to expand and enhance programs and services available to the citizens of Georgia.</p></div>

Library users have access to Georgia Library Learning Online (GALILEO), an online library of databases, full text electronic journals, and reference resources available to all Georgians, as well as to an extensive range of electronic materials selected to support the university's academic programs. All licensed electronic materials are available to university students, faculty and staff through any computer with internet access. By providing access to an extensive range of online materials, through its chat reference service, by developing an electronic reserve system and online request systems for obtaining materials from other libraries, the library ensures that students enrolled at the university's remote class sites and in online courses are afforded the same level of library support as those who attend classes on the Carrollton campus; the Library's Off-Campus Services unit provides materials to such students as needed, upon request through its interlibrary loan system.</p><p>The library participates in state and regional consortia, facilitating extensive access to the collective resources of university system and other libraries. The library catalog, provided through Georgia Interconnected Libraries (GIL), lists materials available in Ingram Library collections and provides links to catalogs of other libraries. West Georgia students, faculty, and staff may request books from any university system library through the online GIL Express service, a feature of the universal catalog, and they also have check out privileges when visiting system libraries. In addition, the University of West Georgia is a member of the Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education (ARCHE), which allows students, faculty and staff to utilize the resources of member libraries. Ingram Library provides interlibrary loan service through its website, facilitating the borrowing of books from libraries throughout the country. Articles requested through interlibrary loan are transmitted to patrons electronically.</p><p>The library pursues an active instruction program. LIBR 2100 -Information Literacy and Research, a for-credit course that is part of Area B of the Core, is taught face to face as well as online. The course is designed to orient students to doing research in academic libraries and to critically evaluating information and media resources. Library skills classes are also arranged at the request of faculty and tailored to specific assignments and class needs. Individuals seeking assistance with library resources and research needs can utilize reference services at the reference desks, via telephone, and through the 24/7 online chat reference service available through the library website. Students can make personal research appointments with librarians through the GoPRO service.</p><p>The Annie Belle Weaver Special Collections area on the ground floor of Ingram Library provides access to information about the history of the university and the geographic area it serves. Photographs, family histories, and other materials associated with the west Georgia region are included in Special Collections, as are materials on sacred harp music and American psalmody. The Humanistic Psychology and Parapsychology collections include the papers of Sidney Jourard, Carmi Harari, William Roll, Ingo Swann, and Edith Weisskopf-Joelson. A special effort is made to acquire the manuscript collections of individuals who have represented the region in state or national legislative bodies. One of the most notable collections is that associated with Georgia's Political Heritage Program, begun by university faculty in 1985. The collection includes taped interviews with state and national leaders, among them most of Georgia's post-World War II governors, U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy. Senator Herman Talmadge was the first interview subject for the program. The Talmadge collection is particularly significant as it includes some 35 interviews recorded between 1985 and 1995 as well as interviews with his staff and some of his supporters. The Thomas B. Murphy Reading Room and State Capitol Office installation, dedicated in 2012, honors Georgia House Speaker Tom Murphy who left office in 2002 with the distinction of serving as the nation's longest-serving House speaker. Murphy's office was replicated as part of a library facility renovation completed in 2011 and funded with a special state legislative appropriation</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition Classification of Students as In-State and Out-of-State</head><p>All applicants who are accepted for admission or readmission to the University of West Georgia for Fall, 2011, or any academic semester thereafter, and who seek to be classified as in-state for tuition purposes, will be required to provide validation of residency and lawful presence in both the State of Georgia and the United States. The University System of Georgia allows students who have been admitted to the University of West Georgia as out-of-state for tuition purposes, to apply for in-state status through various tuition differential waivers. For more information, see the Registrar's site at https://www.westga.edu/registrar/tuition-classification.php.</p><p>It is the policy of the Office of Admissions to take a student's best Critical Reading/Reading/English and best Math score should the student take the SAT or ACT more than once; however, SAT scores and ACT scores cannot be "mixed" in determining admission eligibility.</p><p>5. In addition to the minimum test score requirement, a minimum Freshman Index of 2120 is required for any level of freshman or transfer freshman admission. 6. Students whose index falls between 2000-2119 may be eligible for conditional admission and attendance in Ignite, UWG's Summer Transition Program. 7. A high school senior who is earning college credit in a joint enrollment program while completing the senior year should apply to West Georgia as a beginning freshman but should indicate enrollment in a joint enrollment program on the application for admission. West Georgia will grant transfer credit for this work under the following conditions: (1) Work must be earned through an accredited college. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> Individual courses must meet the normal guidelines for acceptability (see Transfer Student section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Student</head><p>A transfer applicant is one who has been enrolled in any regionally accredited college or university. All previous college attendance must be reported at the time of application. Those who have earned fewer than 45 quarter hours/30 semester hours of transferable work or the equivalent will be asked to comply with both freshman and transfer requirements for admission (see freshman requirements for additional details).</p><p>A transfer applicant should request the registrar of each college or university he or she has attended to send a transcript to the Office of Admissions. Credits from one former institution appearing on the transcript of another institution can neither be officially evaluated for admission nor accepted for credit until a transcript has been received from the institution originating the credit.</p><p>Transfer students will be considered for admission on the basis of their previous college records: 1. They must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 in all transferable college work attempted (non-traditional transfer students with greater than 45 quarter hours/30 semester hours of transferable work may be considered with a lower GPA on a case-by-case basis in order to determine their ability to be successful). 2. Students not meeting the minimum GPA requirement may be admitted if they hold an associate degree in a college transfer program from an accredited college and if they have not attempted any college coursework since completing the associate degree. 3. Students must be in good social and academic standing at their former institutions.</p><p>Students who have been away from high school for less than five years must have completed all RHSC deficiencies and/or Learning Support requirements prior to being admissible and show both English and math proficiency through course credit. Students who have been away from high school for greater than five years may prove proficiency in English, Reading, and Math either through placement testing, valid SAT/ACT scores (less than seven years old), or completion of college coursework. Transfer students from an out-of-state institution may also prove proficiency via the placement test on a case by case basis. Please contact the Admissions Office for further policy details. 4. Admission acceptance by the Office of Admission does not guarantee admission to a specific program or department.</p><p>Transfer credit is normally awarded for all college work earned through any college or university approved by its regional accrediting association, so long as similar credit is offered at West Georgia. Credit earned at a post-secondary institution that is not regionally accredited may be accepted at West Georgia if the course work is similar to course work in the student's degree program at West Georgia and if the course work is deemed to be collegiate level work. Credit earned at proprietary schools and technical institutions that are not Commission of Colleges (COC) accredited is not reviewed for transfer credit. The following stipulations on the transfer of credit are upheld:</p><p>The amount of academic credit that the University will allow for work done in another institution within a given period of time may not exceed the normal amount of credit that could have been earned at the University during that time. The maximum number of academic hours accepted is 90 from all institutions. Not more than a combined total of 30 hours of extension, correspondence work and military education/training will be accepted. 1. The amount of academic credit that the University will allow for work done in another institution within a given period of time may not exceed the normal amount of credit that could have been earned at the University during that time. The maximum number of academic hours accepted is 90 from all institutions. Not more than a combined total of 30 hours of extension, correspondence work and military education/training will be accepted 2. According to Board of Regents policy, if a student transfers to West Georgia with an A.A. or A.S. degree from an institution within the University System of Georgia, he/she will receive full credit for having completed Core Areas A -F. If the major differs between the A.A. or A.S. degree program and the major the student decides to pursue at West Georgia, there may be additional courses required at the 1000 or 2000 level that are specific to that degree major and/or are prerequisite for higher level courses that the student would have to take (example: Some majors require the student to have had Precalculus or Calculus I in order to enroll in some higher level courses in the program of study. If the student had College Algebra as a part of his/her A.A. or A.S. program, he/she would still receive credit for having completed the Math section of Area A of the Core, but he/she would still be required to take Precalculus or Calculus I to complete the requirements of the major.). The Core credit policy does not apply to career degrees (A.A.S. and A.S.); in those cases, each course is evaluated individually and credit is given in areas where comparable courses are offered at West Georgia, including some courses that may be counted as Core or electives. 3. Dual/Joint Enrollment Credit: College credit earned at an accredited institution prior to high school graduation will be considered as transfer credit if the student was enrolled as a joint enrollment/early admission student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Transfers from Technical College System of Georgia Colleges</head><p>The Board of Regents and the Technical College System of Georgia have entered into an agreement referred to as the "Mini-Core Project." The agreement states that course credits for basic skills courses in English and mathematics with common course content will be transferable between schools in the University System of Georgia and COC-accredited institutions in the Technical College System of Georgia. Comparable placement and exit test results will be honored between the two systems as well. The transfer agreement is effective for students from COC-accredited Technical College System of Georgia institutions who have taken <ref type="bibr">ENG 191 and/or MAT 190 or 191 since January 2002</ref>, and who meet the minimum test score requirements for exemption from developmental studies, or successfully complete and meet the minimum test score requirements for exit from developmental studies English and/or mathematics. Courses other than those approved for the mini-core agreement will be evaluated on an individual basis for possible transfer credit. In order to be eligible for mini-core transfer credit, students must have earned satisfactory scores on either placement or exit tests. Students with minimum old SAT Critical Reading 430; RSAT Reading Section 24 (ACT 17) + SAT Math 410; RSAT Math 450 (ACT 17) + high school diploma/GED and four years of college prep English, Algebra I and II, and Geometry, and a college prep math higher than Algebra II will be exempt from placement testing. Exit from Learning Support at a COC-accredited TCSG institution will be honored if the student has a record of meeting the TCSG minimum test score requirement for exit at UWG within the past year. 5. Students who apply for undergraduate admission and have attended a non-accredited institution will be requested to provide an official transcript from that institution. For the purposes of the evaluation of credit, the Admissions Office will request the student provide a catalog, course syllabi, and the names and credentials of the faculty who taught their courses. The student may be able to obtain this information from the institution's Website. The Admissions Office will forward all materials received to the Registrar's Office for review of credit. Lower division courses will be evaluated by the Registrar's Office and credit awarded based upon the materials provided by the student. The decision to award credit may be referred to the appropriate department in some cases. Upper division courses will be evaluated by the appropriate academic department. Departmental decisions on UWG equivalents are final. There is no appeal beyond the departmental level. 6. Provided all other stipulations regarding transfer credits are met, West Georgia will grant transfer credit for the following: All courses with grades of "C" or better All Core Curriculum courses earned at University System institutions with grades of "D" or better, with the exception noted in #7 below Other courses with grades of "D" provided the average for all academic courses being transferred does not fall below "C" 7. A grade of "D" in English composition is not acceptable. 8. Credit for specific courses designated as major courses will not be allowed unless grades are "C" or above. 9. A grade of "C" or above is required for all professional sequence courses in education and those courses listed under content field. None of the professional education sequence may be completed by extension or correspondence. 10. Students who experience problems with transfer of credit should contact the Registrar's Office to determine the nature of the problem. If the problem is not resolved, students should contact the University Chief Transfer Officer to seek resolution to the problem. 11. The University System of Georgia Board of Regents authorizes the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs to make decisions about exceptions on a caseby-case basis when questions arise about course substitutions in the Core curriculum. Transfer course equivalencies may be viewed at http://westga.edu/transfer. Courses listed reflect results from previously reviewed transcripts and in no case should this list be considered a final and/or a complete listing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transient Student</head><p>A student who has taken work in a college or university may apply for the privilege of temporary registration. Such a student is one who expects to return to the college or university in which he or she was previously enrolled. The normal application procedure consists of filing an application form with a $40 non-refundable fee for each semester of transient study. The dean or registrar of the college where the student has been enrolled must give written approval for the student to attend West Georgia.</p><p>The following policies shall govern the admission of a transient student:</p><p>An applicant will be accepted as a transient student only when it appears that the applicant's previous academic work is of satisfactory quality. A student must not be under suspension or exclusion from the previous institution.</p><p>1. Enrollment as a transient student is limited to one semester. Exceptions may be made by special permission of the Admissions Office and with special approval of the dean of the institution from which the student comes. Application for readmission as a transient student for the second semester must be submitted to the Office of Admissions by the semester application and document deadline date. 2. Transient approval for a second consecutive term will be considered only when evidence is submitted to the Office of Admissions that the applicant meets full transfer admission requirements. 3. Transient students desiring to continue as transfer students must apply through the Admissions Office by the semester application and document deadline date and satisfactorily complete the transfer requirements listed above. 4. Since a university's primary obligation is to its regularly enrolled students, West Georgia will consider the acceptance of transient students only when their acceptance will cause no hardship or inconvenience to the institution or its regularly enrolled students. 5. Transient students are not eligible for financial assistance <ref type="bibr">(grants, loans, HOPE scholarship, etc.)</ref> through the University of West Georgia. Transient students must make financial assistance arrangements with their "home" institution. 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement, College Level Exam Programs, Departmental Exams, Cambridge</head><p>International "A" Levels, and International Baccalaureate (IB) Exams The Advanced Placement (AP) Program is available through many high schools and enables a high school student to earn credit toward college in a variety of subjects. Usually these courses are equivalent to college freshmen/sophomore level courses such as American Government, World History, Composition, and so forth. College credit will be awarded based on standardized exams administered at the high schools in mid to late May. If you have questions, contact the Admissions Office. High school students who earn AP exam scores of 3 or higher (on a scale of 1-5) on most exams and who submit official score reports to the University of West Georgia will automatically receive credit for coursework. Scores of 4 or higher are required to receive credit for history exams. Scores of 4 or 5 count as Honors credit. For a list of scores accepted by UWG and the UWG course equivalents, please visit the UWG Registrar's Office website at http://www.westga.edu/registrar. The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is offered at West Georgia by appointment and allows persons to earn college credit by achieving appropriate cutoff scores on nationally standardized exams. Exams available cover a range of courses including math, history, government, literature, and sciences. For a list of scores accepted by UWG and the UWG course equivalents, please visit the UWG Registrar's Office website at http://www.westga.edu/registrar. Test registration information is available through the Testing Office (678-839-6435).</p><p>As with AP testing, CLEP is a great way to earn college credit. Not only will a person save time by not having to take a course containing material he already knows, but he will also save money by not having to pay for a college class. Thus, CLEP enables a student to move through his or her freshman and sophomore years at a faster pace.</p><p>1. All applicants, regardless of immigration status, whose native language is not English, must meet English language proficiency requirements. This requirement can be fulfilled by submitting results from one of the approved English Language Proficiency options listed below. 2.

Native speaking students will need to submit official scores from either the SAT or ACT academic examination. Minimum SAT/ACT score requirements for freshman or transfer freshman admission are: SAT Critical Reading-430 and SAT Math-410; ACT English-17, and ACT Math-17. It is the policy of the Office of Admissions to take a student's best Critical Reading/English and best math score should the student take the SAT or ACT more than once; however, SAT scores and ACT scores cannot be "mixed" in determining admission eligibility.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress</head><p>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements are meant to ensure that students are able to complete their academic program in a timely manner through achieving minimum academic standards. In an age of increasing accountability for the use of federal, state, and institutional student aid funds, institutions of higher education and their students must demonstrate that financial aid funds are being used to assist students in efficiently completing their academic goals.</p><p>The University of West Georgia (UWG) has developed the following Satisfactory Academic Progress policy for Financial Aid recipients to encourage student success and accountability in the use of Financial Aid funds for educational purposes. While the University of West Georgia maintains an academic progress policy for the determination of a student's continued academic eligibility for enrollment purposes, the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy for Financial Aid purposes may be more stringent in some components in order to maintain compliance with Federal Student Aid regulations (34 CFR 668.34).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consistency of Application of SAP Standards</head><p>Unless otherwise noted, the SAP requirements as stated apply to all students regardless of the student's receipt of financial aid funds, the student's academic classification as an undergraduate or graduate student, or the student's academic program. Exceptions (as noted below) will include but are not limited to the minimum GPA requirement and maximum time frame hours for graduate students. II.</p><p>Frequency of SAP Evaluation The UWG Financial Aid Office will evaluate all students' Satisfactory Academic Progress status at the conclusion of each term of enrollment. At UWG, the term of enrollment is the semester. Students enrolled in summer semester will be evaluated for SAP at the conclusion of the summer semester. III.</p><p>Grade-Point Average (GPA) Requirement A. Undergraduate students will be evaluated each semester on the basis of cumulative GPA and the total number of hours attempted. Hours transferred will be included in determining the total hours attempted; however, the cumulative GPA will be computed only on the work completed at UWG (institutional GPA). The cumulative GPA required to maintain SAP for the total number of hours attempted is given below: Graduate students will be evaluated each semester on the basis of cumulative institutional GPA. The minimum cumulative GPA required to maintain SAP is 3.00. C.</p><p>Impacts on GPA regardless of undergraduate or graduate level:</p><p> Transfer credits will not be included in the quality points or GPA hours.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAP Status •</head><p>A student's SAP status will be evaluated at the completion of each term of enrollment. At UWG, the term of enrollment is the semester. Students enrolled in summer semester will be evaluated for SAP at the conclusion of the summer semester. At each evaluation period, one of the following SAP statuses will be assigned: • Satisfactory -Student is meeting the GPA, Pace of Progression, and Maximum Time Frame requirements. Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. • Warning -Student is not meeting either the GPA or Pace of Progression requirements (or both). Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid for one semester only. Continued eligibility beyond the warning semester will be contingent on the student bringing the deficient requirements to the required minimum standards.</p><p>• FA Suspension -Student is not meeting either the GPA or Pace of Progression requirements (or both) after a Warning semester. Student is not eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid until the deficient requirements return to the required minimum standards. • Maximum Time Frame Warning -Student is within 10 attempted hours of the allotted attempted hours for Maximum Time Frame for the student's degree program. Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid until the completion of the semester during which allotted attempted hours is crossed. • Maximum Time Frame -Student has exceeded the number of attempted hours for the academic program. Student has exhausted all eligibility to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. • FA Probation -Student placed on FA Suspension or Maximum Time Frame provided an SAP Appeal which was approved by UWG review procedures. Student must complete the requirements of an academic plan which will be monitored by the Financial Aid Office in conjunction with other academic support offices. Student is eligible to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid for one semester only in coordination with the details of the academic plan. The student's continued eligibility beyond the probation semester will be determined at the conclusion of each semester in coordination with the details of the academic plan. VII.</p><p>Appeals A student who has been placed on FA Suspension or Maximum Time Frame may appeal the SAP status decision only in cases of extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances for which a student may file an SAP appeal may include a student's injury or illness, serious illness or death of an immediate family member, or other special circumstances. Each SAP appeal will be reviewed individually and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis as outlined in the procedures given below.</p><p>The SAP appeal process requires the submission of a written statement by the student outlining the extenuating circumstances which led to their academic difficulties, how the circumstances have now changed, and the student's plan for improving the academic status. The written statement must be typewritten, signed by the student, and must specifically address the courses, grades, and terms of enrollment which are affecting the insufficient SAP standing. The appeal must be accompanied by supporting documentation from at least two individuals who can corroborate the student's circumstances. If the documentation is provided by a professional <ref type="bibr">(business, medical, counselor, clergy, etc.)</ref>, the documentation must include the institution's professional letterhead, the professional's credentials, and must be signed. If a letter of support is provided by a personal reference (teacher, family friend, etc.), the documentation must be signed by that reference. Appeals may be submitted via Banweb for current students.</p><p>SAP appeals will be reviewed by a UWG committee comprised of FA staff and other faculty/staff representatives. A student who wishes to appeal the decision of the SAP Appeals Committee may submit a request for a review by the 2nd Appeal Committee. The decision of the 2nd Appeal Committee is final.</p><p>If a student's SAP appeal is granted by either the SAP Appeals Committee or the Director of Financial Aid, the student will gain eligibility for continued federal, state, or institutional Financial Aid eligibility for one semester only. The student and a representative from the Financial Aid Office will work cooperatively with the student's academic advisor and/or the Center for Academic Success to put together an academic success plan that will be monitored throughout the semester to be sure the student is making proper academic progress. In cases where it is mathematically impossible to bring the GPA or Pace of Progression ratio to required standards within one semester, the academic plan may be developed across multiple semesters, but it will be evaluated at the conclusion of each semester to be certain that the requirements at each checkpoint are being properly achieved by the student. If a student's SAP appeal is denied by either of the SAP Appeals Committees, the student will not be eligible for federal, state, or institutional financial aid until the student returns the GPA and Pace of Progression ratio to required standards. VIII.</p><p>Notification of SAP Status At each SAP evaluation period, the student's SAP status will be recorded in BanWeb. Students who are placed on FA Probation, FA Suspension, or Maximum Time Frame will be notified via email to their UWG email account as well as via a postal letter mailed to the permanent address as recorded in BanWeb. Students who are placed on FA Warning will be notified via email to their UWG email account. All notifications will occur within 3 weeks of the conclusion of the semester against which SAP is evaluated.</p></div>

As early as possible, preferably after being accepted by the university and at least one month before entering the university, any student planning on enrolling under one of these programs should contact the SCO in CALV to initiate enrollment certification procedures. Students requesting enrollment certification for the first time should already be in possession of a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. Each VA educational assistance program has its own set of rules/guidelines and students should be prepared to sustain initial university costs since benefits will not begin until several weeks after certification. Veterans and family members planning to study using GI Bill benefits at the University of West Georgia should apply for admission as any other student. Eligibility for Veterans benefits has no direct relationship to the institution. All financial transactions are directly between the student and Veterans Affairs. The institution serves only as a source of certification and information to Veterans Affairs.</p><p>Students receiving Veterans benefits must adhere strictly to a planned program of study as indicated on the schools as well as all VA forms. Program changes must be reported promptly to the university's SCO in CALV.</p><p>Students receiving VA educational benefits are also required to report to the university's SCO in CALV any changes in course load; or interruptions in attendance in order to minimize personal liability resulting from overpayment of benefits. Veterans Affairs regulations indicate that students receiving benefits are expected to attend classes regularly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOPE Scholarships</head><p>The State of Georgia provides the HOPE Scholarship to students who have graduated from a Georgia high school since 1993 with a 3.0 cumulative grade point average on all core coursework. At 30, 60, or 90 attempted hours (including transfer work and GPA), a Georgia resident may gain eligibility for the HOPE Scholarship despite not meeting incoming freshman criteria. Students must use their HOPE scholarship within 7 years of graduating from High School. Students must complete the GSFAPP application found on the GAFutures.org website or the FAFSA.</p><p>Students remain eligible if they maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 at 30, 60, and 90 attempted semester hours. All HOPE Scholarship recipients must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 at the end of each spring term in order to continue their eligibility. Exceptions are freshmen (1st tier) recipients who enrolled in less than 12 hours for each of their first three terms. The scholarship covers a portion of tuition only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zell Miller Scholarship</head><p>The Zell Miller Scholarship program is available to students who have graduated from a Georgia high school with a minimum 3.7 grade point average combined with a minimum score of 1200 on the math and reading portions of the SAT test or a 26 composite score on the ACT test in a single test administration. (Test score must have been prior to high school graduation) This is available to students who graduated after 2011 only.</p><p>By providing support for fully online and partially online courses and programs, UWG Online makes higher education a possibility for those who face obstacles to taking undergraduate or graduate courses in a traditional face-to-face classroom setting. UWG seeks to extend the ability to earn credit toward a degree or certification program to those whose life circumstances, such as work, family, or distance, make attending face-to-face traditional classes impractical. Through distance learning (online learning), students can attend class whenever and wherever is convenient to them, with just the use of a computer and an internet connection. UWG was one of the first public schools in the state to offer online classes in 1997. Today, our diverse student population is spread across the country and internationally.</p><p>Our online courses are web-based and allow students to interact with the instructor and other students through discussion boards, email, and other various online tools. Course notes, assignments, projects, and grades are delivered using an online course management tool referred to as CourseDen (Brightspace powered by Desire2Learn). Some courses incorporate live sessions through two-way live videoconferencing technologies or other synchronous technologies.</p><p>Many of our online courses are fully online and do not require students to travel to our campus or other instructional sites. However, some courses may be only partially online and may require you to travel to the main campus or other sites for an orientation, exams, or meetings. Be sure to check the 'instructional method' listed beside each course section in Banweb (the public course bulletin). Some instructors may require students to take proctored exams which can be taken at any approved testing center worldwide. Additional proctored testing site fees may apply, and tuition rates may be different. Review the special instructions noted in the online course bulletin, and review your bill carefully.</p><p>Online learning generally provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities. Nevertheless, online courses at UWG are not typically independent study or self-paced courses where students work by themselves or at their own pace. Each course has a syllabus and schedule to follow. Instructors specify the content to be covered in the course, dates for exams and quizzes, individual and group assignments, and other activities that students must complete by a particular date. Students who do not log in and participate by the initial participation deadline may be dropped for non-participation.</p><p>Online core courses -UWG offers options to meet all core course requirements completely online. Some of these online core courses are designed and taught exclusively by instructors at UWG while others may be part of a statewide initiative referred to as eCore (electronic core). eCore courses may include students from other University System of Georgia schools and may be taught by non-UWG instructors. Start dates, end dates, policies, and procedures may be different for eCore than for other UWG courses. See http://ecore.westga.edu or contact 678-839-5300.</p><p>Upper-division undergraduate courses -Some upper-division courses may be offered fully at a distance or 94-99% online, requiring one face to face meeting, while some are offered partially at a distance or 51-94% online. Others may be listed as Entirely at a Distance or 100% online. Always be sure to check the special instructions noted on the public course bulletin site: http://banweb.westga.edu</p><p>Online undergraduate degree program -Though many upper-level undergraduate courses are offered partially, fully, or entirely at a distance, UWG offers several hybrid programs, including a Bachelors of Business Administration in Marketing and a Bachelors of Business Administration in Real Estate. Five undergraduate programs are available completely online -the Bachelor of Science in Criminology, the Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leadership (eMajor), the Bachelor of Science in Political Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN), and the Bachelor of Science in Sociology. In order to create the most convenient schedule possible, select undergraduate online programs are also taught on campus and allow students to enroll in both online and face-to-face courses. See https://uwgonline.westga.edu/academic_programs.php.</p><p>UWG offers many other online degree programs and courses at the graduate and certificate levels. Online degree offerings, services and information for online students , and additional details are available at UWG Online (http://uwgonline.westga.edu).</p><p>A primary function of UWG Online/Distance and Distributed Education Center is to provide support services and training for faculty members and students participating in these courses. The Center also provides opportunities for collaboration and research for those who manage and administer Distance and Distributed Education programs throughout the nation through its online academic journal, its online non-credit certificate program, and its annual conference. For more information about Distance or Distributed Education (UWG Online), telephone 678-839-6248 or visit http://uwgonline.westga.edu</p><p>For a complete description of student services, see the UWG Online Student Guide at: http://uwgonline.westga.edu/online-student-guide.php.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Services</head><p>Traditionally, public institutions of higher education state that they exist for the purpose of instruction, research, and public service. The public service mission has been paramount at West Georgia since its beginning. The faculty and staff have become well known for their efforts in extending the University into the communities of the West Georgia region. Furthermore, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia has placed special emphasis upon the role of public service and continuing education to serve as a catalyst for economic development.</p><p>Continuing Education and Public Services have emerged as an extension of the traditional oncampus learning process, available to adults wherever sufficient interest has been found. The</p><p>Continuing Education/Public Services Department is responsible for coordinating and providing support relating to cooperative vocational and professional programs, institutes, workshops, conferences, and other community educational programs. Short courses and other non-credit studies, such as in-service training and customized training to local business and industry, are responsibilities of the Department of Continuing Education. Courses are conducted on campus and off campus with some in-plant workshops held at various facilities throughout the area and regularly feature West Georgia faculty as instructors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Department of Continuing Education</head><p>Continuing Education and Public Services have emerged as a non-degree extension of the traditional learning process. The Department of Continuing Education is responsible for the assessment, development, and implementation of non-degree programs for those who wish to improve their job skills or otherwise enhance their personal development. This includes the coordination of community educational programs, institutes, workshops, conferences, and specialized training programs which serve as a catalyst for economic development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuing Education Unit</head><p>The Continuing Education Unit (CEU) is defined as ten contact hours of participation in a qualified continuing education program. The CEU is recognized as the national standard for measuring an individual's participation in and an institution's production of non-degree programs. The CEU may be used within an institution in at least three ways. First, the CEU serves as a unit of measure to recognize an individual's participation in non-degree activities that meet appropriate criteria. Second, the CEU may serve as the accounting unit of the institution's total non-degree courses, programs, and activities. Third, the implementation of CEU criteria provides the basis for quality assurance in continuing education programming. The University of West Georgia follows the criteria and guidelines as set forth by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.</p><p>.</p></div>

The University began offering courses in the Georgia Power Company's Shenandoah <ref type="bibr">Environment &amp; Education Center in 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">. In 1998</ref> County purchased the Shenandoah Center from Georgia Power as a permanent location for the University's exclusive use. In 2009, the Shenandoah Center was presented as a gift from Coweta County to the University System of Georgia Board of Regents and the University of West Georgia. The University utilized this site in the Shenandoah Industrial Park for 25 years.</p><p>In the summer of 2015, UWG Newnan relocated to 80 Jackson Street in downtown Newnan into the historic Newnan Hospital which was renovated for University use. The $15M project was spearheaded by the City of Newnan in collaboration with Newnan Hospital, Inc., the University of West Georgia, USG Board of Regents, and Coweta County Commission. The new building includes a 120-seat lecture hall, classrooms, computer labs, science labs, seminar rooms, study areas, and nursing skills and simulation labs.</p><p>UWG Newnan offers the following bachelor's degrees: Nursing, Elementary Education, Social and Behavioral Health, Health and Community Wellness, and Interdisciplinary Studies. UWG offers undergraduate courses in the University's core curriculum at UWG Newnan. The renovated facility will provide access to over 3,000 students and allow expansion of current programs and addition of new ones, such as full or partial programs in criminology, undergraduate business, sociology and psychology. Through the ACCEL program, high-performing high school juniors and seniors are encouraged to "Go West Early" and enroll in core classes at UWG Newnan while still in high school.</p><p>UWG also offers graduate degrees in Newnan: Master of Business Administration and the Ed. S. in Educational Leadership.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Proctoring</head><p>UWG Newnan is a test proctoring site for eCore classes, UWG Online, and for online courses from other universities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Academic Policies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Calendar</head><p>The University of West Georgia is on a semester system, with academic credit being awarded at the end of each semester. The fall and spring semesters are approximately 16 weeks and include a final exam period. The summer semester is approximately 10 weeks and is composed of four short sessions: one two week, two four-week, and one seven week. Each session includes a separate final exam period. A student may take up to 18 total hours per semester. For information regarding exceptions granted to complete above 18 hours in a semester, please refer to Academic Load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Credit by Examination</head><p>The Advanced Placement (AP) Program is available through many high schools and enables a high school student to earn credit toward college in a variety of subjects. Usually these courses are equivalent to college freshmen/sophomore-level courses such as American Government, American History, Composition, and so forth. College credit will be awarded based on standardized exams administered at the high schools in mid to late May. High school students who earn AP exam scores of 3 or higher (on a scale of 1-5) on most exams and who submit official score reports to West Georgia's Admissions Office will automatically receive credit for coursework. Scores of 4 or higher are required to receive credit for history exams. The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is offered at West Georgia by appointment and allows persons to earn college credit by achieving appropriate cutoff scores on nationally standardized exams. Exams available cover a range of courses including math, history, government, literature, and sciences. Test registration information is available through the Testing Office (678-839-6435). As with AP testing, CLEP is a great way to earn college credit. Not only will a person save time by not having to take a course containing material he or she already knows, but the student will also save money by not having to pay for a college class. Thus, CLEP enables a student to move through his or her freshman and sophomore years at a faster pace. Departmental Exams. A few of the academic departments at West Georgia also offer the opportunity for credit by examination. The English Department, for example, allows per-sons who feel confident about their writing skills to write an essay evaluated by a depart-mental committee. If a passing credential is earned, the person will be allowed to exempt English 1101 and/or 1102, depending on the score. The Department of International Languages and Cultures also allows students to exempt certain introductory foreign language courses. To receive credit by examination, the student must pay a fee of $6/credit hour fee. Test dates vary, so interested persons should contact the departments (English 678-839-6512; International Languages and Cultures 678-839-6515) for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement Policy (AP)</head><p>Advanced Placement (AP) scores must be reported to the University of West Georgia directly from the College Board. The UWG college code is 5900. More information can be found by visiting the College Board's website at https://apscore.collegeboard.org/scores.</p><p>Please refer to the chart below to determine course equivalency, credit earned, and exemption information.</p><p>Scores of 4 or 5 on AP exams are granted "Honors credit" for the UWG course equivalents. These courses count toward the 10 honors classes required for Honors College graduation. Questions concerning the policy should be directed to the Registrar's Office Transfer Team by emailing transfer@westga.edu or calling <ref type="formula">(678)</ref>  Theatre Theatre HL HL 4-7 THEA 1100 3 *May Consider ART 1008 **Full credit is dependent on departmental review of student's portfolio.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Honor Code</head><p>At West Georgia, the student is expected to achieve and maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and excellence. Not only does academic honesty preserve the integrity of both the student and the institution, but it is also essential in gaining a true education. The West Georgia student, therefore, pledges not to lie, cheat, steal, or engage in plagiarism in the pursuit of his or her studies and is encouraged to report those who do. See Connection and Student Handbook, Appendix E, Academic Dishonesty. The Pledge follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pledge:</head><p>Having read the Honor Code for UWG, I understand and accept my responsibility to uphold the values and beliefs described and to conduct myself in a manner that will reflect the values of the Institution in such a way as to respect the rights of all UWG community members. As a West Georgia student, I will represent myself truthfully and complete all academic assignments honestly. I understand that if I violate this code, I will accept the penalties imposed, should I be found guilty of violations through processes due me as a university community member. These penalties may include expulsion from the University. I also recognize that my responsibility includes willingness to confront members of the University community if I feel there has been a violation of the Honor Code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Load (Course Load Limits)</head><p>Although a typical course load is 15 semester credit hours, a student may register for 18 semester credit hours without special permission (see summer exceptions below). A student on the Dean's List may register for 20 hours without special permission. Students within 30 credit hours of graduation with a cumulative average of 2.0 may carry up to the maximum of 21 credit hours for two semesters without special permission. A student who is required to enroll in Regents' Test remediation may not carry more than 18 credit hours. During the semester of student teaching, students may take one additional course. Students are advised not to take more than 10 credit hours if they work full time. Special permission must be obtained from the appropriate academic dean before any student may exceed loads authorized above. Academic deans may approve course loads of up to 25 semester credit hours in justifiable circumstances.</p><p>Due to varying session lengths for summer semester, the following schedule presents the maximum hours that can be taken by a student without special permission given by his or her dean. The maximum total load permitted for any combination of sessions without the permission of the appropriate dean is 18. If the student attends Session I for 6 hours, they can only enroll in an additional 12 hours total for the remaining sessions. Session Hours Session I 6 Session II 18 Session III or IV 9 (each session) Maximum Load for Summer Term <ref type="bibr">(any combination)</ref> 18</p><p>Please note that some insurance and loan agencies require that students be enrolled full time (12 or more semester hours) in order to qualify for their services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Renewal</head><p>The Academic Renewal policy allows the University of West Georgia degree-seeking students who earned less than a 2.00 cumulative grade point average at the University of West Georgia to have one opportunity to make a fresh start at UWG after an absence of five calendar years from any postsecondary institution. 1. Students must apply for Academic Renewal. 2. All previously attempted coursework continues to be recorded on the student's official transcript. 3. An Academic Renewal Grade Point Average is begun when the student resumes taking coursework following the five-year period of absence once Academic Renewal has been granted. The institution will place a statement on the student's transcript indicating the Academic Renewal status and the beginning of a separate Academic Renewal GPA in addition to an overall UWG GPA. 4. The Academic Renewal GPA will be used for determining academic standing and eligibility for graduation. At least 50% (60 hours) of course work must be completed after the granting of academic renewal for a student to be eligible for graduation with honors. 5. Academic credit for previously completed coursework -including transfer courseworkwill be retained only for courses in which an 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'S' grade was earned. Retained grades are not calculated in the Academic Renewal GPA, but are counted in Academic Renewal hours earned. 6. Transfer credit A. Suspended/dismissed students: a student who has been suspended or dismissed from UWG and has attended one or more System institutions during the period of suspension or dismissal will not be eligible for Academic Renewal. B. Non-suspended/dismissed students: a student who has not been suspended or dis-missed from UWG, but who has been absent from UWG five years or more and who has attended a school other than UWG may choose only one of the following options:</p><p>• A student may return to UWG subject to all relevant transfer and reentry policies. No renewal GPA is calculated and transfer credit will be granted for applicable courses taken during the absence, or</p><p>• A student may apply for Academic Renewal. If Academic Renewal status is approved, no transfer credit will be granted for course work completed during the absence. 1. To earn a degree, a student must meet the University of West Georgia's residency requirements. UWG will apply the retained hours earned prior to Academic Renewal toward the residency requirement. 2. All remaining courses for the current degree objective must be completed at UWG. No transient credit will be accepted. 3. A student can be granted Academic Renewal status only once. 4. Any previous notation of academic probation, suspension, and dismissal will remain recorded on the student's transcript. 5. A student re-enrolling after an absence of five or more years must apply for Academic Renewal within three semesters of enrollment or within one calendar year, whichever comes first. 6. The Academic Renewal GPA begins with the first term following re-enrollment. 7. Admission or re-entry into any specific degree program (such as teacher education, nursing, business majors, selected majors in the College of Arts and Humanities, Science and Mathematics, and Social Sciences) is not automatic. Admission criteria for specific programs are determined by the department where the program is housed. 8. The granting of Academic Renewal does not supersede financial aid policies regarding Satisfactory Academic Progress. 9. United States and Georgia history and constitution requirements and Regents' Test scores met prior to the granting of academic renewal will remain on the student's transcript even though the courses may not count in the Academic Renewal GPA or Academic Renewal hours earned. 10. Students desiring to enroll in a major offered by the College of Education must submit a letter explaining why they should be considered for Academic Renewal along with the Academic Renewal application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standards of Progress</head><p>The University of West Georgia seeks to provide an environment suitable for promoting the systematic pursuit of learning. To ensure this primary goal, the University requires of its students, reasonable academic progress. The retention of those students who repeatedly demonstrate a lack of ability, industry, maturity, and preparation would be inconsistent with this requirement. Students will be evaluated each semester on the basis of cumulative grade point average and the total number of hours attempted. Hours transferred will be included in determining the total hours attempted; however, the cumulative grade point average will be computed only on the work completed at West Georgia (institutional grade point average (GPA)). The academic standing for a semester is not adjusted when a course taken that semester is subsequently repeated during a later semester and the first grade earned is re-moved from the calculation of the grade point average. The cumulative grade point aver-age required for the total number of hours attempted is given below: Hours Attempted Grade Point Average 1-30 1.8 31-60 1.9 61 + hours 2.0 Under the provisions of the academic policies of West Georgia, students are classified as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Warning</head><p>All students who fail to meet academic standards will be on Academic Warning the next semester of enrollment. Students on Academic Warning may be required to meet certain conditions to be eligible to register for future terms. Such conditions may include a reduced course load, meeting with an academic advisor, attending student success seminars, and/or other academic support interventions. There are three possible outcomes from a semester on Academic Warning: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> A student who raises his/her institutional grade point average to meet the Academic Standards outlined above, will be removed from Academic Warning. <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> A student who receives a term GPA of 2.0 but does not raise the institutional GPA enough to meet above standards, will remain on Academic Warning. (3) A student who fails to achieve a semester grade point average of 2.0 while on Academic Warning will be placed on Academic Probation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>All students, who fail to meet the conditions to be removed from or stay on Academic Warning will be placed on Academic Probation the next semester of enrollment. Students on Academic Probation may be required to meet certain conditions to be eligible to register for future terms. Such conditions may include a reduced course load, meeting with an academic advisor, attending student success seminars, and/or other academic support interventions. There are three possible outcomes from a semester on Academic Probation:</p><p>(1) A student who raises his/her institutional grade point average to meet the Academic Standards outlined above, will be removed from Academic Probation. <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> A student who receives a term GPA of 2.0 but does not raise the institutional GPA enough to meet above standards, will remain on Academic Probation. (3) A student who fails to achieve a semester grade point average of 2.0 while on Academic Probation will be placed on Academic Suspension. Once on Probation, a student will not return to Academic Warning, but will remain on Academic Probation unless he/she meets outcome 1 or 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>Students who do not earn a minimum semester grade point average of 2.0 while on Academic Probation regardless of the cumulative GPA will be suspended for one semester. Readmission on probation will be automatically allowed after one semester of suspension. Students on probation who do not make satisfactory progress after returning from an initial suspension will again be suspended, this time for one calendar year. A student who is suspended for the second time may apply for readmission on probation one calendar year from the date of suspension. An Academic Suspension Appeal (term or one year) may only be reviewed through a grade appeal or hardship withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>Students on probation after a second suspension, who do not make a 2.0 on all work at-tempted in each subsequent semester of enrollment regardless of the cumulative GPA will be dismissed. Dismissed students are eligible to return only when they have earned an associate degree or are granted Academic Renewal after a five-year absence from any post-secondary institution. An Academic Dismissal Appeal may only be reviewed through a grade appeal or hardship withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Advising and Course Selection (Course Level Rule)</head><p>Academic advising is considered an important element in a student's program of study, and West Georgia makes every effort to provide the service; however, students must ultimately be responsible for their own choices, their own course and program selections, and their own deadlines. Each student is responsible for completion of all requirements of his or her program. Advisors provide guidance. Any exception to a published program of study is not valid unless specifically authorized in writing by the dean of the college or department chair in which the major is housed. Advisee records are compiled from admissions documents, grades and quality points, and test results.</p><p>Students who have declared a major within the Richards College of Business or the College of Education are assigned to a professional advisor in that college's advising center. Students who have declared a major in the College of Social Sciences are assigned to a professional advisor in the Advising Center. Students who intend to apply to the Nursing Program are advised either in the Tanner Health School of Nursing or in the Advising Center. Students up to 60 credit hours in the College of Science and Math and the College of Arts and Humanities are assigned to a professional advisor in the Advising Center. Students in those colleges with 60 or more credit hours are advised by a faculty member in their department. Dual enrolled students are advising by a professional advisor in the Office of New Student Programs.</p><p>Every undergraduate student must officially declare a major at or before the completion of 60 semester hours (this includes transfer credits). A hold will be placed on registration until a major is declared. It is important that students see their advisors prior to registration each semester. Each student is responsible for contacting his or her individual department to determine specific advisement procedures for that department. Freshmen and sophomores are required to consult with their advisors in order to register.</p><p>Students are advised to select courses appropriate for their classification, i.e., stepping up or down no more than one level of course numbers. For example, a freshman may step up to a 2000-level course or a junior may step down to a 2000-level course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Air Force ROTC</head><p>University of West Georgia students may participate in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps through the ARCHE cross-registration program. It involves an elective curriculum taken alongside required college classes. Students participating in the pro-gram attend Air Force ROTC classes and training taught weekly at the Georgia Institute of Technology on Tuesdays and Thursdays in addition to courses taken to complete a degree at UWG. Students must balance their course schedule to allow for travel time to and from Georgia Tech. Students earn a college degree and an officer's commission in the U.S. Air Force at the same time. A student who completes the Air Force ROTC Program qualifies as a commissioned officer and will be allowed to enter active duty in the U.S. Air Force. Air Force ROTC offers competitive <ref type="bibr">4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, and 2-</ref>year college scholar-ships to qualified college students based on merit. Non-competitive scholarships are also available based on major to include foreign languages. Scholarships vary from $3,000, $9,000, $15,000, all the way up to full tuition and required fees. Scholarship winners also receive a stipend of up to $400 for each academic month in addition to a $900 allowance for books and other educational items. Non-scholarship students also receive the stipend and book allowance as contracted cadets in the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Audit of Courses</head><p>Regulations are listed in the "Auditors" section or Admissions, and in this section under "Grades, Grade Points."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Absence</head><p>Instruction begins the first day of class. In face-to-face courses, if students fail to attend the first day and have not contacted the instructor to explain their absence, they may be dropped during the Drop/Add Period to make room for other students.</p><p>In fully online or hybrid courses each instructor has the authority to specify in the syllabus what qualifies as attendance at the first class meeting and during the Drop/Add Period to drop students who fail to meet that requirement. Instructors may require students to attend a face-to-face meeting, to log in to the online course-delivery system by a specified date, or to take other specified steps at the beginning of the session. For those courses that meet for the first time after the end of the Drop/Add Period, see Faculty Handbook Section 204. Class attendance policies are determined by each instructor for his or her courses and may be found in the syllabus. Since course policies differ, students are responsible for understanding attendance requirements for each course. Failure to comply with those requirements may significantly affect grades.</p><p>Students are expected to attend each class meeting. Students absent from class while officially representing the University or observing religious holidays should generally not be penalized in the calculation of final grades, as long as they provide advance notice and expeditiously make arrangements to complete any missed work.</p><p>University-sponsored activities include but are not limited to the following: intercollegiate athletic competitions; musical/theatrical/art performances or exhibitions associated with a degree program; debate competitions; and research conferences. Activities not considered to be university-sponsored include participation in clubs, even if they are affiliated with UWG, or events associated with social organizations such as fraternities or sororities.</p><p>Regardless of the reason for the absence, each student is responsible for the material covered in class, for completing any assignments, and for making specific arrangements with the instructor for any work missed. The degree to which missed work can be made up will depend upon the nature of the work and its intended purpose. Make-up is at the discretion of the instructor. However instructors should be aware that students missing classes for university-sponsored activities or religious holidays should be given all appropriate courtesies and opportunities to make up missed work. Students are responsible for alerting their professors about any expected absences prior to those absences Any student who must be absent for more than one week of class should notify the Patient Advocates in Health Services, telephone 678-839-6452. The student should also notify the instructor or department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Preparatory Curriculum Deficiencies</head><p>Students who are admitted with College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies in the areas of social science, science, or foreign language are required to complete with a grade of "C" or better one additional course in each area of deficiency (Social Science deficiency is satisfied with ANTH 1102 only). Credit will be given for courses used to satisfy College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies, but such credit may not be used to satisfy Core Curriculum or degree requirements.</p><p>Students with College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies in English must take and clear the English and reading portions of the placement test. Those with College Preparatory Curriculum/Required High School Curriculum Deficiencies in mathematics must take and clear the mathematics portion of the placement test. Students with English and mathematics deficiencies who are required to enter learning support are not admissible.</p><p>Deficiencies in science, social science, or foreign language should be satisfied during the student's first semester of enrollment. CPC/RHSC deficiencies must be completed before the student has earned 30 hours of credit. Students who earn 30 hours of credit and have not satisfied these deficiencies will not be permitted to enroll in any other university-level courses unless the deficiencies are included in their schedules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidentiality of Student Records</head><p>Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, West Georgia has established policies concerning the confidentiality of student educational records. In accordance with the Act, students of West Georgia are notified that, among other rights, they have the right to seek correction of the contents of these records, to place an explanatory note in a record when a challenge is not successful, and to control (with certain exceptions) the disclosure of the contents of their records. For a full statement of the institutional policy regarding confidentiality of student records see Connection and Student Handbook.</p><p>University officials may provide Directory Information concerning a student unless the student files a Non-Disclosure Form with the Enrollment Services Center. This form must be filed annually by September 15 to assure that locater information not be published in the student directory. Directory Information includes name, address, telephone listing, major field of study, dates of attendance, previous institutions attended, degrees and awards received, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, height and weight of members of athletic teams, photograph, and full or parttime status.</p><p>Course Changes (Drop-Add, Grade for Course Withdrawals) Routine changes in the student's schedule must be made during the scheduled adjustment/drop/add periods for the semester or term. The precise deadlines can be found in the university academic calendar.</p><p>Except for Learning Support courses and Regents' Test remediation, a student may withdraw up to the midpoint of the semester without academic penalty. A grade of W is entered for such withdrawals. Except for cases approved by the dean of the college offering the withdrawn course, the only grade which is given after the mid-semester deadline is WF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit by Prior Learning (CPL)</head><p>1. Prospective students who fit the following criteria are eligible to participate in CPL: a) They are adults; typically, 25 years of age or older. b) They are non-traditional students. c) They have learning experiences that could be reflected in an academic program's curriculum. 2. Course credit via CPL by Portfolio may not replace existing credit assessments. Course credit acquired through these means cannot be used to satisfy the minimum number of hours that must be completed in residence at UWG, nor toward minimum hours in the major field (See SACS 3.5.2, and University catalog requirements for undergraduate degrees). 3. Students may not conduct PLA by departmental examination, standardized test, or portfolio for any courses for which they have previously completed at UWG as a regular or audit student. 4. Students are required to complete CPL Prior Learning Documentation in preparation for developing portfolio(s) for credit evaluation, preferably prior to their last semester. Students will earn two hours credit and a letter grade of A-F for this course. 5. Students must register for Portfolio Assessment in the appropriate department(s) in the term that they will submit a portfolio for evaluation. 6. Credit may be awarded after the first submission, in which case the student will be notified that credit has been granted. The assessors may specifically outline areas for improvement and allow students to resubmit their documentation one time during the next semester. The assessors will provide a report giving specific feedback to students. Students may resubmit a revised portfolio only once for re-assessment, and must include the original portfolio submission and previous assessor's feedback. 7. Individual departments determine how many, if any, CPL credits may be awarded. 8. Students may appeal the outcome of the CPL assessment through the University's Grade Appeal process. 9. Students can pursue Credit for Prior Learning through a variety of pathways, to include CLEP exams, departmental exams, and portfolio assessment. Portfolio assessment is available for select courses and cannot be used for courses for which CLEP and/or departmental exams are available Dean's List Students who achieve a grade point ratio of 3.5 on a minimum of 12 semester hours of college level courses in which grades of A-F are given are placed on the Dean's List for that semester.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeal</head><p>Students have the right to appeal a course grade. Grade appeals must be submitted in writing, using the UWG Student Grade Appeal Form found on the Registrar's website at https://www.westga.edu/student-services/registrar/forms.php and following the procedures outlined below. All grade appeals, regardless of their nature, shall be initiated no later than the following semester after cause for the appeal occurred and concluded no later than one year (12 calendar months) after the assignment of the grade. There are two types of grade appeals:</p><p>1. Dishonesty Grade Appeal -If the faculty member assigned the grade due to an allegation of cheating, plagiarism, or some other act of academic dishonesty and the student wishes to pursue the appeal, his or her case should be considered a Dishonesty Grade Appeal. Appeals of grades assigned due to an allegation of Academic Dishonesty may be made as soon as a grade penalty on the grounds of academic dishonesty has been levied against a student. 2. Grade Determination Appeal -If the reasons underlying the appeal are based on policy disagreements or alleged charges of arbitrary or unfair treatment by the involved faculty member, the appeal should be considered a Grade Determination Appeal. Grade determination appeals must be initiated during the semester immediately following the semester in which the course grade is assigned.</p><p>c. If the appeal is granted, the Dean's Office submits the grade change in writing to the Registrar. d. If the appeal is denied, the student may accept the decision and end the appeal process, or s/he may request that the appeal and all associated documentation be forwarded to the Provost's office for submission to the Grade Appeals Subcommittee. 4. Grade Appeals Subcommittee Level: An appeal forwarded to the Provost's office for referral to the Grade Appeals Subcommittee should include the Student Grade Appeal Form (complete information, decisions indicated, and signatures/initials from the student, Chair, and Dean/designee), documentation, and decision statements from the previous levels. a. The subcommittee's review purpose is described here: Dishonesty Grade Appeals: The purpose of the subcommittee in hearing this type of appeal is to (1) determine if academic improprieties did take place and (2) to re-view the appropriateness of the faculty member's corrective action as it related to the final grade assignment. Grade Determination Appeals: The purpose of the subcommittee in hearing this type of appeal is to review the totality of the student's performance in relationship to his or her final grade. b. The chairperson of the subcommittee will submit in writing to the Provost/designee the conclusions and recommendations of the subcommittee. If the appeal is granted, the Provost's office submits the grade change in writing to the Registrar and notifies the student that the appeal is granted. If the decision of the subcommittee is to return the appeal to the department for further action, it is the responsibility of the Department Chair to follow through with the instructions of the subcommittee. The Provost/designee notifies the student that the appeal was returned to the department for further action. After re-examining the student's performance, the Department Chair notifies the student of the final grade and notifies the Registrar of a grade change, if warranted. If the appeal is denied, the student is notified of the subcommittee's decision. c. In unusual circumstances, the Provost/designee may review the decision of the sub-committee for further action (e.g., judicial sanctions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fairness and Procedural Safeguards Governing Cases of Academic Dishonesty</head><p>In order to guarantee fairness and proper procedural safeguards for all concerned, the subcommittee shall be guided by the following procedures:</p><p>1. The subcommittee will hear a case only if the student has exhausted all administrative remedies through the appropriate department chair and his or her college dean 2. The subcommittee chairperson will consult with both the faculty member and student concerning the hearing procedures, the time, date, and place of the hearing and will ensure relevant materials reach all parties in a timely fashion. 3. The burden of demonstrating a preponderance of evidence shall rest upon the officials or faculty member who originated an action against a student or assigned for cause a particular grade.</p><p>4. The student appearing before the committee shall have the right to be assisted by an advisor of his or her choice. 5. During the hearing the student shall have the opportunity to testify and to present evidence and witnesses own his or her behalf. He or she shall have opportunity to hear and question adverse witnesses. In no case shall the subcommittee consider statements against a student unless the student has been given an opportunity to rebut unfavorable inferences that might otherwise be drawn. 6. All matters upon which a decision will be based must be introduced at the proceeding before the subcommittee. Any conclusions drawn by the subcommittee shall be based solely upon such evidence. 7. In the absence of a transcript, an audio recording of the hearing shall be made. 8. Appellants who fail to appear after proper notice will have their cases heard in absentia. 9. The chairperson of the subcommittee will submit in writing to the Provost/designee the conclusions and recommendations of the subcommittee. 10. See the Board of Regents Policy Manual for more information.</p></div>

Grades, Grade Points The following grading system is used: This symbol indicates that a student was doing satisfactory work, but, for non-academic reasons beyond his or her control, was unable to meet the full requirements of the course. A student must remove an "I" grade during the succeeding semester of enrollment or within one year, which-ever comes first; otherwise, the grade will be changed to "F". An instructor who assigns a grade of "I" must submit with the final grade two copies of a statement indicating the level of performance (A,B,C,D) excluding the missed work and the work that must be done to remove the "I" grade. The Registrar's Office files one copy in the student's permanent record and sends one to the appropriate department chair. The instructor retains a copy. It is the responsibility of the student receiving the "I" grade to see the instructor or department chair (if the instructor is not available) regarding the work to be completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WM-</head><p>This symbol indicates a student was permitted to withdraw under the Board of Regents policy for military service refunds. The use of this symbol indicates that this student was permitted to withdraw without penalty at any time during the term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>W-</head><p>(Withdrew Passing)-This symbol indicates that the student withdrew by midpoint of the semester or the term the course was offered (excluding final examinations). Except in cases of hardship that are approved by the appropriate college dean, students may not withdraw with a grade of W after the midpoint of the total grading period. A course in which the W is received is not included in the calculation of the grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WF-</head><p>Withdrew, Failing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S-</head><p>This symbol indicates that credit has been given for completion of degree requirements other than academic course work. The use of this symbol is approved for thesis hours, student teaching, clinical practicum, internship, proficiency requirements in graduate programs, and a few other courses authorized by the Chancellor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U-</head><p>This symbol indicates unsatisfactory performance in an attempt to complete degree requirements other than academic course work. The use of this symbol is approved for thesis hours, student teaching, clinical practicum, internship, proficiency requirements in graduate programs, and a few other courses authorized by the Chancellor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V-</head><p>This symbol indicates that a student was given permission to audit a course. The audit student is regarded as an official visitor for the purpose of reserving a seat in a course. Students may not transfer from audit to credit status or vice versa. (Additional information is available in Chapter IV, "Auditors.") K-This symbol indicates that a student was given credit for the course via a credit by examination program approved by West Georgia (CLEP, AP, Proficiency, etc.). The institution grade point average is calculated by dividing the number of hours scheduled in courses attempted in which a grade of A,B,C,D,F, or WF was received into the number of grade points earned on those hours scheduled with adjustments for repeated courses according to the policies in place when the course was initially attempted. A grade of WF counts as an F. GPA's are truncated, not rounded up. The institution grade point average is recorded on the student's permanent record. Remedial credit shall in no way affect the institutional grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation with Honors</head><p>The University of West Georgia awards baccalaureate degrees with honors to those undergraduates which have a minimum GPA of 3.50 on all courses attempted. For students who repeat courses for grade replacement, both courses will be calculated into the honors GPA. Those candidates who have transferred from other institutions will qualify for honors if they attain an honors grade point average on all work attempted at UWG and combined total of all courses attempted at UWG and other institutions. Baccalaureate degrees are awarded with honors based on the following grade point average range for all courses attempted: 3.50 -3.79 GPA -honors (cum laude) 3.80 -3.89 GPA -high honors (magna cum laude) 3.90 -4.00 GPA -highest honors (summa cum laude) Because grades are not official until after the commencement ceremony, the initial honors designation is based on the student's honors GPA at the end of the semester prior to the graduating semester. Students who have not met the GPA requirements to be designated as an honors recipient at the time of commencement will not be allowed to walk as an honors recipient or to purchase honors cords from the University Bookstore. Official honors designation will be determined after the commencement ceremony when term grades are official and the honors GPA is recalculated. GPAs are truncated to the second decimal place and will not be rounded (example, a 3.49 will not be rounded to a 3.50). Students who graduate with honors will have their honors status (cum laude, etc.) notated on their official academic transcript and their diploma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hardship Withdrawal Policy</head><p>A Hardship Withdrawal is an exception that permits a student to withdraw from all courses after the official Drop/Add period during the semester. It is intended for the student who has experienced an acute, traumatic event that prevents him/her from completing the semester. That same event also makes it impossible for the student to take an I (incomplete) and finish the work the next semester. Thus, the Hardship Withdrawal is based on unusual or emergency circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances are categorized as follows: Physical</p><p>• Examples include bodily injury or invasive surgery resulting in prolonged absences from class, or unexpected physical disability preventing completion of course work. Necessary documentation to support such claims would include a physician's report, including name, address, phone, nature of illness or accidents, dates of treatment, prognosis, and recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological</head><p>• Examples include extreme mental duress suffered from traumatic experiences, of the severity and frequency to prevent completion of course work. Necessary documentation to support such claims would include a memo from a Counseling Center counselor that includes dates of treatment and a clear recommendation of whether a hardship withdrawal be given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal</head><p>• Examples include significant change in financial status or personal tragedy such as the death of a loved one or domestic disruptions, to the degree to prevent completion of coursework. Necessary documentation to support such claims might include copy of divorce papers, financial statements, police reports, obituaries, or other pertinent documents. The following list is illustrative of invalid reasons for a hardship withdrawal. A request using these reasons will not be approved.</p><p>• Retroactive Hardship Withdrawals will not be approved for terms occurring more than six months prior to the time the request is made. 2. The student must withdraw from all classes during the current term, and may not select only certain classes from which to withdraw.</p><p>• Under unusual circumstances, a student may be granted a hardship withdrawal from only one class, while being allowed to remain in others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>An example of unusual circumstances would be a student who is passing an applied piano course and injures a finger, thus being unable to play the piano the rest of the semester. A student would be allowed to complete other courses being taken concurrently. Students should be aware of the following four points when a hardship withdrawal is approved:</p><p>• A hardship withdrawal does not remove courses from the academic record. Course grades are converted to W's for the hardship withdrawal semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The W grades do not count against the overall grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The W grades trigger a Financial Aid Warning, because none of the courses in the hardship withdrawal semester are completed. See the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy for financial aid eligibility at https://www.westga.edu/studentservices/financialaid/satisfactory-academic-progress.php for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Students who are granted a hardship withdrawal do not receive refunds of expenditures associated with the hardship withdrawal term. See this link for information on how to request a hardship withdrawal: https://www.westga.edu/administration/vpaa/assets/docs/facultyresources/Hardship_Withdrawal_Form__RevNov2016_Fillable.pdf.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Studies</head><p>Some departments may offer independent studies, directed readings, and individual research projects. These are not substitutes for scheduled courses (though department chairs may authorize such substitutions in exceptional circumstances). When offered, independent studies are intended to provide students who are well advanced in their majors with the opportunity to explore research projects on their own with limited faculty supervision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limited Course Withdrawals</head><p>Undergraduate students may withdraw from courses with a grade of "W" (Withdraw Passing) a maximum of six times during their entire undergraduate enrollment at the University of West Georgia. Students must withdraw from courses during the Withdrawal "W" Period, as noted on the Registrar's Calendar in The Scoop. Retroactive withdrawals for prior terms are not permitted. The Withdrawal "W" Period typically begins after Drop/Add and closes at mid-term. Grades of "W" do not count toward the grade point average. It is recommended that students consult with the instructor, academic advisor, Financial Aid, Bursar, and International Student Admissions and Programs (if applicable) before making the decision to withdraw from a course, since undesirable consequences may follow. For example:</p><p>• Student athletes must maintain full-time status to retain athletic eligibility • International students on an F1 or J1 visa must maintain full-time status to protect their immigration status • Withdrawing from a course will delay progress toward graduation Students who attempt to withdraw from a course after reaching their maximum of six withdrawals will continue to be enrolled and will receive a grade at the end of the term, unless the Dean (or Dean's designee) approves the exception. See Petition for Exceptions below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Automatic Exceptions</head><p>The following exceptions do not count toward the maximum of six course withdrawals: After the limit of six withdrawals is reached, students are permitted to request exceptions only for circumstances beyond their control. Students appeal in writing to the Dean (or Dean's designee) of the college or school that houses their major. Undeclared students should appeal in writing to the Dean of the Honors College (or Dean's designee). The written request (typewritten) should include the following: (1) description of the exact nature of the appeal, (2) reason for the appeal, and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> supporting documentation, if applicable. Appeals are not heard unless the student has reached the maximum number of withdrawals allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Orientation</head><p>To assist new students in becoming adjusted to college life as quickly as possible, West Georgia conducts an orientation program which consists of testing, preregistration advisement, special lectures, and social gatherings. All new students are required to participate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical Education Policy</head><p>University policy allows each of the three colleges to set its own physical education requirements. For this catalog year, the requirements are as follows:</p><p>• The College of Arts and Humanities has no physical education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The College of Education requires 3 hours of physical education that must include one 2hour Health and Wellness course and one 1-hour activity course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The College of Business has no physical education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The Tanner Health System School of Nursing has no physical education requirement. All students are required to satisfy the physical education requirements of the college from which they graduate (not the college in which the student was first admitted as a degree candidate). The physical education activity requirement will be waived for veterans with two years of active military duty. No PWLA course credit may be applied toward the number of academic hours required for a degree. For detailed requirements and exceptions, see the specific degree program description section of the catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration</head><p>Registration for a future semester is held for continuing students and new fully admitted graduate students during the preceding semester. Course listings are available on Banweb, http://banweb.westga.edu/under Public Access, Class Bulletin. The Scoop gives detailed instructions for registering and paying fees. Late Registration is held during the drop/add period of the semester. A $75 late fee is charged to continuing students who did not participate in on-time registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating a Course to Replace a Grade</head><p>A student may repeat a course taken at West Georgia in order to replace an earlier grade earned in a course taken Fall 1996 or later. Grades earned in courses taken at other institutions cannot replace grades earned in courses taken at the University of West Georgia. In the case of courses with variable course titles, the repeated course must have the exact same title as the original course. Beginning Summer Semester 2001, students can repeat <ref type="bibr">XIDS 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">XIDS , 2002</ref>, and 2100 and use the grade replacement rules regardless of the titles of the courses taken. The academic standing and graduation GPA will be based on the last attempt at all courses taken at the institution. Note that the original grade remains on the transcript, although it is not included in the GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Classification</head><p>Student classification is based on the number of earned semester hours of academic credit. The classifications are as follows: Freshman 0-29 earned semester hours Sophomore 30-59 Junior 60-89 Senior 90 or more</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>The University offers a range of study abroad options for students at all levels of their academic careers. Freshman and sophomore students may participate in short-term programs that offer corelevel courses; juniors and seniors may participate in programs lasting from two weeks to a year that offer specialized coursework in their majors. Students may select programs taught in English or may participate in language immersion programs in Spanish, French and German. The Office of Education Abroad provides advising to help each student choose the program and coursework that best fits his or her academic needs and interests. Short-term program offerings vary from year to year, and students should visit the study abroad website (http://studyabroad.westga.edu) or the Office of Education Abroad for a complete list of opportunities. Many short-term programs are designed for students who have not traveled extensively and provide a mix of classroom instruction and site-specific field trips, with airfare, housing and some meals usually included in the program fee. For upperclassmen interested in specialized semester-long programs, the university offers exchange programs in several European countries, in South America and in Australia. Exchange students generally pay on-campus tuition and fees while studying at the exchange partner institution. Students who participate in study abroad programs or semester exchanges may apply their current financial aid, including Hope scholarship funds, to their study abroad program fees. In addition, students may apply for study abroad scholarships through the study abroad website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology Access Policy</head><p>The University of West Georgia requires all students to have ready access to a computer as students will be expected to use a computer for coursework. Purchasing a new or used computer is recommended but not required. The University provides some computer labs on campus; however, access to these labs at times may be limited. Students are responsible for making plans necessary for timely completion of their class assignments. All students must have access to email, word processing, spreadsheet, and web browsing software. For more details on what is recommended see the TechLife Website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer of Credit</head><p>See section titled Transfer Students, for regulations regarding transfer of credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transient Student Status</head><p>Students wishing to complete classes at another college or university to count toward their degree at the University of West Georgia (UWG) must maintain good academic standing at UWG and hold active student status at UWG for the transient term. Prior to taking the course(s), students must complete a Transient Status Permission Form, which includes the signatures of their advisor, the chair of the department in which the credit shall be granted, and the dean/designee of their major college. If the transient status involves study abroad, students must also obtain the signature of the Director of Education Abroad. International students must also obtain the signature of the Director of International Services and Programs. It is each student's responsibility to consult the Undergraduate Transfer Student Policy, Transfer Course Equivalency Tool on the Registrar's website, or contact the Registrar's Office to determine if the course will be accepted as transfer credit at UWG. Grades earned in courses taken as a transient student do not replace previous grades earned in courses taken at UWG, and duplicate credit will not be awarded. Transient status is given for one semester at a time, and students must have the host institution send an official transcript of the completed coursework to the Registrar's Office at UWG in order to receive credit for the coursework. For final term transient status restrictions, see Graduation Policies in the Undergraduate Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-Year College Graduates/Former Students</head><p>Students who have been academically suspended or dismissed from West Georgia may, as two-year graduates of accredited colleges or universities, be readmitted as degree candidates. This is a onetime option. A minimum of 60 academic hours after the associate degree with at least a 2.0 grade point average is required for the bachelor's degree. Students accepted as transients from a two-year college to complete one or more courses needed for graduation at a two-year college will not be permitted to complete other work while enrolled as transients, or to include the transient credit in the 60 hours of work required at West Georgia.</p><p>The following notation shall be placed on the official transcript of two-year, college graduates readmitted to West Georgia: "Readmitted as two-year college graduate; must complete a minimum of 60 additional hours with at least a 2.0 average for a bachelor's degree."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The University Year and Definition of a Credit Hour</head><p>The University is organized on the semester system. There are two semesters of approximately 15 weeks, a three-week term in May, and summer semesters of approximately four and eight weeks. The University of West Georgia grants one semester hour of credit for work equivalent to a minimum of one hour (50 minutes) of in-class or other direct faculty instruction AND two hours of student work outside of class per week for approximately fifteen weeks. For each course, the course syllabus will document the amount of in-class (or other direct faculty instruction) and out-of-class work required to earn the credit hour(s) assigned to the course. Out-of-class work will include all forms of credit-bearing activity, including but not limited to assignments, readings, observations, and musical practice. Where available, the university grants academic credit for students who verify via competency-based testing, that they have accomplished the learning outcomes associated with a course that would normally meet the requirements outlined above (e.g. AP credit, CLEP, and departmental exams).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U.S. and Georgia History and Constitution Requirements</head><p>USG institutions shall give instruction in the history of the United States, in the history of Georgia, and in the essentials of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia. No undergraduate student shall receive a certificate of graduation or a degree without successfully completing course-work or passing a satisfactory examination on the history of the United States, the history of Georgia, and the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia.</p><p>Students may meet these requirements by passing HIST 2111 or HIST 2112 and POLS 1101 at West Georgia. The U.S. and Georgia history requirements may also be satisfied by passing examinations developed by the History Department and administered by the Testing Office. The Georgia Constitution requirement may also be satisfied by passing an examination developed by the Political Science Department and administered by the Testing Office. Transfer students who have fulfilled any or all of these requirements will be notified of that fact at the time of admission on the "Evaluation of Transfer Credit" form. Students transferring from institutions outside the state of Georgia who receive credit for HIST 2111 or HIST 2112 and/or POLS 1101 will not have satisfied the Georgia history and constitution requirements. The Georgia history and constitution requirements can be satisfied by passing examinations administered each semester by the Testing Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal</head><p>Formal withdrawal from the University must begin with a written request to the Registrar's Office. At the time the request is presented, specific instructions are given to the student for the completion of formal withdrawal. Failure to officially withdraw may result in grades of F for the semester. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Policies</head><p>The University of West Georgia awards degrees three times a year corresponding with the end of each semester and only to the students who have applied and who are meeting all graduation requirements at the time final grades are posted. How to Apply:</p><p>Students should submit the Undergraduate Application for Graduation along with the $40 (per degree) application fee to the Enrollment Services Center, first floor Parker Hall by the appropriate deadline listed below.</p><p>Spring Graduation -October 1 Summer Graduation -March 1 Fall Graduation -August 1</p><p>The graduation application and $40 (per degree) non-refundable application fee can be deferred up to one year from the initial term of scheduled graduation. For example, a student who applies for spring 2017 graduation would have until spring 2018 to graduate without having to complete another application for graduation or pay the $40 (per degree) graduation fee. If the student does not graduate within one year from the original scheduled graduation date, the student must reapply for graduation and pay the $40 (per degree) application fee again.</p><p>Graduation Policies: 1. Candidates may choose to meet the degree requirements of the current catalog or any catalog within six years prior to graduation, provided that the candidate was enrolled in the degree program during the year of the catalog chosen. 2. A student's graduation will be delayed one semester if:</p><p>• all incomplete (I) grades are not removed and a grade recorded in the Registrar's Office by the grade deadline of the term in which the student is graduating;</p><p>• transient, study abroad, credit by exam or any other type of credit is not recorded in the Registrar's Office by the grade deadline of the term in which the student is scheduled to graduate;</p><p>• the student is not meeting graduation requirements after grades are posted for the term in which the student is scheduled to graduate. 3. Students are encouraged to attend graduation. If attendance is not possible, the student should notify the Registrar's Office. A student may participate in only one graduation ceremony per degree earned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation on specific course hours which can be used to meet graduation requirements</head><p>A maximum of 6 credit hours total of military science, debate practicum (COMM 1115) and applied music/ensemble courses (for non-music majors and minors) can be applied toward a degree.</p><p>No PWLA course credit may be applied toward the number of academic hours required for a degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors/Embedded Certificates</head><p>Minors and embedded certificates consist of a group of academic courses that complement the student's degree program. Each gives the student the opportunity to gain limited knowledge of a specific subject area and therefore supplements the academic study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Certificate in Public History</head><p>This Certificate introduces West Georgia students to the interdisciplinary field of public history and provides students with specific training to be successful in the field. The completion of this Certificate program gives students an edge in today's highly competitive job market. The training for the Certificate encourages students to engage in interdisciplinary research and community outreach activities.</p><p>Public historians are historians who "do history outside of the academy," whether in a museum, historical society, archives, historic preservation office, or other type of local or regional history association or organization. This Certificate introduces students to these careers and begins building skillsets in addition to those gained as part of the student's major. Students who engage in public history training build intercultural awareness and aptitude as community bridgebuilders; these are less tangible traits but ones that are crucial to students' future civic life.</p><p>The Certificate program is open to all UWG undergraduate students interested in career opportunities in this field. Because public history is interdisciplinary, students from a variety of fields may see the opportunity for potential careers in this field, including not only history but art history, studio art, anthropology, business, marketing, English, and other humanities fields. Regardless of your major, this Certificate will provide training for participants in areas such as career preparation, professionalism, and work experience. </p></div>

Students will have the opportunity to learn many skills, including but not limited to the following:</p><p>• how community and social factors contribute to a variety of public health solutions and policies; • how to plan, implement, and administer social service and/or behavioral health programs; • how to design, evaluate, and assess social service and/or behavioral health programs to ensure their quality and effectiveness; • how to work with individuals in community or social services settings; • and how to help people navigate the healthcare system to find the resources they need to be healthy. Instead, like almost all other honors colleges in the United States, the Honors College offers a distinctive curriculum featuring two types of courses -special sections of courses required in the core curriculum and junior and senior seminars. Because Honors classes are small, they typically provide more opportunities for discussion and more individual attention than is possible in the regular curriculum. Honors courses are designed to offer more opportunities for research in preparation for graduate or professional school; consequently, they are more challenging, and they do place more responsibility on the individual student. The Honors College is open to students in all undergraduate degree programs offered by the University.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors College Learning Environment and Outcomes</head><p>The Honors College enables undergraduate students to realize their full potential through academic rigor and scholarship, leadership development and community engagement.</p><p>The Honors College of the University of West Georgia is designed for highly motivated students who have demonstrated superior academic achievement and express a desire to continue on that path. Students accepted into the Honors College become immersed in a learning community, where they are expected to be actively engaged in an ongoing, interactive learning process with likeminded faculty and peers, both in and out of the classroom. To support and nurture such an environment, Honors classes are small, seminar-based, and taught by faculty members approved by the Honors College. Honors course work differs from general course work in both breadth and depth of exploration of subject matter, and as much as possible, inclusion of primary sources of information. Honors students are expected to exhibit and further develop genuine emotional and cognitive engagement in the learning process and reflect on the meaning of what they are learning in their own and others' lives, including a consideration of ethical ramifications when applicable. Ultimately, the goal of the program is to produce young adults who will become leaders and serve as transformation agents among their peers, in the campus community, and in the larger social world. To this end, all courses in the Honors College will incorporate one or more of the following learning outcomes:</p><p>• Students will demonstrate the ability to examine topics and issues from diverse perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Students will demonstrate the ability to engage in higher order abstract, creative and critical thinking. •</p><p>Students will demonstrate the ability to explore, and if feasible, experiment with possible applications of their learning toward the solution of "real world" problems. •</p><p>Students will demonstrate the ability to explore and conduct discipline-specific independent research and creative activities using a variety of resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Students will demonstrate superior oral and written communication skills. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Select Students</head><p>The Select Student Program is intended for students who have demonstrated superior scholastic achievement and who wish to pursue advanced course work in an individualized curriculum in their majors under the guidance of their department chairs. A student who attains a 3.75 or above grade point average in the first 40-60 academic hours of credit at West Georgia is eligible to apply for the program. A Select Student must maintain a minimum cumulative average of 3.2.</p><p>A student seeking Select Student status must be recommended by his major department chair or the Honors College Committee and approved by the Office of the Honors College Dean. Students must make application to the department chair by the time they have earned 90 hours and obtain approval of specialized curriculum. A student completing the program will have Select Student designation recorded on the transcript. A Select Student may:</p><p>• take advanced courses without prerequisite; • take designated courses which allow credit by validation for lower level courses; • elect to substitute other courses for three credit hours of physical education activity courses; • design with the chair of the major department a special course of study to meet major requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Presidential Scholarships</head><p>Presidential Scholarships are funded by donations to the University managed by the University of West Georgia Foundation. They are intended primarily to reward incoming freshmen who have demonstrated superior academic ability in high school and potential for academic success at the University. These scholarships are renewed annually for four years or eight semesters, provided that the students continue to meet established Honors College academic criteria and remain on track to complete the Honors College curriculum requirements. For more detailed information, please contact the Honors College, Honors House, 678-839-0628.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>National Scholarships and Fellowships</head><p>The Office of Undergraduate Research and the Honors College support all UWG students in application for national scholarships and fellowships, including Fulbright, Gilman, Goldwater, Madison, Truman, and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU). We work with students through the entire application process, from identifying national awards that fit their goals, to writing application essays, to obtaining appropriate letters of recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Research</head><p>All undergraduate students have the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research. Undergraduate research is defined as an inquiry, investigation, or creative endeavor by an undergraduate student that enhances the student's knowledge or advances the student's creative abilities and contributes in a meaningful way to the student's chosen discipline. Collaborative research projects allow students to further explore their areas of interest through hands-on work with faculty members. Undergraduate research is not limited to laboratory and scientific settings, although there are many opportunities for research in these areas. New discoveries and contributions can also be made in literature, social sciences, education, business, creative arts, and nursing, which also provide exciting avenues for experiential learning. There are also interdisciplinary opportunities, and students may explore research endeavors in areas outside of their major and/or minor.</p></div>

Although, the international community has committed itself to the prevention of genocide as reflected in the famous expression "Never again!," the rhetoric commitment has not been matched by consistent action. Accordingly, there have been cases of the commission of genocidal crimes as a recurring phenomenon-from the Holocaust to Sudan's Darfur region.
