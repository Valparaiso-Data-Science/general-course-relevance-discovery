<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEGREES AND PROGRAMS</head><p>a second bachelor's degree or are interested in non--degree seeking or certificate programs are also encouraged to apply through the Office of Admission (contact information listed above).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRADITIONAL FIRST--YEAR STUDENT ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS</head><p>The admissions committee makes decisions based upon a careful review of each application. To be considered for admission to Carlow as a traditional undergraduate student, applicants must present satisfactory evidence of the ability to achieve at the college level. In general, students should:</p><p>• Follow a college preparatory curriculum in high school (18 units of academic preparation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Have a B average (preferred).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Have satisfactory scores on the SAT/ACT/CLT. Old and new SAT scores (if applicable) will be concorded based on College Board recommendations. High school and/or home school coursework is one of the most important factors in admissions, particularly to more selective programs. It is strongly recommended that all students follow a college preparatory curriculum throughout high school. Those applying to science or nursing programs should complete both algebra II and chemistry, with trigonometry and advanced sciences also strongly recommended. The Carlow University Admissions Committee recognizes that school curricula greatly varies, and will consider favorably the application of an academically able student whose preparation and experience differs from the traditional college preparatory program. Carlow will superscore SAT, ACT, or CLT exams for admission and scholarship review. In other words, the Admissions Committee will use the applicant's highest subcomponent scores to create a new composite score. Students scoring below 990 on the SAT, 19 on the ACT, or 64 on the CLT are strongly encouraged to re--test, especially if they are interested in qualifying for selective academic programs and/or for significant merit scholarships. Some programs have established an SAT/ACT/CLT threshold. Old and new SAT scores (if applicable) will be concorded based on College Board recommendations. Prospective nursing candidates must possess a minimum 3.00 cumulative high school GPA, scored 1060 or higher on the SAT (taken after March 2016) or 21 or higher on the ACT or 68 or higher on the CLT, and have completed strong science and math courses (preferably with a grade of B or better in each). The Pennsylvania State Board of Nursing requires that applicants accepted into professional nursing programs must have completed, as a minimum, four units of English, three units of social sciences, two units of mathematics (one must be algebra), and two units of lab science, including chemistry. ADMISSIONS AND SCHOLARSHIP DEADLINES Carlow operates on a rolling admissions basis, accepting applications from incoming first--year students through August. Due to space limitations in some programs, such as nursing, students are strongly encouraged to complete the application process as soon as possible during their senior year to ensure maximum consideration for admission and scholarships/financial aid. ADVANCED PLACEMENT AND PLACEMENT TESTS Incoming first--year students who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations, or any college--level courses prior to enrolling at Carlow University, must submit their official exam scores and/or official college transcripts to the Office of Admission in a timely manner to assure proper credit evaluation and course registration. TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS Admission to Carlow University is determined on an individual basis. SAT/ACT/CLT scores are not required for transfer students, but may be one of the factors considered for students with minimal college credits. Carlow accepts transfer credits from institutions recognized as an institution of higher education or accredited by a regional accrediting association recognized by the Council of Higher Education Accreditation. We will make every attempt to utilize the academic credits students earned with those of Carlow's curriculum and standards. A transfer course evaluation will be completed to approximate if and how courses will transfer. Grades must be a C or above in 100--level or higher courses to be transferred. Developmental courses at the 100--level do not transfer. See page 49 for more on Transfer of Credits. REQUIRED GPA Students transferring to Carlow for programs in:</p><p>• Biology with Master of Science in Cardiovascular Perfusion accelerated option must have a minimum 3.5 GPA and cumulative 3.5 GPA in the sciences. • Behavioral Neuroscience with Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring (IONM) must have a minimum 3.0 GPA and a cumulative 3.0 GPA in the sciences. • Education must have a minimum 3.0 GPA. If the student is transferring 48 or more credits, he/she must also have successfully passed PAPA I or CORE ETS. • Nursing must have a minimum 3.25 GPA with appropriate coursework. • Pre--Nursing must have a minimum 3.0 GPA. • Respiratory Care must have a minimum 2.5 GPA. • All other programs require a minimum 2.0 GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHEN TO TRANSFER</head><p>• BSN program-Spaces are limited and highly competitive; early application is recommended. • RN--to--BSN-Students may apply anytime for spring or fall admission. • All other programs-We operate on a rolling admissions basis for transfers, typically through August each year for the fall semester, and through December for the spring, or as long as space allows. However, students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. GUEST STUDENTS Guest students are those who wish to register for coursework but who are not admitted to a program of study. Guest students are not eligible for financial aid or academic recognition; they are subject to the rules and regulations of the university. Guest students are limited to a maximum of 12 credits and may not exceed more than two classes per semester. Those interested in being a guest student should contact the Office of the Registrar. PROVISIONAL ADMISSION Occasionally, an applicant is admitted to an undergraduate program as a provisionally admitted student. Provisional admission is granted to an applicant who does not fully meet all of the admissions criteria, but for whom we believe there is a strong possibility for academic success. As a condition of provisional admission, students are limited to 12--14 credits for their first semester, and must attend mandatory meetings with their academic advisor and the Center for Academic Achievement (CAA). Students will have the opportunity to work with their advisors to schedule future semesters. CONDITIONAL ADMISSION Occasionally, an applicant is conditionally admitted to an undergraduate program. This occurs when final official documentation is still needed in order to be fully admitted to the university. Conditional admission is based on the student's ability to provide us with one or more final official transcripts or official standardized test scores, or any other required documentation as requested by the Office of Admissions. Once received, the student will be fully admitted to Carlow. As a conditionally admitted student, registration for the following semester and financial aid are held until a student is fully admitted to the university.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RE--ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY</head><p>Re--admission procedures have been established for the following categories of students:</p><p>• Any student who attended Carlow as a matriculated student and withdrew before completing a degree • Any student who has not attended Carlow for a period of four semesters, including the summer terms • Any student academically dismissed, please see the section: RE--ADMISSION AFTER A DISMISSAL.

PRIVATE ALTERNATIVE LOANS There are many private loans that may be used for educational expenses. A list of loans used most frequently by Carlow students can be found at www.elmstreet.com, but students are free to use any lender they choose. Interest rates and terms of the loans vary by lender and the borrower's credit history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS</head><p>The U.S. Department of Education requires institutions to apply the Return of Title IV Funds policy for students withdrawing from the university who received Title IV financial aid and who did not complete at least 60% of the semester. The Title IV programs include Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, Federal Direct Student Loans, and Federal Direct PLUS Loans. The federal refund policy is separate from Carlow University's tuition refund policy. The Return of Title IV Funds policy is applicable when a student completely withdraws or does not complete all modules (courses which do not span the entire semester) for which he/she has registered at the time those modules began. The Financial Aid Office recalculates federal* financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed or take a leave of absence prior to completing at least 60% of a semester. Recalculation is based on the percent of earned aid using the following formula: The Financial Aid Office recalculates federal* financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing at least 60 percent of a semester. Federal financial aid is returned to the federal government based on the percent of unearned aid using the following formula:</p><p>Step One: Percent earned = Number of days completed up to the withdrawal date** / total days in the semester</p><p>Step Two: Aid to be returned = (100 percent-percent earned in Step 1) x the amount of federal aid disbursed or to be disbursed toward institutional charges *Federal financial aid includes the Federal Pell Grant, SEOG Grant, Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, and PLUS Loan. **Withdrawal date is defined as the actual date the student contacted the registrar to begin the institution's withdrawal process, the student's last date of recorded attendance, or the midpoint of the semester for a student who leaves without notifying the institution. The school must return unearned aid by repaying funds to the following sources in the following order:</p><p>• Other Title IV programs When aid is returned, the student may owe a balance to the university. If so, the student should contact the Office of Student Accounts to make arrangements to pay the balance due. The Federal Refund Calculations only apply if the student is withdrawing from all classes. However, if a student makes changes in registration that result in changes to tuition and fee amounts, the Financial Aid Office will recalculate the Cost of Attendance and may need to change the original amount of aid awarded. IMPORTANT: BEFORE WITHDRAWING FROM ALL OR SOME CLASSES, STUDENTS SHOULD CONTACT FINANCIAL AID/STUDENT ACCOUNTS TO FIND OUT THE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS. STUDENTS COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID MAY FIND THEMSELVES WITH AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE BECAUSE FUNDS HAD TO BE RETURNED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawals:</head><p>A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a particular course prior to the final date to withdraw in a given semester, according to the academic calendar published in the Carlow Course Schedule and online at www.carlow.edu/registrar/registrar.html. A WD on a transcript influences the ratio of cumulative credits earned versus credits attempted. Withdrawals also impact the amount of time taken to complete the program of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeated Courses:</head><p>Students may attempt to improve their grade point average by repeating courses. A student wishing to repeat a course can do so only by taking the same course at Carlow University. When a course has been repeated, both grades remain on the transcript. The grade earned by repeating a course is used in lieu of the grade originally earned and will be used in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. A student who repeats a course one time may still be considered for financial aid for that course. No course may be taken more than three times. No course may be repeated at any other institution in order to have that grade accepted as a replacement for the original grade earned at Carlow University. A student who repeats a course for which credits were earned will not earn additional credits for the repeated course. Academic Forgiveness: When a student is granted Academic Forgiveness by the provost, the actual earned credits and earned grade are the units taken into account for the purpose of measuring academic progress for financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pennsylvania State Grants:</head><p>For each academic year during which a Pennsylvania state grant is received, a student must successfully complete the minimum number of credits appropriate to the student's enrollment status during the semester(s) for which state grant aid was received. In an academic year, students receiving two full--time semesters of state grant aid must earn at least 24 credits, and students receiving two part--time semesters of state grant aid must earn at least 12 credits. A student who has not maintained satisfactory academic progress for state grant aid may enroll in summer courses (without state grant aid) to make up the necessary credits. Academic Levels:</p><p>The following guidelines are used to determine the academic level for undergraduate students:</p><p>• First--year-a student who has completed 0 to 23 credits • Sophomore-a student who has completed 24 to 53 credits • Junior-a student who has completed 54 to 87 credits • Senior-a student who has completed at least 88 credits • Full--time-a student enrolled in 12 or more credits • Part--time-a student enrolled in fewer than 12 credits • Less than Half--time --&lt; 6 credits VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) BENEFITS The US Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits to those eligible that can be used to defray the cost of tuition for approved programs of study. Carlow University accepts VA benefits for this purpose for those students that qualify. If you are interested in utilizing these benefits, you should begin by visiting the VA's website (va.gov) to check the status of your benefits and apply to use them at Carlow. In addition, Carlow University adheres to specific policies set forth under the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 regarding Covered Individuals. A Covered Individual is defined as any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under chapter 31, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, or chapter 33, Post--9/11 GI Bill benefits. Covered individuals may attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 (a "certificate of eligibility" can also include a "Statement of Benefits" obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) website e--Benefits, or a VAF 28--1905 form for chapter 31 authorization purposes) and ending on the earlier of the following dates:</p><p>• The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution.</p><p>• 90 days after the date the institution certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certificate of eligibility. Carlow University will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under chapter 31 or 33.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC INFORMATION ACADEMIC ADVISING</head><p>All students are assigned an academic advisor when they are registered for classes in a program. Students are expected to meet with their advisor prior to and throughout their program of study. Some undergraduate programs require students to follow a prescribed sequence of courses. The academic advisor is responsible for helping the student make informed choices about course selection, but it is the student's responsibility to ensure that courses are appropriately selected to meet all requirements of the program and university in order to satisfy graduation requirements. Students are matched to academic advisors by the department chair/program director. If a change is necessary, the program director/chair will assign a different academic advisor in consultation with the student and faculty. ORIENTATION The orientation program is the first step to a successful Carlow experience. Students will learn valuable information about their academic programs and support services, IDs, parking, and technology at Carlow; they will also have the opportunity to meet and socialize with one another and with the members of the faculty, staff, and administration. For more information about orientation, students should visit the Carlow website. TRANSCRIPT REQUESTS All requests for official transcripts should be submitted via a Transcript Request Form to the Office of the Registrar. A student's signature is required to release any transcript. A fee is charged for each transcript. A transcript will not be issued unless all financial obligations owed to the university have been fulfilled. Unofficial transcripts are available only to current students through WebAdvisor/Self--Service. The Office of the Registrar does not release unofficial transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES HONOR AND SERVICE SOCIETIES</head><p>Outstanding achievement in the general academic program entitles students to apply for membership in national honor societies. Benefits vary by the society but, in general, membership in a national honor society can also provide access to educational enrichment activities, career planning, and career advancement opportunities. Chapters of honor and service societies on the Carlow University campus are: Alpha Nu Theta: Alpha Nu Theta is Carlow University's Chapter of Sigma Tau Delta, an International English Honor Society. The Society strives to confer distinction for high achievement in English language and literature in undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies; provide, through its local chapters, cultural stimulation on college campuses, and promote interest in literature and the English language in surrounding communities; foster all aspects of the discipline of English, including literature, language, and writing; promote exemplary character and good fellowship among its members; exhibit high standards of academic excellence; and serve society by fostering literacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alpha Sigma Lambda:</head><p>A scholastic and fraternal organization, Alpha Sigma Lambda is a national honor society for nontraditional adult students. Its goal is to recognize the special achievements of adults who accomplish academic excellence while facing competing interests of home and work. Alpha Sigma Lambda is dedicated to the advancement of scholarship and recognizes scholastic achievement in an adult student's career. Inductees must have a GPA of 3.5 in order to be invited for membership. Through programming and camaraderie, the society encourages its members to continue toward and to earn their degrees.

Academic and Professional Clubs may be found on the Carlow website. HONORS AND AWARDS FOR GRADUATING SENIORS Eligibility for graduation with honors is computed cumulatively. Students are eligible for graduation with honors under the following conditions: Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of:</p><p>• to 4.0-summa cum laude • to 3.89-magna cum laude • 3.50 to 3.69-cum laude Latin Honors are calculated based upon grades at the conclusion of CAP III for May commencement. Students who have received academic forgiveness may be eligible to graduate with honors limited to the cum laude designation only. Joseph G. Smith Memorial Award: In honor of the late Joseph G. Smith, former chairman of the Board of Trustees, this highest Carlow award is given to a senior in recognition of academic distinction and service to the university and to the community. The Honors Program invites accomplished and motivated students to participate in a series of academic experiences that will challenge their abilities and help them to prepare for professions or graduate study. Through this program, students experience expanded leadership opportunities, and increased opportunities to interact with faculty and to shape their own education experience. See Honors Program on page 57. STUDY ABROAD We encourage Carlow students to enhance their on--campus and online coursework with a study abroad experience. Study abroad allows students to travel outside the United States to earn credits toward their Carlow degree requirements (major, minor, and Compass) through coursework, academic internships, and service--learning. Opportunities of varying lengths are available year--round for students of all majors and foreign language proficiency levels (including English--only programs), and funding is available to help make the experience affordable for students from a range of financial backgrounds.</p><p>There are three types of study abroad opportunities:</p><p>1. Carlow--created programs: Designed for Carlow students and often taught by Carlow faculty, these programs typically offer focused coursework and experiential learning opportunities outside the classroom. Fees vary by program, and students may be able to use their regular financial aid, including Carlow scholarships, to help fund the experience. Current programs include spring break in Nicaragua, full--semester options in Italy and Ireland, and short--term summer options in Ireland. 2. ISEP exchange program: Students may spend one or two semesters at any one of 250 universities around the world as part of the ISEP program. As an exchange program, students pay their regular Carlow tuition, room, and board to Carlow and pay nothing to their host university abroad. In addition, students may be able to use their regular financial aid, including Carlow scholarships, to help fund the experience. Extensive English--language coursework in a wide variety of disciplines is available across the ISEP network. 3. Third--party programs: Students may also select credit--bearing programs offered by other universities and study abroad companies. Although students cannot use Carlow scholarships on these programs, they may still be able to use federal financial aid. Programs of varying lengths, disciplines, and prices are available around the world.</p><p>Students who are interested in studying abroad should begin the planning process as early as possible with the Center for Global Learning, which provides support with program selection, financial planning, credit transfer, health and safety orientation, and more. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DR. TOM HOPKINS COMMUNICATION LABORATORY</head><p>Carlow is fortunate to have a state--of--the--art communication lab open to all members of the university community. The Hopkins Communication Lab is located on the 4th floor of the Learning Commons. There are 2 large presentation rooms, three interview rooms and a digital conference room. All rooms in the lab are set up for digital video display. Additionally, there is a large workroom where classes can incorporate a true lab experience. Well--trained peer tutors and a communication faculty member are available seven days a week and three evenings (open hours and by appointment) to assist students in all phases of the presentation process. The communication lab team members can help students with creating an individual communication plan, brainstorming a topic for any presentation, researching a speech, outlining a speech, building persuasive arguments through evidence, creating visual aids, coping with speech anxiety, taping a speech, or practicing a speech. All appointments are kept confidential and students receive individual attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT EVALUATION</head><p>The methods that faculty use to evaluate student achievement vary according to the types of learning experiences. Written examinations are a common means of evaluation, but research papers, essays, interviews, classroom interaction, media presentations, observation, and clinical and field experience are also used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC POLICIES</head><p>In addition to the following academic policies, students are advised to consult with their program directors/chairs and advisors regarding major--specific policies and procedures. Some departments have program--specific handbooks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC CALENDAR</head><p>The academic calendar is published annually. Carlow follows the semester system, although some programs are divided into shorter sessions within the semester. (See Accelerated Course Calendar in the section below.) Most academic--related actions are carried out on a semester basis, such as academic standing decisions, the Dean's List, and determination for graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACCELERATED COURSE CALENDAR</head><p>Carlow Accelerated Program (CAP) classes generally meet for eight weeks. These courses typically meet in the evening or online and can occur in CAP I through VI sections. In addition to CAP sections, some courses meet over the weekend. When an accelerated course is scheduled to meet at a time the university is closed, faculty will schedule a make--up class, provide an out--of--class assignment or hold an online session. Classes will not be conducted on days when the institution is officially closed. As alternatives to a make--up day, faculty may decide to give the class a substantive assignment or hold an online class session instead of using the make--up day. Faculty who teach an accelerated--format class that should meet on an official holiday will publish in their syllabus which of these plans will be in place for that course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS</head><p>Any student who matriculated at Carlow University and withdrew at least five years prior to seeking re--admission* has the option of requesting academic forgiveness through the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. A student seeking academic forgiveness shall request consideration at the time of re--admission. Academic forgiveness means all previous courses the student has passed will remain on the permanent record, but none will be computed into the new cumulative GPA. Credit earned prior to academic forgiveness for courses graded A, B, C, or D will be counted toward degree requirements. Previous courses graded F will not be counted toward degree requirements. Please refer to individual departments for specific repeat policies in major and support courses. When a student is granted academic forgiveness by the Provost, the actual earned credits and earned grades are the units taken into account for the purpose of measuring academic progress for financial aid. To complete the degree, the student must earn a minimum of 32 credits after academic forgiveness. To earn graduation honors, the student must earn a minimum 3.5 GPA. Honors are limited to the cum laude designation, no matter how high the GPA.</p><p>*For additional information regarding re--admission please refer to section: Re--Admission Procedure to the University. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY Carlow University's values and vision are founded in the Sisters of Mercy's mission of cultivating lifelong learners through a learner--centric approach. It is in this tradition that Carlow University aims to educate and challenge students to reach their highest potential; to that end, we guide students along a path of honesty and integrity throughout their intellectual pursuits. Carlow University expects its constituencies to understand the various forms of academic dishonesty and to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORMS OF ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT Cheating</head><p>Any coursework, such as (but not limited to) quizzes, tests, exams (in--class, online, or take--home), homework or other assignments, lab work, presentations, and both creative and scholarly forms of expression such as projects and papers, computer programs, artistic, musical, or any audiovisual or multimedia work, is presumed to represent a student's individual, original work (or the original work of all members of a group, in the case of group assignments). Cheating thus involves completing coursework by providing or receiving inappropriate assistance from a person or reference, or using unauthorized material such as (but not limited to) notes of any form, texts, test banks, wireless devices such as cell phones, tablets, or smart watches, calculators, formulas, or computers, unless otherwise directed or permitted by the course instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plagiarism</head><p>Plagiarism refers to the unauthorized use of copyrighted material or misrepresentation of someone else's work as one's own in any coursework, such as (but not limited to) quizzes, tests, exams (in--class, online, or take--home), homework or other assignments, lab work, presentations, and both creative and scholarly forms of expression such as projects and papers, computer programs, artistic, musical, or any audiovisual or multimedia work. Plagiarism can occur in many ways, including: 1. Submitting another's work as one's own. 2. Not properly citing sources, using exact wording without quotations or proper attribution, paraphrasing without proper citation, or improper paraphrasing. 3. Attributing citations to inaccurate or misleading sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self--Plagiarism</head><p>Unless otherwise permitted by the course instructor or the nature of the assignment, each submitted work is presumed to be original. Self--plagiarism thus involves the unauthorized use of one's own work or part of a work, either from the same course or from another course, in more than one assignment. Academic Deceit Academic deceit involves the intentional use of false or altered information or the withholding of information critical to the processes of the University such as grade changes, course withdrawals, or other academic procedures. Academic deceit also entails providing false information or documentation with the intent to obtain an exemption, extension or exception to assignments, exams, presentations, and other coursework. In addition, academic deceit involves signing other students into classes or on group reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fabrication of Data</head><p>Fabrication of data involves the use of distorted data through either falsification or fabrication, or any sort of forgery or unsanctioned use of documents for research or other coursework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interference with Other Students' Learning or Achievement</head><p>The interference with the classroom learning or scholarly products of other students is a violation of academic integrity. Examples include, but are not limited to: sabotaging (including failing to contribute to) group projects or laboratory work, disrupting in--class work including tests and quizzes, altering computer files or online posts, or making educational materials such as equipment or texts unavailable to others. provide a written statement of his/her case, the hearing will continue with the evidence available. Only members of the Academic Integrity Hearing Panel, the faculty alleging the misconduct, the accused student, witnesses (if applicable), and a representative from the Disability Services Office (if applicable) may attend the hearing; no other personnel shall be permitted. If a witness cannot attend the hearing, he/she may be asked to submit a written statement as evidence. The faculty, student, and witnesses may be excused from the room during the Panel's deliberation. During the academic integrity hearing process, the student may not withdraw from the course. If the matter is not resolved by the final grade due date, an incomplete grade is assigned until the Academic Integrity Hearing Panel rules on the matter. The student will not be conferred a degree or certificate if there are outstanding academic misconduct charges. If the Academic Integrity Hearing Panel finds the student guilty of violating the academic integrity policy, the Panel will have three business days to consult with the faculty alleging misconduct for a decision on appropriate sanctions. In collaboration with the faculty, the following grade sanctions may be applied:</p><p>• Zero credit on the assignment • Failure of the course For serious cases of academic misconduct, the Panel may consult with the program(s)/department(s) that houses the student's major area(s) of study and recommend that the Provost apply the following sanctions:</p><p>• Suspension from the University • Dismissal from the University</p><p>In the case of suspension from the University, if the ruling occurs past the course withdrawal date, the suspension will begin at the end of the current semester so that the student will not incur financial aid penalties. If a student is dismissed from the University due to violation of the academic integrity policy, he/she cannot be readmitted to the University in the future. The Panel's ruling may be appealed, following the procedure described below. The Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee will notify the student, the faculty alleging the misconduct, the Dean of the College that houses the student's major(s), and the Office of the Registrar regarding the outcome of the Panel's ruling. All records of academic integrity violations will be kept permanently in the Office of Academic Affairs. Cases of academic integrity violation that take place after the last spring hearing of the academic year or over the summer months shall be directed to the Office of Academic Affairs, which will convene an ad hoc panel consisting of three faculty who are available to serve within ten business days from the time the academic integrity violation is reported. The Office of Academic Affairs will also notify the Dean of the College that houses the student's major(s) and the Office of the Registrar regarding pending cases and the outcome of the ad hoc panel's ruling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Composition of the Academic Integrity Committee</head><p>The Academic Integrity Committee is a standing committee that is available to meet once per month during the fall and spring semesters. This committee shall consist of two faculty members from each college (six total), serving staggering two-year terms. The Academic Integrity Committee shall work with the Office of Student Affairs to identify eligible graduate and undergraduate students to serve on Academic Integrity Hearing Panels. Academic Integrity Hearing Panels shall be convened as needed to take place during the Committee's scheduled meeting time.</p><p>Each Panel shall consist of four members, as follows:</p><p>• Three faculty members from the Committee (one from each College).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>One student. An undergraduate student will serve if the accused is an undergraduate student, while a graduate student will serve if the accused is a graduate student. Student members must not have previous violations of the Academic Integrity Policy.</p><p>In addition, one staff member may serve as a consultant if such expertise is deemed necessary.</p><p>If a Panel member fails to attend the hearing, the hearing will proceed with the remaining members of the Panel, providing that there are at least three Panel members present. Members serving on an Academic Integrity Hearing Panel must not have taught the accused student in the past or have personal ties to the student. If no Committee member from a particular College is eligible to serve under this condition, the Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee will work with the College representative to identify a substitute from that College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals</head><p>Following the Academic Integrity Hearing Panel's ruling, both the faculty alleging misconduct and the accused student may appeal the decision in writing detailing the grounds of the appeal. Appeals must be submitted to the Provost within ten business days of the Panel's ruling. ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Formal grievance procedures have been established to provide students with a means to express concerns regarding the application of academic policies, procedures, practices, rules, or regulations of the university, and a method by which concerns can be resolved. For appeal of a grade, students should consult the Grade Changes and Grade Appeals section. The student is encouraged initially to discuss the concern informally with the faculty member and/or department/program chair. Students must utilize internal mechanisms for grievances before involving external counsel. General counsel is not part of the internal grievance procedure.</p><p>Steps to address a concern: 1. If a student has an academic concern she/he should present the situation to the faculty member in writing/email. The email must make explicit that the student is starting the grievance procedure. The faculty member will arrange an appointment as soon as possible. The faculty member will respond to the concern presented during this initial appointment within seven days of the appointment. Parties should retain a written record of this discussion. Most matters can be settled by frank discussion of the facts. 2. Should the concern remain unresolved, the student will discuss the matter with the department chair or program director and determine if a resolution can be mutually agreed or if a grievance process is required. This will be completed within five days of response from Step 1. In order for all facts to be carefully re--examined and evaluated, the department chair will follow these procedures: a. Discuss the situation with the faculty member(s) b. Arrange to meet with the student and involved faculty together to arrive at resolutions to the situation c. Retain written notes from each intervention 3. Should the concern remain unresolved with the department chair or program director, or if the specific concern involves the department chair, the student will take the concern to the appropriate dean. The student filing the grievance must have completed Step 1 and have documentation of the discussion. The appropriate dean will then follow Steps 2a and b. There should be a written record of each meeting and its outcome. 4. If the grievance remains unresolved at this level and the student wishes to pursue it further, the dean will begin the process of setting up the grievance committee as described in this step. The committee will consist of five members: two students and three faculty members. One faculty member will be elected as chair of the committee and will vote only to break a tie. Student members will be drawn from the pool of graduate students when a grievance is filed by a graduate student. Faculty members will be drawn from other graduate departments. The student and faculty members may each request the removal of any one member of the pool of eligible members. 5. Both parties will be informed of the status or resolution of the grievance at each step of the process. If either party remains unsatisfied with the decision of the committee, the dean will notify the provost that there is dissatisfaction with the decision. The provost shall make a final determination.</p><p>learning assessment. By engaging in learning assessment processes, we take steps to ensure our students achieve the learning goals represented by their degree. Through our learning assessment efforts, we seek to provide truthful and accurate answers to the following questions:</p><p>• What goals do we have for students with respect to the knowledge, competencies, and skills they should develop or master to be able to enter into a career, a community of practice, or higher levels of graduate study? •</p><p>What intentional steps do we take to achieve these goals? •</p><p>How successful are our students in achieving these goals? That is, what are the actual outcomes? • How do we improve student learning when the information obtained through our efforts indicates that students' progress in achieving these goals is not sufficient? In Standards for Accreditation and Requirements of <ref type="bibr">Affiliation (2016)</ref>, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education observes that assessment has the student as its primary focus, functions to help students improve their learning, enhances quality, and leads to continuous improvements in academic programs. As a member of the Middle States Association, Carlow University embraces these principles as integral to its own framework for assessment. In fact, the improvement of teaching and learning is the framework's primary goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carlow's Learning Assessment Framework</head><p>Based on best practices in the field of learning assessment, we have established a common set of expectations for the development and assessment of student learning outcomes. Each program of study is responsible for maintaining a sustainable assessment process. Specifically, a sustainable assessment plan in Carlow's learning assessment framework includes the following elements:</p><p>1. Clearly Articulated Student Learning Outcomes To ensure learning, a program must first define goals in order to intentionally work toward those goals. With this in mind, each program of study defines five to seven program--level student learning outcomes. These outcomes are statements about what a learner should be able to do after he/she has completed the program of study. At the end of each academic year, departments and programs of study review their outcome results and use the information to determine action steps that will improve, bolster and better assure student learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Defined Measures and Criteria for Success</head><p>Learning outcome statements specify student learning behaviors that are observable, measurable and able to be demonstrated. Based on all of this, each program of study identifies opportunities where students apply and demonstrate their learning outcomes. These can include exams, papers, presentations, projects, and other assignments. After identifying these demonstration opportunities, programs of study establish standards of quality, i.e., "criteria for success", that they will use to evaluate the learning outcomes, ensuring that they meet our expectations and prepare students for future success. Wherever necessary, rubrics are developed to clearly explain the criteria used to evaluate outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Collection and Analysis of Data</head><p>Upon conducting assessments of each learning outcome, programs of study and Compass curriculum areas collect and analyze the resulting data. This analysis includes evaluation of the achievement of each outcome and thus leads to identification of best practices or areas in which student learning can be improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Action Plans for the Improvement of Student Learning</head><p>Where data collected indicate unsatisfactory progress in the achievement of learning outcomes, faculty will identify tangible actions that will be taken to improve student learning. The efficacy of these actions is then evaluated through future assessments. It should be noted that while this framework provides clear guidelines for how each program of study carries out assessment, it leaves great flexibility to faculty, departments, and programs in determining and implementing the best practices for evaluating their students' achievement. There are several programs at Carlow University that are externally accredited, including programs in the School of Nursing (CCNE), the Counseling Psychology Doctoral Program (APA), the Respiratory Care Program (provisional accreditation through the Council on Accreditation for Respiratory Care--COARC), and the Social Work program (CSWE). For these programs, external agencies often have their own requirements regarding assessment and these programs may adapt the Carlow framework to conduct assessment of student learning in ways that align with those requirements. Assessment Reports and Activities Each program produces an assessment report each year that includes the following:</p><p>• Assessment results data from the most recent academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Plans for the improvement of student learning that result from analysis of the data collected. Additionally, general education and institutional learning outcomes (a.k.a "Compass learning outcomes") are reviewed by the Carlow Compass Curriculum Steering Committee. In these reviews, which are designed to carefully examine the quality of education achieved by our Carlow Compass Curriculum, information and data on assessment of student learning are carefully evaluated by representative faculty from across the university. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)</head><p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended (FERPA) does three things:</p><p>1. FERPA allows students to have the right to inspect their own records. 2. FERPA creates rules regarding the confidentiality and disclosure of education records. 3. FERPA allows students to ask to have their records amended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CARLOW UNIVERSITY PROCEDURE FOR STUDENTS TO INSPECT EDUCATION RECORDS</head><p>Students who wish to inspect and review their own education records may submit to the registrar a written request that identifies the records the student wishes to inspect. A university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected, within 45 days after the request was received. A university official may be present during the inspection and review. Certain documents are excluded from the student's inspection of his or her education records. These exclusions are: 1) information submitted by the student's parents; 2) confidential letters of recommendation related to admission, employment, job placement or honors, placed in the file before January 1, 1975, or thereafter when the student has waived the right to inspect and review such letters of recommendation, (c) information about other students, and (d) documents that are not considered "education records. For example, documents that are in the sole possession of the maker of the document and are not shared with anyone else (except a substitute) are not considered education records maintained by the institution. In general, students cannot inspect education records of other students unless the other student provides his/her written, signed and dated consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CARLOW UNIVERSITY PROCEDURES REGARDING DISCLOSURES OF STUDENT RECORDS</head><p>Carlow University students are encouraged to allow their parents and guardians to have access to their education records. To authorize disclosure to parents and guardians (and anyone else not listed in the exceptions below), students must provide written, signed and dated, specific authorization specifying the records they wish to share. To do so, students may submit an Authorization to Release Records form with the registrar. The student may email the completed form to the registrar only from the student's own Carlow University email account. Otherwise, the student's signature must be hand delivered or mailed to the Office of the Registrar. To revoke this authorization, students may alert the registrar in writing, including by email. Disclosure with the student's written consent is by no means mandatory or automatic. If a parent or guardian, or other designated third party wishes to review a specific record, Carlow will respond to that request by reviewing whether Carlow has the student's written, signed, and dated authorization to disclose on file and weighing other interests. In many cases, the university may choose to share information directly with the student to allow the student to determine how and when to share with others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Written consent generally required:</head><p>The general rule is that Carlow will not disclose personally identifiable information from the records of a student without the student's prior written consent. The list of exceptions (instances where Carlow may disclose education information without student consent) are set forth below. Disclosures without student consent: Carlow may disclose information from education records, including personally identifiable information, without the prior written consent of the student in the following circumstances (some are mandatory disclosures and Carlow has no choice; some are discretionary):</p><p>1. To Carlow University officials who have been determined by the university to have legitimate educational interests in the records. A school official is: a. a person employed by Carlow in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position. Any Carlow employee who needs information about a student in the course of performing instructional, supervisory, advisory, or administrative duties for Carlow University has a legitimate educational interest. For example, human resources and accounting staff may have legitimate educational interests for purposes of tuition reimbursement. b. a person employed by or under contract to Carlow to perform specific tasks, such as an auditor, consultant, or attorney, a person on the Board of Trustees, or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official. Vendors (for example, technology vendors) who receive education records must sign contracts agreeing to use the information only for the purposes designated in their contracts, must agree not to disclose information further and must otherwise agree to the protections and protocols in the Carlow University Non--Disclosure Agreement. 2. To certain officials of the United States Department of Education, the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, and state and local educational authorities in connection with state or federally supported educational programs. 3. In connection with the student's request for, or receipt of, financial aid necessary to determine the eligibility, amounts or conditions of financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid. 4. To organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of Carlow University, provided such organizations agree to protocols regarding the safeguarding of the information. 5. To accrediting commissions or state licensing or regulatory bodies to carry out their functions. 6. To parents of a dependent student, as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. Although Carlow is permitted to disclose under the law, it is Carlow's policy to disclose only with the student's consent. 7. To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. 8. To appropriate parties in health or safety emergencies. 9. To officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. 10.

To persons in addition to the victim of a crime of violence or sexual offense, the final results of the Carlow University disciplinary proceedings described in paragraph 10 above but only if the school has determined that a student is the perpetrator of a crime of violence or sexual offense, and with respect to the allegation made against him or her, the student has committed a violation of Carlow University's rules or policies. Carlow University, in such instances, does not disclose the name of any other student, including a victim or witness without the prior written consent of the other student(s). 12. To a parent regarding the student's violation of any federal, state, or local law or of any Carlow University rules governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if Carlow determines that the student has committed a disciplinary violation with respect to that use or possession, and the student is under 21 at the time of the disclosure to the parent. 13. Directory information. Directory information is personally identifiable information that may be disclosed without the student's consent. Carlow University designates the following information as directory information: Photograph of the student, if available k. Enrollment status (i.e., enrolled, continuing, future enrolled student, reentry, leave of absence, etc.) l.</p><p>Student honors and awards received. m. The height and weight of athletic team members.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opting out of the directory:</head><p>A student may request that his or her information not be included in the directory. To do so, please complete the Request to Restrict Directory Information (Opt-Out) Form or otherwise submit written notice to the registrar. Failure to request nondisclosure of directory information may result in routine disclosure of one or more of the above--designated categories of personally identifiable directory information. Carlow University does not provide directory information to marketing companies, including credit card companies, ring vendors or the like. Student Recruiting Information. Carlow University is required to comply with certain requests made by the U.S. Military. Student recruiting information includes ONLY: name, address, Carlow email address, telephone listing, age or date of birth, class level, academic major, place of birth, degrees received and most recent educational institution attended. It does not include and Carlow University will not provide: Social Security numbers, race, ethnicity, nationality, GPA, grades, low performing student lists, religious affiliation, students with loans in default, veteran's status, and information about students no longer enrolled. Students who opt out of the directory also opt out of student recruiting information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Records of Requests for Disclosure:</head><p>The registrar maintains a record indicating the parties who have requested or obtained personally identifiable information from a student's education records and the legitimate interests those parties had in requesting or obtaining the information. This record may be inspected by the student. The registrar need not include in the record, disclosures made to the student himself/herself, disclosures made with the student's written authorization, disclosures to university officials and employees, and disclosures of directory information. PROCEDURE TO AMEND EDUCATIONAL RECORDS Students have the right to request that a school amend records that they believe to be inaccurate. misleading, or in violation of their right to privacy. To do so, the student files a written request to amend the record with the Registrar's Office, Carlow University, 3333 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. The request should identify the part of the record that the student wants to have amended and specify why the student believes it to be inaccurate or misleading. Carlow will either amend the record or decide not to amend the record and will so alert the student. If Carlow decides not to amend the record, the student then has the right to request a hearing. Carlow will arrange for the hearing and notify the student reasonably in advance of the date, place and time of the hearing. The hearing will be conducted by an individual who does not have a direct interest in the outcome. That individual may be an official of Carlow University. The student shall be afforded a forum for the opportunity to tell his or her side of the story, and present documentation and other information relevant to the issues raised in the original request to amend. The student may be assisted by another person, including an attorney. After the hearing, Carlow University will prepare a written decision based upon the evidence presented at the hearing. If Carlow determines that the record was inaccurate or misleading, it will amend the record and inform the student in writing. If, after the hearing, Carlow still decides not to amend the record, the student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FERPA</head><p>Students are afforded the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202--5901 For additional information please visit http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Copying of Education Records</head><p>Online students or other students who are not able to inspect their academic records in person may request a copy of their education records. Students must follow the procedure to inspect education records as stated above. Transcripts from other institutions submitted as part of the admissions process may not be copied and distributed. Students must contact the other institutions directly to receive official transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE INFORMATION REGISTRATION</head><p>A student is officially registered for a course when named on the official class roster. Grades and credits will not be recorded for any course for which a student is not officially registered. Upon registration, a student agrees to pay all charges on the student account for that enrollment period according to the standard payment terms available on the Portal. Default of payment will result in a hold on future registration and release of transcripts. Tuition refund policies, deadlines, and more details for each semester are available on the Portal and in the Student Hub. Only officially registered students may attend class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANGE OF REGISTRATION</head><p>Students may change registration without academic penalty during the official add/drop period. Dropping below full--time status may affect financial aid. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for details. Students must have written permission from the instructor and advisor to add a course after the first week of classes. In Carlow accelerated courses, change of registration must be completed one day prior to the beginning of the second class. Students who miss the equivalent of more than two sessions cannot receive a passing grade for the course. A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a particular course prior to the final date to withdraw in a given semester. Grades of students who do not complete a course and who have not withdrawn officially will be listed as F. Add/Drop/Withdrawal dates are posted on the Portal. ATTENDANCE POLICY Students have a responsibility to attend classes for which they have registered and fully participate in them. Specific attendance requirements for each course are established by the instructor. Students should be aware of individual course attendance policies, as they are held accountable for meeting those standards. Students are obligated to be in attendance on days with examinations, major or minor, are scheduled. Students who absent themselves from examinations may be refused permission to take the examination at a later date; may receive a failing grade for the examination missed; and may receive a failing grade for the course. Further, absence from class on a day when an assignment is due does not excuse the student from the obligation to have the assignment turned in on time. Faculty may refuse to accept any work which is turned in late and may assign a failing grade for that work. ACCELERATED COURSES Accelerated courses, regardless of delivery mode, have a very specific attendance policy, and faculty teaching these courses have a responsibility to adhere to it. Students who miss more than the equivalent of two class meetings of an eight--week week/accelerated course will receive an F (failing grade). This policy includes partial absences that add up to more than two class meetings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ONLINE/DISTANCE EDUCATION COURSES</head><p>In an online/distance education context, documenting that a student has logged into an online class is not sufficient, by itself, to demonstrate academic attendance by the student. A university must demonstrate that a student participated in class or was otherwise engaged in an academically related activity, such as by contributing to an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a course--related question, in order to constitute attendance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NON--ATTENDANCE POLICY</head><p>To be eligible for a Federal Title IV grant and loan funds, a student must begin attendance in the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended. Accordingly, institutions must have a process in place to determine that the student actually began attendance. Faculty reporting activities are necessary for the university to comply with Federal Department of Education regulation 34CFR 668.21, which requires that if a student does not begin attendance in a payment period, the institution must return all Title IV, HEA program funds that were credited or disbursed to the student's account no later than 30 days after the date that the institution becomes aware that the student will not or has not begun attendance. If the student fails to begin attendance in any classes after disbursement of federal loan funds has been made directly to the student, the institution must immediately notify the applicable Federal loan servicer that the student has not begun attendance and did not establish eligibility for federal aid. The loan servicer will then issue a final demand letter to the student borrower for repayment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND ABSENCE FOR MANDATORY UNIVERSITY SPONSORED EVENTS</head><p>A university--sponsored event is defined as an event directly related to a student's education or the university community that takes place outside the classroom. Examples include participation in varsity athletics, professional conferences, on-campus theatre productions, and student orientation activities. A student whose participation in a university--sponsored event is required (such as athletics) or would promote her/his education (such as presenting research at a professional conference) must notify the appropriate faculty member(s) of her/his participation in these particular events, as well as the anticipated absence from class. It is recommended that the student should notify the appropriate faculty member(s) at least one week prior to the actual absence, and, if it is available, present the faculty member with a schedule of her/his events. The student is responsible for all material and assignments covered during the absence. In the event that a student will be absent from an examination or absent on the due date for an assignment, the student will be expected to make up the examination or submit the assignment at a time and place designated by the faculty member. All students participating in university--sponsored events must be given the opportunity to make up classwork, including labs, assignments, and exams that they miss during attendance at such sponsored events. Every effort should be made to accommodate the student, and there will be no consequences due to missing class for the events (such as point deductions for an assignment, loss of attendance points, unfavorable grade adjustments, or new assignments beyond those listed in the course syllabus). The student should also discuss the event schedule with her/his academic advisor when registering for courses. To the extent that event schedules are known in advance, and to the extent that multiple sections are offered for particular courses, the student, where it is possible and where it does not adversely affect the integrity of her/his Carlow education, should schedule courses in such a way as to minimize schedule conflicts. Accelerated courses are not recommended for students who are aware that they have extensive travel commitments, evening obligations, or other university--sponsored activities that would cause them to miss such classes. The guidelines established by the university regarding CAP classes will apply. Realizing that circumstances which may cause an absence may vary greatly, any exceptions will be at the discretion of the faculty member on a case--by--case basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND TUTORIALS Independent Studies:</head><p>Department resources permitting, students may explore areas not covered in the Carlow curriculum through independent study. Upper--level students may work independently or design a course to be pursued independently under the guidance of a sponsoring faculty member and with chair/program director approval. Students must have a minimum cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.75 and demonstrate proficiency in dealing with pertinent materials. Students are expected to demonstrate learning outcomes consistent with comparable course work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tutorials:</head><p>Courses taught infrequently but listed in the catalog may be taken as tutorials with advisor, faculty tutor, and chair/director approval, and department resources permitting. Prior to registration, the student must make arrangements with the professor who usually teaches the course. A tutorial may not be taken during a semester in which the same course is being offered as a class session. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the department responsible for the tutorial. Experiential Learning: EXP 250 provides experiential learning credit for participation in seminars, workshops, conferences, internships, or special events. Such experiences might include leadership conferences, the Mercy--sponsored trip to the United Nations, etc. EXP 250 can be taken for 1 or 2 credits during the summer terms only. A maximum of three (total) credits may be issued for any given summer term. EXP 250 has a special summer pricing structure. Contact Student Accounts for the fixed rate per credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPEATED COURSES</head><p>Students may attempt to improve their grade point average by repeating courses. A student wishing to repeat a course can do so only by taking the same course at Carlow University. When a course has been repeated, both grades remain on the transcript. The grade earned by repeating a course is used in lieu of the grade originally earned and will be used in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. A student who repeats a course one time may still be considered for financial aid for that course. No course may be taken more than three times. A student who repeats a course for which credits were earned will not earn additional credits for the repeated course. In some situations, it may be necessary for a student to repeat a course off campus. This situation will be handled on a case--by--case basis with oversight by the appropriate dean. No course may be repeated at any other institution in order to have that grade accepted as a replacement for the original grade earned at Carlow University. In the event that a student has failed a course that is no longer offered or for which the student is ineligible to take by determination of the academic department, the department offering the course will decide what course or courses a student may substitute. The grade for the substituted course does not replace the grade for the original course in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. Students should consult with the Office of Financial Aid for more information on how repeated courses might impact student aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSE</head><p>Withdrawal from a course must be made officially in the Office of the Registrar. A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a course after the drop deadline and prior to the final date to withdraw in a given semester, according to the deadlines posted on the Portal. Withdrawing from a course or courses does not withdraw a student from the university. Withdrawal from the University requires submission of an Official Notification of Withdrawal/Leave of Absence form to the Office of the Registrar. Grades of students who do not complete a course and who have not withdrawn officially will be listed as F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CROSS--REGISTRATION (PCHE)</head><p>Full--time undergraduate students (12 credits or above) in good academic standing are eligible to participate in a cross-registration program through the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE), provided the course is open for cross-registration and the student has met the prerequisites. Students may cross--register for one course per semester in the fall and spring terms only. The registrant must have the approval of the appropriate dean, advisor, and the University Registrar. Grades earned through cross--registration are posted on the Carlow transcript and counted in the GPA. Students may not repeat courses for which they received a D--or above at Carlow for credit or to replace a grade. There is no additional tuition charge to cross--register, although students may be assessed course fees (e.g. for courses with a laboratory component) by the host institution. Students are responsible for special course or lab fees at the host institution. Academic rules and regulations of the host institution prevail. Cross--registration forms are available on the Portal.</p><p>There are nine schools where Carlow students can cross--register: Credit for Prior Learning, and the International Baccalaureate program. A student may earn a maximum of 30 credits at Carlow, or elsewhere, through these options, either singly or combined. Any credits earned are not included in the number of credits necessary to satisfy college residence requirements. Carlow is part of the ACE Credit College and University Network that considers ACE recommendations for military training and experience. Carlow will also review additional types of credit for prior learning on a case--by--case basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement Program of the College Board:</head><p>A student who has taken college--level courses in one or more subjects in high school and has submitted the results of the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Tests will be considered for advanced placement. Test scores of 3, 4, or 5 may entitle the student to academic credit in course areas corresponding to the advanced study. Scores are submitted to the Office of Admissions, usually at the time of application for admission. The university registrar will consult with the appropriate academic department to assign course equivalencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Eligibility:</head><p>Carlow accepts CLEP credit for scores at or above the recommended score of 50 or higher. Credit cannot be awarded if the student has already taken an equivalent course or a course at a more advanced level in the same discipline. CLEP scores are only applied to Core requirements. CLEP credit does not affect grade point average and does not count for residency requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College in High School (CHS):</head><p>A student who has taken College in High School (CHS) courses in one or more subjects during high school and has submitted official transcripts from the awarding institution will be considered for college credit. A grade of C or better will be accepted for college credit. Course equivalency is determined by the Office of the Registrar in consultation with the appropriate academic department. Official transcripts are submitted to the Office of Admissions, usually at the time of application for admission. Course Challenge or Credit by Examination: Some courses may be challenged for either credit or exemption by passing an examination and/or by satisfying another means of evaluation. Students may qualify for challenge if they have not already attempted to pass or challenge the course or have not been enrolled in the course for more than four weeks. (For CAP and Weekend courses, consult the department office for appropriate time frame.) To challenge the course, students must submit to the appropriate academic department a declaration of intention as well as reasonable evidence of preparation. After a student has successfully challenged a course for credit, the course is entered onto the transcript and the notation "Credit by Challenge" is posted in lieu of a grade. Credits earned by challenge are charged at a special fee. If a student chooses exemption, the exemption is noted by the Office of the Registrar, and there is no fee. Students are permitted one attempt to successfully challenge or exempt themselves from a given course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Learning Portfolio/Learning Counts:</head><p>Available to matriculated students with five years of professional experience that aligns with Carlow University courses. Upon successful completion of a three--credit portfolio development course CAEL 100, students will be able to: identify areas of their own learning from numerous settings such as training, work, community volunteering, and self--study; describe learning from experience, reflect on the learning, and synthesize ideas and the ideas of others; build a deep understanding of lifelong learning; discuss and apply experiential learning theory, models, and concepts; apply critical reflection to consider the nature and value of learning from experience; demonstrate an appropriate balance of practical and theoretical understanding; prepare learning narratives that demonstrate learning comparable to college level courses; identify research, gather, organize, and write documentation that supports learning in order to build a learning portfolio. Portfolio credits may be earned in all Carlow University courses with the exception of the following: major courses (SW prefix) within the Bachelor of Social Work; major courses (NU prefix) within the Bachelor of Science in Nursing except for NU 413 and NU 420; major courses (RC prefix) in the Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care. International Baccalaureate Program: Students who have completed the International Baccalaureate Program and score 5 or above on the examinations may qualify for Carlow University credit. In most cases, credits awarded will be for elective credit only. DEGREE/CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS General requirements for a degree for all students include the following: Proficiency in the English Language: Each student is expected to demonstrate in all course work the ability to speak and write with precision and clarity, showing evidence of competent command of the English language. Residence: Students must earn a minimum of 32 credits in courses taken at Carlow University in order to fulfill the residence requirements of the university. In addition, each major also has a specified residence requirement. Please check the specific major section of the catalog; however, students are required to take a minimum of 18 credits in a major at Carlow. The total number of credits that any transfer student will need to take at Carlow will be a combination of university residence requirements, major residence requirements, and general education requirements as specified on the transfer evaluation issued upon admission to the university. Credits earned through Advanced Placement, CLEP, College in High School, Course Challenge, Prior Learning Portfolio/Learning Counts, or International Baccalaureate cannot be considered as part of the residence requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Program Requirements:</head><p>Candidates for Pennsylvania Teacher Certification must maintain a 3.0 GPA to remain in good standing. Students in the nursing program must attain a 3.0 GPA to enter the specialized nursing sequences in the sophomore year and maintain a 3.0 each semester thereafter. Students majoring in biology who expect to be accepted in perfusion technology must present a 3.0 GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Point Average:</head><p>To qualify for a degree/certificate, a student must attain a cumulative academic average of 2.0 GPA by the completion of the degree/certificate. Students in degree programs must officially apply to graduate and must have a minimum of 120 credits (consult the specific academic program). Certificate students must alert the Office of the Registrar when they are about to complete the certificate requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capstone Experience:</head><p>Graduating seniors are usually assessed in their major through examinations, comprehensive seminars, research presentations, practica, and/or internships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education Requirements:</head><p>The Carlow Compass and Core Curriculum requirements are listed in this catalog. Academic Major Requirements: Specific requirements for majors are listed within each department section of this catalog. Students are required to take a minimum of 18 credits in a major at Carlow. Students who change their program of study (major) will be governed by the catalog in effect when the change is made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minor Requirements:</head><p>To earn a minor in an academic discipline, students must complete a minimum number of credits defined by the academic discipline. At least half of the credits for the minor must be completed with Carlow courses. Student Responsibility: Students are personally responsible for meeting all degree requirements governed by the catalog in effect at their time of enrollment. Advisors will assist them in academic planning. GRADUATION POLICY All students must submit an application for graduation in order to be reviewed by their advisors and the University Registrar. The purpose of this review is to ensure students have met requirements for their degree or certificate. Students must meet all degree or certificate requirements, including all minimum grade, credit hour, and GPA requirements per departmental and University policy. Due to the University's obligation to report graduates within federally--mandated deadlines, students must submit their graduation applications by the date required for that graduation period and no more than 30 days beyond the end of the term. Students who submit their graduation applications beyond the deadline and more than 30 days after the term end date will be reviewed for the next graduation term. In addition, students who do not complete their final courses by the aforementioned deadlines due to incomplete or in--progress grades, late submission of official transcripts for off--campus credit, or any other reason will be reviewed in the next graduation term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADES GRADING AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA)</head><p>Instructors publish their grading policies so students know exactly how course grades will be determined. Withdrawn AUDITING A COURSE Students may audit a course with the instructor's permission and must register through the Office of the Registrar. Students should consult with Student Accounts regarding fees for auditing a course. A grade of AU is given for an audited course with no credit. PASS/FAIL OPTION The Pass/Fail option permits students to explore disciplines without jeopardizing Grade Point Average (GPA). The option must be exercised on the student's original registration or by the end of the add/drop period. Only electives can be completed with this option. The maximum number of credits earned under the Pass/Fail option is 15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INCOMPLETE GRADE POLICY</head><p>An incomplete grade (I grade) at the end of a course is reserved for those students who have completed at least 75 percent of the course work, have a passing grade in the course, and for good reason (mitigating or extenuating circumstances) have assignments or examinations to complete. Incompletes are given at the discretion of the instructor for the course; the instructor makes the final decision to award an incomplete. The I grade is automatically changed to 'F' by the Office of the Registrar if not removed within the required time frame (six calendar weeks from the end of the semester in which the I grade was assigned, including summer terms). Official deadlines for each semester will be supplied by the University Registrar and posted on the Portal. Once the student has completed the work, the instructor must submit a Change of Grade form to the Office of the Registrar. Instructors reserve the right to require that work be submitted prior to the sixth--week deadline in any given term. If an extension for an incomplete grade is needed, instructors must submit an Incomplete Extension form with Dean's approval to the Office of the Registrar prior to the six--week deadline. Credits assigned the grade of incomplete are not considered earned credits until completion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IN PROGRESS (IP) GRADES</head><p>The IP grade is reserved for certain courses where it is anticipated that a student's work will extend into the next semester (e.g. thesis, project, internship, clinical, a third student teaching experience, etc.). At the end of the semester in which the student completes the work, an earned grade will be assigned which replaces the IP grade. Individual programs may place a time limit on completion of the thesis, creative project, internship, or clinical course. Students should check with their individual program directors. Students who are carrying an IP grade and do not register for classes for two or more semesters will have the IP grade converted to an NG (no grade). If those students are readmitted to the university, they will register and pay for the original course again with its associated credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE CHANGES AND GRADE APPEALS</head><p>Once a grade has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar, the grade cannot be changed unless there has been an error or grade reconsideration on the part of the instructor. To change a grade, the faculty member must complete the Change of Grade form and obtain the appropriate department chair's or program director's signature. Completed forms are to be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the instructor. Students who have questions regarding a final course grade are to first consult with the instructor who originally awarded the grade. Any request for a grade reconsideration must be made to the faculty member in writing/email within 30 calendar days of the beginning of the semester following the one for which the first grade was first issued. If the instructor does not believe the evidence warrants a change of grade, the student may appeal within 30 calendar days of the instructor's written/emailed decision by following the appeal process outlined below. If an acceptable solution cannot be reached by discussion with the instructor, the student may appeal by sending a written statement to the instructor and department chair/program director, along with any supporting evidence. The department chair/program director will then work with the instructor to review and assess the student's claims. The decision will be communicated to the student in email by the department chair/program director, and will be final. This process is not intended to replace informal conferences between a student and instructor concerning the issuance of a grade. In the event the instructor is the department chair/program director, the student should consult with the dean of the college.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD</head><p>Federal law protects the individual's right to privacy and protects citizens from harm from others. Research involving human subjects is reviewed to safeguard those rights. Carlow University has convened an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that all human subject research and/or projects that include data collection from human subjects is reviewed in advance by responsible, knowledgeable peers to protect these rights. Carlow University is committed to these laws based on moral, ethical, and legal grounds. All research that comes under the aegis of the university must meet the procedures established to ensure the privacy and protection of human subjects. These procedures are followed by faculty in their own research, and by students in any research they conduct, regardless of where it is actually conducted. Additional guidelines can be found on the Portal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLACEMENT TESTING New First----Year Traditional Students:</head><p>Prior to starting mathematics coursework at Carlow University, incoming first--year students will test in mathematics to evaluate essential foundational skills that are important for success in college. The test results serve to identify the appropriate starting point in mathematics, particularly in certain majors, and/or become part of baseline information. Specific programs may require additional placement tests.</p><p>Carlow University's Compass requires all new traditional students to take a two--course writing sequence: SKW101 Foundations of Writing and SKW102 Foundations of Writing II. Each course is designed to prepare students for the rigors of college writing and research. If a student wishes to skip the first course in the sequence (SKW101), that student may try to place into the second course in the sequence by taking a writing placement test. Placement tests are NOT required. Students who wish to take the two--course writing course sequence will register for SKW101 during registration. If students opt to take the test, this will occur at the time of registration. New Traditional and Adult Transfer Students: Math placement tests evaluate basic competencies for students who do not have transfer equivalency credit for Compass requirements. The results are used to identify the appropriate starting level course. Students who take placement tests may be required to take an additional course based upon their final score on this evaluation. This course in addition to the standard curriculum may lengthen the duration of the program and increase the overall cost. Additional earned credits will be applied to the total number of credits required for graduation. Students may submit to the Registrar's office prior writing courses for transfer equivalency. All prior courses will be evaluated for equivalency by the director of skills writing at the time of registration. If students have not taken writing courses at prior institutions or if their courses do not transfer, they have the option to take the placement test in an effort to place out of the first writing course in the sequence. All placement testing occurs at the time of registration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSFER OF CREDITS</head><p>Students transferring to Carlow from other institutions may have up to 88 credits accepted. A grade of C or higher must have been earned. Courses taken for pass/fail or satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades may only be transferred if it can be verified that a pass or satisfactory grade is equivalent to a C or higher. Only the credit is transferred, not the grade. A transfer evaluation will be done after a student is accepted and after all catalog or course descriptions have been received. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain the course descriptions or catalogs from all colleges or universities outside of Allegheny County. Once a student matriculates at Carlow University, the student must have permission from the faculty advisor and the university registrar/transfer coordinator prior to beginning a class at another institution. Students may be permitted to transfer a maximum of four classes or sixteen (16) credits from other universities, exclusive of cross--registration. The student is also responsible for requesting that the registrar at the host institution forward an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar at Carlow University. Credit will not be accepted for a course if a student has not obtained formal permission from the advisor and university registrar/transfer coordinator to take the course. Appropriate forms are available in the Student Hub and on the Portal. Students may be awarded credits for vocational/technical programs of study. In the event a student qualifies for a technical block award, the credits can be used as elective credit only and may not be used as equivalent coursework in any of Carlow's academic programs or in fulfillment of any academic requirement. Coursework taken in vocational and technical programs of study is subject to the same transfer policies as other college level coursework. Carlow University makes no promises about the transferability of its credits to another institution of higher education. Transferability of credits is determined exclusively by each receiving institutions. Typical considerations involve accreditation guidelines, whether the course substitutes for a course in the curriculum at the other institution, whether the student received a certain grade or better, how long ago the course was taken, how many credits the student seeks to transfer, and other factors. Students who plan to transfer credits from Carlow can check with the registrar to see if there is an affiliation agreement in place and check with the other institution to learn about their policies regarding transfer of credits before taking the courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DUAL MAJORS</head><p>A student can pursue dual undergraduate majors at Carlow resulting in a single or double degree. Both majors must be completed before any degree is awarded. The student must complete the requirements for both majors, earning a minimum of 120 credits, although the student may need to complete more than 120 credits to fulfill both majors' requirements. All requirements of each major must be satisfied before the degree(s) is conferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SECOND DEGREE FOR STUDENTS</head><p>Whether a student has completed a previous Carlow undergraduate degree or a degree at another institution, the student must complete a minimum of 32 credits at Carlow for the additional degree. While previous courses can fulfill requirements if appropriate, 32 more Carlow credits must be completed to be awarded a second degree. It is possible students may need to take more than the 32--credit minimum to complete the degree. Compass curriculum requirements are waived for the second--degree students. Students who previously earned a Carlow University bachelor's degree and are returning to complete the requirements for Bachelor of Science in Nursing or the Second Degree in Nursing program should refer to Office of Admissions for specific residency requirements. Residence Requirement: Refer to Degree/Certificate Requirements section. PENNSYLVANIA TRANSFER AND ARTICULATION CENTER Carlow University participates in the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Center. Course equivalences between Carlow and other participating institutions are defined on the PaTrac website: http://www.patrac.org/ A student who completes an associate degree as defined in the Program to Program articulations will enter Carlow in the junior year. Students will not be required to complete Carlow Compass requirements. Major courses requirements are determined by the major department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUITION AND FEES</head><p>A complete listing of charges and fees is available on the Carlow website at www.carlow.edu/tuition_and_fees and on the Portal. The University reserves the right to modify these charges if circumstances require. Payment options and student account policies are also listed on the Portal under the Student Hub/Student Accounts tab. STUDENT ACCOUNTS PAYMENT POLICIES Each semester, payment is due by the due date published on myPortal. A student must pay the balance due or begin an official payment plan to cover any balance that will not be cleared by pending financial aid in order to begin attending classes and to move into the residence halls. Ten business days prior to the start of the semester, registration may be voided for any returning student who owes an outstanding balance of $4,000.00 or more for any previous and/or upcoming semesters combined after any finalized financial aid would be applied to the student account and who has not made payment arrangements with the Student Accounts Office. A notification letter will be sent to any student whose registration has been voided. Registration can be reinstated within the first week of the semester after the student pays the balance due or makes satisfactory payment arrangements. Reinstatement of registration will be subject to course availability. Student accounts are audited during the semester and bursar holds are added to delinquent accounts. A bursar hold prevents receipt of transcripts. A registration hold is also placed on an account that has a delinquent balance of $1000 or higher. Upon graduation, a student must pay all outstanding obligations to the university prior to receiving a diploma and transcripts. A student who is no longer enrolled at the university and has an outstanding balance must make satisfactory payment arrangements or the account may be placed with a collection agency, incur additional collection agency/legal fees of up to 33 1/3% of the balance due, and be reported to credit reporting agencies. CARLOW UNIVERSITY CREDIT HOUR POLICY Carlow University complies with federal (U.S. Department of Education) and Middle States Commission of Higher Education (MSCHE) and Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) regulations pertaining to degree requirements and credit hours. Carlow University undergraduate degrees require the successful completion of 120 semester credit hours. All graduate degrees require a minimum of 30 semester credit hours. Carlow University's academic year is separated into fall, spring and summer semesters. Fall and spring are traditionally 15 weeks in length with an additional week for finals. Accelerated semesters (CAP/WEC) are typically five or eight weeks in length. Summer classes generally run for eight weeks. All formats, including traditional semester--length classes and the accelerated and summer formats, must comply with the university credit hour policy. All new courses will have a credit hours calculation worksheet completed as part of new course development. For accelerated and weekend courses, faculty must also document, through their extended syllabi how CAP/WEC courses will meet the minimum semester credit hour requirement. In addition, existing courses are reviewed periodically by the college dean and Office of the Registrar to ensure that the workload is consistent with the potential credits to be earned. BACKGROUND The U.S. Department of Education, at 34 CFR Section 600.2, defines "credit hour" as: "…an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:</p><p>(1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out--of--class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or, (2) at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours." The Pennsylvania regulation states, in part, "A semester credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty. A quarter credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 10 hours or classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty." 22 Pa. Code Section 31.21(b).u The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, in its Credit Hour Policy, effective August 23, 2013, requires institutions to verify compliance with Credit Hour regulations. CARLOW UNIVERSITY CREDIT HOUR POLICY Carlow University has adopted the credit hour as the unit measure of instruction for awarding credit. At Carlow University, a credit hour is equivalent to one hour of classroom instruction (50 minutes) with a normal expectation of two hours of outside study for each class session. Typically, a three--semester credit hour course meeting for 45 total hours over 15 weeks requires 90 total hours of out of class academic engagement. Carlow adheres to the Federal standard of a total expectation of 45 total learning hours (15 hours for every 1 credit earned) in a semester regardless of time frame of delivery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CARLOW UNIVERSITY COURSE METHODS Delivery method:</head><p>1. Onsite-All classes meet at a site (can be a combination of campus and another site, ex. Clinical Rotation or Student Teaching). 2. Hybrid-Online meetings reduce the number of face--to--face meetings. Hybrid courses will have meeting dates onsite. 3. Online-All content is delivered online. There are no required face--to--face meetings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Levels of synchronicity:</head><p>1. Completely Synchronous-Regardless of whether the faculty member and students are in the same location or are online, they have at least 45 hours together at the same time (in real time) for a 3--credit lecture or seminar course. 2. At least 50% synchronous-Regardless of whether the faculty member and students are in the same location or are online, they have at least 22.5 hours but less than 45 hours together at the same time (in real time) for a 3--credit lecture or seminar course. CAP/WEC college format courses generally follow this formula. 3. Less than 50% synchronous-Regardless of whether the faculty member and students are in the same location or are online, they have more than 0 but less than 22.5 together at the same time (in real time) for a 3--credit lecture or seminar course. 0 but less than 21 hours for CAP/WEC college format. 4. Completely Asynchronous-The faculty member and students do not meet in real time together. This would be a pure online section with no real--time meetings. week. Credit Hours for Online, Hybrid, and Accelerated/Weekend Courses Credit hours for online or hybrid learning courses, as well as accelerated and weekend courses at Carlow, must adhere to the Federal standard of a total expectation of 45 total learning hours for every 1 credit (15 hours of instruction with 30 hours of out of class academic engagement) earned in a semester regardless of time frame of delivery. All course developers are expected to complete the credit hours calculation worksheet as part of new course development. For accelerated and weekend courses, faculty must also document, through their extended syllabi how CAP/WEC courses will meet the minimum semester credit hour requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculating Credit Hours for Synchronous or Asynchronous Environments</head><p>The following is a brief description of the types of activities that can be included in learning hour calculations. Many courses will present unique learning activities not directly covered in the exact or estimated equivalent examples provided below. Equivalent Instructional Activities contribute toward the total number of learning hours by using the following examples:</p><p>• Exact Equivalent (1:1, i.e. one learning or contact hour for every hour spent) •</p><p>Face--to--face or live synchronous sessions, such as classroom or web--based lectures or class sessions, real--time chat sessions, or conference calls • Other live 'classroom' time (i.e. internships or practica, guided field experiences [museum or facility tours], studio work, virtual or at--home labs for chemistry/biology, service projects, etc.) Homework/Working Problems time (instructor estimation of time to be spent) ACCEPTABLE RANGES OF STUDENT LEARNING HOURS Given the diversity of course offerings and delivery and instructional formats, calculating student learning hours requires flexibility. Because of this, the following chart was devised to provide a foundation for calculating student learning hours. Equivalent Instructional Activities helps to supplement time when courses do not meet the traditional (45 total learning hours, 15 hours for every 1 credit earned).</p><p>• This follows the federal guideline for every one hour in class the student will have two hours of work outside the classroom. For courses with abbreviated contact hours, the out of class academic engagement will be supplemented via Equivalent Instructional Activities.</p></div>

At Carlow, scholar-practitioner is more than a professional role and goes beyond the acquisition of specific skill sets or application of best practices. Scholar--practitioner is a way of being in and relating to the world. Those who embody the stance of scholar practitioner understand that teaching is a daunting task and a challenging endeavor. It is a vocation that when taken seriously demands moral vision and intellectual rigor. At Carlow we believe that scholar--practitioners in the professional field of education embody six intertwining qualities: metacognitive reflection, theoretical understanding, pedagogical wisdom, contextual literacy, ethical stewardship, and aesthetic imagination. Graduates of all undergraduate and graduate programs of study in the Education Department will embody the qualities of a Carlow scholar--practitioner as manifested by their capacity for metacognitive reflection, theoretical understanding, pedagogical wisdom, contextual literacy, ethical stewardship, and aesthetic imagination. Graduates of all undergraduate and graduate programs of study in the Education Department will demonstrate the ability to be reflective in action, capable of creating and serving in high performance learning environments, and will support and respect the dignity and diversity of all learners.</p></div>

If you are interested in working with children and youth with autism spectrum disorders, including autism, pervasive developmental disorder (PDD and PDD--NOS), Asperger syndrome, Rett's syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), this program will prepare you to design effective programs for your students. Through a four--course sequence, students become familiar with the theories and methods proven to be successful in working with the ASD population. The first course in the sequence, SPED 472: Positive Behavior Supports PK--8 or SPED 474: Positive Behavior Supports 7--12, provides a foundation of Applied Behavioral Analysis, including conducting Functional Behavior Assessments (FBAs) and designing Behavior Interventions (BIPs). The second course, SPED 460: Communication and Assistive Technologies, focuses on typical challenges for students with ASD in developing effective communication and provides an in-depth exploration of the various assistive technologies, including augmentative communication systems that improve opportunities for students to access the general education curriculum or to develop functional communication skills. The third course, SPED 478: Autism, explores the evidence--based practices for teaching children who are on the spectrum including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), TEACCH, Early Start Denver Model, Discrete Trial Training (DTT), Verbal Behavioral Intervention (VBI), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), and Pivotal Response Training (PRT). The final course in the sequence, SPED 788: Applied Issues in ASD, addresses professional ethics, co--morbidity and medications, and parental collaboration. Central to the final course is the opportunity to apply the methods previously explored in a classroom or therapeutic setting. The four courses are offered in either the traditional classroom on our Oakland campus or through our digital learning environment (DLE), available online. The fourth (last) class is an exclusively online course.</p></div>

By exploring all genres of literature and workshopping creative pieces with peers and professional authors, students expand their abilities to consider important concepts including context, image, voice, and audience. Students may concentrate on poetry, fiction, or creative nonfiction. Students may develop additional experience in editing, writing, graphic design, and planning literary events through internships with The Critical Point (the university's journal of visual and literary arts), Dionne's Story (an anthology of original writing connected to Dionne's Project), the Hungry Sphinx Reading Series (an interactive series between the community and the university), and Voices from the Attic (the annual anthology of the Madwomen in the Attic). Students who minor in Creative Writing must take a minimum of 18 credits in Creative Writing. The student and faculty advisor will design the program that best suits the student's needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGLISH MAJOR</head><p>The English major provides a strong foundation in British and American literature, world literature, major writers, and linguistics. Students who major in English have the flexibility to focus on additional areas of interest by taking a variety of electives, combining their degree with a secondary education certification, or pursuing a double major or minor in creative writing or professional writing. Many major courses highlight women writers' contributions to the history of literature. English majors develop the ability to read critically, to communicate clearly and confidently, and to conduct research with an open and analytical mind. The major prepares students for many professions that require strong analytical thinking and exceptional communication skills, including fields such as teaching, publishing, public relations, and law. English majors may develop additional skills and professional experience through membership in Sigma Tau Delta (the English Honors Society) and editorial internships for The Critical Point and Dionne's Story anthologies. Three English electives (9 credits), which may include internship experience. The requirements are the same for English majors seeking certification in secondary education or preparing for graduate study in English, but students intending to pursue a graduate degree in English should take at least two semesters of foreign language to meet the world literature/language requirement. Students who have an undergraduate degree and are applying for secondary certification must have Chaucer (EN 207), Linguistics (EN 220), Shakespeare (EN 301), American literature, and world literature. In general, such students must take a minimum of two upper division English courses at Carlow. Students who combine an English major with a major in another discipline must fulfill a minimum of 26 to 27 credits in English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGLISH MINOR</head><p>Students who minor in English must take a minimum of 18 credits in English. The student and faculty advisor will design the program that best suits the student's needs. English minors have opportunities to explore literature that intrigues them, through topics as diverse as crime fiction, Irish literature, and environmental justice literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEATRE MINOR</head><p>The Theatre minor requires a minimum of 18 credits including TR 103 and TR 205. The student and advisor will plan the program in accordance with the student's interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES MINOR</head><p>Women's and Gender Studies courses look at contemporary and historical research about and creative productions by women; raise new questions which are relevant to women in global cultures; question sex role relationships and basic social assumptions regarding women's roles; and encourage students and faculty to do research and creative productions about gender issues. Women's and Gender Studies incorporate interdisciplinary concepts and methods and question masculine biases across the disciplines. Courses explore the historical condition of women, the interpretation of women in the various disciplines, and the present and future position of women in society. The program fosters new scholarship in order to understand the cultural history of gendered experiences as well as to debate gendered situations today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements:</head><p>The Women's and Gender Studies program offers an introductory course, a course in feminist theory, and a course in global perspectives. Students who would like to minor in Women's and Gender Studies should first enroll in level--one courses, in the order in which they appear below, before moving on to level--two courses, which are cross--listed in various departments and programs. The Women's and Gender Studies program requests that the two cross--listed courses not be from the same discipline/department and that the student also complete one Women's and Gender Studies elective. Under this structure, the total credits needed for the minor in Women's and Gender Studies is 18.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Required Core Women's and Gender Studies Courses:</head><p>• Theology GENERAL STUDIES MAJOR The Bachelor of Arts in General Studies is designed for the student who wishes to pursue a university degree grounded in the liberal arts in the most expedient, yet enriching, way possible. The student fulfills the specified Compass required of all Carlow University students but enjoys a maximum degree of flexibility in choosing the remaining courses. It is a viable option for the student with varied interests who wishes, for example, to study the plays of Shakespeare in one course, pursue the theories of economics in another, and focus on biblical interpretation in yet another. A required concentration in one area of study assures that the student will reach a level of progressive depth in a single discipline of his/her choice. This is also an excellent program for a student who is currently employed but can advance further in the workplace with a university degree. With the help of an advisor, the student can creatively shape the direction of studies in light of personal and professional goals. This program will be particularly beneficial to students who have decided to exit their original major but who still desire to graduate in a timely manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</head><p>• Students must successfully achieve 120 credits in order to graduate. A minimum 2.0 grade point average is required. • All students must fulfill the requirements of the Carlow Compass. •</p><p>In addition to the Carlow Compass, each student must choose one area of concentration, taking a minimum of 12 credits in one discipline. At least two of those courses must be at the 200 level or higher. Note: Students may not minor in the same subject in which they have a concentration. •</p><p>In the last semester, the student will produce a thesis or project that demonstrates integrative thinking and proficiency of the Program of Study outcomes. This will be chosen and completed under the direction of the program advisor. •</p><p>The remaining credits needed to reach 120 will be considered electives chosen at the discretion of the student in conjunction with the advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HISTORY MAJOR</head><p>The study of history and the skills developed in writing history provide a sound basis for positioning students in the increasingly competitive job markets of today and tomorrow, for their formal and informal education later in their lives, as well as during their college years. A major in History is one of the best foundations for success in career and academic plans. Knowledge of history is essential for success in a rapidly changing world. Understanding humanity's recorded experience gives students the information and perspective they need in order to be able to think in an orderly way about the world: its economics, politics, cultures, legal systems, and religions. History also provides students with a context for better understanding and enjoying literature, music, and the arts, all of which are in part reflections of the times in which they were produced. Equally important are the skills in research and writing developed in the course of historical study. These skills are readily transferable to everyday life, future scholarship, and a career. The quality performance of History majors in law, business, education, government, journalism, television and radio, and the arts has long been recognized. A major in History is a good preparation for graduate study in History or other humanities. The History major program can be combined with virtually any minor program at Carlow. History is also an ideal second major augmenting the advantages of almost any field of study. Graduates from Carlow with a degree in History should:</p><p>• Exhibit in--depth knowledge in a specialty area coupled with a broad familiarity with other histories, Western and/or non--Western, and a solid foundation in methodology; • Produce scholarship sensitized to the issues of class, race, gender, and sexual orientation, manifestly utilizing cross--cultural and transnational perspectives, leadership issues, and peace and justice considerations; • Demonstrate familiarity with current concerns and debates within historiography, and the social and cultural significance of these debates; • Show knowledge and versatility adequate for entrance to and successful completion of an MA and/or PhD program in history or another superior degree in other related graduate programs, or to pursue a career in journalism, the media, or the arts upon graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements:</head><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional History Courses (15 credits)</head><p>• 15 credits in History in consultation with your advisor. HISTORY MINOR Students who minor in History must take a minimum of 15 credits in History. The student and faculty member will design the program that best suits the student's needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIBERAL STUDIES MAJOR</head><p>A Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies provides an ideal major for the creative, independent student who is interested in an interdisciplinary focus. This major takes on the characteristics of a "guided studies" or "directed studies" program whereby the student, working closely with the program advisor, has the opportunity to "create a major" according to personal education and career goals. This major further allows the student to gain significant depth in three areas of study and, at the same time, to acquire the breadth that is characteristic of a liberal arts education. While a degree in Liberal Studies is a very practical degree in itself, this major is also an ideal preparation for students who are planning to pursue studies beyond the bachelor degree level. It is especially practical for students who have particular career goals that require in--depth study in more than one academic area. It is an individually designed program of study whereby students choose three minors. At least two minors must be from any of the liberal arts programs such as those found in the humanities, art, the sciences, English, Women's Studies, and the social sciences. Students may choose one minor in an area outside of the liberal arts programs-Accounting, Business Management, Human Resources, Information Technology, or Health Coach minor.  <ref type="figure">(IS 400, 1--4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>credits)</head><p>During the senior year, the student will produce a senior project that reflects the learning outcomes of the program. While this project will be created in conjunction with the program advisor, the student will be free to choose a project faculty director from any of the chosen minor fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Carlow Compass</head><p>Any of the Carlow Compass courses can be counted toward the minors where applicable, as well as to the Liberal Studies major as a whole. MODERN LANGUAGES MINOR Students may earn a minor in Modern Languages by achieving six semesters of foreign language study. At least three of those semesters must be obtained at Carlow by studying language in a Carlow University--approved study abroad program language course, a PCHE language course, or by completion of EN 220 Linguistics. The balance may be achieved by transferring credits. Eligible credits include:</p><p>• Credits earned on study abroad prior to transfer to Carlow OR during enrollment at Carlow • Credits earned through study at a PCHE institution (These are cross--registered, not transferred credits.) • Credits transferred from another college or university at the time of transfer admission PHILOSOPHY MINOR As a minor, Philosophy provides a strong humanities background for students whose primary major-perhaps Biology or Business Management-may not provide this opportunity. Additionally, Philosophy is a superb complement to majors such as Psychology or Education. With its emphasis on language skills, critical thinking, and abstract reasoning, Philosophy is a minor with numerous practical applications. A Philosophy minor can be obtained by completing at least 15 credits (five courses) in the field of philosophy. Philosophy minors should meet with the members of the Philosophy Department about which courses would be most appropriate for their degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEOLOGY MINOR</head><p>Theology is a scholarly study of the mystery of human existence and the interdependence of women and men as they relate to God. Theology examines the human experiences that have given rise to questions of religion such as the meaning of life and death, the existence of a personal God, the search for human values, issues of peace and justice, contemporary spirituality, and ministry of the laity. These questions have no answers. Rather, they invite inquiry into reality in a unique way by engaging one in reflection that yearns for Sabbath, i.e. sacred time set aside to ponder the depth of the richness and wisdom of God in human beings, in human history, and in all of creation. Following upon this, it seems that the theology student comes to this discipline already with a prerequisite: the desire to rest in the depths of holy mystery. The theology minor provides the discipline necessary for this unique way of inquiry through a sequence of courses in scriptural, historical, systematic, and moral theology, and pastoral ministry. The Theology minor is a perfect augment to many majors. Students majoring in the Social Sciences, Education or Nursing have found that theological studies can provide a greater depth as to how and why we care about the many issues in society, education and health care. Students in the empirical sciences can be enriched by Theology's encompassing approach to the natural world as a window that reveals the presence of divine activity in the cosmos. Finally, students who choose Liberal Studies as a major will find the Theology minor to be an exciting complement to their other minors. Students who minor in Theology must take 18 credits in the department including TH 101. The student and advisor plan the program in accordance with the student's interests.</p></div>

Included among the topics addressed are the history of special education; its legal and legislative foundation; and the purpose of the Individual Education Plan (IEP), its development and requirements for implementation. A focus on the nature and causes of disabilities will give students an overview of the needs of exceptional children. The entire range of disabilities requiring special education intervention will be addressed. This includes children with hearing losses; visual problems; speech disorders; attention deficit; traumatic brain injury; autism; emotional, behavioral, and social disorders; mental retardation; learning disabilities; physical disabilities; and giftedness. Current trends will focus on minority representation, inclusion, and standards. Models for collaboration, including the multidisciplinary team and trans--disciplinary approaches for effective communication with family and among related service providers, will be addressed. Finally, definitions, prevalence, causes, assessment, characteristics, and educational considerations for several exceptionalities will be reviewed. This course is designed to nurture in students a critical stance towards research, theory, and practice. The goal is that students become educated consumers of the special--education knowledge base. For this purpose, the prevailing as well as alternative perspectives on topics will be reviewed. In addition, cultural diversity and social justice will be emphasized throughout the course. 3 credits SPED 332 Instructional Support in Reading, Writing, and Mathematics Designed for the general education teacher, this course focuses on prevention and early intervention for struggling learners in general and inclusive classrooms.

Effective instructional practices that support transition at each level will be a central part of this course, as will the range of delivery methods for effective transition. Transition remains a challenge for individuals with disabilities, despite the focus on providing students with disabilities access to the general education. Special educators need to understand the processes and procedures of transition from secondary school to post--secondary settings. They must develop facility with the tools that support transition regardless of the setting in which education takes place. A key focus will be on the vocational choices, training, and education available to young adults with disabilities and the major societal challenges that face young adults as they make the transition into adulthood. Understanding transition assessment and incorporating transition planning into IEP development will also be a focal point of this course. The differing legal requirements between the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act will be a central part of this course. The field component of this course involves visits to sites that prepare individuals with disabilities to enter the post--school environment. 3 credits</p></div>

Juniors and seniors admitted to this program would be permitted to take MFF courses while they are still undergraduate students. This includes the following:</p><p>1. MFF 710 Fraud and Forensics Community Experience, (2 credits), starts each August 2. MFF 711 White Collar Crime, (3 credits), fall semester 3. MFF 721 Legal Elements of Fraud, (3 credits), spring semester. The courses offered have been pre--selected as optimal for undergraduate students. To be given graduate credit, all graduate courses must be passed with a B--or above. These eight credits will also be counted toward the 120 credits needed for the undergraduate degree and be concurrently posted on the graduate transcript. Graduate courses will count for graduate credit only if the student earns a B--or higher; graduate courses will count for undergraduate credit even if the student earns a C+ through D--. This opportunity can save students time and money if they are planning on start Carlow's MFF program upon graduation. This is also an opportunity for students to engage in higher--level work and interact with graduate students while completing their undergraduate coursework. The classes will have both undergraduate and graduate students. To remain in this program, students will need to maintain a 3.0 overall GPA average. The opportunity to enter the Fraud and Forensics program will present a path to a graduate degree unlike that offered by other universities. This program is an Accelerated Bachelor's to Master's degree program. However, the student does not complete the program any faster-it takes an additional year regardless of taking MFF courses during their undergraduate career. As a result, the student does not graduate from the MFF any earlier. Accelerated Master of Science in Fraud and Forensics begins at the start of the student's senior year. In addition to the requirements for enrolling in Carlow's accelerated programs (Accelerated Programs section above), entrance into the accelerated master of science in fraud and forensics program requires that MFF 710 Fraud and Forensics Community Experience (2 credits) be taken prior to beginning the program. Final and full admission to the MFF may be granted upon completion of the undergraduate degree from Carlow.</p></div>

Students receive grounding in all three disciplines, in addition to coursework in neuroscience specifically. Students must choose one of the two possible tracks within the major. The Neuroscience with Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring (IONM) track prepares students for a career in IONM. Students are prepared in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuropharmacology, and finish the degree with instructors at UPMC's Procirca -Center for Clinical Neurophysiology, where they receive instruction and hands--on training in the operating room. This highly specialized training allows students to observe and assist in up to 150 surgical cases to accumulate the clinical hours necessary to take the ABRET's Certification in Neurophysiologic Intraoperative Monitoring (CNIM) Exam to be a certified Surgical Neurophysiologist. The Neuropsychology track prepares students for graduate work in neuropsychology or psychology and, ultimately, a career in either area. Neuropsychologists also study the connection between the brain and behavior; this career option often focuses on assessment of neuropsychological functioning in patients. The Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience is designed for students who are not majoring in Behavioral Neuroscience. It is of particular interest to Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry majors who would like to focus on Behavioral Neuroscience without majoring in this area. However, other majors are welcome to take this minor, which gives students preparation in all three disciplines <ref type="bibr">(psychology, chemistry, &amp; biology)</ref> and some beginning groundwork in Neuroscience. A minimum of 20 credits are required as follows: PY/BIO 230I or <ref type="bibr">BIO/PY 230,</ref><ref type="bibr">NEU 220,</ref><ref type="bibr">BIO 110,</ref><ref type="bibr">PY 101,</ref><ref type="bibr">PY 280,</ref><ref type="bibr">CHM 111,</ref><ref type="bibr">CHM 113</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HEALTHCARE DATA ANALYTICS MAJOR</head><p>From the moment you check in to a hospital or medical provider's office, you start generating information. Every interaction, every lab result, x--ray, diagnostic, prescription, diagnosis, or procedure is collected and kept safe and secure, available to you and your providers to establish a cogent medical history to better serve you. But that information can also do so much more. It's up to the Healthcare Data Analytics specialists to use -and protect -that date in meaningful ways. It's a discipline that combines medicine, business, and information. Medicine: One way a healthcare data analyst can use data is predictive: does your health history indicate an increased chance of something more serious? Maybe a treatment successfully used on other patients would work on your chronic condition, too. As patients continue along on whatever paths through the healthcare system, the valuable data they create can be used, anonymously, to assist in finding larger trends in the ever--changing health landscape. Business: These trends don't just matter to the patients affected by them -they matter to the providers and insurers, too. Health data is used to make business function better, to streamline information--gathering technologies, to simplify and secure the health records themselves, or to connect better treatments to more cost--effective practices. A healthcare data analyst is also a business specialist. Information: Data protection is more and more important with each passing day, and healthcare data professionals are at the front lines of the battle against leaks, hacks, and information mismanagement. They're the people developing and implementing the best practices in keeping patient data safe, secure, and easily accessible.</p></div>
