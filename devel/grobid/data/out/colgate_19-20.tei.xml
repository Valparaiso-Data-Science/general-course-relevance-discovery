Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> projects. This option is open to students who have completed their Core requirements with the requisite average grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For additional information see the Liberal Arts Common Core</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Requirement</head><p>Foreign language competence is of critical value in understanding today's world. In addition, language skills are required by many graduate schools and may be necessary to qualify for certain professional positions, particularly in today's global economy.</p><p>The graduation requirement of competence in a foreign or classical language may be demonstrated in one of three ways:</p><p>1. by successfully completing at least three years of study of one foreign or classical language (through the third level) in a secondary school prior to enrolling at Colgate; 2. by demonstrating basic language skills as measured by tested proficiency (e.g., a score of 580 or better on the SAT Subject Tests in a foreign or classical language); 3. by successfully completing the study of a foreign or classical language at Colgate through at least one term at the intermediate level.</p><p>Students are expected to complete the language requirement by the end of the fourth term at Colgate. A registration hold will be placed on the record of a student who fails to satisfy the requirement by this time. The student will be required to register for an appropriate course in the fifth term. The registration hold will remain in place until the requirement has been satisfied.</p><p>Language study is also required prior to participation in some of Colgate's off-campus study groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-Year Seminars</head><p>Director Bary</p><p>First-year seminars (FSEMs) are designed to introduce students to a variety of liberal arts topics, skills, and ways of learning, including the importance of academic integrity. The FSEM emphasizes all aspects of the learning process including the exploration of individual needs and strengths, interactions with classmates, and the multiplicity of resources beyond the classroom. Special emphasis is placed on improving writing skills and using the library's many resources. The merging of these elements into a single course provides a prime opportunity for the student to obtain a breadth of college-level experience and academic perspective. Many first-year seminars will earn credit within the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, including Areas of Inquiry. FSEMs are listed each year in the first-year student registration materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC)</head><p>Colgate University seeks to create an international ethos for the liberal arts by expanding the range of curricular settings in which students and professors can develop and use foreign language skills. Beyond the foreign language departments, faculty in various departments and programs encourage the use of foreign language materials in their curricula, and certain courses -such as literature in translation -offer FLAC sections in which students can engage with the material in the relevant foreign language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Arts Degree (AB) Programs</head><p>The major programs are approved by the Dean's Advisory Council and registered officially with the New York State Education Department. Specific major and honors requirements are found in Majors and Minors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Major</head><p>Some students elect to fulfill the requirements for two separate majors. This choice helps focus the plan of study but greatly reduces one's freedom in electing courses each semester.</p><p>Students wishing to declare a second major must formally file their plan with the registrar by the end of fullterm course withdrawal period in the first term of the senior year.</p><p>The form filed first will be considered the primary major, unless the registrar is informed that the second form filed is to be the primary major. Students who elect to complete a double major must let each supervising department or program know that a second major is being pursued.</p><p>A course may be used to satisfy requirements in both majors. A student will only be considered to have completed a double major when at least seven of the courses completed in fulfillment of each major are unique. If the primary major requires cognate courses (which must be taken but which are not actually considered part of the major), these cognate courses may be counted toward the second major. The minimum GPA of 2.00, required for completion of the primary major, also applies to a second major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors in Major</head><p>Students who earn honors in their majors have so mastered their disciplines that they are able to complete with distinction original work appropriate to their chosen fields of study. While specific requirements differ, all majors (except topical majors) offer the opportunity to pursue honors or high honors. Most major honors require completion of department or program courses with a designated grade point average (GPA) as well as a project designed and pursued independently under the guidance of a faculty sponsor. Departments and programs will determine whether the oral presentation and/or written reports are of a quality appropriate for honors. For details consult the departmental or program major listed alphabetically in Departments and Programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Honors</head><p>Students who maintain a consistently high grade point average (GPA) throughout their academic careers are recognized for their achievements by the awarding of university honors at graduation. University honors are summa cum laude <ref type="bibr">(3.80</ref> for all courses attempted), magna cum laude <ref type="bibr">(3.50)</ref>, and cum laude <ref type="bibr">(3.30)</ref>. GPAs for university honors are established and reviewed by the Dean's Advisory Council. A minimum of 22</p><p>Students who study on a Colgate-directed study group or on an external approved program continue to pay Colgate tuition and are eligible for Colgate need-based financial aid when studying off campus. Students are billed for tuition by Colgate for the semester they will be off campus plus the cost of any room, board, or other expenses charged by the study group or approved program. Students are responsible for paying other non-billable expenses, such as airfare, government visas, books, refundable deposits, optional fees, and personal incidentals directly. Off-campus study cost estimates are available on the OCS web pages at colgate.edu/OCS.</p><p>Students receiving need-based financial aid will have their financial aid package reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid for the semester they will be abroad. Financial aid is applied to students' accounts at the time of billing. Students are responsible for paying any balance due to Colgate. If there is a credit due, it will be released to the student shortly before the start of the semester.</p><p>Financial aid may be increased to meet the additional cost of off-campus study for only one semester and one extended study. Students participating in an additional semester-long or extended study program will have their awards capped at the amount they would have received if they were to have remained on campus.</p><p>For information regarding withdrawal from off-campus study, see Withdrawal and Refund Policy section in Expenses.</p><p>As a way of ensuring an immersive study abroad experience, students participating on approved programs that are hosted in a non-English speaking country or in a country in which English is one of many official languages, are required to take at least one language class in that program's native language or one course taught in a local language other than English during the program. Please consult the Off-Campus Study website for a list of language requirements for each country. Ordinarily, exceptions will not be granted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extended Study</head><p>A number of Colgate courses offer short-term study components that extend the course for three weeks beyond the campus and beyond the regular term. These programs offer opportunities for students to gain access to institutions and individuals relevant to their coursework that are not available on campus.</p><p>Extended study is particularly attractive to students whose schedules do not permit them to participate in semester-long programs. The university has developed some twenty extended study courses, of which five or six are offered each year.</p><p>Prerequisites may exist for extended study courses. Any seniors electing to participate in a spring extended study will graduate at the next degree conferral date, but will be eligible to apply for participation in the May commencement ceremony. Please refer to the student handbook for details on commencement participation.</p><p>New extended study courses are added on a regular basis. Please see the OCS web page for a complete listing of courses offering extended study components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Engineering Studies</head><p>Adviser Tseng</p><p>To combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University (St. Louis), under which a competent student may pursue this option. He or she may earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions by spending three years at Colgate as a physics major and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan). The pre-engineering student may be ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Students who wish to gain New York State teacher certification have the option of completing their professional semester in the fall term following graduation as part of the ninth semester program. To be eligible for this special program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification requirements prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their junior year. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the MAT adolescence programs are accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) for a period of seven years from May 7, 2014 until May 7, 2021.</p><p>Successful completion of all requirements in all teacher preparation programs leads to recommendation for New York State initial teacher certification.</p><p>For more information see educational studies department page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium</head><p>Established with the support of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium facilitates collaboration among its member institutions in fulfilling their educational missions and serving the public good. Through the sharing of expertise and resources, the Consortium enhances options for students, faculty, and staff. In addition to Colgate, members of the consortium include Hamilton College, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Skidmore College, St. Lawrence University, and Union College.</p><p>Students who have completed at least one semester at Colgate have the opportunity to participate in a collaborative cross-registration program made possible through the New York Six Consortium. To be eligible to cross-register, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 3.00 course credits at Colgate. Courses taken as part of this cross-registration program will count as institutional (Colgate) credit, and grades earned will be recorded on the Colgate transcript and calculated into the Colgate grade point average. Because crossregistered courses count as part of the student's full-time Colgate course load, no additional tuition is assessed by the host institution. Normally students may only cross-register for one New York Six course per term. A maximum of three New York Six credits will count toward the Colgate degree. For additional information, please refer to the registrar's office web pages at colgate.edu/registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Less-Commonly Taught Language Program</head><p>The Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTL) Program provides opportunities for students to study languages not available through the regular Colgate curriculum. LCTL courses are offered through two methods: shared course initiatives with instructors located on other campuses and self-instructional language courses overseen by the Director of the Keck Center for Language Study and the Language Council. LCTL courses are never offered for languages being taught on campus at Colgate nor do they count toward the completion of Colgate's language requirement. The Language Council regularly reviews the effectiveness of LCTL courses to determine whether they are suitable for the Colgate curriculum.</p><p>Upon approval from the Language Council, the Curriculum Committee, the Registrar, and any other relevant program of study, shared courses will be listed among the course offerings. Students will receive credit for courses taught by the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium members according to the guidelines of that agreement. Courses taught at any other institution will be treated as transfer credit. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phi Beta Kappa</head><p>The Society of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1776; Colgate's chapter was organized in 1878. The Colgate chapter holds three elections each year, in September, February, and May. Seniors whose records of outstanding academic achievement are combined with the society's traditional regard for moral character and a broad liberal education may be invited to join Phi Beta Kappa in a formal initiation ceremony.</p><p>Minimum academic requirements include:</p><p>1. A course in mathematics, statistics, or logic (or AP equivalent) 2. Fluency in a second language, as demonstrated by a year of coursework at the intermediate level (or AP equivalent) or graduation from a non-English language secondary school. Transfer students should take note that election requires a minimum of 16 courses taken at Colgate for a grade, not under the S/U option.</p><p>For questions, contact Professor Jason Meyers, Associate Professor of Biology, President, Eta Chapter, Phi Beta Kappa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other national honorary societies</head><p>Colgate also has a chapter of the national honor society of Phi Eta Sigma for first-year students.</p><p>Honor societies in specific disciplines include  Lambda Alpha (Anthropology)  Eta Sigma Phi (The Classics)  Omicron Delta Epsilon (Economics)  Gamma Theta Upsilon (Geography)  Delta Phi Alpha (German)  Phi Alpha Theta (History)  Phi Delta Phi (Romance Languages and Literatures)  Pi Sigma Alpha (Political Science)  Psi Chi (Psychology)  Alpha Kappa Delta (Sociology)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career Services and Postgraduate Planning</head><p>The Center for Career Services supports Colgate University's mission by helping students to translate their liberal arts education into a lifetime of meaningful careers. Career services offers opportunities for students to assess their interests, skills, and values; to explore the world of work through hands-on experiences; and to learn life skills necessary to attain their career goals.</p><p>The Music and Youth Fellowship, established in 2011 by Gary Eichhorn '75 and Joan Eichhorn P'05, provides current students an opportunity to work in nonprofit youth development organizations in the Boston area over the summer months. Students partner with local organizations to teach vibrant music programs as a vehicle of developing self-confidence and self-esteem.</p><p>Summer on the Cuyahoga, sponsored by the Colgate Club of Cleveland, is a unique initiative designed to bring up to 10 Colgate undergraduates to Cleveland each summer for challenging paid internships, civic engagement, alumni connections, and social events to introduce them to the professional, civic, and personal offerings in northeast Ohio.</p><p>The Internship Credit Program allows matriculated students who have completed at least one semester at Colgate, but have not yet completed their degree requirements, to earn academic credit for internships under the following circumstances: Students must apply to the Center for Career Services prior to the beginning of the internship for approval to earn academic credit; to be eligible for credit, the internship must entail a minimum of 120 work hours and the employer must require the award of academic credit as a condition of hiring. Approved internships carry 0.05 course credit and are graded on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis only. Students may complete a maximum of four unique internships, for a total of 0.20 credits. Internship credit appears on the transcript with a subject code of INTR and a course number corresponding to the student's class level. Students may not apply internship credit toward the requirements for the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internship Funds</head><p>Through the generous support of alumni and parents, Colgate offers grants to students seeking unpaid or underpaying opportunities outside of the university. These grants are awarded on a competitive basis:</p><p>The Career Services Internship Fund offers grants in support of unpaid or low-paid internships, research, and community service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High School Seminar Program</head><p>The High School Seminar Program provides opportunities for high school students from surrounding school districts to participate in late-afternoon non-credit bearing mini-seminars taught by Colgate faculty and administrators. For additional information, please contact the High School Seminar Coordinator at 315-228-7863. <ref type="bibr">______________________________________________________________________________________________________________</ref> This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Not more than one half of a student's course load in any one term may be courses of independent study, except with the permission of the associate dean of the faculty. Permission must be secured before the beginning of the term. 3. Independent study courses must be approved by the faculty supervisor and the appropriate department chair or program director no later than the last day of the drop/add period in any term. 4. Independent study courses are not offered to students free of charge. Tuition is charged for independent studies according to the established rates whether taken as part of a full-time or parttime course load. 5. A student who wishes to take an independent study course during a fall or spring semester when not in residence at Colgate must secure the approval of the faculty supervisor, the appropriate department chair, and the Associate Dean of the Faculty before the beginning of the term. Students must also make appropriate arrangements with the registrar's office for independent study courses well in advance of the beginning of the term. Work equivalent to the course credits earned must be completed during the semester in which the credit is received. 6. Independent study courses are registered according to the level of the course, which usually corresponds to the student's class level. Sophomores who enroll for independent study courses will normally be registered at the 291 level, juniors at the 391 level, and seniors at the 491 level. Firstyear students normally do not enroll in independent study courses. 7. In rare cases, students may take a conventional course independently. This should be done only for compelling reasons, and explicit permission must be received in advance from the faculty supervisor and the appropriate department chair. Students enrolling in such a course will be registered according to the normal course number, to which the suffix Z is appended to indicate that the course is taken independently. 8. All work for independent study courses must be submitted by the last day of classes in the term to give the faculty supervisor sufficient time to evaluate the student's performance and submit the final course grade to the university registrar. For additional information regarding independent study policies and procedures, please refer to the registrar's office web page at colgate.edu/registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration Restrictions</head><p>A student may not register for a course that is a prerequisite for a course for which he or she has already received credit, unless permission is granted by the department chair/program director and the associate dean of the faculty. A student may not take crosslisted courses and receive credit for both courses. Students may not register for any courses that overlap in any of their scheduled times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating a Course</head><p>With written permission from the instructor, a student may repeat a course in which a grade of C-, C, or C+ is earned. Any course in which a grade of D+, D, D-, F, or U was received may be repeated in subsequent terms without permission of instructor. A student may not repeat a course in which a grade of B-or higher was earned. Students should declare to the registrar's office prior to registration that the course is being repeated.</p><p>A prerequisite course may not be repeated after the successful completion of a subsequent higher level course. Courses, including discontinued courses, may not be repeated by substituting a similar or comparable course currently in the curriculum. A repeated course must be taken in the same grading mode (i.e., conventional letter grade or S/U) as the original course. Additionally, the course must be taken in the same method (e.g., a conventional course cannot be repeated on an independent basis). Courses taken on ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019. Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. <ref type="bibr">41</ref> a Colgate study group may not be repeated on campus, and courses taken on campus may not be repeated on a Colgate study group, without the permission of the department chair/program director and associate dean of the faculty. A Colgate course may not be repeated by means of transfer credit from another institution, although credit for a course, with no GPA adjustment, may be earned if a student earned a grade of F or U in the equivalent Colgate course.</p><p>Only the highest grade of a repeated course will be calculated into the term and cumulative GPAs. Should a student earn the same grade on a second or subsequent attempt, only the first grade earned will be reflected in the student's term and cumulative GPAs. Credit from the repeated course will not be counted toward overall graduation credits. Students who complete a Colgate course that is a repeat of (or equivalent to) a transfer course or Advanced Placement will not receive duplicate credit. All grades earned in courses, including transfer or Advanced Placement, remain on the student's transcript, but will be noted as repeated. When a course is repeated after a grade of F has been assigned as a result of University Student Conduct Board action, both the original grade of F and the subsequent grade will be calculated into the cumulative GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading Policies</head><p>The grades used to indicate the quality of the student's performance in a completed course are as follows: A means excellent, B means good, C means satisfactory, D means poor but passing, F means failing. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by dividing the number of quality points by the number of course credits attempted for grades. Colgate grades are assigned the following quality points to full (1.00) credit courses: 6. Courses taken to fulfill the Common Core, Global Engagements, areas of inquiry, language, writing, and major or minor requirements may not be taken S/U. 7. The choice to take a particular course with the S/U option must be made prior to the end of the withdrawal period as published on the academic calendar. 8. No course will be officially recorded as using the S/U grading option unless the student has submitted the completed Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Option form to the registrar's office by the deadline. 9. After the end of the withdrawal period, no changes in the grading mode (conventional grade to S/U, or S/U to conventional grade) may be made. 10. In the event of a course's limited enrollment, a student's desire to take the course on the S/U basis shall not be a criterion in determining his or her eligibility for the course or course section. 11. To achieve the grade of S, the student must perform at a level that would warrant a grade of C-or better. 12. Satisfactory completion of a course is entered on the student's permanent transcript as S, but does not enter into the computation of the GPA. The unsatisfactory completion of a course is entered on the student's transcript as U, but does not enter into the computation of the GPA. No course credit is awarded for a grade of U. 13. Seniors, during their final semester, are discouraged from taking a course using the S/U option unless they will have a total of 32 course credits without the S/U course. For additional information regarding the S/U grade option, please refer to the registrar's office web page at colgate.edu/registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from a Course</head><p>Students are permitted to withdraw from a course without academic penalty until the mid-term date listed in the academic calendar. For fractional credit courses that meet for the first-or second-half of term students are permitted to withdraw without academic penalty prior to the appropriate date listed in the academic calendar. The required course withdrawal form is available in the registrar's office. Withdrawing from a course after the end of the drop/add period places a W on the transcript for the course. Students are cautioned to avoid a pattern of regularly accumulating W grades on their academic record. Withdrawals after the deadline are not permitted unless there are extraordinary circumstances (such as severe illness) that merit an exception. In those cases, a petition must be submitted to the administrative dean and approved by the Committee on Standards and Academic Standing (CSAS).</p><p>First-year students normally may withdraw from courses only for reasons beyond their ability to predict or control and only with approval of the course instructor and faculty adviser. First-year students in the fall semester must also receive approval from their administrative dean to ensure appropriate mentorship and support.</p><p>Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors may withdraw from courses only with the approval of the course instructor and faculty adviser. Sophomores, Juniors or Seniors are also encouraged to discuss the withdrawal with their administrative dean to ensure appropriate mentorship and support but are not required to obtain their signature.</p><p>International students must receive approval from their administrative dean, in addition to their faculty advisor and course instructor, to withdraw from a course regardless of their class year because such decisions may affect visa eligibility.</p><p>Student athletes must consult with the Director of Student-Athlete Academic Services, in addition to their faculty advisor and course instructor, when considering whether to withdraw from a class, as this decision may impact their NCAA athletic eligibility. Students receiving financial aid are limited to a total of 8 1. A student who fails to meet minimum GPA requirements (see "Minimum Academic Progress," above), either cumulatively or for any term, will be placed on academic warning during the next term of enrollment at Colgate, or will be suspended. 2. Any student on academic warning who fails to earn at least a 2.00 GPA for a term will be subject to academic suspension. 3. Any student who fails three or more courses during a term and/or who has a term or cumulative GPA of less than 1.33 will be subject to suspension even if the student is not on academic warning. 4. A student readmitted after academic suspension will be placed on warning for the term in which he or she returns. 5. A student who does not return from an academic suspension within four semesters will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for readmission through the Office of Admissions 6. A second academic suspension results in permanent academic dismissal.</p></div>

Colgate study group students who enroll in a host university will also need to comply with the host university's academic regulations and registration requirements. Students making changes to their curriculum must seek Colgate approval (as outlined below) before making final course selections.</p><p>A normal course load on a Colgate study group is four courses, unless a fifth course is a required part of the program.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement and Pre-matriculation Transfer Credit</head><p>Upon receipt of an official college transcript, students may be eligible to earn credit for courses taken at a regionally accredited college/university while a student is in secondary school. The courses may be considered for Colgate credit if satisfactorily completed (letter grade of C or better) and bear a minimum of three semester or five quarter hours.

Colgate has a long and proud history of graduating students who lead in all aspects of their lives. This program is part of a university-wide focus on ensuring that this great tradition endures.</p><p>The program has been thoughtfully designed to infuse leadership and global themes into the Colgate experience by providing scholars with activities and selected courses that will enrich and bring new perspectives to their experiences on campus and throughout their lives. Like all Colgate students, Benton Scholars have control of their course of study, as well as choice of major and activities. The program builds upon the Colgate experience rather than creating a separate track within it.</p><p>Those invited to participate in the Benton Scholars Program are students who have demonstrated not only the ability to think and lead, but also the passion to make a positive impact on the world. This program will sharpen skills, ignite new passions, and provide a platform to think globally about what it means to be a leader in the 21st century.</p></div>

Candidates chosen to be part of the program are a highly select group of students who have demonstrated creativity and determination in the face of personal, economic, and social challenges; they have systematically sought the most demanding academic paths open to them and dedicated themselves to achieving success. The OUS Scholars Program is a vibrant community of scholars who have a history of making significant and meaningful impacts on campus.</p><p>The OUS curricular program begins with the Summer Institute, a rigorous five-week, pre-first-year summer session designed to begin the transition to college. With courses taught by a select group of Colgate's excellent faculty, the Summer Institute fosters close and lasting student-faculty relationships and enhances the academic preparedness of OUS scholars. Each OUS cohort lives and learns together in a supportive family-like environment throughout their first year. This tight-knit community is further developed over four years at Colgate through a series of planned events and experiences, setting the stage for students to take on a wide array of scholarly pursuits, leadership roles, and community engagements.</p><p>Eligibility for admission to Colgate through OUS is determined at the time of admission, and no separate application is necessary. Questions about OUS admissions should be sent directly to the admission office. For more information about the OUS program, visit colgate.edu/ous.

Admission may be granted in the fall or spring. The application deadline for fall admission is March 15; for spring, November 1. (Candidates are notified of the admission decision by early May and early December, respectively.) A non-refundable application fee of $60 must accompany each application. This fee may be waived upon certification of extreme financial hardship or if the student has received a waiver from the Common or Coalition Application. The application fee is also waived for students whose permanent mailing address is outside the United States. Colgate does not accept transfer, visiting, or special exemption student applications for the undergraduate program from individuals who already possess a bachelor's degree.</p><p>Competition for admission with advanced standing is rigorous. Most successful transfer applicants will have achieved at or above the 3.00 (B) grade level during their previous college experience. Participants in the Visiting Student Program (see below) are eligible to apply for transfer to Colgate but should not expect to receive preferential treatment.</p><p>Application requirements: In addition to an application for transfer admission, Colgate reviews a full report of the candidate's secondary school record and the results of either the SAT or the ACT must be submitted. Official transcripts of all completed college studies should be forwarded immediately. The College Official's Report should be completed and submitted by the dean of each college attended, and the Faculty Recommendation should be completed by a faculty member who has taught the student and who can comment on the student's academic potential. Additional information about applications can be found at colgate.edu/apply.</p></div>

This deposit is applied to the overall program costs for the semester of participation or forfeited upon withdrawal from a program. Failure to pay the enrollment deposit will result in withdrawal from the program. If this payment presents a significant and demonstrable financial burden, a student accepted to a program may contact the Office of Off-Campus Study to submit a request to reduce the deposit, which will be considered on a case-by case basis with input from the Office of Financial Aid.</p><p>Refunds of Colgate tuition for off-campus study are governed by the university's refund policy.

Colgate is committed to meeting the demonstrated financial need of all admitted students, but the admission process is not need-blind.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility</head><p>A need-based financial aid package, including Colgate grant assistance, is offered to accepted students who file all required forms and statements on time and demonstrate that they cannot provide the full cost of a Colgate education through their own and their families' resources. A limited number of Colgate grant awards are reserved each year for international students. Believing that students should share responsibility for the cost of their education, the university makes use of available forms of self-help such as work opportunities and loans, as well as grants, in arranging financial assistance.</p><p>The amount of aid varies with need, as demonstrated by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS Profile TM . If parents are divorced or separated, information must be provided by each parent and/or by each parent and their spouse if the parent has remarried. The custodial parent (and spouse, if remarried) must complete the FAFSA and the CSS Profile TM . Further documentation may be required after initial review. Limitations 1. Colgate grant assistance is limited to a maximum of eight terms of enrollment for students who matriculate as first-year dependent students, regardless of whether or not they were aid recipients in any given term. Courses transferred to complete Colgate degree requirements will reduce this eligibility. 2. It is anticipated that students who first matriculate as dependent students will remain dependent for financial aid purposes through completion of their degree requirements. Increased grant assistance is not available to students who marry or who voluntarily declare themselves independent of their parents. Colgate is not able to offer assistance if parents decide that they no longer wish to support the student at Colgate. 3. Colgate grant assistance is applicable only to resident student programs and Colgate-directed offcampus programs and approved programs. 4. Colgate grant recipients could receive additional assistance for one Colgate-directed off-campus study group or approved program and one Colgate-directed extended study program. Colgate grant assistance is awarded to meet the extra costs after loans have been increased by $1,500. (For additional information, inquire at the Office of Financial Aid.) 5. Students attending another institution on an academic leave of absence are not eligible for state or institutional aid. 6. Visiting students are not eligible for Colgate financial assistance. 7. Financial aid is not available to international students who do not receive Colgate grant assistance as an entering student. 8. Students receiving federal or New York State financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress and pursuit of program standards for continuance of such aid. Those standards appear below in the New York State Programs section.</p><p>______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

To maintain good academic standing, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree and pursuing the program of study. Note that satisfactory academic progress for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program differs from federal satisfactory academic progress. Good academic standing for TAP is evaluated each semester in which a New York State award is received.</p><p>For pursuit of the program of study, students must enroll in a certain number of credit hours each semester and earn a specific number of credit hours for that semester. For the first year an award is received, a student must earn 50% of the minimum full-time course load for each term. For the second year an award is received, this is increased to 75%, and it increases to 100% in each term of the third year and subsequent semesters an award is received thereafter.</p><p>For satisfactory academic progress, students must maintain a specified grade point average and a pace leading to completion of his or her degree within a specified time period. The table below illustrates the specific requirements needed to receive TAP for satisfactory academic progress.

Total completed credits are calculated by dividing a student's total number of earned credits by a student's total number of attempted credits. Withdrawals, course incompletes, repetitions, and transfer credits (not including AP credits) are considered part of a student's attempted credit total. Students must also complete their programs within 150% of the normal program length. The maximum time frame is reached when the student has attempted more than one-and-one-half the number of course credit hours required to earn the degree. The maximum time-frame standard for transfer-students will consider only those course credit hours attempted at Colgate University, as well as those accepted for transfer credit by the university. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAT Curriculum and Degree Requirements</head><p>The MAT program provides advanced coursework in a selected discipline and in education, leading to secondary school teaching certification. In keeping with the character of our educational studies department, this program emphasizes that what and how we teach in public schools is connected with the struggle for global peace and social and environmental sustainability and justice. Subject areas in which certification is offered include English, mathematics, history, and natural science (biology, chemistry, earth science, or physics). The program is based on the premise that a prospective teacher should have a liberal education, thorough knowledge of his or her chosen discipline, a mastery of educational theory and practice, and a complex understanding of social institutions. A prospective teacher also needs habits of mind that include a willingness to move beyond personal comfort, and a desire to be challenged in all aspects of learning. MAT students work closely with departments to integrate increased knowledge in their disciplines with field experience in education which includes significant observation time and a full term of student teaching.</p><p>To receive the MAT degree, students complete between four and eight courses in educational studies, and at least three courses in their major depending on previous experience and coursework, a special project or thesis, and workshops on child abuse and violence prevention. Fingerprinting is also required by the State of New York. Students who are already certified at the secondary level may substitute two other education courses.</p><p>MAT students should enroll in educational studies courses at the 500 level. (See Educational Studies.) Courses taken by MAT students for degree credit in their disciplines of specialization will be assigned 500level numbers consecutively beginning with 591.</p><p>For each undergraduate course taken toward the MAT degree, a student must submit a Graduate Credit Agreement form prior to registration. This form is available online or from the registrar's office.</p><p>To be admitted to the program, a student must have a strong academic background in at least one area of certification, usually the equivalent of an undergraduate major. A background in the social, cultural, and developmental foundations of education is also desirable, but this background can be acquired in the program. In addition, two semesters of a foreign language or the equivalent is required. These courses may be transferred from another institution and must be approved by the educational studies department. Alternatively, the prerequisite courses may be part of the degree program.</p></div>

Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that human communities have continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. The course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with "The West," emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions. Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text. Complementary texts or visual materials from the ancient period, in and beyond the Western world, and/or response texts from the medieval or contemporary periods are added by faculty in individual sections.</p></div>

A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity. To ensure a substantially common experience for students, the staff each year chooses texts to be taught in all sections of the course. This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communities and Identities</head><p>Director Thomson</p><p>Courses in the Communities and Identities (CI) component are designed to provide a textured understanding of identities, cultures, and human experiences in particular communities and regions of the world. They seek to examine critically the multiple forms of social life that contribute to the world's cultural diversity, and to analyze the ways in which any one society functions as a unified whole and yet encompasses multiple, sometimes conflicting identities (based, for example, on gender, race, status, class, sexual identities, religion, and language). As investigations into a particular place and its extensions, they consider cultures and communities in their own right, with their own practices, histories, beliefs, and values, their own instantiations of modernity, and lastly, with their own capacities to produce and shape complex identities. Furthermore, because many of the societies that are the subject of study have had significant and enduring encounters with imperial powers or other forms of domination, these courses examine the tensions and permutations, asymmetries and alliances that such relationships have produced. Multidisciplinary in focus and materials, these courses explore the complex identities of persons through study of their geography, history, politics, and economics as well as their languages, literature, film, art, music, and religions. Students develop a comparative, historical frame of reference between the community being studied and the communities to which they belong.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Perspectives on the World</head><p>Director Metzler</p><p>All people routinely face important decisions about their own lives and about issues of broader social significance that require scientific literacy. In order to make thoughtful decisions about such matters, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of how scientific knowledge is obtained and an appreciation for the complexities of applying scientific findings to broader issues. The courses in the Scientific Perspectives (SP) program are designed to address both of these needs, and are unified by two common purposes. First, these courses deepen students' understanding of the methods used in scientific fields to acquire knowledge about the world. Each of the SP courses focuses on an area of scientific research to give students grounding in the interplay of scientific analysis, verification, and explanation. Second, the SP courses broaden students' understanding of the relevance of scientific methods by helping students to apply scientific methods and findings to a broad range of issues. Specifically, these courses help students to connect their growing understanding of scientific methods either to a topic relevant to society and the human experience or to an area of knowledge or mode of inquiry outside the natural sciences and mathematics. In ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019. Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. <ref type="bibr">93</ref> this way, SP courses are multi-disciplinary in focus. Because empirical methods and quantitative reasoning are used in a variety of disciplines, the topics of the SP courses span the study of the physical world, biological processes, human behavior, mathematical methods, and technological innovations. SP courses provide an illustration of the application of the scientific method through an active learning, problem-oriented experience for students.</p><p>Courses that may be crosslisted with Scientific Perspectives (e.g., COSC 100/CORE 126S, and COSC 150 /CORE 142S ) may not be used to satisfy both the Areas of Inquiry and Core SP requirements. Check the course offerings posted online each term for additional Scientific Perspectives offerings as well as selected first-year seminars that may fulfill this requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Engagements</head><p>Director Bary</p><p>Living thoughtfully in the multicultural, globalized world of the 21st century requires critical engagement with complex phenomena and varied perspectives. Courses in this component provide the opportunity to analyze the conditions and consequences of human diversity in its local and transnational forms. To satisfy this requirement, each student will successfully complete a designated course that inquires into the ways that people seek to make sense of a diverse and increasingly interconnected world. Global Engagements (GE) courses come from departments and programs throughout the university. A number of Colgate study group directors' courses have also been approved to satisfy this requirement. Transfer credit, including courses taken on Approved Programs, may not count toward the Global Engagement requirement. GE courses take a variety of forms. For instance, a course in this component might ask students to do one of the following:</p><p> examine the consequences of globalization in one or more of its many forms,  investigate issues or processes that have an impact that can be fully understood only by using a global perspective,  experience the cross-cultural understanding that comes from intensive language learning or study group participation,  cross boundaries by examining how diversity finds expression in human culture, or  consider human diversity in dimensions such as race, class, and gender.</p><p>Ultimately, the GE requirement seeks to empower students to live responsibly in contexts that require an understanding of the complexity of human beings and their impact, whether in the United States or in the broader world.</p><p>A Global Engagements course may count toward a student's major or minor; it may also fulfill an Areas of Inquiry requirement. Students are expected to take at least one CI or GE course that is not focused exclusively on the United States.</p></div>

Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper, ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019. Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. <ref type="bibr">94</ref> which may be relevant to the student's departmental or program honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways:</p><p> by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project;</p><p> by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or  by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental or program projects. If selected by the course instructors to enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A-or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental honors with the completion of the department honors project, and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation.</p></div>

Transfer credit for an English course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The transfer-credit adviser grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300-or 400level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major.</p></div>

Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. Many students come to Colgate with significant musical experience behind them, won through arduous and focused study. The fundamental aim of the curriculum in music is to develop that experience to its utmost potential. Performance ensembles and private instruction build directly on that experience, while classroom instruction introduces student musicians to important ideas, histories, and various cultures that inform and broaden that experience. Qualified students can choose to develop in ways that most interest them. Those who choose to major in music will find their development guided by a balanced program of performance and classroom studies. Graduating majors have gone on to graduate study in every area of music or have immediately entered careers in arts management, mathematics, medicine, law, business, sound engineering, and many other fields.</p><p>Another fundamental aim of the curriculum is to introduce students with little or no musical background into the world of music as part of Colgate's liberal arts program. These students should begin with MUSI 103, MUSI 111, MUSI 151, MUSI 161, or MUSI 221.</p><p>Upper-level courses divide into three groups: history, theory, and performance. The history courses are designed to give students an understanding of music through a study of composers and historical periods. The theory sequence teaches how music is put together and how to write it. The performance courses offer opportunities for students to engage in the art of performance and to gain credit in department-sponsored ensembles and private instruction.</p><p>Students with some musical background are encouraged to take MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 or MUSI 203 first. MUSI 215 and MUSI 216 can be taken in any order.</p><p>The music department offers extensive performing opportunities open to all qualified students regardless of major. The Colgate University Orchestra and Colgate University Choral Ensembles are the large performing organizations (auditions required). Performance opportunities are also offered in the Colgate Chamber Players (chamber music) and Colgate University Concert Jazz Ensemble. Private instruction in most instruments and in voice is available to students at an additional fee. All of these programs (except private instruction) may be elected on a credit or non-credit basis, and they are open to all Colgate students regardless of major.</p><p>The department recommends that students planning graduate work in musicology acquire background in foreign languages. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

In attempting to answer such questions, students of philosophy reflect on both their own responses to these questions and the ways in which past thinkers have defended their answers to them. The process of formulating and testing these answers requires education in logical analysis, reasoned argument, and analytic thinking. In acquiring such education within the philosophy curriculum, students develop their ability to solve problems and to think, read, and write critically -skills that are in high demand in a number of different professions. Philosophy majors go on to successful careers in law, consulting, finance, and medicine. Many have also embarked on academic careers.</p><p>But philosophy is about more than reflection and finding answers. As the love of wisdom, it is also a practice and a way of life, one characterized by openness to viewpoints other than one's own, a willingness to question both received opinions and one's own opinions, and a passionate concern to integrate thought and practice into a meaningful life.</p><p>The department offers a number of courses that serve as gateways to the practice of philosophy. These gateway courses are PHIL 101 -Introduction to Philosophical Problems; PHIL 111 -Ethics; and PHIL 121 -Political Philosophy. Prospective philosophy majors are especially encouraged to take PHIL 101 early in their course of study. Other courses at the 200 and 300 level are either courses in the history of philosophy or courses that focus on problems in specific areas of philosophy. Many of these courses do not have specific prerequisites and are open to all interested students.</p><p>There are two distinct major programs: philosophy and the joint major in philosophy and religion. The department does not offer a minor in philosophy and religion.</p></div>

Normally this will be an essay written for a 300-or 400-level philosophy course, together with a plan for developing the original essay into an honors thesis. If the faculty member and the department's honors supervisor agree that the submitted essay shows promise of becoming a high-quality thesis, the student may register for PHIL 490 with a view to qualifying for honors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Students writing a senior thesis will give an informal presentation of their work to students and faculty of the department. Students seeking honors must submit their theses to their advisers by the deadline set by the department. If a student's adviser judges the thesis to be of sufficient quality, the student will be invited to stand for honors. (Independent study students who are not invited to stand for honors will still be able to complete their senior theses.) Honors candidates will undergo an oral exam (the honors defense) conducted by the adviser and two additional faculty members during exam week. Ideally the honors defense becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. In addition an honors candidate must have a GPA of at least 3.40 in his or her major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy and Religion</head><p>Candidates for honors in Philosophy and Religion normally take an independent study (PHIL 490 or RELG 490) with their honors adviser during spring term of senior year. The honors thesis -a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique -is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser and two other faculty readers decide that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets with their adviser and the two other faculty readers -a committee consisting of Philosophy and Religion faculty -and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in the Philosophy and Religion major.</p></div>

In addition, it engages related issues in philosophy, ethics, society, spirituality, science, gender, sexuality, arts, and politics. Thus, a major or minor in religion may serve as a natural complement to other majors. Students in the arts and humanities, for instance, will find that the study of religious texts and worlds affords them greater insight into literature and visual art. Some students may seek to make stronger interdisciplinary connections. In consultation with an adviser, students may elect to create a track through the religion major or minor that brings their work in religion into dialogue with their work in other departments or programs. Possible tracks include:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religion, Politics, and Law</head><p>The department offers courses that examine the intersection of religion and politics, past and present, explore the legal frameworks of a variety of religious traditions, and ask students to think about the role of ethics and morality in public life. Students interested in history, international relations, peace and conflict studies, or political science will find that a minor or second major in religion allows them a better understanding of many of the longstanding ideological conflicts that have shaped the contemporary world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religion and Health</head><p>Students interested in the natural sciences who intend to enter the fields of medicine and health sciences will find that courses in religion equip them to evaluate the moral complexity of current scientific advances. A host of religion courses probe questions that are central to medicine and health: questions of body and soul, psychic states and mindfulness, sex and sexuality, life and death. These are treated in a variety of religious traditions, offering the pre-med student a comparative approach to health and healing.</p><p>The success of our graduates indicates that a major in religion provides excellent preparation for a number of careers, including education, government, journalism, finance, law, social work, and professional service in non-profit organizations and religious institutions. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

At the end of the course, the faculty member may recommend that a student's paper be reworked into an honors thesis.</p><p>In the spring of the senior year, candidates for honors normally take an independent study (RELG 490) with their honors adviser. The honors thesis -a substantial piece of research, analysis, or critique -is turned in to the adviser several weeks before the end of the term. If the adviser decides that the thesis can stand for honors, the honors candidate meets during exam week with his or her adviser and two other faculty readers and fields questions: the honors defense. Ideally the question and answer session becomes a forum for intellectual exchange between the student writer and the faculty readers. A student is awarded honors on the basis of both the quality of the written thesis and the conduct of the honors defense. No student can be awarded honors, however, who does not have at least a GPA of 3.40 in his or her major. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. The aim of this department is to provide students with a solid foundation in the languages, literatures, and cultures of the French-, Italian-, and Spanish-speaking worlds. Language courses work to improve students' abilities in speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing in French, Italian, or Spanish, while providing an introduction to culture. Structured in levels of increasing complexity, literature courses foster the improvement of analytical and critical skills, an enhanced aesthetic appreciation of works of literary art, and a broader understanding of linguistic and cultural diversity. Many of the courses offered in the department may be taken by students who do not plan to major in French or Spanish but who would like to maintain or develop their knowledge of these languages and cultures. Given the multi-cultural nature of the United States today, familiarity with a second language and culture will enhance a student's preparation for a career in any profession. Advanced study of Spanish or French (300 level and higher) makes the student eligible for the intimate contact with a foreign culture available through the department's study groups abroad. A major in French or Spanish can be particularly useful in the fields of law, business, international trade, journalism, education, and public administration.</p></div>

Theater predates recorded history and remains a vital mode of artistic expression in the modern world. The Department of Theater educates students in the interdisciplinary practice of theater through required courses in acting, directing, stagecraft, and stage design, as well as elective courses in playwriting, screenwriting, and dance. Students also study theater as a social and cultural institution through courses in theater history and dramatic literature. Each semester, the department mounts a major production in the University Theater, directed either by a member of the theater faculty or a distinguished guest artist. Theater courses and University Theater productions are open not only to theater majors and minors but to all students on campus.</p><p>Theater students at Colgate learn by doing in the intellectually and physically rigorous environment of studio courses, rehearsals, and public performances. The curriculum transcends the artificial split of mind and body, encouraging students to develop skills in both logic and intuition that apply to any field of endeavor. A major or minor in theater fosters students' ability to read closely, think critically, and communicate clearly -not only through speech and writing, but also through embodied presence. Students of theater are trained to integrate analytical, physical, emotional, and interpersonal intelligence in a way that few other courses of study demand.</p><p>By making and studying theater, Colgate students act out a variety of perspectives on the world, learning to problem solve and self-start through immersion in the challenges of the creative process. Students have opportunities both to lead and to collaborate. Graduates regularly pursue successful careers not only in theater but also in communications, media, business, law, and technology. Students interested in majoring or minoring in theater should discuss their plans with an adviser, and consider courses in music, art and art history, film and media studies, English, foreign languages and cultures to complement their theater education.</p></div>

Transfer credit for a theater course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The department chair grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300-or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major.</p></div>

Proposals are normally due in October and must be approved by the Theater faculty.</p><p>Students pursuing an honors project are enrolled in THEA 496 -Special Studies for Honors Candidates in Theater, during the spring term of their senior year. This course will ordinarily take the form of an independent study with the supervisor of the student's honors project. THEA 496 must be taken in addition to THEA 495 and to the minimum number of courses required for the Theater major. Students must complete their honors projects by a date specified by the Department of Theater. If the Theater faculty approves a completed project for honors, the student receives a grade in THEA 496. If a student withdraws from the program, or if the final project is not approved for honors, THEA 496 is converted to THEA 491 -Independent Study, and a grade is assigned by the student's faculty supervisor. Students are awarded high honors on the basis of the quality of their chosen artistic project, thesis, and the oral presentation.</p><p>Students with further questions should contact the chair of the Department of Theater.</p></div>

Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. A major in biology is the traditional undergraduate preparation for students planning to pursue career interests in the biological or health-related sciences. Although the majority of majors ultimately pursue careers in the life sciences, a significant number of individuals with other career interests choose the major within the liberal arts context. The department's majors are found today in positions of responsibility in many fields outside the life sciences, including business, theology, law, and the performing arts. Biology majors who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching should refer to Educational Studies.</p><p>Students expecting to attend graduate or professional schools are reminded that these schools frequently recommend or require calculus, statistics, computer science, chemistry (typically through organic), and a year of physics as cognates to the biology major.</p></div>

Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and the machines that carry out these processes.</p><p>Computer science is a mix of theory, application, design, and experiment. Theory addresses questions about the nature and limits of computation, the abstract properties of machine models, the complexity of algorithms, and the formalization of programming languages. Applications include machine and systems design, the design and implementation of programming languages, artificial intelligence, networks, graphics, and simulation. An important aspect of computer science is the development of methods for the systematic design of large systems in hardware and software. Both applications and theoretical issues must be tested experimentally.</p><p>The computer science major prepares students either for graduate study in computer science or for a variety of professional careers. The computer science minor and the major in computer science/mathematics prepare students for professions in which computer science overlaps significantly with another discipline. COSC 100, COSC 140, and COSC 150 provide opportunities for non-majors to learn about computer applications in the liberal arts and to survey, at an introductory level, some topics in computer science.</p></div>

Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. Geology is the study of the Earth through time, from its surface environments to its deep interior. It is a multidisciplinary science that explores the physical and chemical nature of the Earth, the evolution and impact of life on our planet, and how global processes operate both now and in the past. Geology focuses on the scientific study of Earth materials, such as minerals, rocks, and fossils, as well as Earth-observing data derived from satellites, geophysical instruments, and models. The geosciences explain how past and present-day ecosystems and environments have been and are continuing to be shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, mountain building, climate change, evolution, and human activity through time.</p><p>Introductory courses are designed to contribute significantly to a liberal arts education and an understanding of Earth and the environment. Advanced courses are more focused and provide the highest possible level of general and pre-professional training for majors.</p><p>Majors in geology or environmental geology provide students with the opportunity to pursue careers in the geological and environmental sciences, business, and education, as well as government and public service. Upon graduation, many geology majors attend graduate school in geology, hydrology, oceanography, environmental sciences, and environmental policy and law. Other graduates go directly into a wide spectrum of employment situations, including business, environmental consulting, teaching, administration in schools and museums, and mineral resources and petroleum-related jobs.</p><p>Students considering attending graduate school in geology should note that graduate schools expect applicants to have supplemented their undergraduate geology majors with a year each of introductory calculus, chemistry, and physics or biology. The geology department encourages all majors to take these courses; they are required for honors in geology. Students interested in paleontology are encouraged to take BIOL 304 in addition to, or in place of, one of the 300-level electives.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>All geology and environmental geology majors are encouraged to consider the advantages and challenges of undertaking honors in geology. A GPA of 3.20 or higher in the four core courses (GEOL 201 , GEOL 215 , GEOL 225 , and GEOL 235 ), plus the two required 400-level courses are required for a student to become eligible for honors. In addition, at least six full-credit courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics must be taken to become eligible for honors. GEOG 245 can be taken in place of one of these six courses.</p><p>In addition, honors candidates must complete a year-long senior thesis, which represents the culmination of a research project that typically begins during the summer before the senior year and continues during the fall and spring terms of the senior year. The written thesis must be completed and orally defended by the end of the spring semester. Following the defense, and with the recommendation of the thesis committee, the geology faculty will vote to award honors. Awarding the distinction of honors is based primarily on the quality of the written thesis but will also include an overall assessment of the student's academic record. Students who may be eligible for honors will be notified in the spring of the junior year by their academic adviser.</p></div>

There are many good reasons to study mathematics: preparation for a career, use in another field, or the beauty of the subject itself. Students at Colgate who major in mathematics go on to careers in medicine, law, or business administration as well as areas of industry and education having an orientation in science. Nonmajors often require mathematical skills to carry on work in other disciplines, and all students can use the study of mathematics to assist them in forming habits of precise expression, in developing their ability to reason logically, and in learning how to deal with abstract concepts. There are also many people who view mathematics as an art form, to be studied for its own intrinsic beauty.</p><p>All mathematics courses are open to qualified students. Entering first-year students who have successfully completed at least three years of secondary school mathematics, including trigonometry, should be adequately prepared for MATH 161. Students who have studied calculus in secondary school are typically ready to enter MATH 162 or MATH 163.</p><p>Students who are planning to undertake graduate study in mathematics are advised to take MATH 485 and MATH 487.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematical Systems Biology Minor</head><p>Ingram (Chair of the Department of Biology) Valente (Chair of the Department of Mathematics)</p><p>Mathematical systems biology describes a field of inquiry in which mathematical and computational methods are used to examine complex, large-scale interactions between components of biological systems and to predict how these interactions influence the properties of those systems. The systems examined may range in scale from molecular through cellular and tissue levels to the scale of organisms and entire ecosystems. The unifying feature of this field is quantitative description of interactions between components of biological systems.</p><p>The interface between mathematics and biology is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of research in the sciences. The technological development of methods for generating large amounts of biological dataincluding genome sequence information, total protein analysis, metabolic information, etc. -demands the development of mathematical and computational methods for analyzing these data and for developing predictive models that use such large data sets. The multidisciplinary field of systems biology requires an understanding of both mathematical and biological concepts, insights into interesting questions in biology, and comprehension of the mathematical methods that can be used to address many of those questions. The mathematical systems biology minor provides students with the coursework in mathematics and biology required to begin to gain insights and experience in this important new field. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

To allow a student to combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University. A student may spend three years at Colgate and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan) to earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions. The student may be eligible to continue study for a Master of Science (MS) degree, which can sometimes be completed in as little as one additional year after earning the bachelor's degree in engineering. Eligibility for the MS program is determined by the engineering school.</p><p>It is imperative for students interested in the 3-2 plan to begin the physics and math curriculum in the fall term of the first year. To be eligible for the 3-2 plan, a student must complete all physics major courses through PHYS 336 and PHYS 431 (or PHYS 451), plus one other upper-level physics course to be chosen in consultation with the pre-engineering adviser.</p><p>Prerequisites for admission to engineering schools vary among schools and fields of study; therefore, it is necessary to indicate an interest in pre-engineering to the physics faculty as soon as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation for Graduate School</head><p>Students intending to pursue graduate studies in physics, astronomy, or engineering should discuss their plans with their major advisers as early as possible. Students who wish to prepare for graduate studies in physics or astronomy should complete PHYS 431, PHYS 432, PHYS 433 and PHYS 434. To enrich the program, a student should choose additional physics and astronomy electives at the 300 and 400 levels. Advanced courses in other science departments, especially mathematics, are also encouraged. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Drawing on astronomical observations, physical models, chemical constraints, and geological interpretations, students consider the Earth in its planetary context, the processes that have shaped Earth and other planets through time, and our place in the Universe. Students learn to appreciate or participate in the ongoing discovery of planets throughout the galaxy, and to reflect critically on their similarities with and differences from our own world. Astrogeophysics majors develop intellectual tools from across the physical sciences to reason qualitatively and quantitatively about global issues, such as the accelerating pace of global change and planetary habitability.

As a discipline, it is dedicated to identifying and understanding basic and complex processes including sensation and perception, learning and memory, thought and language, motivation and emotion, development, personality, psychopathology, and social interaction. These processes are examined from a variety of levels of analysis; from the genetic and neuronal, to physiological and cognitive systems, and to whole organism responses and group interactions. By its very nature, psychological science has relevance to a wide range of practical, human problems. </p></div>

Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. The basic objective of the Department of Economics is the development of students' understanding of economics as the social science that deals with production, consumption, and market exchange activities. All students begin with ECON 151 -Introduction to Economics. Majors advance through a core of analytical courses and choose among a series of options in theoretical and applied economics. Students with an interest in graduate work leading to careers in such fields as economics, law, business, public administration, or the foreign service are asked to discuss these objectives early in their college careers in order to plan an adequate program in economics. While not an undergraduate business or professional school, the department provides essential background for a variety of career interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Information</head><p>ECON 151 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered above 200. ECON 251 is a prerequisite for all courses numbered between 300 and 349. ECON 251 and ECON 252 are prerequisites for all courses numbered between 350 and 374. ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375 are prerequisites for all courses above 375.</p><p>Courses numbered below ECON 150, including ECON 105, cannot be counted as part of the major program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation for Graduate School</head><p>For students considering graduate school in business administration, at least two courses in mathematics (preferably MATH 161 and MATH 162) and one computer science course (such as COSC 101) are strongly recommended. Students considering graduate school in economics are strongly encouraged to take these courses, as well as additional courses in mathematics, including MATH 214 and MATH 377. Students with these interests should also consider the mathematical economics major described here and consult with their academic adviser as early as possible. Students considering graduate work in economics leading to a PhD should consider pursuing a double major in economics and mathematics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement and Transfer Credits</head><p>A score of 4 or 5 on both the microeconomics and macroeconomics AP exams will exempt incoming students from ECON 151; no credit is given if only one AP exam is taken or if a score of 3 or lower is received on either exam. No transfer credit is given for ECON 105 -Principles of Accounting. Except for students transferring from another college or university, no transfer credit will be given for ECON 251, ECON 252, or ECON 375, and no more than two courses in economics taken elsewhere can be accepted for major credit. These courses must be comparable to what is offered in a liberal arts economics program.</p><p>Students who hope to transfer course credit must consult with the department prior to enrolling elsewhere. Students returning from summer courses or study groups are not entitled to retroactively seek major credit in the department. Students participating in a Colgate approved program are only eligible for major credit when attending programs on the departmental approved list: up to two courses taken on a departmentally approved program may be transferred towards the major and one course may be transferred towards the minor. No major or minor credit is granted for courses taken while participating in an approved program that is not on the economics department list, and no minor credit is given for any other courses, including summer courses.</p><p>All transfer courses must have a minimum prerequisite that is equivalent to Colgate's ECON 151 course and the department recommends taking courses that have ECON 251 and/or ECON 252 as prerequisites. Students who transfer to Colgate from other institutions may be granted more than two course credits toward the major at the discretion of the department chair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and High Honors Economics</head><p>To be invited to participate in the honors program, students need a minimum 3.33 GPA in the three core courses: ECON 251, ECON 252, and ECON 375. To qualify for departmental honors, a student must enroll in the year-long honors seminar (ECON 489 and ECON 490) in which each student writes an honors thesis. Students also present their projects to the seminar and act as discussants of other projects. Certification of honors and high honors will be based mainly on the quality of the honors paper. In addition, honors candidates must have, at graduation, a B+ average (A-for high honors) in the nine economics courses taken for major credit, and must receive a satisfactory grade in ECON 490. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

The Department of Educational Studies offers two distinct undergraduate programs: (1) a major or minor in educational studies and (2) a preparation program for students intending to teach at either the elementary or secondary level. The department also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program for students preparing to teach at the secondary level.</p><p>Given these programs, the department offers a comprehensive study of formal and informal educational institutions and practices, and the ways they are affected by social forces. Interdisciplinary by design, classes draw on diverse methods of inquiry to analyze critically the historical and contemporary ways that people educate and are educated in the United States and societies across the globe. Theory, research, and practice work together to help students become more informed as consumers and producers of knowledge in a variety of educational contexts. Students learn to ask questions about the relationships between knowledge, power, and identity in educational contexts, and to reimagine education and its contribution to a democratic society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Groups</head><p>The South Korea Study Group is a joint program between Educational Studies and Asian Studies. The program offers a dynamic experience for any Colgate University student due in part to its efforts to become a leader in the newly forming globalized world in which we live. South Korea is highly regarded for its rapid modernization, yet the people still hold to its traditional ways in mind and spirit. While the focus is on students' development of educational studies theory and practice from a global perspective, they also gain a fascinating sociocultural experience.</p><p>Students enroll in four courses.

The program encompasses liberal studies in education as well as studies and experiences designed to develop teaching effectiveness and professional leadership. The emphasis is on developing the student's ability to relate knowledge and theory to skillful teaching in the interest of promoting greater social justice and environmental sustainability. Colgate's undergraduate adolescence and childhood certification programs and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) adolescence programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) for a period of seven years from May 7, 2014 until May 7, 2021.</p><p>There are three ways to become a certified public school teacher through the Teacher Preparation Program at Colgate. The first is the undergraduate teacher education program, which can be completed in the fouryear undergraduate period and certifies successful candidates in childhood education (grades 1-6 Students who wish to enter the program should submit an application to the director of teacher preparation as soon as possible. Application materials include a personal teaching statement, trasncripts, an academic writing piece, and a letter of recommendation. Acceptance into a teacher certification program does not guarantee acceptance into the student-teaching semester.</p><p>Students are tentatively approved for student teaching in the spring of their junior year for undergraduates. Final approval depends on successful completion of all prerequisite courses in their program by the end of the spring term. A decision is made by the department to approve a candidate for student teaching based on previous academic performance at Colgate as well as the apparent suitability of the candidate for the teaching profession. The student must also submit to the program a letter of recommendation written by an individual who has observed the student in some teaching/learning capacity in a school setting. In general, the following GPA requirements will apply: for the secondary teaching programs, students should maintain a 3.00 GPA in education courses, 3.00 in the teaching field, and 3.00 overall; for the elementary teaching program, students will be expected to have a 3.00 GPA in education courses and a 3.00 overall.</p><p>Candidates for teacher certification in New York must pass competency examinations prepared by the State Education Department. (For comparative data from Colgate and other teacher education programs within New York State see www.highered.nysed.gov) Initial certification is available to U.S. citizens and to noncitizens who have completed a letter of intent to become a U.S. citizen. Teacher certification students are required to spend a minimum of 100 hours in a variety of field experiences related to coursework prior to student teaching. Please note that completing certification requirements is not the same as majoring in educational studies. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

To be eligible for this special program, students must have received their Colgate degree in the academic year prior to the professional semester and completed all other certification prerequisites prior to enrolling in the ninth semester. In the ninth semester, students are allowed to enroll only in the professional semester courses, which consist of two or three seminars (depending upon adolescence or childhood certification) and student teaching. Students admitted into the ninth semester program will be charged a small administrative fee (currently waived), must meet the usual requirements for enrollment at Colgate (such as proof of health insurance), and are responsible for locating their own off-campus housing. Students interested in the ninth semester program should meet with an educational studies faculty member to determine if they are eligible and apply to the program in the spring of their senior year.</p></div>

The IR program cosponsors a study group in Geneva that typically runs once per year. On the Geneva study group, students receive one core subfield credit for POSC 357, and two elective credits: one for an internship course and the other for a course taken at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. IR majors who are pursuing French to complete their foreign language requirement can receive credit at the 100 or 200 level for an intensive course taken at the beginning of the Geneva study group.

The department's program is designed to provide students with an understanding and appreciation of politics in the broadest sense and to introduce them to the skills needed for research and analysis. The curriculum includes courses in the principal fields of the discipline, including American and comparative government and politics, international relations, and political theory. Through coursework and independent study projects, students confront some of the enduring questions of politics while studying political institutions, processes, behavior, and theory. Internships in Washington on the D.C. study group combine rigorous analysis of politics and government with direct exposure to Congress, the national executive, political parties, interest groups, think tanks, and media. Similarly, study and internships in Geneva, Switzerland, on the department's other study group, provide students with the opportunity to travel widely in Europe and to become immersed in the world of international organizations. The honors colloquium, in addition, offers students the opportunity to conduct significant research under the supervision of a faculty member. Students who major in political science are likely to be well prepared for future careers or graduate study in such fields as law, public service, international affairs, business management, teaching, journalism, and many others.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>The department will accept for major credit a maximum of two political science courses taken at other institutions. Only one transfer credit will be accepted toward the minor. These courses must have been approved for transfer credit by the Colgate registrar and by the member of the Department of Political Science designated to evaluate them. In all instances, courses accepted for major or minor credit must be comparable in quality, quantity of reading and writing, and scope of coverage to courses offered in the department. Transfer credits will not ordinarily be offered for POSC 100-level courses or POSC 232. Students who anticipate applying for major or minor credit for a course or courses to be taken at another institution should consult with the faculty member evaluating them before enrolling elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and High Honors</head><p>Students with outstanding records in political science may pursue honors. To qualify, a student must have, at graduation, an overall GPA of 3.40 and a departmental GPA of 3.50 in the eleven or more courses taken to satisfy the major requirement for honors. A student must enroll in the year-long honors colloquium <ref type="bibr">(POSC 498 and POSC 499)</ref>. Major credit and grades used in determining departmental GPA will be awarded for both courses. Each student in the fall while enrolled in POSC 498 will complete an in-depth written literature review of his or her subject of interest; then, in the spring while enrolled in POSC 499, students will write a lengthy thesis. Each course is graded separately, but enrollment in POSC 499 is contingent on the successful completion of POSC 498, and the recommendation of the seminar director and the student's primary adviser. Although these courses are designed for and required of those hoping to stand for honors or high honors at graduation, neither is restricted to them; rising seniors with a strong interest in some area of political science and a proven academic record of accomplishment who would like to explore further a chosen area of research in a collaborative environment should also consider enrolling. It is critically important that juniors interested in doing an honors thesis in their senior year, speak both with their advisers and members of the faculty conducting research in an area of common interest while searching for a primary adviser to guide their independent research during their senior year.</p><p>All students who have successfully completed the honors sequence will be eligible for honors or high honors. Whether a student receives honors or high honors ultimately depends upon the outcome of their thesis research. To be awarded honors, a thesis must be judged superior both by the faculty member guiding the student's research and the seminar director of POSC 499. A thesis judged by these readers to be potentially worthy of high honors will, with the agreement of the student, be submitted to a third reader. An oral defense will then be scheduled at which time the student is examined both on the content of the thesis and his or her knowledge of the general field of inquiry. The three readers then make the final decision as to whether the student will receive high honors at graduation.</p></div>

In consultation with their faculty advisers, students should plan course sequences that fulfill major requirements while allowing them, if so desired, to develop particular interests in some depth while still gaining a well-rounded grounding in the discipline. All majors are encouraged, as well, to take electives in other closely allied social sciences.</p><p>The 100-level courses are designed for students likely to major in other fields of study as well as those considering a major or minor in political science. The 200-level courses are intended to serve as gateway courses to the major as well as to particular subfields. Both the 100-and 200-level courses, then, serve as general introductions providing a broad foundation in the discipline and are particularly suitable for first -and second -year students. The 300-and 400-level courses are, in most instances, somewhat more demanding and less general than lower-level courses and allow students to explore a specific topic in greater depth. These courses are generally directed, but not limited, to the needs of juniors and seniors. Majors and others interested in one particular area of the discipline, for example in international relations, can take up to seven courses, seminars, or independent studies in that area of interest, especially in classes at the 300 and 400 level.</p></div>

Therefore, students are encouraged to seek anthropology-approved off-campus study opportunities that may feature: home stays, coursework in a second language, independent research projects, and/or different community service learning opportunities. Students are also encouraged to seek off-campus research opportunities that may involve summer ethnographic or archaeological fieldwork, or work in museum exhibits. All research intensive activities form part of students' cumulative curricular experience that will prepare them for the senior thesis seminar.</p><p>To meet the Research Intensive component, students may seek approval from their anthropology adviser to satisfy this area with one of the following activities:</p><p> Interning in Colgate's Longyear Museum of Anthropology during the academic year or summer.</p><p> Working with faculty on funded summer research projects (subject to department approval)  Participating in other off-campus anthropology approved programs that involve opportunities for substantial experiential learning and/or independent research (subject to department approval).

All seniors will normally enroll in ANTH 452 -Senior Seminar in Anthropology in the fall of their senior year and begin work on a thesis of their own design. To continue to pursue honors or high honors, students must receive at least an A-on the final thesis of the senior seminar. Those students pursuing honors or high honors will significantly revise and expand their seminar theses by enrolling in ANTH 495 -Independent Study for Honors and High Honors, in the spring semester (if a substantial number of students are pursuing honors and high honors in a given year, the group may be organized into a formal honors seminar). They will work with a primary advisor and a secondary reader to complete the project.</p><p>Certification of honors and high honors is primarily based on the quality of the thesis and participation in a public defense. To receive honors, a three-person faculty committee must determine that it is strong in each of the following areas: asking and answering a clear anthropological research question, engaging deeply with social theory, collecting and analyzing empirical materials, and writing in a well-organized and professional style. To receive high honors, the committee must determine that the thesis is excellent in each area. Note: ANTH 495 is an additional requirement for students pursuing honors and high honors and cannot be counted as one of the electives required for the major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociology Major</head><p>Sociology is the scientific study of the organization and functioning of societies, their major institutions, groups, and values. Sociologists are particularly interested in understanding and explaining social issues and problems, and the sources of stress and change in contemporary and historical societies. Our courses provide students with critical perspectives on a wide range of major social issues, including social inequality, race/ethnicity, gender/sexuality, the media, immigration, social movements, globalization, crime/deviance, education, war, and environmental issues. In addition, students take courses on classical and contemporary sociological theory, research design, and qualitative and quantitative research methods. The culmination of our curriculum is the required senior seminar. This course provides an opportunity for students to draw on their substantive and methodological training to complete an independent research project on a topic of their choice. Students majoring or minoring in sociology go on to careers in fields such as communications, marketing, business, management, education, law, medicine/public health, and the non-profit sector.</p><p>Students in the Classes of 2020 and 2021 can find the previous major requirements in the 2018-2019 University Catalog.</p></div>

The Africana and Latin American Studies (ALST) Program is an interdisciplinary program that studies the histories and cultures, both material and expressive, of the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, and of African Americans in the United States. It draws heavily from several disciplines in the arts and humanities (art, languages, literature, music) and the social sciences (anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology), as well as educational studies, philosophy, psychology, religion, and writing and rhetoric. The program offers a major and a minor with four different emphases: African, African American, Caribbean, and Latin American studies. United by a shared historical connection within the Atlantic world, Africans, African Americans (US), Latin Americans, and the peoples of the Caribbean provide rich opportunities for interdisciplinary and comparative studies. The program offers students the opportunity to study one particular group of people in relation to others in the wider Atlantic world. It examines the indigenous civilizations of these regions and studies the impact of migration, imperialism and colonialism, racism, nationalism, and globalization in shaping the lives, ideas, and cultural identities of their inhabitants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Africana and Latin American Studies</head><p>The major in Africana and Latin American studies consists of nine courses. Students concentrate in African studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, or Latin America studies. Each emphasis has a required introductory course, and all students are also required to take at least one approved course within the program from outside their own emphasis.</p><p>Substitution of other appropriate or equivalent courses, independent studies, or special study groups for the requirements for each concentration may be possible, but must be approved by the Africana and Latin American Studies Program director. Transfer courses, field study, and one-time-only courses by visiting professors can be credited toward the major or minor only with approval of the program director. A minimum average GPA of 2.00 in the courses chosen to count toward the major or minor in Africana and Latin American studies is required for graduation.</p><p>Majors in the Africana and Latin American Studies Program may not pursue a minor in the program. In the case of a double major, no more than two courses from the department or program of the second major may be counted for the ALST major, with the approval of the ALST director or respective coordinator. The relationship between students and the coordinator of each concentration is a vital one, and it is imperative that each major and minor meet with the appropriate coordinator at least once a semester to assess progress toward meeting graduation requirements.</p><p>As with the major, the minor in Africana and Latin American studies allows the student to concentrate in African studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, or Latin American studies. It consists of six courses, no more than one of which may also be counted toward a student's major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and High Honors</head><p>Majors may graduate with honors or high honors in Africana and Latin American studies. Qualifications for honors include, at graduation, a minimum overall average of 3.00, a major average of 3.30, and a successful defense before a designated faculty committee of an honors paper or project prepared under the direction of a member of the Africana and Latin American studies faculty. The committee that evaluates the final paper will be identified by the program director in consultation with the student and the student's faculty adviser. Prospective honors students should notify the appropriate coordinators of their intentions by the first week of October of the senior year. A student with a double major in Africana and Latin American studies and a second field may apply for honors in both areas by submitting and defending a paper in each. The paper topics may be related, but the focus and/or content of the two papers must differ substantially. Beyond the requirements for honors, high honors requires a major average of 3.7. High honors projects are usually begun in the fall of the senior year. Students who expect to qualify for honors or high honors should register for ALST 499. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Better known in the United States as a tourist destination, the region has a rich but tragic history intimately connected with Euro-American imperialism and plantation slavery. Nevertheless, by bringing together people of widely diverse ethnicities from all over the world, the plantations became a virtual laboratory of socio-cultural engineering to produce some of the earliest and most complex multiracial societies. In conjunction with a study group that spends a semester at the University of the West Indies, ALST majors within the Caribbean concentration are exposed to a diverse range of issues relating to race relations, cultural identity, political governance, and economic development that are embedded in the history, literature, politics, and economies of the territories of the region.</p><p>For more information about the program, honors/high honors, transfer credit, etc., visit the Africana and Latin American studies program page.</p></div>

Colgate's Environmental Studies Program helps students to understand the complexity of environmental issues and explores the consequences and impacts of the human experience on the environment. Students in environmental studies learn to think, speak, and write clearly and articulately about environmental issues from a variety of perspectives. The environmental studies curriculum combines interdisciplinary breadth with depth in a chosen field of study.</p><p>The Environmental Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program located within the Division of University Studies and staffed by faculty from a number of departments who apply their knowledge and expertise to teaching and research endeavors that cross disciplinary boundaries. The program administers five majors: environmental studies plus four departmentally affiliated majors including environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology. All five majors include a common set of courses that ensures a common interdisciplinary experience. Each student achieves depth in analytical ability by taking a specified set of courses, usually in a particular discipline, chosen in consultation with her or his adviser. To fulfill environmental studies graduation requirements, students must possess a minimum overall GPA of at least 2.00 in all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and High Honors</head><p>Environmental studies majors wishing to pursue honors should consult with the environmental studies program director and a research sponsor no later than the spring of their junior year. Honors may be awarded to students majoring in environmental studies who accumulate a GPA of 3.30 in courses counted toward the major, and complete a semester-long independent research project under faculty guidance through enrollment in ENST 491 -Independent Study. Students pursuing honors will submit a proposal developed in consultation with an ENST-affiliated faculty member who will serve as research sponsor. The proposal describing the project will be submitted to the environmental studies steering committee in the fall semester of their senior year for approval. The research project should reflect the student's area of focus but must also demonstrate the understanding gained using an interdisciplinary perspective and approach. The Director of the program will normally serve as second reader to the honors project. Alternatively, the director and research sponsor may designate up to three faculty members to evaluate the merit of the work and report to the environmental studies steering committee. Students standing for honors will deliver an oral presentation to faculty and students of the program, and produce a report in a format most appropriate to the project. The environmental studies steering committee and the research sponsor must determine whether the oral presentation and report are of high quality and worthy of honors in the program. Students demonstrating exceptional commitment to research and meeting all the requirements for honors may be awarded high honors if the overall quality of their work is deemed to be outstanding by the environmental studies steering committee and research sponsor. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019. Therefore, there may be some differences with the live web pages and links or other interactive content will not work. <ref type="bibr">283</ref> To qualify for graduation with honors or high honors in environmental biology, environmental economics, or environmental geography, students must take ENST 490 -Seminar in Environmental Studies and also meet the requirements for honors or high honors in the biology, economics, or geography major (depending on the area of specialization). The major GPA is calculated from all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and High Honors for Environmental Geology</head><p>To be eligible for honors in environmental geology, students must complete the following requirements in addition to the environmental geology major: (1) Complete ENST 490 -Seminar in Environmental Studies, (2) take four full-credit courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or biology, <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> complete a year-long senior thesis as described in the honors section of the geology major, and (4) achieve a minimum average GPA of 3.0 in the three 200-level core courses and 400-level capstone course. If additional courses are taken in these categories, the highest grades will be used to compute this GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>A maximum of two course credits transferred from other institutions may be applied toward the environmental studies major. One course credit transferred from another institution may be applied toward the environmental studies minor. If the requirement for Focus in a Particular Field of Study is waived because of a second major or minor, transfer credits contributing to the second major or minor do not count toward this maximum. Approved courses taken as part of Colgate sponsored study groups, such as the Australia study group affiliated with the Environmental Studies Program, are not considered transfer credits and do not count toward the maximum. In many cases, courses that might be applied toward the environmental studies major or minor will be approved for university credit by another department on campus. For example, an environmental economics course would be reviewed for credit by the economics department. Once approved for university credit, the course must be approved by the director of environmental studies for credit toward the major or minor. In some cases, a course might be approved for university credit as an environmental studies (ENST) course. Students must supply the director with a course description and syllabus to apply for transfer credit in these cases. Limits on the transfer of courses toward environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology majors are determined by the biology, economics, geography, and geology departments, respectively, and are available in the affiliated department section in this chapter.</p></div>

The affiliated minor in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies (LGBT) examines the lives and representations of individuals and groups considered sexual minorities, as well as the various forces that have affected them across cultures and throughout time. Sexuality offers a critical lens to analyze communities, cultures, and subcultures; institutions, discourses, and literatures; economic and political movements; the social construction of power, status, and hierarchies; and identity categories configured on the basis of age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. Moreover, sexuality is considered as the subject of biological, medical, and psychological research.</p><p>LGBT studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary minor that emphasizes the application of new theories and methodologies (e.g., queer, feminist, critical race, and multicultural theories) to established disciplines as it promotes the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields. Through the minor, students gain critical understandings of normative categorization, query unspoken assumptions, examine social stratification and distributions of power, and explore the diversity of forms that sexuality has taken historically and in contemporary contexts.</p></div>

The Medieval and Renaissance studies (MARS) minor enables students to explore the richness and variety of civilization from the late Roman era through the Renaissance and Reformation. Broadly interdisciplinary, it is intended as a supplement to traditional majors. Spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences, MARS covers history, art, literature, music, philosophy, science, and religion from the 4th to the 17th centuries.</p><p>Chronological parameters define the Middle Ages as beginning with the rise of Christianity in the 4th-century Roman Empire. The Renaissance encompasses the humanism of 15th-century Italy, the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, and its aftermath in the 17th-century Counter-Reformation. Because of the difficulty of assigning absolute chronological limits to these diverse periods, some courses necessarily include material that crosses these boundaries; moreover, the emphasis in MARS is on creating interdisciplinary bridges across the curriculum, and the program is structured in a way that encourages students to explore a cross section of traditional fields. To this end, MARS courses can center on a topic area proposed by the student and agreed upon in consultation with a faculty adviser. However, courses in the minor should complement each other.</p><p>Students may elect to minor in either the medieval or Renaissance period or in a combination of both. In order to declare a minor, prospective students must write a statement of purpose (at least one page), explaining how the choice of courses in their minor will coalesce. This should normally be submitted to the program director by the spring term of the junior year. In order to take full advantage of course offerings and advising, students are urged to enroll in the program as early as possible in their undergraduate career.</p></div>

While there is no mandated language requirement, it is strongly recommended that students considering graduate school in a medieval or Renaissance field should study Latin at least through the intermediate level. This program focuses on the Middle East and North Africa while also studying the wider Islamic world. It provides students with an understanding of the origins and development of the Islamic faith in its heartland, as well as an awareness of the multi-cultural and dynamic character of modern Islam. It also trains students in the history, culture, politics, and political economy of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world.</p><p>The area encompassed by this program extends from Morocco to the Philippines. It contains an extraordinary variety of linguistic and ethnic groups such as Arabs, Iranians, Turkic peoples, Kurds, Baluchis, Malays, and others. This region is home to over 1.4 billion Muslims, who constitute more than onefifth of the world's population. It is the source of a rich religious and intellectual tradition that emerged from the same roots as the Western tradition and evolved over a long history of interaction with the West. It also plays an important role in global peace, security, and prosperity. These demographic, cultural, and strategic considerations will lead to a steady increase in contact between the Islamic world and the United States in the future. The Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Program (MIST) program equips Colgate students with the knowledge and conceptual tools needed to understand and manage this relationship.</p><p>The themes addressed by the program include the history and development of the Islamic faith; colonialism and its impact on the cultures, economies, and polities of the region; the rise of nationalism and its relationship to tribal, religious, and ethnic identities; the emergence and impact of political Islam; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the prospects for democratization; and United States foreign policy toward the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world.</p></div>

The Native American Studies Program offers students the opportunity to undertake a comparative study of the pre-Columbian, colonial, and contemporary cultures of North and Latin America. The required and elective courses are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, representing the various topical and regional interests of Colgate faculty whose specializations include archaeology, art, cultural anthropology, education, ethnomusicology, geography, history, law, literature, and religion. Themes and topics of the major include the integrity, richness, and complexity of Native cultures; the reciprocal impact of contact between Native and non-Native populations in the Western Hemisphere; modes and processes of culture change; cultural disruption, resistance, and vitality; social movements; indigenous ways of knowing; and an understanding of the variety of methodological and theoretical approaches to Native American Studies, including comparisons with other indigenous cultures. A major in Native American Studies provides an excellent foundation for graduate education in the disciplines mentioned, as well as professional work in areas such as contract archaeology, environmental and cultural resource management, government services, non-governmental and non-profit organizations, law, museums, public health, and teaching.</p></div>

Founded with a generous gift of the Cooley family, the program presents a challenging course of study that integrates trans-disciplinary academic approaches to war and peace with research into specific regional conflicts and their aftermaths. The curriculum offers students a range of opportunities to explore the complex impacts of violence, the challenges of human security, and human rights issues in global perspective. With its regular film and media series, symposia, lectures, and unique electives, the program is actively involved in promoting the study of peace, conflict, and security at Colgate and beyond. After taking advantage of the distinctive combination of faculty and program resources at Colgate, peace and conflict studies majors have pursued successful careers in various international arenas, including law, government, development, journalism, academe, and the private sector.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>322</head><p>Cluster 1 -Core Approaches Students are strongly encouraged to take all three core approaches courses during their first and sophomore years. They may be taken concurrently or in any order. PCON 111 and at least one of the other two courses should be taken before students take courses from Cluster 2. To intensify their knowledge of issues and current debates in peace and conflict studies, students take four: Cluster 2 electives Such courses develop substantive knowledge of issues in this interdisciplinary field, while at the same time exposing students to a range of methodologies for studying them, frameworks developed to understand them, and critical approaches to theorizing them. Courses in this section deal with war, armed conflict, and genocide, transnational and human security issues, the lived experience of collective violence, and human rights and structural violence in broadly interdisciplinary ways. A student pursuing a double major with another department or program may use one Cluster 2 elective to count for both majors. At least two of these courses must be at or above the 300 level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cluster 3 -Geographic Areas of Specialization</head><p>Knowledge of specific regional conflicts, and efforts to resolve them, is essential to the study of peace and conflict. To develop this knowledge base, students are required to take three approved courses on the politics, culture, history, geography, or economics of a geographic region chosen from the following:</p><p>A. Central America, the Caribbean, and South America B. North America C. West, East, Central, and Southern and Sub-Saharan Africa D. Europe E. The Middle East and North Africa F. Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia G. Asia and the Pacific Rim H. Transregional Communities Students may take Cluster 3 electives concurrently with Cluster 1 and 2. A student pursuing a double major in peace and conflict studies and an area studies department or program should discuss with the program director which courses may be used to satisfy the requirements for both majors. Other courses, including Liberal Arts Core Curriculum courses, off-campus studies courses, and 300-or 400-level language courses, may count toward the geographic areas requirement, if approved by the program director. Many courses can count for Cluster 3 for each of the regions listed. Students should consult their PCON adviser about specific courses across the curriculum and off campus which may satisfy this requirement. Approved study abroad programs will normally provide two course credits towards this part of the major. The "Transregional Communities" designation applies to a course of study on issues such as displacement, forced migration, or refugee and diaspora communities. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Minors may take PCON 479 as one of their electives, with instructor permission. Russian and Eurasian studies (REST) is a multifaceted discipline that aims to give students an understanding of the history, politics, environment, and culture of Russian, East European and Eurasian places, along with proficiency in the Russian language. Students can choose among courses in literary and cultural studies, art history, anthropology, history, geography, Jewish studies, environmental studies, and political science, taking advantage of Colgate's unusual array of specialists in these diverse areas. Prospective majors, and those with an interest in Russian language, should begin REST 121 as soon as possible. The major requires a minimum of two years of language. Students who continue into advanced Russian are encouraged to spend a semester in Russia on one of Colgate's approved programs. Courses throughout the curriculum are interdisciplinary and culminate in a senior seminar in which majors pursue a thesis or advanced research topics in a collaborative environment. Many of our students choose to combine Russian and Eurasian studies with a second major or minor in history, political science, international relations and other fields. Recent graduates have found work in government, journalism, law, NGOs, education, finance, and many other fields; some have gone to the Peace Corps, and a significant number have pursued graduate study.</p></div>

The Women's Studies Program is built on the understanding that gender is a crucial category of human knowledge and action. Women's studies recognizes the complexity of human lives as gender interconnects with sexuality, race, class, ability, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and age in the constitution of experience and identities. It thus seeks to provide insights which lead one beyond older and more exclusionary theories and practices.</p><p>The program is at its core interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from different disciplines to encourage critical engagement with all forms of experience from a feminist standpoint. Interdisciplinary study leads students to question frameworks, concepts, and methods, enabling them to understand better both the past and the contemporary world, while envisioning a future beyond traditional roles and inequities. By emphasizing interdisciplinarity, the program seeks to help students acquire the tools to analyze critically the societal, cultural, global, and personal issues that shape their lives and challenge them to look at these issues from multiple perspectives. It also encourages them to reflect on the ways in which knowledge is produced within different and oftentimes unrecognized systems of oppression, and to examine categories that are presented as natural and permanent in their cultural and historical context. Finally, the program strives to help students acquire the skills of critical analysis and imagine alternatives that challenge the naturalizing of inequalities.</p><p>Consonant with the goal of promoting new theoretical frameworks, the related and emerging field of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies provides the basis for an independent minor affiliated with the Women's Studies Program.</p></div>

During the final term, honors candidates register for WMST 499 and carry out individual research projects related to their central topics of study. Honors in women's studies may be awarded to majors who have a GPA of at least 3.30 in all women's studies courses, who have completed an approved women's studies honors project, and whose projects have been approved by faculty sponsors and by the women's studies director. High honors in women's studies may be awarded to successful honors candidates who have been invited to present the results of their written projects in oral form to the women's studies faculty. A committee of faculty will vote on granting high honors for exceptionally strong intersectional projects that engage feminist theory and communicate across disciplines. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue -racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities.

The focus is guided by a critical reading of development theory, paying particular attention to Latin American theorizations and empirical experiences, and concern for the subjects, places, and scales that have been excluded from the presumed benefits of development. Mindful that Latin America's development experience is historically embedded, students examine the transformation of Latin American societies and environments through legacies of conquest and colonialism, processes of globalization and neo-liberalization, dynamics of rural and urban change, changes in gender and race relations, and transformations of political and civil society dynamics. These issues are grounded in case studies drawn from Central America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries, and Southern Cone, and Brazil. The course's point of entry is contemporary environmental crises and the role of natural and human resources in shaping the development experience of the region.</p></div>

Utilizing a massive body of data, archaeology is in a unique position to study how warfare evolved alongside the emergence of civilizations. Students focus on several civilizations, such as Mesoamerica, the Mediterranean, and the Andes to compare and contrast various models of warfare in the ancient world. In some cases, warfare results in the utter annihilation of millions of people. In other cases, warfare is limited to a ceremonial gathering of armies that result in few to no deaths. By understanding the different models of human warfare, students engage with universal questions such as, how and why warfare happens. Is warfare an innate part of humanity? What is and is not warfare? </p></div>

Questions addressed include: Who were the Aztecs? Why did the Aztecs practice human sacrifice and cannibalism? How did the Aztecs become the largest empire in ancient Mesoamerica? Did the Aztec Empire promote the well-being of its commoners? Was religion used as a tool of domination? What was the role of women in Aztec society? Why did the Aztec Empire fall to the Spanish? What happened to people following the fall of the Aztec Empire? Students will integrate primary sources, archaeological research, and ethnohistory to uncover the Aztec past.</p></div>

What do they share with structures for Buddhist, Jaina, and Muslim worship? How did ritual shape buildings and sculpture, and can we reconstruct ritual from material remains? With an eye to geopolitics in the art world, students examines key exhibitions that have displayed new artistic practices. They analyze how new art challenged traditional displays of art, breaking away from the famous "white cube" gallery display to transform the exhibition space into a more fluid environment. It shows how contemporary art practices affected art institutions that, in turn, prompted new exhibition formats and institutional discourses. </p></div>

Using visual, historical, and theoretical materials to study select case studies from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, students will focus on how the history of art display impacts our understanding of modernism today, studying installations of art as creations that manifest ideologies and aesthetics. An important aspect of the course will be thinking about how photography -the primary medium through which we can now know how past exhibitions looked like -operates as a medium of visual representation as well as a force of cultural innovation by circulating modern art. In addition to the study of the history of exhibitions, students will also investigate the changing role of the art critic and the curator. As part of the course, students will study exhibitions on campus, applying to contemporary shows the critical skills learned by studying art displays from the past. </p></div>

As students analyze the literary works of people writing within these social and cultural contexts and shifting political views, they are forced to question the nature of oppression. Who does the oppressing? Who are the oppressed? What is the nature of such a relationship? What are the structures of oppression? How does the voice of the oppressed find expression in the language and literary constructs of the dominant culture? What narrative techniques and strategies are employed by oppressors and oppressed in the quest for selfrepresentation? This course allows students to explore the themes of power, self-representation, and language, while developing some important critical reading and analytical writing skills.</p></div>

Yet few people appreciate that modern medicine has its roots in the chemistry of plants. From headaches and malaria to AIDS and hypertension, most modern drug treatments originated from plant extracts. Even in the modern world of sophisticated synthetic chemistry, 25 percent of all prescriptions contain plant extracts or active principles prepared from plants. More than providing pain relief and disease cures, the search of effective medical botany has shaped cultures, created fierce wars, and contributed to the modern issues of bioprospecting, drug wars, and crime scene investigation. This course delves into issues of medical and forensic botany from multiple perspectives. Students develop a greater understanding of basic plant biology and phytochemistry, and learn how many cultures have utilized plants for curative and destructive means. Students also examine how plant-derived drugs have disrupted both ancient and modern cultures, and have shaped the scientific method and modern drug creation. Finally, the class examines how plants play significant roles in early and modern forensics by focusing on major cases whose decisions have hinged on plant evidence. </p></div>

The media "frames" that structure how media is produced, conveyed, and consumed form the discourses that we use to understand mass politics and culture in our daily lives. This course provides students with the methodological tools to empirically study media frames through content analysis. Content analysis takes the stuff of media, such as music lyrics, news stories, or advertisements, and systematically analyzes the content for the explicit and implicit frames that represent the issues and perspectives conveyed through media. The course provides students hands-on training in content analysis through a series of workshops on content sampling, collection, coding, and analysis that culminate in a final research project. This course meets for the first 7 weeks of the term and may be used to satisfy the 0.50-credit methods requirement for the sociology major. </p></div>

Students examine how things happening "over there" have repercussions (or generate concerns about repercussions) in the international system of states as a whole. In order to pay close attention to the systemic effects of events in the Middle East, case studies privilege the moments in between major wars that shook the region. Of necessity, the course focuses extensively on the period known as "The Cold War." Analyses are organized around the careers of three fluids: oil, water, and blood. The first two are quite "dear" in the Middle East and have organized entire political economies. The evidence would suggest that the third has not been considered as precious, particularly by the great powers and would-be hegemons of the modern era. </p></div>

This course starts with an overview of the diverse, multidisciplinary scholarship on factors that may contribute to happiness. But the main goal of the course is to consider themes central to the discipline of geography: how do environmental changes, efforts to achieve sustainable development, and culture affect the geography of happiness? Do people achieve a greater sense of well-being when interacting with wilderness or by exploring nature in their backyards? Does environmental stewardship improve happiness? What roles do attitudes about food and leisure play in how happy people are? Students explore these questions via out-of-class excursions, films, diverse mix of scholarly and popular press readings, guest speakers, and individual research projects. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GEOG 310 -Geopolitics</head><p>Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of "the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation." As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the "closed system" we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to --and has often justified --various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th century, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time. </p></div>

What are the ways in which different social groups make claims on space and place, and how does the scale at which these activities occur have effects? What are the critical questions to ask about urban landscapes today? How would you formulate a research proposal on such topics? The course offers a theoretical and practical framework within which to examine the city as a site of socio-cultural and politicaleconomic transformation.

Hazards are a complex mix of natural processes and human actions; thus, they do not just happen, but are caused. This course emphasizes the role of institutions, technology, and human behavior in hazard creation, as well as ways in which society responds to hazards of multiple origins: case studies center on earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfire (natural hazards); toxic pollution (technological hazards); and malaria and invasive species (biological hazards). A key theme explores ways in which society may mitigate the risk of environmental hazards and manage them more effectively. The intellectual goal of this extended study is to address issues of both population vulnerabilities and cultural resilience by considering Aborigines in Australia, and specifically engaging the historical geography and the contemporary experience of the Noongar community in Western Australia. Three themes form the curricular program of the extended study. (1) Students study the historical geography of Aborigines in Australia within the context of European colonization and settlement, federation and nation-building. These issues are framed using concepts of population vulnerability, environmental impact, and cultural heritage and identity at the national, regional and local geographic scales. (2) Students study the impacts of national, regional and local policies directed toward indigenous peoples on Aboriginal families and children, given particular focus to programs concerning part-Aboriginal children, Australia's "Stolen Generations." (3) Students learn the ways in which Aboriginal culture and 'care for country' has remained resilient across time, space, and generations. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GEOG 341 -Cartography</head><p>As an academic discipline, geography focuses on the nature and causes of spatial variation. This focus is wide ranging and includes human and geophysical processes. Although the scope of geography is broad and the interest and expertise among geographers varied, one commonality is the use of maps and/or graphics for spatial analysis and visual communication. This course provides students with a fundamental understanding of cartography, including mapping theory, technique, and application. This objective is accomplished through a blend of lecture and exercises that introduce students to the theory and philosophy of cartography, map and graphic design, and appropriate forms of visual communication. The course begins with an introduction to cartography, including its history, and proceeds through examinations of statistical graphing, map projections, map design, symbology, and thematic mapping. </p></div>

It is divided into two segments: GIS concepts and theory, and advanced GIS analysis and application. The first segment explores the evolution of GIS from a set of cartographic and data analytical tools used primarily by geographers to a more encompassing set of ideas and tools used by many disciplines to examine spatial processes. Included in the first segment is a thorough examination of issues associated with mapping and referencing the nonspherical earth, conceptual models for representing spatial phenomena, and data-quality issues. The second segment focuses on a select set of spatial analytical issues that can be addressed using GIS. These issues include analysis of continuous spatial phenomena (e.g., terrain), model building using multiple sources of spatial data, network analysis, and the integration of remotely sensed data in a GIS. </p></div>

The course examines this environmental issue from the beginning of the industrial revolution to the present. The science of acid rain -from why and how it forms to what we know about its effects on ecosystems, earth materials, and people -is explored and discussed in detail. For decades, New York State received some of the most acidic deposition in the United States; therefore a portion of course time is spent examining the effects of acid deposition in central New York and the Adirondack Mountains, and the potential for recovery of ecosystems to pre-acid rain conditions. Finally, links between science and policy are explored through examination of the Clean Air Act and events leading up to this and subsequent landmark environmental enactments by Congress.</p></div>

Not only does it stand for the author, it has come to signify a host of political, institutional, existential, and aesthetic conditions. One refers to "Kafkaesque" experiences, sensibilities, or bureaucracies; situations, movies, the 20th century, and modern life are all regularly dubbed "Kafkan" or "Kafkaish." The name seems to have a life of its own; but to understand what it means, students must animate Kafka by reading him. Students read, discuss, and think about a range of Kafka's writing, from novels and short stories to diary entries and legal brief, paying close attention not only to the texts and their various obsessions, but to their emergence in his creative process and their afterlives in translation and the works of other artists. Students explore the multicultural Central European milieu that Kafka inhabited and examine the global transmission and remediation of his work in its critical reception, multiple translations, and adaptations; its transmutation into a style; and its metastasis in popular culture.

A second-rate power in Europe, his kingdom had been torn apart by dynastic struggles and civil war. By 1714, when the last of the Stuart monarchs died, everything had changed. England was now part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which included Scotland and Wales, and whose king also ruled over the neighboring island of Ireland. The medieval feudal kingship had been replaced by a well-established parliamentary monarchy, with many stops along the way. Britain was now a world power, at the center of a far-flung empire, and competing with France for dominance in Europe and beyond. This course will explore precisely how these monumental changes came about, taking a close look at British history over the long 16th and 17th centuries from a number of different perspectives: political, religious, social, cultural, commercial, and intellectual.

How does American history look different when we reverse this perspective and put the continent's original people at the center of the story? What has been the experience of American Indian people, both before and after European contact? And why is this history essential for understanding the world we live in today? With these questions in mind, students will examine the history of indigenous peoples in what is now the United States from 1492 to the present day. Particular focus will be placed on American Indians' history of adaptation and resilience in the face of European and American colonialism. </p></div>

Russia's modern wars have been particularly (although certainly not uniquely) traumatic, with profound impacts on government and citizen alike. The course examines the ways in which the events leading up to war, wartime conditions, and eyewitness accounts were recorded and internalized by citizens and managed by an autocratic state to create collective historical understandings of events. By analyzing the changing ways in which social hierarchy, gender and exclusivity have been structured during and in the aftermath of war, the course offers an important guide to understanding the emergence of ethno-nationalism in one of the world's largest and longestlasting multiethnic Empires.

What political, economic, and social forces have contributed to the prevalence of contamination? Why have some communities suffered disproportionately? How have people in the past identified and coped with toxic danger, and how have they fought against the contamination of their regions, cities, homes, and bodies? In the face of mounting global challenges of toxicity and contamination today, students consider what lessons might be found in these past struggles. Explores the complex and often hidden histories of sex and sexuality in U.S. history, from the Revolutionary era to the present day. Students will consider how American views of sex, desire, and other intimate matters have changed over time, influencing both private decisions and public policies. Topics to be examined include: the emergence of hetero-and homosexuality as categories of experience and identity; the contested boundaries drawn between sociability, friendship, and romance; experiences of dating and courtship; representations of sex and sexualities in popular culture; the development of women's lib and LGBTQ politics; and the significance of gender, class, racial/ethnic, and generational differences.

Chanoyu is the most direct practice of Zen Buddhism tradition, and many samurai warriors practiced it as part of the martial arts education. Students learn to realize the principles of chanoyu in a concrete and ritualistic way of making and receiving a bowl of maccha whisked tea. Assigned readings, along with hands-on practice, help students learn the Japanese tradition, art, aesthetics, calligraphy, literature, history, philosophy, and architecture. At the end of the course, students create and perform a tea ceremony in small groups, write a final paper that reflects on their performance and relates their experience to their modern lives as well as to their own cultural backgrounds. Students learn how the apparent universal concepts such as purity, tranquility, and mindfulness are attained through different sets of human behavior, and examine the human diversity and global interconnections reflected in cultural and artistic expression over time and space. The course has no prerequisite and is taught in English. Students will consume maccha tea and Japanese confectionery.</p></div>

A consideration of film, literature, and scholarly accounts from a range of disciplines will allow students to explore both those who are at the center and at the periphery of Israeli society. LGBT 350 -Sexuality, Gender, and the Law The course examines the effects of the U.S. legal system on the lives of the LGBTQ communities; the influence of religion, science, and culture on the laws affecting LGBTQ individuals; and the processes by which LGBTQ citizens may advance their legal rights. Constitutional theories such as equal protection, privacy, due process, liberty interests, and states' rights are applied to issues such as consensual sodomy, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ parenting, employment rights, military policy, and freedoms of public school students. The power of the U.S. Supreme Court to shape laws concerning LGBTQ issues not only for the present society but for future generations is also examined. Cases studied are supplemented with secondary works. These works include writings by traditional legal scholars as well as works by feminists, race-based scholars, and queer theorists to create a fuller perspective. Through this exploration into the legal reality of a marginalized group, students see how the U.S. legal system continues to evolve in its struggle to provide equality for all of its citizens.</p></div>

Fossil fuels, which were deposited on Earth over hundreds of millions of years, will largely be exhausted over the course of just a few hundred years. Global climate change makes our situation even more unsustainable-we need to stop using fossil fuels long before they run out if we want to avoid catastrophic environmental change. This course takes a quantitative approach to learning about our current energy use, so that students can understand how our personal choices and lifestyles affect energy use.

Unfortunately, many citizens in our society do not understand the fundamentals of these environmental problems. This course --designed for students without experience in other university-level science courses --explores the chemistry behind some of our more pressing environmental dilemmas. Topics include some consequences of fossil fuel combustion (the greenhouse effect, acid rain, urban smog), the ozone hole, nuclear energy/wastes, and ground water contamination. The emphasis is on the science behind these problems, what we know about how the problems have come about, and what we can do, if anything, to ease the problems. This course is for the student who has not taken college-level chemistry, but is concerned about our threatened environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CORE 103S -Remote Sensing of the Environment</head><p>Remote sensing is the art and science of obtaining information about a phenomenon through a device that is not in contact with the object. The remote sensing process involves collection and analysis of data about energy, reflected from or emitted by an object. Remote sensing is used to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. After an introduction to the interplay among science, technology, and remote sensing, students examine the development of remote sensing technology. Students focus on the physical principles upon which remote sensing is based, explore the basic tools of photography and photograph interpretation, and consider the principles of acquiring and interpreting data collected by non-photographic sensors. Throughout the semester, students consider how remote sensing has improved our understanding of biophysical processes using a case-study approach to demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings. Finally, consideration is given to the ethical implications of remote sensing. </p></div>

These are fundamental questions in science. This course explores these questions via several topics of much research in science today. It looks at fundamental questions at the cosmological scale, like the big bang, the structure of the universe, birth and death of stars, and the nature of black holes; and then inward to fundamental questions in the subatomic world, made up of baryons, mesons, leptons, and quarks. The exercise shows that the properties of elementary particles and their interactions are intimately tied to the cosmological questions. The discussion centers on what we know about these topics and how we investigate them. An important component of this course is the discussion of the outstanding puzzles today, like dark matter in the universe, the missing energy fueling its expansion, and whether certain fundamental particles exist or not. In exploring these questions the course provides an introductory coverage of the major physical theories: Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, and relativity. How do these questions affect society and humanity? The course also examines some of the current controversies and debates. </p></div>

Imagine enjoying abundance with no manufacturing costs and taking an elevator to the moon. Imagine also the loss of all personal privacy and the irreversible poisoning of the environment. Such are the hopes, hype, and fears of nanotechnology -the study of materials and devices with dimensions on the nanoscale (1 x 10-9m, the realm of assemblies of molecules). This course provides an introduction to the science and potential implications of molecular nanotechnology. Scientific and sensationalist visions of nanotechnology are critically examined through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, and presentations. The course forges an appreciation for the nanoscale, an understanding of the excitement and the challenges, and an awareness of the societal and ethical implications. Through the lens of nanotechnology, students gain insights applicable to the broad landscape of emerging technologies -and encourage curiosity towards the future. </p></div>

The universe he discovered was a stark contrast to the universe described by the ancient Greek philosophers whose cosmology had held sway for over a millennium. Some 60 years after the publication of Copernicus' treatise "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres," Galileo used his newfound insight into the nature of the heavens to support the heliocentric model of the universe. In so doing, Galileo challenged not only the authority of Aristotelian cosmology, but also the religious tradition and interpretation of the scripture by the Holy Fathers of the Catholic Church. This episode in the history of western science and the development of the Church is often cited as one of the original clashes between modern science and religious traditions. The discoveries, writings, and trial of Galileo Galilei will serve as both a focus and backdrop for students to explore the practical development of scientific thought and the near simultaneous invention and re-invention of the Church. In addition to readings, written responses, and classroom discussions, the course requires students to repeat many of the ground-breaking observations Galileo made using a hand-held refracting telescope similar in size and shape to the one he built. </p></div>

Many of the topics discussed are centered on the view that the function of art and the function of the visual brain are one and the same. Students thus consider that the aims of the artist in rendering a particular piece of art essentially constitute an extension of the processes of the visual brain. By taking this point of view (through an introductory understanding of the sensory and perceptual processes of the visual brain) students discuss possible outlines of a theory of aesthetics that is biologically based. Students are required to read chapters from different textbooks devoted to sensory and perceptual processes as they relate to visual art, as well as review articles from professional journals. </p></div>

What kind of brain would one design? What kinds of social, emotional, and cognitive predispositions would be included? What kind of environment would one provide? To answer these questions, one must determine what is innate and what is learned in human development. Although this "nature-nurture" question can be traced back to ancient philosophers (right here on Earth!), modern-day science has made great strides in exploring (and reformulating) this question. In this class, students first explore some pop-culture approaches to this issue. Then, they briefly trace the history of the debate to its foundations in classical and modern philosophy. Finally, students compare these philosophical and pop-culture perspectives to modern-day scientific approaches. This is accomplished through primary and secondary readings, class discussions, and group presentations. In the end, students may discover that the answers to the "nature-nurture" question are not on a planet far, far way -but rather closer to home than they have ever been.</p></div>

There is an even longer history of art reflecting and perhaps affecting people's appreciation of and understanding of the relationships between humans and nature. Using examples from painting, photography, sculpture, music, film, dance, theater, poetry, and other media, including multimedia performances and installations, this course examines two questions about the relationships among environmental activism, science, and the arts. First, how do activist artists use scientific understanding in their environmental arts? Second, does activist environmental art affect environmental attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, and/or behavior? By addressing these questions, the course explores scientific perspectives, connects them to a topic outside the natural sciences and mathematics, and contrasts them with other ways of knowing. </p></div>

As detectives attempting to solve the world's greatest murder mysteries, students of this course examine when each of these catastrophic events occurred, what caused ecosystems and evolutionary processes to be disrupted, why and where biological diversity was greatly diminished, and who survived to begin the evolutionary repair of life during subsequent recovery and radiation phases. In the final part of the course, students use their knowledge of these past events to hypothesize about and investigate the severity of the Sixth Extinction.

This course explores this relationship by examining how psychological and social factors influence human health. Proponents of Western medicine have frequently dismissed a mind-body link as folklore; others, especially writers for the popular media, have claimed that the mind has miraculous power to cure disease. In recent years, scientists have conducted numerous studies aimed at discovering how thoughts and emotions actually influence physical health, and what mechanisms underlie this influence. Students evaluate this literature, learning about the effects of beliefs, emotional states (depression, anxiety), personality characteristics, and stress on people's susceptibility to and recovery from illnesses. Students also explore literature suggesting that psychological approaches can prevent or treat physical conditions. By doing hands-on experimentation, students learn how to measure stress and even how to control their own physiological responses to it. The course emphasizes the value and limitations of using Western scientific methodology to gain knowledge, and contrasts this approach with ideas from "alternative" and Eastern approaches to medicine. </p></div>

To answer this question this course explores the interrelation between verbal expression and such cognitive faculties as bodily experience, imagination, memory, categorization, and abstract thought. The study of language as a cognitive phenomenon is a relatively new discipline. It originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since then, cognitive linguistics has been a rapidly growing field that has both benefited from and contributed to its allied disciplines of cognitive psychology, cognitive anthropology, and cognitive neuroscience. The course begins by examining the advantages and shortcomings of the cognitive perspective on the different levels of language (e.g., sounds, words, sentences, texts, etc.). Students explore the connections of cognitive linguistics with the related fields that are broadly referred to as the "cognitive sciences."

The Adirondack Mountains are particularly sensitive to acid deposition because of their geology and topography. Many different collaborative studies were conducted with geologists, biologists, hydrologists and atmospheric scientists, and their results led legislators to enact the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Twenty five years later, we examine how scientists addressed skeptical concerns about the extent of the acid rain problem, how effective the legislation has been in recovery of lakes, streams and forests as well as efforts to mitigate the effects of acid deposition through lime applications that neutralize acid and restore chemistry to lakes, streams and forests. Students will gain an understanding of linkages between soils, forests, streams and lakes, and we will compare how scientists and legislators addressed the acid rain problem versus our current actions to address climate change. Students compare restoration "success" in the Adirondack Mountains to changes in precipitation chemistry and biota in other parts of the world such as Canada, different European countries, the United Kingdom and Asia. </p></div>

This course will explore what the science of social psychology tells us about how social inequality shapes the ways we think, live, and die. Because social inequality is about the relative status of people based on their group memberships, we will begin the course by exploring social psychological theories that help explain the centrality of our group memberships to our identity. As we will see, these group memberships can be based on many different aspects of our identity: race, gender, socioeconomic status, among many others. Next, we will explore what experimental data tell us about the sources of, and consequences of, group-based disparities. In particular, we will examine the roles of limited resources, identity, power, morality, and prejudice in perpetuating inequality.

It is also a potent symbol whose meaning has become central to our national and community discourse. Fire is at the root of countless traditions, myths, and foodways, and through controlled combustion of fossil fuels, fire has grown to be the central process at the heart of modern industrial and agricultural systems. The deliberate release of energy through different forms of combustion has changed the course of human social-and potentially, biological evolution. But where does the energy in combustion come from? How do humans harness that energy to do work?

From their very beginnings their evolutionary history contains unpredicted effects across all levels of biological organization. From the social construct of being a wild animal (wolf), to becoming dependent on man (domestication), and colonizing our homes and our beds (inter-species bonding). The history of this single species provides a rich learning opportunity to introductory students. Readings and discussions include a brief introduction and exploration of most branches of biology, in an inter-disciplinary manner: evolution, ecology, genetics, physiology, and behavior, with the underlying theme of how dogs are unique to each of those branches in biology. Emphasis is placed on the interaction between wild animals and early humans, and tracks that interaction through time as the domestication of the dog has progressed. Further exploration occurs on physiological aspects of canine biology that are beneficial for humans, for example, cancer research. Students are challenged to formulate questions about science and how science relates to the inter-species relationship we have created with "man's best friend."</p></div>

Students are introduced to critical evaluation of the major theoretical approaches to the study of power and politics. Students consider rationalist, functionalist, and interpretive approaches in the social sciences, as they relate to questions of peace and conflict. Students examine the specific operative theories that have emerged out of these intellectual traditions -theories of state formation, security, international norms, and transnational networksas they have been incorporated into and further developed in the study of peace and conflict. Students test major theories on case studies linked to major world events. For example, deterrence theory is examined in light of the end of the Cold War. When people think about the social movements behind struggles for revolutionary change or territorial independence, they often imagine armed insurrections, guerrilla armies, and terrorist organizations. Yet nonviolent movements are far more likely to achieve revolution or independence than violent movements. Nonviolent movements are also more likely to install durable and democratic governments after the conflict is over. These nonviolent victories often take place when movements abandon violence and adopt civil resistance as their leading strategy. To understand these global trends, this course investigates the dynamics of violent and nonviolent conflicts using theories of social movements. This theoretical understanding is tested using comparative case study analysis, student research projects, computer game play, and real-world simulations. </p></div>

As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the "closed system" we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to --and has often justified --various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time.

Asymmetric warfare, however, is no mere historical artifact. It dominates headlines as much as it confounds leaders around the world. Central to this course are several in depth case studies of counter-insurgency and terrorism, including France in Algeria and Indochina; the British in Malaya, East Africa and Northern Ireland; state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War; and the United States in the Philippines, Vietnam, and, after September 11, 2001, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.

Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the "military-industrial complex;" and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 304 -Kant and German Idealism (MF)</head><p>German Idealism continues to be one of the most influential movements in philosophy, leaving its mark on many different fields of thought and experience, including epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, politics, and religion. Designed as an overview of the thought of the major representatives of German Idealism: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Students will examine the problems that motivated the emergence and development of this philosophical tradition, and the new forms of philosophical argument that each of these thinkers employed in order to address these problems. In doing so, students will see that there is a sense in which Kant can be considered the father of Existentialism. The topics discussed include the doctrine of transcendental idealism, the nature and possibility of knowledge, the ground of moral obligation, human freedom, and religious belief. No prior familiarity with these issues or thinkers will be assumed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 326 -Philosophical Theology</head><p>Philosophical theology is the systematic articulation of divine revelation. Its origin as a discipline trace to antiquity, as early Christians sought to compose a coherent alternative to "pagan" philosophies <ref type="bibr">(Platonic, Stoic, etc.)</ref>, using the tools of those very philosophies (e.g., conceptual analysis and the determination of logical consistency as a means to metaphysical system-building). Philosophical theology flourished in the Middle Ages, as Jews, Christians, and Muslims grappled with the rediscovered Aristotelian corpus; it is in the midst of a renaissance begun in the second half of the 20th century. After examining the epistemological framework in which philosophical theology takes place, the course discusses particular issues, which may include: revelation and scripture, the concept of prayer, the oneness of God, mitzvoth (commandments), halakhah (law), the Trinity, the Incarnation, sin and original sin, the Atonement, and the eternal destiny of the soul. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 315 -Government and the Economy</head><p>The course examines the inevitable intrusion of politics into economic policy making, with examples drawn from a variety of policy areas including traditional economic regulation, the new social regulation, energy and environmental policies, and recent trends toward deregulation. The course begins with elementary economic theory: the case for free markets, a review of the various ways unregulated markets break down, and rational prescriptions for remedying market failures. The bulk of the course then examines the factors operating to make these market failures more complex than at first they appear, producing policies that depart from economic ideals. </p></div>

Introduces students to a variety of theoretical approaches concerning the origin, transformation, and mobilization of national, ethnic, and other forms of collective identity. Students consider empirical applications of these theories: students identify processes through which identity becomes politicized, explore why some identity conflicts manifest as violence, and analyze the various ways -ranging from electoral solutions to genocide -in which states manage difference. Case studies are drawn from Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa, the Asian sub-continent, and the United States.</p><p>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Does business have too much power or have the critics of "big business" and multinationals been too alarmist? Is the role of the government diminishing as the world becomes more global? This course discusses contemporary controversies regarding the relationship between government and the economy. It evaluates and examines the extent and kinds of state intervention into markets and the private sector, the influence and impact of corporations and business leaders on government institutions and policy from the United States to Latin America. </p></div>

After providing a strong background in party theory and the American party system, the remainder of the course highlights important commonalities by comparing party activity and party system development in other countries that straddle the developed and developing world. </p></div>

In order to develop a strong conception of American parties, students combine scrutiny of the day-to-day media representations of political parties with important comparative perspectives to understand how American parties and elections fit into broader political science frameworks, as well as their long-term and global implications. Students compare the current US party system in three directions: back through history (especially the 20th century) to understand the roots of today's parties; out to the rest of the world, comparing party systems in other highly democratic countries; and also down to the state level, where students examine to what degree New York State parties and elections reflect national trends. Important topics covered include the effects of redistricting and campaign finance. Students also investigate the importance of issue-framing with units on contrasting party strategies of presenting a "war on women" and President Obama's "socialism."</p><p>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 328 -Religion and Politics</head><p>Religion and politics influence each other--pervasively and controversially--in almost every political system across the globe. This course examines this fundamentally important relationship in a variety of national settings through a comparative assessment of issues and controversies such as constitutional relations between religious institutions and the state; the appropriate role of religious beliefs in a democracy; the challenges posed to contemporary governments by the expansion of religious pluralism; the role that religious interests and religious leaders can play in elections and policy making; and the many ways that religion and religious mobilization are shaping the very nature of political life in the modern world. How is history used to advance state-building and nation-building projects? What role do forgetting and memory play in politics? How do international forces interact with domestic political movements? This extended study course uses Vilnius, the current capital of Lithuania, as a case for studying the politics of nationalism and memory, which so shaped its history and which continue to inform its politics and culture today. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 331 -Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa</head><p>Provides an understanding of politics in 48 countries that constitute sub-Saharan Africa. Following the independence era of the early 1960s and 1970s, much of the sub-continent exploded into a seemingly endless cycle of violence underscored by military coups d'état and civil wars. Over the last decade, various conflicts subsided enough for some states to institute political and market reforms. Others remained stuck in the throes of economic stagnation, on the verge of disintegration and vulnerable to terrorist groups and drug runners who exploit their vast ungovernable territories. What explains the various transitions that some states have experienced in sub-Saharan Africa? Why did most states disintegrate in violence following the end of colonial rule? Drawing upon pre-colonial accounts and histories of state formation and the theoretical, methodological, and conceptual tools that various Africanists have used to analyze key events, this course offers answers to these and other important questions about political and socio-economic developments on the continent of Africa. </p></div>

These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's "culture wars" in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S. </p></div>

These urban areas are governed by a dizzying array of local, state, and federal institutions whose policies affect citizens' lives enormously and in myriad ways. This course explores the politics of urban America in the context of the contemporary metropolis. The legal and philosophical origins of local American government are discussed, along with the political economy of the city and classic theories of urban politics. The course traces the history of urbanization and the accompanying growth of government institutions, and addresses issues of suburbanization, regional balkanization, and federalism. Other issues addressed in the course include land use, segregation, housing, economic development, and poverty. This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the "military-industrial complex;" and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system. Readings will engage such topics from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain ranging over several centuries. </p></div>

This course is an analysis of politics and the media from the inside out, beginning with the ways people receive, interpret, or ignore the media messages directed at them. News reporting and questions of bias are treated in the context of a group analysis of important stories. The class also considers the evolution and refinement of media campaigning techniques. Those who cannot purchase time or space in the mass media may resort to protest, terror, and violence in order to air their views. The class discusses these cases along with the ethical issues they pose. (PG) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POSC 346 -Beneath the Black Robes: Courts as Political Institutions</head><p>Focuses on the causal dynamics of judicial behavior. Introduces students to the study of courts as political institutions and, in doing so, provides some understanding of the political nature of the role of courts in American society. Departs from the view that landmark national decisions such as Roe v. Wade, Baker v. Carr, and Brown v. Bd. of Education, along with their more recent conservative corollaries, are solely the product of adherence to constitutional standards of interpretation. Instead, it posits that these controversial rulings and judicial policy in general can be explained through careful examination of certain political factors. In short, the course is based on the premise that the judiciary is a permeable structure that is responsive to democratic processes and that, in turn, exerts influence upon those processes. Two major theoretical concerns integrate the lectures and materials covered: 1) the dynamic relationship between court decisionmaking processes and major features of the larger American political arena, and 2) the inherent tensions between judicial independence and democratic politics. </p></div>

Using political science--rather than theology or philosophy--as the lens for inquiry emphasizes the role played by political power in the creation and transmission of these systems of value. Beginning with an exploration of the roots of Western Just War thinking in the ancient world (Greece, Rome, and Israel), the course explores traditional just war thinking in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Students delve into source texts, examining the evolution of just war thought in a historical and comparative context, and the course illustrates the ways in which concepts of justice may be contingent on both a society's religious/ethnical beliefs and its military capabilities. Finally, the course turns to contemporary scholarship to ask, is just war theory still relevant today? Modern just war responses to weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and counter-insurgency warfare provide students the opportunity to apply these ancient theories to the modern world. </p></div>

It explores various arguments for state sovereignty and examines several challenges to it as well. Finally, it considers the state of the state in today's globalized world. </p></div>

Students also explore the role of the Supreme Court in the definition and protection of these rights and engage the several controversies surrounding the larger enterprise of constitutional interpretation, such as originalism v. nonoriginalism, natural law v. positivism, judicial activism v. judicial restraint, and so forth. </p></div>

More specifically, students focus on the structural characteristics of the American regime, or Constitution--separation of powers, federalism, emergency powers, property rights; but students are equally concerned with the politics of interpretation itself--the complex process by which people determine what is the Constitution, how it is to be understood, and who has authority to interpret it. The responsibility for constitutional interpretation is broadly distributed, but it is also obvious that the preeminent voice for interpreting the Constitution has become the Supreme Court. Accordingly, students spend the greater portion of the course with the analysis of cases, that is, the Court's opinion of what the Constitution means. </p></div>

Most have had relatively free and honest elections; some have even had peaceful transfers of power later on; most are somewhere in the process of changing to market economies. But in many places, the quality of life has deteriorated in important respects, and democratization is stale-mated by economic crises, ethnic and religious conflicts, low levels of political participation, crime, and other problems. This seminar explores democratic transitions -the removal of repressive regimes and the establishment of new democratic institutions -and democratic consolidation -the process of "deepening" democracy and making it sustainable. Major topics include the role of civil society, relationships between wealth and power, ethnic conflicts and national identity, political participation and accountability, building democratic cultures, and models of democracy appropriate for different societies. </p></div>

Bureaucracies defend us, educate us, collect our taxes, provide us with basic services, protect our health and safety, and occasionally kill us. Effective bureaucratic agencies are necessary for the creation and sustenance of modern, democratic government. At the same time, bureaucratic power can be a threat to democracy. Legislatures may pass laws, executives may issue orders, and courts may judge, but real governance happens when a soldier fires a gun, a teacher grades a paper, an inspector certifies an aircraft, and a police officer writes a speeding ticket. The difference between effective and dysfunctional bureaucracy at the street level--where governments and people interact--can make the difference between flourishing and failing democracy. This seminar offers an introduction to organizational theory and the politics of bureaucracy, with discussions and analysis centered on the HBO series "The Wire." Students learn classic theories and emerging research on human organization and bureaucratic politics by applying them to the characters and stories of the acclaimed television series. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Each of these perspectives provides unique evidence concerning "origins." Developmental psychology examines the origins of thought within the lifespan of the individual within a particular culture; cross-cultural psychology examines the degree to which ways of thinking originate culturally; comparative psychology studies the evolutionary origins of thinking by making comparisons among species. These different approaches to studying "origins" are applied to a few focused topics in human cognition, such as origins of speech, concepts and categories, perception of objects, and perception of music. </p></div>

Students then review interventions that have been used to encourage cooperation and facilitate positive relationships among children from different backgrounds. Finally, the class explores the use of music and drama to facilitate the development of social connection in children. With this background, students participate in an extensive service-learning project where they are directly responsible for the development and implementation of a 6-week drama and music workshop for local children with and without disabilities.

Students consider both proximate (immediate) influences on behavior, such as the immediate social situation, as well as distal (more remote) influences on behavior, such as human evolution. Both motivational approaches to understanding prejudice (e.g., explaining prejudice as a consequence of the desire for social dominance) as well as cognitive approaches (e.g., explaining prejudice as a byproduct of automatic associations people learn) are examined. </p></div>

That is, students investigate how these traditions envision morality as such but also how they think concretely about violence, gender, poverty, and the value of human life. This comparative approach to the study of religion ultimately hopes to prompt students toward a consideration of what is, as well as what is not, ethical about these traditions. </p></div>

Classical Chinese thought was defined by the violence of the times and was therefore directed toward the question of how social harmony might be established and maintained. Later Confucian thought, under the influence of Buddhism, introduced additional questions about ethics and the human relationship to the cosmos. These intellectual traditions influenced generations of Chinese scholars and officials, and they also give insight into some of the unique aspects of Chinese society today. The course considers attempts by modern-day scholars ("New Confucians") to apply Chinese thought to contemporary ethical and political problems. </p></div>

How does the construction of the sacred text reflect its theological meaning? The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation. As students read through the canon they establish the boundaries of the texts studied, distinguish the type(s) of literature found in them, examine their prose and poetic qualities, and identify their surface structures. Students also consider the literary legacy of the Bible and the many ways that subsequent writers have revisited its stories. </p></div>

Similarly, while biomedicine defines health as the absence of disease, in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, health is about achieving balance between different elements in the body, such as wind, water, and fire. Students will develop an appreciation for the culturally and historically patterned ways in which people come to identify and treat bodily, psychological, and social distress. For instance, students will examine spirit possession in a variety of contexts as both a form of affliction and as a mode of healing. Students will look at the role of traditional healers; how cultures vary in what they consider to be the causes of illness; who gets sick; what forms illness takes; and how the social, political, and aesthetic dimensions of health and healing affect treatment outcomes. Readings will be drawn from the fields of ethnomedicine, medical anthropology, and the anthropology of religion, to explore how illness and health are conceptualized and experienced in different cultures and across different sites of healing. </p></div>

Until the 1960s, Christian thinkers considered it the great glory of Christianity that it alone among the world's religions had permitted purely secular science to develop in a civilization in which it was dominant. After several centuries of an ever-increasing eclipse of the religious significance of nature in the West and neglect of the order of nature, humans are now experiencing environmental crisis: global warming; the destruction of the ozone layer; climatic and weather pattern changes; soil erosion; death of animals, birds, and marine life; and the disappearance of some plant species. Today the very fabric of life is threatened and the future of our world hangs in the balance as nature is threatened by destruction caused by an environmental crisis that has gone unchecked for several centuries. What can be learned from religions of the world that will save humanity and nature? What is the relationship between religion, nature, science, and technology? Discussions include views from various religious traditions concerning nature, concept of the human, notions of progress and destiny, faith and science, ecological theology, ecofeminism, justice and sustainability, and spirituality.</p><p>Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Human Thought and Expression Liberal Arts CORE: None</p></div>

Through close readings of primary texts in translation, this course focuses on the history of Hindu traditions from their origins to the development of devotional movements in medieval and early modern India. Following a chronological order, these texts include the hymns of the ancient Vedas, the investigations into salvific reality in the Upanishads, the religious epics, devotional poems in praise of gods, religious philosophy (Yoga and Advaita Vedanta), and classical mythology. While exploring the variety of forms Hinduism has taken, the class engages broader questions in the study of religions such as the construction of religious authority, the definition of the good life, conceptions of the soul, differences between elite and non-elite styles of religiosity, and the significance of gender in conceptualizations of the divine. </p></div>

Within decades, Muhammad's message sparked a religious and social revolution that changed the course of human history. Students examine the rise of Islam, its emergence as a diverse global religion, and its multi-faceted encounters with Western-style modernity. Students begin by studying the Qur'an, the life of Muhammad, and the stories of his immediate successors. Who exactly was Muhammad, and what was the nature of his message? What challenges did the early Muslim community face? Following our exploration of the earliest phases of Islamic history, students then delve into the formation of two major streams of Islamic thought: shari'a (Islamic law) and Sufism (Islamic mysticism). The final third of the semester focuses on Muslim responses to European colonialism and Western-style modernity. Specifically, we examine colonial-era changes to shari'a, the Iranian Revolution, the rise of violent Islamists like Al Qaeda and ISIS, and modern Muslims living in the West. </p></div>

The great themes articulated by Luther, Calvin, and others constituted a challenge to established authority that involved the Church, the monarchies, and the dissenters. The Protestant tradition that emerged gave rise to new conceptions of political order that profoundly impacted the ideological, social, and political foundations of the United States. Protestant vision contributed heavily to biblical metaphors shaping American self-understanding.

The cognitive science of religion also seeks to answer why it is that certain beliefs and specific practices appear to outperform and outlive others. More generally, the CSR seeks to explain the persistence and pervasiveness of religious beliefs and practices throughout human history by drawing on the theories and methodologies of a range of disciplines, including cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, behavioral ecology, and several others, as well as disciplines more traditionally associated with the study of religion. Scholars in CSR embrace a variety of methods, including textual analysis, quantification of historical and archaeological data, statistical analysis of ethnographic data, controlled laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling.

Russia's modern wars have been particularly (although certainly not uniquely) traumatic, with profound impacts on government and citizen alike. The course examines the ways in which the events leading up to war, wartime conditions, and eyewitness accounts were recorded and internalized by citizens and managed by an autocratic state to create collective historical understandings of events. By analyzing the changing ways in which social hierarchy, gender and exclusivity have been structured during and in the aftermath of war, the course offers an important guide to understanding the emergence of ethno-nationalism in one of the world's largest and longestlasting multiethnic Empires. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

This region offers some of the most sophisticated works of science fiction, owing to the radical "otherness" of its philosophical and political traditions and the challenges it offers to dominant Western constructions of self, nature, and society. Focusing on philosophical, ethical, and environmental questions, students will discuss such topics as human-machine interfaces and ethics, life-extension and transhumanism, space travel and colonization, and the prospects and perils of the rationally-planned society. Course readings are in English. No prior experience in Russian studies required.

It often focuses upon characters who are at an existential breaking point because of ideological, spiritual, sexual, or economic pressures. Students read a combination of short stories and novels, concentrating upon canonical "greats" (Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov) but also sampling lesser-known writers, including neglected female authors. By examining literary depictions of such social institutions as warfare, dueling and gambling, courtship and marriage, adultery and spousal abuse, work and leisure, the course emphasizes the relationship between literary text and cultural context. Particular attention is paid to the cultural construction of gender, as well as the relationship between humans and nature. A range of theoretical and critical texts informs discussions, as do film adaptations of certain works. All works are read in translation, but a FLAC section of the course may be offered for advanced Russian language students who are interested in trying to read selections in the original Russian.

Beginning with the idealists, nihilists, and terrorists determined to bring the Russian monarchy to an end in the 19th century, the course explores history, politics, and culture through a range of genres and media--from the 19th-century Russian realist novel, the political manifesto, the avant-garde film, revolutionary poetry, to the works of seminal historians who have shaped how we "read" the Russian revolution today. Is the revolution over, so to speak? Are we ever finished with an historical event of such monumental consequence? Course requirements include readings, film screenings, local Colgate events, and an excursion to New York City's Museum of Modern Art.

But, especially since WWII, much armed conflict has taken place between states and other kinds of entities -national liberation movements, criminal syndicates, warlords, terrorist groups. In an extreme case such as Somalia, states have totally disintegrated. This course asks what the consequences of this change are for our sociological understanding of the nature of warfare. It examines case studies of armed conflict in the present and recent past -Afghanistan, Kashmir, warlordism in West Africa, Northern Ireland, armed leftist movements in Western Europe during the 1970s; and in late colonial period and its aftermath, the Mau-Mau Rebellion, the Algerian war of independence, the Rhodesian War.

Focusing on field and survey research, students examine the ways social scientists formulate questions, collect and analyze data, and present their findings. Also concerned with the epistemological underpinnings of "doing sociology." How do sociologists define "fact" and "truth"? What are the historical and contemporary debates over these concepts? To provide students with a hands-on understanding of concepts and issues, students are expected to collect and analyze original data.

The media "frames" that structure how media is produced, conveyed, and consumed form the discourses that we use to understand mass politics and culture in our daily lives. This course provides students with the methodological tools to empirically study media frames through content analysis. Content analysis takes the stuff of media, such as music lyrics, news stories, or advertisements, and systematically analyzes the content for the explicit and implicit frames that represent the issues and perspectives conveyed through media. The course provides students hands-on training in content analysis through a series of workshops on content sampling, collection, coding, and analysis that culminate in a final research project. This course meets for the first 7 weeks of the term and may be used to satisfy the 0.50-credit methods requirement for the sociology major.</p><p>Credits: 0.50 Crosslisted: GEOG 251 Corequisite: None ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

The course gives special attention to the relationship between social thought and its historical-political context, and notably its relationship to labor and anti-colonial movements and the "new social movements." Central themes in the course include the problems of the idea of "culture"; how much an understanding of "class" can or cannot explain; and the status of notions of ideology, discourse, and materialism in contemporary social thought. Theorists who work may be covered include Gramsci, Norbert Elias, Karl Polanyi, C. Wright Mills, De ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

The course will adopt a multidisciplinary approach, examining a variety of texts from different intellectual perspectives. Rhetoric--the effective use of language to persuade a given audience--is as old as human speech itself. Yet attuned as they were to "kairos," the opportune time of a fledgling democracy in Athens, the ancient Greeks were perhaps the first to codify rhetorical practice as an art. This is a course about time, about the art of rhetoric as a most effective medium of change at the right time. Students see this when rhetoric served as a vehicle for change in 5th-century Greece, when it equipped individuals to write and preach to effect change in the so-called dark ages, and when it gave women and former slaves the voice to change attitudes and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students survey the entire history of western rhetoric from the earliest treatises to the most recent theories. In addition to examining this history through a close reading of canonical texts, students come to know the rhetorical tradition through experience, by engaging in the very practices (e.g., medieval preaching and letter writing, and 18th-century exercises in elocution) associated with rhetoric in a particular historical period. The many rhetorical terms, concepts, principles, and practices covered in the course provide students the proper background for further study in the more specialized areas of rhetoric. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 21, 2019.

Civil war, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, and Black Power were all actions or movements that ensued largely because words fell short of persuading persons of good will to submit to reasoned arguments. Arguably a pillar of American democracy (as in the freedom to speak and to dissent), why has rhetoric been so seemingly ineffective in securing mutual respect and understanding between America's Black and White citizens? This course seeks to answer this question by closely examining the styles of communication that historically have shaped the cultural identities and public personas of the two groups. From slave speech to the languages of protest in the 1960s to verbal expression in rap music and social media today, the course considers why communication or dialogue involving race is often doomed to fail. The primary focus will be the body as viewed through the rhetorical lens of techné, defined by Aristotle as crafted knowledge and application. It engages with recent developments in the field of rhetoric, which has expanded to consider how persuasion and meaning making are impacted by movement, gender, and performance. To this end, the course will center on theories for studying bodies, introducing students to the dominant conversations within rhetoric and related fields. Students will apply these frameworks to texts from popular, political, and artistic performances to better understand how dominant narratives about the body constrain or enable certain types of behavior and what they signify. Through this theoretical and practical study, students will become critically aware of the intersections of bodies and their representations and how these intersections influence our capacity for engaged deliberation and social action.</p></div>

It analyzes the evolution of Chinese economic market reforms and China's uneven integration into the Liberal World Order since 1978. This two-pronged developmental trajectory, however, encounters major challenges such as socioeconomic problems, ecological degradations, political dysfunctions, ideational crises, and international impediments. With varying efficacy, the Chinese government has attempted to redress these daunting problems through administrative reforms, economic rebalancing, anticorruption campaigns, and international institutions. These major challenges and their attempted ameliorations are analyzed in-depth. The course concludes by examining the practical and discursive ramifications of China's development model for Chinese society, world politics, and the philosophical search for alternative modernities.Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None</figDesc></figure>

Where does this principle originate? Are there exceptions? This course explores the relationship between religion and law in the United States. Students consider the question of what Americans mean when they speak of the separation of church and state, and explore the ways in which the U.S. Supreme Court has attempted to implement this principle within American law. Students examine a variety of influential theories of church-state separation, and read some of the most important First Amendment cases of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Ultimately, this course familiarizes students with some of the most significant voices within today's churchstate debate, and provides them with the tools for an ongoing understanding of religion and law in the United States.

Students consider such questions as: What is a constitution? Why have one? What does it mean to "have" a constitution (what are the possible relations between the text and practice)? What are the distinct forms of constitutional government and what are their advantages and disadvantages? To what extent should we consider a constitution a cause or effect of political culture? How should one interpret a constitution; to what extent are the terms of American debate-such as originalism v.nonoriginalism-found in other countries? As the form of government to which most countries aspire today (or the form they claim to be), liberal democracy seems to have pride of place, but why? Is it the right answer to the ancient question of the "best regime"? Or perhaps the best practicable regime? Do the forces of history favor its existence, or does this depend more fundamentally on acts of statesmanship?</figDesc><table><row><cell>: 1.00</cell></row><row><cell>Corequisite: None</cell></row><row><cell>Prerequisites: None</cell></row><row><cell>Major/Minor Restrictions: None</cell></row><row><cell>Class Restriction: None</cell></row><row><cell>Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp;amp; Agents</cell></row><row><cell>Using Credits: 1.00</cell></row><row><cell>Corequisite: None</cell></row><row><cell>Prerequisites: None</cell></row><row><cell>Major/Minor Restrictions: None</cell></row><row><cell>Class Restriction: None</cell></row><row><cell>Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.&amp; Agents</cell></row><row><cell>Liberal Arts CORE: None</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Social bonds are traced through the lifespan, beginning with parent-infant attachments, moving next to peer relationships, and ending with pair bonds.

It began as the language of youth and grew to its present centrality. This music course examines innovative songs and artists, primarily from the `50s through the `70s, the era of classic rock. The goals of the course are to broaden students' knowledge of rock history for this period, to gain insights into the music and lyrics, to learn how to listen and analyze music, and to think critically. Since rock reflected 20th-century society, broad issues of culture, art, and history are also discussed. (H&amp;A) </p></div>

Students learn to distinguish by ear plainchant, classic polyphony, operatic-symphonic, and popular idioms (including some of non-western cultures) as well as the history of each. The course also covers the principal liturgies of the Roman rite and some of the more important 20th-century legislation regarding liturgical music. This is an 8week course.

For many advocates and activists, the gap is a source of frustration as international human rights laws and norms rarely translate into basic protections at the level of the individual. This course is designed to make students aware of the contentious nature of human rights, both in theory and in practice. It is premised on the idea that human rights are constantly claimed and developed, if not made anew, by multiple actors--whether as rights-holders, advocates, or otherwise, and that this takes place in the context of intense struggle between state and non-state actors. Students examine both the international human rights regime and the struggle for human rights, and how they interact in practice. The course takes a purposeful right-based and victimcentered approach, with the goal of introducing students to the profession of human rights advocacy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 226 -Philosophy of Religion</head><p>Can the existence of God be proven? Can it be disproven? What is the relationship between faith and reason? Does evil provide strong evidence against the existence of God? How should we think about the relationship between creation and evolution --and about the relationship between science and religion generally? Does the Christian notion of the Trinity make any sense? What about the idea of Original Sin or the Atonement? Students seek reasoned answers to many of these questions by evaluating the work of philosophers who address them. Students encounter both classical and contemporary authors, though the class focuses more on perspicacious presentations of these issues rather than on their historical development.</p></div>

Guided by evolutionary, developmental, and cross-cultural perspectives, questions about social power and leadership are addressed using empirical literature: To what degree are motives for social dominance--and social docility--embedded in human nature and traceable through primate evolution? What traits and competencies distinguish leaders from followers, how early do these differences develop, and is the pattern the same for girls and boys, and for men and women, across the globe? How do some leaders and groups cultivate followers so devoted that they adhere to destructive directives? Contemporary problems in leadership provide illustrations. </p></div>

The field of social psychology is devoted to understanding how people feel about, think about, and interact with others. This advanced social psychology seminar offers a contemporary, in-depth exploration of different topic areas within the field of social psychology.

By pursuing close readings of classic texts in the field of philosophy of religion, this course considers how both philosophical and religious ideas are often developed together. Students explore various arguments about the rationality of God as responses to wider intellectual, cultural, and historical contexts in which they are made and to the specific shape and needs of a particular religious tradition (e.g., Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism). Students also explore the "rationality" of religious forms such as scripture, symbol, ritual, and prayer. In different semesters, select themes such as revelation, theodicy (the justification of God in the face of human suffering), providence and free will, or the theism/atheism debate are investigated. </p></div>

The course foregrounds the ways that each tradition understands the city as a symbol--as a holy city, a city of God, a centre of the cosmos. As importantly, it explores how religion is lived within the city's sacred geography, investigating the religious practices and sacred sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in Jerusalem. </p></div>

Over the last 200 years tremendous changes have revolutionized the nature of mass communication in modern societies. Designed to provide a basic understanding of the nature of mass media and its social significance. It addresses the impact of different types of communication from information exchange, to news, to entertainment, to advertising. Students are introduced to a wide range of media including print, telegraphy, film, recorded sound, radio, television, and digital. This course is about analyzing how media texts are produced; why some messages enter mass media channels and others do not; how these messages affect audiences and how audiences receive them; and the general impact of mass media on contemporary society, culture, and politics. </p></div>

Students critically consider how a range of historical, cultural, economic, legal and social factors shape our notions of family. Students examine recent family demographic trends and changes in gender roles and ideologies, and in doing so, investigate how and why family forms and decisions are differentiated by social class, race-ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. In addition, students examine the implications of different family formation trends for individual and child-wellbeing. Finally, students draw on sociological research and perspectives to evaluate how social policies impact families, including same-sex families, poverty and welfare, work-family balance, marriage promotion</p></div>

This course fuses theory to praxis in introducing students to basic public speaking skills, including researching, organization, and writing effective oral presentations; developing skills of critical listening and audience analysis; surveying key examples of public address; and providing students the opportunity to work in different speech situations. Students develop poise and self-confidence in public speaking as they deepen their understanding of the evolving aesthetics of public discourse in the context of new media and global cultures.

How does a writer's combination of verbal and visual elements communicate different arguments when circulated among different audiences? How do verbal/visual texts imitate, represent, and/or constitute cultural identities, norms, values, or practices? With the goal of becoming effective rhetorical critics, as well as incisive consumers and producers of visual culture, students in this course study a variety of visual texts in print and electronic form and examine these texts' complex powers of persuasion. The primary work is to develop and strengthen fluency in rhetorical discourse and visual literacy, as students work to perceive and analyze, as well as design and create, verbal-visual texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WRIT 242 -Stand and Speak: Feminist Rhetorics and Social Change</head><p>As an introduction to rhetoric, rhetorical history and criticism, and feminist rhetorics, this course fore-grounds the study of how 19th-century women used both pen and voice with rhetorical precision to "stand and speak" to issues that marked their personal lives and their times. By studying women who composed and embodied what is now understood as the early years of the first wave of U.S. feminism, students access a genealogy of women rhectors who serve as exemplars -and cautions -for later waves and for their own contemporary visions of social change. By positioning the study of rhetoric as the study of language as it constitutes social relations, power, and knowledge, students become more acutely aware of and fluent in the composition, circulation, and criticism of private and public discourses, the verbal material through which they construct social worlds. The work for this course requires close reading and active discussion of course texts through a rhetorical lens and through the category of gender. This course does not meet the writing requirement. </p></div>
