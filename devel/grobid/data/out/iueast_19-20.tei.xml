<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for Academic Forgiveness</head><p>Students who are enrolled in an IU East undergraduate degree program (BUSE, EDUC, HSS, NSM, NURS) may petition for grade forgiveness if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p>• Student has experienced a gap in enrollment of at least two (2) calendar years. THIS IS NEW! Prior to Fall 2019, the gap of enrollment must have been four (4) calendar years. Effective Fall 2019, the required gap of enrollment will be reduced to two (2) calendar years. • Student has since completed at least 12 credit hours of graded course work, at IU East, and has passed all courses with a GPA of at least 2.0. • Student has passed all IU East courses with an average GPA of at least 2.0 in the current enrollment period. • The student is pursuing their first baccalaureate degree.</p><p>This grade forgiveness policy applies to all IU East undergraduate degree programs.

Schools may specify GPA requirements for degree conferral, including specifying a minimum cumulative GPA that may exclude grades forgiven under the general campus policy.</p><p>Schools retain the right to consider all records of student performance in determining admission to the School, granting of honors, and other matters.</p></div>

Fulltime students should carry at least 15 credit hours during each semester of the regular academic year (i.e., each fall and spring term) if they expect to complete degree requirements within the usual 4-year time frame. Except with special permission, students are not permitted to enroll in more than 18 credit hours in the fall or spring and in no more than 9 credit hours during either of the two summer sessions. A 3.00 grade point average is generally required before such permission will be granted.</p></div>

The course selected for P/F must be an elective; it may not be used to satisfy requirements for institutional or degree programs. Students must file a P/F option request within the first three weeks of a fall or spring semester, or the first two weeks of a summer session. Students should consult with the academic advisor and school dean prior to submitting the P/F option request. The school dean is responsible for determining the elective nature of the course and signing the request form. Once approved, the P/F option request form is forwarded to the Office of Student Records for processing.</p><p>Instructors will not be notified of those students registering for the P/F option. A final letter grade will be submitted by the instructor and any grade other than an F, FN, or FNN will be converted to P.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeal Policy Student Appeal Process</head><p>Most course grade appeals can be resolved informally between instructor and student; however, a formal appeal can be initiated through the following grade appeals process. Students may request face-to-face meetings at any time during this process. Decisions at any level are separate and apart from an earlier decision. Special consideration can be given if severe circumstances prohibit the student from following the time frames listed below (e.g. military deployment or catastrophic illness).</p><p>Step One: Appeal to Instructor • Initiate within 10 business days after course grade is posted. • Contact Instructor in writing to attempt to resolve the matter amicably. • The appeal may proceed to Step Two if an amicable resolution could not be reached or the instructor does contact.</p><p>Step Two: Appeal to Dean of School electronic gradebook, and/or copies of previous communications with instructor, and/or witness testimony</p><p>• The Dean may appoint a faculty designee of the school to review the appeal. • The Dean or designee may require additional documentation.</p><p>Step Three: Appeal to Admissions &amp; Academic Affairs Committee (AAA)</p><p>• Initiate within 10 business days upon conclusion of</p><p>Step Two. electronic gradebook, and/or copies of previous communications with instructor and/or Dean, and/or witness testimony.</p><p>• AAA may require additional documentation.</p><p>• The decision of AAA will be final.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades and courses for which this option is available</head><p>Grade replacement under this policy is only available for undergraduate courses with fixed credit. Grades in courses with variable topic may not be replaced unless the topics, rigor, expected competencies, and work-assignments in both courses are the same. The determination of equivalency is made by the faculty. Under this policy, any grade may be replaced by the grade in the retaken course. e used to replace another grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Record</head><p>This policy only excludes certain grades from the calculation of the grade point average. All grades will the transcript will indicate if a grade is not included in the GPA calculation. The provisions apply to undergraduate courses taken by students pursuing an undergraduate degree only. If a degree has been awarded, in no case may a grade be replaced for a course taken prior to the award of that degree. Schools and programs with selective admissions criteria may use a GPA calculation that does not honor the grade replacement under this policy in determining admissibility, academic standards, honors and graduation criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Students may petition for grade replacement under this policy at any time after repeating the course. The petition is made on a course-by-course basis. Once a grade fice will in consultation with the Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and the Admissions and Academic Affairs Committee establish a procedure consistent with this policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades Earned at other IU campuses</head><p>Students who take a course at another IU campus and subsequently repeat that course at IU East may petition for grade replacement under this policy. However, replacement of grades earned at another IU campus is subject to the policies and procedures at that campus. The registrar at IU East shall forward petitions for grade replacement to the appropriate registrar and shall act as a liaison between the divisions and faculty who are responsible for evaluating the replacement.</p><p>Honoring grade replacement requests from other IU campuses IU East joins all other IU campuses in honoring the principle that the grade policies on the degree granting campus are applicable for each student. Hence, if an IU East student transfers to another campus with different grade replacement policies, IU East will honor requests from that campus, on behalf of the student, to replace an IU East grade that may not be replaceable under this policy. If the student were to return to IU East for graduation, however, that grade exclusion may not apply. In such a case, the student may petition to the degree-granting division to honor the IU sister-Grades earned outside of the IU system cannot be used to replace grades earned at IU East.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade replacement with courses using different course numbers</head><p>A student may petition to replace a grade in one course with the grade earned in another course, provided that the two courses are equivalent. The determination of equivalency of the two courses is made by the appropriate department chair and the faculty of the subject area. In order to establish equivalency, the faculty must determine that topics, rigor, expected competencies, and workassignments in both courses are equivalent. A comparison of course descriptions alone is not adequate to establish equivalency. Students may not petition for grade replacement on the basis of having proved competency by successfully completing a subsequent course, through life experience, or through testing. [Explanation: This provision is meant to be used in cases where a course number has been changed, or where the two different course numbers are used for essentially the same course.]</p></div>
