<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In and through the visible world in which we live, we come to know and experience the invisible God. In mediation the Catholic vision perceives God not only present in but also working through persons, events, and material things. There is an intelligibility and a coherence to all reality, discoverable through spirit, mind and imagination. God's grace prompts human activity to assist the world in creating justice grounded in love. God's way to us comes as communion, through the communities in which men and women live. This community includes the many theological traditions, liturgies, and spiritualities that fashion the life of the church. The emphasis on community in Catholicism explains why Notre Dame historically has fostered familial bonds in its institutional life.</p><p>A Catholic university draws its basic inspiration from Jesus Christ as the source of wisdom and from the conviction that in him all things can be brought to their completion. As a Catholic university, Notre Dame wishes to contribute to this educational mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>the MIssIon</head><p>The University of Notre Dame is a Catholic academic community of higher learning, animated from its origins by the Congregation of Holy Cross. The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake. As a Catholic university, one of its distinctive goals is to provide a forum where through free inquiry and open discussion the various lines of Catholic thought may intersect with all the forms of knowledge found in the arts, sciences, professions, and every other area of human scholarship and creativity.</p><p>The intellectual interchange essential to a university requires, and is enriched by, the presence and voices of diverse scholars and students. The Catholic identity of the University depends upon, and is nurtured by, the continuing presence of a predominant number of Catholic intellectuals. This ideal has been consistently maintained by the University leadership throughout its history. What the University asks of all its scholars and students, however, is not a particular creedal affiliation but a respect for the objectives of Notre Dame and a willingness to enter into the conversation that gives it life and character. Therefore, the University insists upon academic freedom, which makes open discussion and inquiry possible.</p><p>The University prides itself on being an environment of teaching and learning that fosters the development in its students of those disciplined habits of mind, body, and spirit that characterize educated, skilled, and free human beings. In addition, the University seeks to cultivate in its students not only an appreciation for the great achievements of human beings but also a disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice, and oppression that burden the lives of so many. The aim is to create a sense of human solidarity and concern for the common good that will bear fruit as learning becomes service to justice.</p><p>Notre Dame also has a responsibility to advance knowledge in a search for truth through original inquiry and publication. This responsibility engages the faculty and students in all areas of the University, but particularly in graduate and professional education and research. The University is committed to constructive and critical engagement with the whole of human culture.</p><p>The University encourages a way of living consonant with a Christian community and manifest in prayer, liturgy, and service. Residential life endeavors to develop that sense of community and of responsibility that prepares students for subsequent leadership in building a society that is at once more human and more divine.</p><p>Notre Dame's character as a Catholic academic community presupposes that no genuine search for the truth in the human or the cosmic order is alien to the life of faith. The University welcomes all areas of scholarly activity as consonant with its mission, subject to appropriate critical refinement. There is, however, a special obligation and opportunity, specifically as a Catholic university, to pursue the religious dimensions of all human learning. Only thus can Catholic intellectual life in all disciplines be animated and fostered. Notre Dame pursues its objectives through the formation of an authentic human community graced by the Spirit of Christ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The University of Notre Dame</head><p>Notre Dame is at once a Catholic university, a national symbol, and an international community of religious faith, intellectual inquiry, and devotion to the powerless. Among its conspicuous features are its academic reputation, an elaborately designed and golden-domed administration building, a famous collegiate football team, a popular shrine to the Mother of God, two fascinating lakes, a pleasantly landscaped campus, and a spirited student body surrounded by an intensely loyal community of alumni and friends who unabashedly refer to themselves as the Notre Dame "family."</p><p>The institution was founded on the site of an old Catholic missionary outpost in 1842. The founders were a small and impoverished band of French and Irish religious brothers whose leader was Rev. Edward F. Sorin, C.S.C., an impetuous, strong-willed, and apparently tireless priest. In a memoir titled My Notre Dame, Thomas Stritch, professor emeritus of American Studies and Notre Dame historian, wrote that Father Sorin "carved Notre Dame out of the Northern Indiana wilderness and by sheer strength of character made it go. He built and rebuilt, recruited students where he could, and gradually began the unique image Notre Dame still enjoys. In a college or university, reputation is everything. Somehow Sorin developed a favorable one for Notre Dame, one that reverberated throughout the American Catholic world, the Eastern Seaboard as well as the Midwest. Long before football was invented, Notre Dame caught the imagination of American Catholics."</p><p>Father Sorin was a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross, a then recently formed Catholic religious community that would own and administer the University from its foundation until 1967, when the University's governance was legally transferred to a two-tiered, mixed board of lay and religious trustees and fellows. The University's bylaws ensure that the Congregation will continue to exert a prominent influence on its administration. They stipulate, for example, that Notre Dame's presidents must always be chosen from among the priests of the Congregation. The Congregation also ministers to the University it founded through the many Holy Cross priests serving on the University's faculty, the counselors and chaplains who live with the undergraduate students in the residence halls, and the staff of the campus ministry office.</p><p>In 1972, five years after the change in governance, a new chapter of University history began to be written as the first undergraduate women were admitted to Notre Dame. A quarter of a century later, the majority of living Notre Dame alumni have been graduated from a fully coeducational institution.</p><p>Obviously, many other aspects of the University have been changed by more than a century and a half of turbulent and unpredictable happenings in the Catholic Church and in American life and culture. Fires, outbreaks of infectious diseases, the Civil War, waves of European immigrants and refugees, Church controversies, the Great Depression, two world wars and several smaller bloodlettings, the civil rights movement, and other social convulsions in America, all have involved members of the Notre Dame family and have left deep and indelible imprints on the character and rich tradition of the institution. Rev. William Corby, C.S.C., a successor to Father Sorin, played a memorable national role as a Union chaplain at the Battle of Gettysburg; Rev. Julius Nieuwland, C.S.C., a scientist and faculty member, invented synthetic rubber; Notre Dame students were participants in a nationally publicized scuffle with a resurgent Ku Klux Klan; the University's colorful football team and something of its campus atmosphere were enshrined in American history and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notre Dame's Vision for Undergraduate Education</head><p>Notre Dame is a vibrant academic community dedicated to scholarship and the advancement of knowledge, where students find opportunities on campus and abroad to develop initiative and leadership, and to learn by being fully engaged in our classrooms, libraries, research laboratories, studios, and residence halls among other venues. Notre Dame seeks to nurture in its students intellectual passion and a keenly developed moral sense, goals attainable only where freedom of thought and expression flourishes in a culture built on respect, responsibility, and integrity.</p><p>Drawing on our Catholic intellectual tradition, which fosters the integration of faith and reason, Notre Dame offers an undergraduate education rooted in the fundamental belief that all truths participate in the Divine Truth, a belief that motivates the vigorous search for knowledge.</p><p>Notre Dame inspires students to pursue learning as a good in itself and to see that pursuit as involving the whole person. We cultivate each student's capacity to think creatively and critically while valuing the rich inheritance that comes from our shared past. We expect our graduates to be conversant with and equipped to contribute to the best thinking across the disciplines. Notre Dame helps students acquire the virtues necessary for living a good human life and prepares them to become leaders in their professions, for their communities, the Church, and the world.</p><p>As a community committed to service, we challenge students to grow in their understanding of complex human realities, and we call them to respond to the needs of the world with compassion and committed action. By educating students to be engaged by both their intellectual labors and their faith, we aspire to offer an education that is Catholic in the broadest sense of the word, both in welcoming all persons of good will to our university community and turning outward to embrace the larger world.</p><p>Formed by a rich liberal education and possessed of mature faith in service to others, our graduates leave Notre Dame prepared to take their places at the forefront of discovery, innovation, and human achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Life</head><p>Notre Dame offers its students a quality education, made possible by an excellent faculty, advanced research facilities, experienced administration, and a well-developed educational philosophy. Education here also extends far beyond coursework and research, to the development and formation facilitated by residential and spiritual life, student development, and a culture grounded in the University's Catholic, Holy Cross mission, which seeks to educate both the mind and the heart.</p><p>The Division of Student Affairs enriches the experience of Notre Dame students by offering services, resources, and engagement opportunities designed to develop students to their full potential. The Division oversees residential and extracurricular programs that promote community, faith, wellness, service, and discernment for the University's student body.</p><p>residential life: Residential life is perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Notre Dame experience. At Notre Dame, residential life is designed to form undergraduate communities that are inclusive of all members; dedicated to the intellectual, moral, and spiritual development of each individual; and characterized by a collective sense of care and concern for the common good and service to others. The residence halls also form the base of many students' spiritual, athletic, social, and volunteer service activities.</p><p>Each of Notre Dame's 31 undergraduate residence halls has an atmosphere and character of its own. Unique traditions in each hall generate a feeling of loyalty and camaraderie among its residents. Welltrained rectors, assistant rectors, and senior resident assistants provide multiple layers of pastoral care for the students who call a Notre Dame residence hall "home."</p><p>First-year students, sophomores, and juniors, beginning with the incoming class of 2018, are required to live on campus for six semesters. Study abroad facilitated through Notre Dame International automatically counts toward the fulfillment of the six-semester expectation, with other exceptions considered on an individual basis. Several hall leadership roles, along with incentives to stay in the halls, are available to seniors.</p><p>spiritual life: Notre Dame is a professedly Catholic place, which means-at its core-all are welcome.</p><p>Beliefs are strengthened by a commitment to God, to one another, and to the human family in love and service while at Notre Dame and throughout life.</p><p>The Office of Campus Ministry is rooted in the Catholic tradition and inspired by the charism and spirituality of the Congregation of Holy Cross, and works to bring education, the Catholic faith, and the hope of the Cross to students and the broader Notre Dame community. The office is dedicated to inspiring students to engage others about their faith and discovering their gifts for exercising leadership while at Notre Dame and within the wider Church. The office ministers faithfully and fervently to all students, regardless of denomination, faith tradition, or level of education at the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intercollegiate Athletics</head><p>Since its first athletic contest in 1887, the University of Notre Dame has proudly shouldered the responsibility as a model for intercollegiate athletics. Notre Dame student-athletes today live by the athletic department's five pillars: excellence, education, faith, community and tradition. Not only do the approximately 650 student-athletes across the department's 26 sports excel on the field, in the classroom and in community-centered service efforts, they show their commitment to those endeavors through their displays of faith and of pride in the University. More than 130 years on, Notre Dame student-athletes remain unparalleled in their dedication to shine in all facets of college life.</p><p>The University is committed to a well-rounded program for both men and women. The Notre Dame athletic tradition boasts national contenders across 26 varsity sports (13 men's sports and 13 women's sports) and since 2001, the Irish have won national championships in fencing <ref type="bibr">('05, '11, '17 and '18)</ref>, women's basketball ('01 and '18), women's soccer ('04 and '10) and men's soccer <ref type="bibr">('13)</ref>.</p><p>The Notre Dame student body plays an important role in the success of teams that represent the University. Anyone who has attended a football pep rally or seen a top-ranked basketball team upset in the Purcell Pavilion knows why. The pride and loyalty displayed by the Leprechaun Legion are moving forces that embody the spirit of the Notre Dame community. Athletic contests at Notre Dame are an integral part of the social life as well as an opportunity for the athletically gifted to compete against the nation's best.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FaCIlItIes</head><p>Notre Dame Stadium, with its 77,622 seats, has been the home to Irish football since 1930. In the fall of 2017 the University debuted the Campus Crossroads Project, which enhanced fan experience at games as well as brought academic and student life closer to other campus facilities at the University. The project included the addition of a video board in the south end zone and ribbon boards around the east and west sides. Academic buildings connect to both the south, east and west sides of the stadium with premium seating and media accommodations located on the top floors. Installation of an artificial FieldTurf surface was completed prior to the 2014 football season.</p><p>Built in 1968, Notre Dame's Joyce Center has been called one of the most complete sports complexes in the country. Not only is there a 9,149-seat basketball/volleyball arena <ref type="bibr">(Purcell Pavilion)</ref> but also boxing, weight rooms and multi-use courts in the Fieldhouse. <ref type="bibr">In</ref>  Notre Dame opened Alumni Stadium, home of the Irish men's and women's soccer programs, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">2009</ref>. The approximately 3,000-seat facility, which sits side-by-side with the Irish lacrosse facility, Arlotta Stadium, features a natural grass field, fully equipped locker rooms, restrooms and concession areas, an expanded press box and a state-of-the-art light and sound system.</p><p>Arlotta Stadium is the home for the men's and women's lacrosse programs. Located east of Alumni Stadium, Arlotta features over 2,000 permanent seats with additional seating available on a grass berm opposite of the stands, lights, an artificial turf field, locker rooms, player lounges, press box, restrooms and concession areas. The first event in the new stadium was held October 16, <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">2009</ref>, as the men's lacrosse team played the Iroquois National team in an exhibition contest. Women's lacrosse held its first event in the new stadium on March 7, 2010 in a regular-season matchup with Dartmouth.</p><p>Frank Eck Stadium, with its 2,500 seats, has been home to Irish baseball since 1994 and has undergone a series of improvements in that time. The clubhouse was remodeled in 2011, before an artificial surface was installed on the playing field in 2014. The program opened its addition of a team room and study lounge in 2017.</p><p>Melissa Cook Stadium opened for competition on April 12, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1084">2008</ref>. This venue is named in memory of former Irish softball player Melissa Cook. It features a brick/stucco exterior, bluegrass sod outfield, a Daktronics scoreboard with full-color message center, Musco lighting, heated dugouts, home and visitor locker rooms, training room, press box, six batting cages, chair back and bleacher seating, interior restrooms, and concession stand.</p><p>The Eck Tennis Pavilion, a 35,000-square-foot structure opened in 1987, is the place on campus for indoor tennis and serves as home for both Irish men's and women's tennis teams. Inside are six courts, coaches' offices, showers and lockers, a repair shop and an observation deck. The pavilion stands adjacent to its outdoor counterpart, the Courtney Tennis Center which features 12 courts for use during the warmer months.</p><p>The construction of the new Harris Family Track and Field Stadium was completed in 2018, featuring an existing nine-lane track where the Irish will hold future outdoor meets during the spring competition season. Harris Family Stadium is located southeast of the Joyce Center and features space for throwing and jumping events in two directions and a warm-up area at one end of the track. Among the amenities are men's and women's locker rooms, a training facility and a team room, in addition to press box and concession facilities.</p><p>Located on the St. Joseph River in downtown South Bend, the 15,000-square-foot McConnell Family Boathouse was dedicated on September 8, <ref type="bibr">2016</ref>. The boathouse features a team room, coach's lockers and office, varsity locker room, laundry facilities, training room and spectator gallery on the upper level. The lower level includes three boat storage bays, one boat repair bay, boat trailer access, a 144-oar racking system and equipment storage space. A new dock was also constructed for the women's varsity and the men's club team to utilize.</p></div>

The University publishes an annual report outlining security and fire safety information and crime statistics for campus. This document provides suggestions regarding crime prevention strategies and important policy information about emergency procedures, reporting of crimes, law enforcement services on campus, fire safety, and information about support services for victims of sexual assault. The brochure also contains information about the University's policy on alcohol and other drugs, the SafeBouND safety escort program and campus shuttle service. You may view the document on the web at: https://police.nd.edu/ crime-prevention-and-safety/yearly-security-firesafety-reports/.

We prize the uniqueness of all persons as God's creatures. We welcome all people, regardless of color, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, social or economic class, and nationality, for example, precisely because of Christ's calling to treat others as we desire to be treated. We value gay and lesbian members of this community as we value all members of this community. We condemn harassment of any kind, and University policies proscribe it. We consciously create an environment of mutual respect, hospitality and warmth in which none are strangers and all may flourish.</p><p>One of the essential tests of social justice within any Christian community is its abiding spirit of inclusion. Scriptural accounts of Jesus provide a constant witness of this inclusiveness. Jesus sought out and welcomed all people into the Kingdom of God-the gentile as well as the Jew, women as well as men, the poor as well as the wealthy, the slave as well as</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>To the free, the infirm as well as the healthy. The social teachings of the Catholic Church promote a society founded on justice and love, in which all persons possess inherent dignity as children of God. The individual and collective experiences of Christians have also provided strong warrants for the inclusion of all persons of good will in their communal living. Christians have found their life together enriched by the different qualities of their many members, and they have sought to increase this richness by welcoming others who bring additional gifts, talents and backgrounds to the community.</p><p>The spirit of inclusion at Notre Dame flows from our character as a community of scholarship, teaching, learning and service founded upon Jesus Christ. As the Word through whom all things were made, Christ is the source of the order of all creation and of the moral law which is written in our hearts. As the incarnate Word, Christ taught the law of love of God and sent the Holy Spirit that we might live lives of love and receive the gift of eternal life. For Notre Dame, Christ is the law by which all other laws are to be judged. As a Catholic institution of higher learning, in the governance of our common life we look to the teaching of Christ, which is proclaimed in Sacred Scripture and tradition, authoritatively interpreted by Church teaching, articulated in normative understandings of the human person, and continually deepened by the wisdom born of inquiry and experience. The rich heritage of the Catholic faith informs and transforms our search for truth and our understanding of contemporary challenges in higher education. This statement was adopted by the officers of the University on <ref type="bibr">August 27, 1997,</ref> in conjunction with an Open Letter to the Notre Dame community.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees anD aCaDeMIC PrograMs</head><p>The University is organized into four undergraduate colleges, an architecture school, a graduate school of four divisions, a graduate business school, a law school, and several graduate research study centers.</p><p>In the   The two-semester moreau first Year experience * One of these requirements must be designated as a University Seminar course typically numbered as 13180-13189.</p><p>(a) Only courses identified as approved "Ways of Knowing" for the University Core Curriculum can be used to fulfill a University requirement. Approved courses are administratively marked with a "WKxx" identifier in Class Search each semester to denote their approved status as a "Way of Knowing." These courses can be viewed for a particular academic term by selecting the "Class Search" link within insideND or by visiting the home page of the Office of the Registrar website and clicking on the "Class Search" link. (b) In addition to these university requirements, each college has its own requirements that must be completed. Without prior permission from the appropriate college dean, special studies and directed readings do not satisfy college requirements. ( c) First-year students are required to complete a University Seminar; the Writing &amp; Rhetoric course; and two one-semester courses for the Moreau First Year Experience. The University Seminar may simultaneously satisfy another university requirement, e.g., a University Seminar offered by the History Department should also satisfy the History requirement. (d) Satisfactory work in a major or a concentration program of study. (e) A minimum cumulative average of 2.000. (f ) Completion of a minimum of 50% of the degree credit hours at the University (not less than 60 credit hours) and a minimum of 75% of the degree credit hours (not less than 90 credit hours) must be earned after high school graduation through college and university courses. (g) Enrollment in the last semester on the main university campus. Under extraordinary circumstances this requirement can be waived by the dean (or the dean's designee) of the student's college.</p><p>The following principles guide the application of these requirements.</p><p>1. All courses approved for the University Core must be at least 2.5 credit hours. In rare circumstances, a maximum of two so-called "mini-courses" (less than 2.5 credit hours) may be reviewed by a Core subcommittee and approved (as a combined set) but only if they form a coordinated and coherent whole.</p><p>2. Courses counting toward the University Core must be letter-graded and may not be graded as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory or Pass/Fail.</p><p>3. Transfer students (a) are not required to complete the Core's University Seminar requirement and (b) may choose to take another approved Writing Intensive course in lieu of the Writing and Rhetoric requirement. Other University Core requirements are not waived for transfer students.</p><p>4. At the discretion of the student's dean or dean's designee, transfer credits may be accepted for University Core requirements. The student's dean or dean's designee typically seeks an appropriate correspondence between transfer courses and approved courses in Notre Dame's Course Catalog. When no such correspondence exists, transfer courses (and study abroad courses) are vetted by Notre Dame's academic departments and the Core curriculum subcommittees.</p><p>The deans and their designated representatives in each college and school enforce the University Core curriculum standards, and graduation requirement decisions are at their sole discretion.</p><p>Central to undergraduate education at Notre Dame is the core curriculum, a set of University required courses intended to provide every undergraduate with a common foundation in learning. Detailed rationales for each requirement can be found at http://corecurriculum.nd.edu/.</p><p>Writing. Students will take two writing courses, one of which is a University Seminar. With sufficient placement credit, the student may choose to take a second writing-intensive course instead of Writing and Rhetoric. The Writing and Rhetoric course prepares students to write college-level arguments. Students learn to identify an issue amid diverse and conflicting points of view; frame and sustain an ethical argument that not only includes the analysis and exposition of information but also establishes what is at stake in the issue; provide sufficient and relevant evidence to support their claims; identify and evaluate potential counterarguments; respond thoughtfully to the work of their peers; develop skills for writing a research proposal for conducting original research (e.g., through surveys or interviews) and for using the library's print and electronic information resources; and learn to employ conventions of language in writing academic arguments. A second writing-intensive course may be an elective course with a substantial writing component or a course in the student's major field of study that emphasizes writing skills appropriate to the discipline.</p><p>university seminars. The University Seminar is a distinctive opportunity for every first-year student to experience a small, writing-intensive seminar taught by a member of the University's teaching and research faculty. With a class size of no more than 18, students have the opportunity to regularly engage in class discussions around a particular issue, problem, or topic in a given field of study. Students study the paradigms, content, methodology, or problems of a particular discipline while learning the conventions for academic writing within the parameters or discourse of that field. Each seminar also fulfills one of the University requirements in fine arts, literature, history, social science, philosophy, theology, mathematics, or science.</p><p>Quantitative reasoning. Students develop quantitative reasoning skills through the study of various aspects of mathematics, including analysis, logic, probability and statistics, and modeling. From each of these students derive techniques that are applicable to specific classes of problems. Students will use deductive reasoning in problem solving, apply the inductive process to draw conclusions through quantitative analysis, evaluate data and think probabilistically, assess the strength of numerical evidence, and mathematically model processes or systems to be able to predict (or change) their outcomes. By engaging in multiple mathematical ways of thinking, students will enhance their ability to make informed decisions as citizens and as potential leaders and will gain a deeper understanding of the vital role that Quantitative Reasoning plays in modern society.</p><p>science and Technology. Through the study of science and engineering, students learn how knowledge of the natural world is built on observation, experiment, and evidence, and how these principles can be used to advance technology. They develop a basic understanding of the scientific method and the engineering design process, including an appreciation for the interplay between theory and experiment, and how an advance in one drives the other. In addition to acquiring a working knowledge of fundamental concepts and laws in a particular field of scientific study, students learn to analyze and interpret simple sets of quantitative data and to use mathematical structures to solve problems and create models. Finally, students gain an appreciation of the important interdependence among science, technology, and society.</p><p>history. In the study of history, students explore human beings as individuals, groups, nations, or even civilizations in an attempt to comprehend the human experience. Students come to appreciate and understand the processes of continuity and change over time, and they discover how people shaped, altered, or succumbed to their environment or how, in turn, environment channeled historical experience. Thinking critically about the connections between specific events or processes and an array of contingent phenomena, students look for causes and effects, relationships, and relevance. social science. Students discover the diversity of societies and world cultures, the complexity of the choices facing human beings, and the potential social and political consequences of the paths people take. Through lectures, classroom experiences, or local fieldwork, students gain an understanding of the research methods, processes and procedures used to examine human behavior. From the perspective of different social science disciplines, students uncover the competing organizations and institutional opportunities for realizing one's conceptions of justice and the good life.</p><p>Theology. Theology, the "science of God," represents "faith seeking understanding." Through the first required course, students arrive at an understanding of the distinctive nature of the discipline of theology; encounter the authoritative texts that serve to constitute the self-understanding of Christian tradition as a response to God's self-revelation; become aware of the constitution, transmission, and interpretation of these texts within the tradition; and, develop their own skills of textual interpretation in conversation with the tradition. Through the second required course, students are introduced to the riches of the Christian theological tradition; develop their theological skills, facilitating the critical retrieval of the Christian heritage; and, come to appreciate better their rootedness in the ongoing tradition of the believing community.</p><p>philosophy. Students engage in logical reflection on the fundamental problems of human existence and prepare to take their place as citizens capable of critically evaluating arguments which bear on public affairs. In the first course in philosophy, students read philosophical texts and identify the main lines of argument and counter-argument, reason about philosophical questions, and defend their own philosophical positions. In the second course in philosophy, students explore a subset of philosophical questions or authors of special interest to them. By studying seminal philosophical texts like those that have contributed to the Catholic tradition and those that have presented challenges to it, students learn to think in depth about the problems posed by a life of faith.</p><p>fine arts and literature. Students approach works of art and literature from critical perspectives-as viewers, readers, or listeners-and they apply the analytical tools needed to realize the insights and pleasures that artistic texts and works offer. Students may engage in the creative process, and in so doing gain insights as to how artists interact with their media and how creativity meshes with understanding. The critical analysis of others' creative practice will enable students to develop the analytical tools to recognize a work's formal dimensions and its ideas as well as the often-complex interaction between the two. Engagement with artworks will also lead students to reflect on how aesthetic forms of expression help us define ourselves and our world. Analysis of a work of art, be it through its production, through careful interpretation of the work, or through its reception, will lead students to a deeper reflection on how art and society interact, and how artistic expression reflects the position of the artist and the individual with respect to society at large.</p><p>advanced language and culture. Exposure to literature, culture, thought, and political discourse in the original language of expression lends both an invaluable insight into the belief patterns of different cultures and a deepening understanding of those beliefs and traditions. Extensive reading, writing, and speaking in a different language requires students to place themselves into the idiom of the underlying culture and its way of thought. Through this intensive engagement with words and ideas, students gain a new perspective on differences of culture and thought, and, ultimately, on their place in a diverse world.</p><p>integration. Integration courses are team-taught by faculty from two departments or academic units and have as a primary goal the pursuit of knowledge that integrates and synthesizes the perspective of two or more disciplines to address an issue of global importance or great existential depth that is too complex to be adequately addressed by a single field of study. In integration courses, students will learn to identify commonalities and differences, as well as strengths and weaknesses, among the various disciplinary perspectives and to devise a more complex approach to the question, problem, or issue that provides the theme for the course. By undertaking an active investigation of a complex topic, students will employ critical thinking and intellectual synthesis, as well as develop habits of inquiry and independent learning.</p><p>catholicism and the disciplines. Catholicism and the Disciplines (CAD) courses provide a forum where the various lines of Catholic thought intersect with all forms of knowledge and creativity</p></div>

Students will become adept at examining faith questions or normative questions critically as they explore Catholic content from the perspective of one or more disciplines, and as they explore topics from the disciplines from a distinctively Catholic perspective. Students will be challenged to defend a position on selected issues of faith or normative questions raised by disciplinary considerations in light of competing alternatives, helping them develop their capacities to think critically and to speak and write effectively about matters of faith in a pluralistic world.</p></div>

In evaluating a student's academic achievement, the Committee on Admissions considers a student's curriculum, class rank, concentration of talent in the high school, test scores, teacher evaluation, and essays. Most students admitted to Notre Dame have taken the most demanding courses available, rank among the top students in their schools, and have done quite well on standardized tests. We could cite the average rank and median test results of our admitted students, but a listing of such numbers is often misinterpreted.

The lifeblood of Notre Dame resides in its people: faculty, staff, and students. Each potential student's application is studied to determine what talents, skills, and interests that person might offer Notre Dame's community. We have a strong interest in people who can make unique contributions and will share their talents with us-talents as musicians, writers, technicians, tutors, athletes, artists, volunteer workers, actors, organizers, thinkers, conversationalists, poets, or dancers. There is need in each freshman class for a variety of talents and personalities. The listing of activities, written statements, and evaluations gives us a view of the person represented by the application.

It utilizes an integrative paradigm for student engagement. Discernment, exploration, and academic planning are the essential touchstones for its work. Student-centered advising is one of the hallmarks of a Notre Dame education. Students are encouraged to think of their intellectual growth along a four-year arc, with required and elective courses providing an educational experience with substantial breadth and depth.</p><p>First Year Advisors challenge students to: think carefully about how to make the most of their learning opportunities; hone existing talents; acquire new competencies; and cultivate areas of specialization that reflect both their interests and passions. They also assist students in working toward realization of nine learning outcomes. Collectively, these objectives aim to help students communicate effectively; formulate appropriate learning goals and strategies; become good decision makers; gain proficiency in academic planning; engage in learning self-assessment; become integrative thinkers; develop resilience; prepare to become life-long learners; and cultivate those capacities requisite for discernment.</p><p>Starting in their first-year, students select courses that reflect their college or school intent, likely major (if already determined), emerging interests, and the University's Core Curriculum. The goal of the Core Curriculum is to expose students to various intellectual modalities for comprehending and interacting with the larger world. These eleven "ways of knowing" are intellectual pathways reflective of several of the University's "Learning Outcomes for Undergraduates." The process of building such a schedule is undertaken with the assistance of members of our first-year advising teams. Specific information on course options for first-year students is found on the First Year Advising website at https:// firstyear.nd.edu/academics/.</p><p>The Office of First Year Advising provides complementary academic support and other programming for intellectual enrichment and to foster connections between faculty members, staff, and students. In the United States, most registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure.

Instruction teaches the skills, cultivates the talents, and imparts the knowledge necessary to produce buildings that represent innovation within long-standing traditions, use nature's materials responsibly, and contribute to building livable communities. The school believes this is best done by learning how recurring problems in designing and constructing buildings and fitting them into existing urban and rural settings have been addressed in the past and adapting those lessons to the ever-changing circumstances of the modern world.</p><p>The goals of the curriculum include developing competence in the design of individual buildings, understanding the relationship between individual buildings and their physical and cultural contexts, and recognizing the ethical dimensions of the professional practice of architecture. Architects play a primary role in shaping the built environment and have a professional responsibility to do so in a manner that contributes to the civil life of society. Their work must also help to renew and sustain the integrity of the natural world and promote social welfare.</p><p>In addition to the five-year undergraduate professional degree of Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.), the School of Architecture offers multiple paths of study leading to one of three masters degrees.</p><p>The two-year post-professional graduate course of study leads to the Master of Architectural Design and Urbanism (MADU) degree, and is for those who already hold a professional degree in architecture (B.Arch. or M.Arch.).</p><p>The two-year professional graduate course of study leads to the Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degree, and is for those who hold a four-year preprofessional degree (B.S. or B.A. in Architecture).</p><p>The three-year professional graduate course of study leads to the Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degree, and is for those who hold an accredited undergraduate degree in a field other than architecture.</p><p>All of these graduate courses of study entail one or three foundational studio courses, a one-year advanced study of architecture and urban design including one semester in Rome, and conclude with a one-semester thesis project.</p><p>Concentrations in furniture design, in historic preservation and restoration, and in architectural practice and enterprise, are options within the undergraduate degree program. Concentrations are declared at the end of the third year. The National Architectural Accrediting Board requires B. Arch students to take at least 45 credit hours outside of architecture. Students taking electives in architecture, either within a concentration or as random electives, may need additional credits outside of architecture to meet the minimum of 45.</p></div>

This beginning study is reinforced in the third year, spent in Rome, where 2,500 years of building tradition provide the context for contemporary design problems. Fourth-year students return to Notre Dame, where they are reintroduced to the American context. At this stage, students are encouraged to synthesize their interpretations of the historical legacy in the context of American urban centers and small cities. They are also challenged by projects that require them to engage architectural problems outside their Western focus. The undergraduate program culminates with a thesis design project completed in the fifth year.</p><p>In addition to studio instruction, students complete course work in structural, mechanical, and environmental systems and architectural history. History and theory courses in the School of Architecture include a two-semester survey of the history of architecture from the earliest times to the present and specialized upper-level course work in selected topics involving the history and theory of architecture.</p><p>Students are in contact with practicing professionals through collaboration between the School of Architecture and the Northern Indiana Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

NOMAS-ND provides mentorship as well as interaction with NOMAS clubs at other schools across the country. The goal of the club is to give minority students a sense of community and provide role models to encourage, inspire, and provide them with a sense of belonging in the field of architecture. Students for Classical Architecture -Notre Dame (SCA-ND). Students for Classical Architecture's Notre Dame Chapter is a student group focusing on classical architecture in the architectural practice and education of the 21st century. The club's mission statement is as follows: Architecture has its roots in hundreds of years of tradition. Yet, it is common in today's architectural academies that the teaching of this tradition be willfully neglected. As students, we want to learn the fundamentals that have arisen from this tradition so that we might incorporate those principles into our own, contemporary, architecture. SCA will promote discussion regarding how best to incorporate architectural fundamentals into a contemporary curriculum. The Students for Classical Architecture will also support local chapters of this organization at all institutions of higher learning. It is our hope that collaboration between these chapters will encourage dialogue between their respective academic programs, fostering a gradual rebirth of tradition in education. A prerequisite for admission of sophomores into the College of Arts and Letters is good standing at the end of the student's first year.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>degree requirements for the college of arts and letters</head><p>Students in the College of Arts and Letters are required to complete 122 degree-countable credits. They must also complete all University and College requirements as well as the requirements for one major program of study. multi counting: College and University requirements are intended to expose students to a broad range of fundamental courses in multiple disciplines or "ways of knowing" deemed essential for a liberal arts education within the context of a Catholic university. Exposure to these disciplines is normally defined as taking a limited number of courses (typically one or two) within that field or way of knowing. Hence, the College offers a generous multi-counting policy between a student's major(s) or minor(s) and college and/or university general requirements. That is, The College of Arts and Letters is the oldest, and traditionally the largest, of the four undergraduate colleges of the University of Notre Dame. It houses 21 departments and several programs through which students at both undergraduate and graduate levels pursue the study of the fine arts, the humanities and the social sciences. liberal education. The College of Arts and Letters provides a contemporary version of a traditional liberal arts educational program. In the college, students have the opportunity to understand themselves as heirs of a rich intellectual and spiritual tradition and as members of a complex national and international society. The faculty of the college are committed to the life of the mind, to the critical and constructive engagement with the whole of human experience. On the basis of a firm yet broad foundation, graduates of the college are equipped for a lifetime of learning in an ever-changing world. The overall curriculum and the specific major programs encourage students to approach issues reflectively, to analyze them carefully and to express their reasoned conclusions with clarity.</p><p>The intellectual quest conducted in the College of Arts and Letters takes place in an explicitly Catholic environment. Here ultimate questions of the meaning and value of human life before God are welcome, and efforts to deal with such questions utilize the immense resources of the Catholic tradition. Inquiry and faith are seen not as opposing forces but as complementary elements of the fully human pursuit of truth.</p><p>Organization. The college's administrative center is the Office for Undergraduate Studies, located in 104 O'Shaughnessy Hall. All undergraduates in arts and letters are invited to consult with the assistant deans regarding questions about their academic progress, educational and career goals, and any other concerns of an academic or administrative nature. Pre-med and pre-graduate school advising are available in this office. In particular, sophomores in the college who have not yet declared a major should begin their pursuit for academic advising in this office.</p><p>Because education is not limited to the classroom, the college also sponsors or helps to subsidize events which are intended to enrich the undergraduate experience and facilitate faculty-student interaction both on and off campus.  Student Organizations 44 students will be able to multi-count a course taken to satisfy a college requirement to fulfill a University core requirement; moreover, students will be able to multi-count University or college requirements towards their major and minor requirements. It is further understood that University Seminars and writing-intensive courses are designed to satisfy a Collegiate or University requirement or to be part of a major program of study and thus would be expected to count both towards the University writing requirement and another general requirement and are not discrete required courses. cross counting: A major within the college is intended to provide the student with an in-depth knowledge of a given field. Departments are free to determine the design of the required curriculum for the majors they offer. The College requires only that each major consist of a minimum of 10 courses (30 credit hours) though these courses may multi-count for any University or College requirement, as described above.</p><p>Furthermore, if a student chooses to pursue an additional program of study leading towards a second major or a minor within the College, individual courses may cross-count among these programs provided that each major consists of a minimum of 10 discrete courses (or 30 discrete credit hours) and each minor of a minimum of 5 discrete courses (or 15 discrete credit hours). That is to say, with departmental approval(s), students may cross-count courses between a major and a minor, two majors, or two minors in order to satisfy area/field requirements within a major. A single course can therefore form part of multiple majors or minors if it is deemed to provide some skill or knowledge that is essential for each program. For example, a student majoring in two disciplines that require statistics would need (with departmental approval) to take only one such course for the two majors. However, it is required that students substitute another course within one of the majors for the cross-counted course, such that each major will always comprise at least 10 unique courses (or 30 credit hours) in accordance with major requirements. The same obtains for minors: if a course is cross-counted between majors and/or minors, it is expected that each minor will nevertheless consist of a minimum of 5 unique courses (15 credit hours), with another appropriate course replacing the cross-counted course. In each case, however, courses may still multi-count between University or College requirements and major/minor requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing requirement. Students in Arts and</head><p>Letters are required to complete one course in their major at the 30xxx or 40xxx level designated as a writing-intensive course. This course may satisfy other distributional requirements within the major. Writing intensive courses require the student to work closely with a professor throughout the semester on a significant written project. activity and experiential learning courses. Three elective credits of the required 122 hours can be derived/obtained from the following activity courses: Exceptions will be made for music majors for music lessons and ensembles. If students complete more than three of these courses, these will appear on a student's transcript, but the extra credits will be subtracted from the student's total number of hours at the time the graduation check is made; hence, these will not count toward the 122 hours needed to graduate.</p></div>

No Mendoza College of Business (MCOB) course may be taken pass-fail. arts and letters degree credit. Students may not count both examination and degree credit for the same course toward graduation hours. For example, a student who has advanced placement credit for ROSP 20201 may not take ROSP 20201 and count both toward the 122 hours required in arts and letters. Students also may not count for degree credit both of two equivalent courses taught at Notre Dame. For example, PHIL 10101 and 20201 are considered to be equivalent courses, as are ECON 10015 and 20015. Students should take only one of each pair but not both. In cases where a student has double credit for the same course, the credits for only one course will be counted toward the student's degree credit, despite the fact that credits for both will appear on the student's transcript. A list of equivalent math and science courses can be found at the end of the College of Science section of the Bulletin. The same rules about double credit apply to them.</p></div>

Arts and Letters students need to take both art AND literature.</p><p>No courses in logic will satisfy the University philosophy requirement.</p><p>Additionally, students must fulfill the following signature requirements of the College of Arts and Letters:</p><p>College Seminar Foreign Language (1-4 courses) foreign language requirement The College recognizes that students come to Notre Dame with some foreign language competency, as this is usually a requirement for admissions. Accordingly, students who choose to continue the language they have previously studied will be able to place out of lower-level language courses but must take at least one language course at the appropriate level during their undergraduate career at Notre Dame. The foreign language requirement may be satisfied through the study of any modern or classical language offered at the University up to and including four semesters (or similar exposure). This will normally be a minimum of 14 credit hours over four semesters.</p><p>Students cannot be exempted from this requirement by placing at a higher level: all students must take at least one semester of a foreign language at the appropriate level. Such a requirement recognizes the importance of foreign languages and cultures in our increasingly global society.</p><p>Students who enter the University from a high school program where the language of instruction is other than English may be exempted from the foreign language requirement. Such students should petition the dean of the college (or the dean's designate) and may be subject to an oral interview and/ or a written exam in the relevant language before the exemption is granted.</p><p>Students with disabilities that preclude the oral performance component of a modern foreign language will be expected to take a classical language through the fourth semester (or similar exposure).</p></div>

Students without Advanced Placement or SAT II credit, but who come with some background in the language they elect will be placed by examinations given during first-year orientation and prior to spring preregistration. Departmental placement exams will not be credit-bearing. Students may receive up to 8 hours of credit based on their scores on the AP and SAT II tests. If, for some reason, more than 8 hours of credit appear on the transcript, the credits beyond 8 will be non-counted and will be manually subtracted from the total number of degree credits counting for graduation. Regardless of the scores on these exams, it is impossible for a student to test out of the language requirement in the College of Arts and Letters. Every student in arts and letters must take at least one course at the appropriate level that deals with texts in the original language. For the specific details of a given language offering or program, check with the relevant department. college seminar. The College Seminar is a unique one-semester course shared by all students earning a degree in the College of Arts and Letters. Typically taken in the sophomore year, the course offers students an introduction to the diversity and distinctive focus of arts and letters at the University of Notre Dame. Specific sections of the College Seminars vary in their topics and texts, but all feature an interdisciplinary approach, commitment to engaging important questions, employment of major works, and emphasis on the development of oral skills. Every College Seminar syllabus will include works that approach the topic from the perspective of each of the three divisions of the college: the arts, humanities, and social sciences.</p><p>College Seminar fulfills the CSEM requirement and cannot fulfill any other requirement.</p></div>

The opportunity to write a Senior Thesis in American Studies is open to any major with a GPA of 3.5 or higher within the major as of January of their junior year. In exceptional circumstances students with a GPA below 3.5 may apply. Writing a thesis is a chance to do original research and explore a topic of your choice, to develop a deeper relationship with a faculty member, and to put what you've learned as an American Studies major into practice. It is also a significant commitment. Students need one if they want to earn departmental honors in American Studies, but they do not need one to satisfy the requirements for the major.

The undergraduate program in anthropology is designed to provide each student with a broad, holistic, integrated and species-wide perspective on contemporary human behavior. Anthropology may be the only major that provides significant intellectual and professional links with the humanities and other social science fields, while also providing separate bridges into both the natural sciences and the field of business. In so doing the anthropology major prepares students for successful entry into any number of fields and disciplines and their appropriate professional graduate schools, including medical schools, public health, and law. Human evolutionary models, critical comparative analyses, ethnographic methods, and a variety of developmental approaches are taught and applied in our classes to such diverse topics and research areas as: health; illness; addiction; human communication (verbal and non-verbal); human origins; the nature of social groups; the family; worldwide political and socio-economic systems; religion; warfare; infancy and childhood; non-human primate ecology and behavior; archaeology, prehistory, and ethnology; sexuality; museum studies; evolutionary medicine; transnationalism; sex and gender; food; and medical anthropology. Geographic specialities of the faculty include China, Southeast Asia, North America, Latin America, Russia, Italy, Ireland, Egypt, Central and Southern Africa, and the Middle East.</p><p>In moving toward our goal to achieve national prominence as one of the top undergraduate research and teaching departments in the nation, our faculty stress the importance of innovative and significant undergraduate research. We aim to provide as many majors as is possible with hands-on research experiences in both the field and laboratory. Smithsonian and Chicago Field Museum summer research internships created by the department are available to majors. The department also administers a paid summer internship with J.F. New Environmental Consultants. It is common throughout the school year and summer that the faculty pair up with students to conceptualize and work together on research projects both here and abroad. Often this collaborative research leads to joint publications. Our undergraduate students receive many undergraduate research awards from the University and regularly attend national professional meetings to stand alongside graduate students and professors from around the nation to present the results of their research. Our anthropology minors also participate to a high degree.</p><p>Aside from its applicability and relevance across different disciplines, professions, and careers, one of the truly unique aspects of anthropology is that it changes in a most profound and insightful way the manner in which our students experience and come to interpret their own lives. The subject of anthropology is humankind as viewed not through a local lens limited by the biases or world view of one's own culture, but by a view that attempts to reconcile and understand the intersecting and sometimes conflicting, yet, often logical alternative ways by which our fellow human beings live and think.</p><p>Perhaps it is the result of this very personal encounter, experienced alongside exposure to the very best scholarship, that permits our anthropology students to connect so easily and successfully with diverse professional communities. This relative fluidity by which our graduates make the transition into so many varied fields, the knowledge and skills gained by studying anthropology, in addition to providing keen insights into others, enriches one's understanding of one's self. In this way anthropology maximizes the chances of personal achievement and self-fulfillment, and offers a powerful holistic core of experience for excellent cutting-edge jobs in any career path.</p></div>

The Department of Art, Art History, and Design at the University of Notre Dame, is a multidisciplinary department offering programs of study in studio art, art history, and design. The mission of the department is to provide students with intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in creative studies within the context of a liberal arts university. An active lecture and visiting artist series and the extensive collections of the Snite Museum of Art strengthen and broaden the work in the classroom and studio. The South Bend and Chicago areas provide additional cultural activities and experiences.</p><p>The department has fifteen studio art and design faculty, and eight art history faculty. Undergraduate students may pursue coursework leading to one of two degrees: the bachelor of arts (BA) in studio art, art history or design; or the bachelor of fine arts (BFA) in studio art or design. A minor in studio art is also offered to those students who wish to add experience in visual art to their undergraduate studies.</p><p>The departmental office is located in Riley Hall along with all studio art facilities, classrooms, and studio faculty offices. The art history classrooms are on the first floor of O'Shaughnessy Hall and the art history faculty offices are in Decio Faculty Hall. The design classrooms, studios, and design faculty offices are located in West Lake Hall. Skilled teaching scholars and support facilities are available as appropriate for each medium that is offered. The Center for Creative Computing operates five specialized computing labs for studio and design work including a professional digital printing studio in Riley Hall.</p><p>Students with a degree in creative studies are uniquely competitive among job-seeking graduates today. It is well recognized that creative study fosters methods of scholarship and production that employers and research institutions alike find compelling. A creative person draws on innovative approaches to solve problems; is willing to take initiatives in the face of ambiguity and uncertainty; is able to accept critical feedback to revise or expand an idea; can successfully communicate the value of their approach to others; and has the ability to mobilize resources to realize their ideas in an original form. In short, creative study is essential to the educational preparation needed to compete in the complex world culture we work and live in today. </p></div>

The photography program educates students to be technically skilled, visually literate and creatively prepared for a world where photography, video and streaming media permeate our everyday experiences. Beginning with foundation work through senior thesis, courses are designed to inform students about photographic traditions while engaging them in the critical issues and methodologies of contemporary practice. The photography major prepares students for a career in visual media (including fine art, media communications or advertising), education or institutional professions at galleries, museums or auction houses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>printmaking concentration</head><p>Printmaking is a vital, visual, graphic process by which one may engage in a conversation with the world. In fact, printmakers all over the world are in constant contact, exchanging exciting information and keeping current with the ever-shifting flow of ideas.</p><p>Printmakers' work encompasses a wide range of practice: from stenciled art spray painted on a sidewalk to very fine prints made on paper, from a one-inch square print to wrapping an entire building in a print. Printmakers are involved with a very dynamic form of art.</p><p>At Notre Dame, students learn about current cultural and critical issues and how printmaking addresses them. As students learn about the various matrixes, techniques and technologies of a wide range of printmaking (including relief, photolithography, intaglio, screen-printing, digital processes, papermaking and the making of books), they will develop their aesthetic, critical and technical skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>sculpture concentration</head><p>Sculpture today encompasses diverse materials and contexts for the expression of ideas in space. Within this broad description, students are encouraged to develop the technical skills that will help them expand their ideas into thoughtful individual expression. We embrace a breadth of vision and experience, which will challenge the student to investigate and respond to contemporary issues through problem-solving. A full range of traditional and nontraditional media are available in specific courses and through individual mentoring. By blending required and elective courses and independent study, students can experience a curriculum that responds to their particular needs and direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>design</head><p>Design is the order of form and the control of function; it is what designers do. Humans are conditioned to make decisions on the basis of appearance and contextual input, accepting or rejecting information and material goods in response to a variety of visual cues. Effective, user-centered design can do more than attract interest or manipulate</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>53</head><p>To At Notre Dame, undergraduate design education begins with immersion into the liberal arts curriculum. This social, philosophical, critical, ethical, and historical experience helps build a foundation of cultural understanding that naturally informs the creative and problem-solving methods. Responsible designers, consequently, approach the development process with sensitivity for human need, human aspiration, and the functional requirements for both production and implementation. At its best, design serves the spectrum of needs from individuals to constituencies in industry, society and the global environment.</p><p>Though design has been part of the Notre Dame curriculum since the early 1950s, students enjoy the advantages of a campus that provides access to current technologies. Technically advanced collaborative teaching spaces and digital labs support all student design activities, including an on-site 20-station 2D computer studio, a 16-station 3D computer studio, and a high performance digital imaging studio, all maintained by the services from Notre Dame's Center for Creative Computing. In addition, a model shop provides rapid prototyping capabilities ranging from traditional hand tools to precision computer controlled fabrication and 3D printing. Intermediate and advanced level undergraduate students share an energized design community with defined studio spaces located in close proximity to all design-related resources and facilities in the Design Center at West Lake Hall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>visual communication design concentration</head><p>At its most basic level, visual communication design is a creative process that combines the visual arts and technology to communicate ideas. In the hands of a talented designer, these ideas are transformed into visual communication that transcends mere words and pictures. By controlling color, type, movement, symbols, and images, the designer creates and manages the production of visuals designed to inform and persuade a specific audience. By combining aesthetic judgment with project management skills, designers develop visual solutions and communications strategies. The professional designer works with writers, editors, illustrators, photographers, code writers, and printers to complete compelling designs that effectively communicate a message.</p><p>At Notre Dame, the undergraduate visual communication design curriculum begins with a foundation in the liberal arts. Such a basis is a design student's best path to meet and solve the varied communication challenges inherent in today's complex world. Because a design solution may emerge from the humanities, an algorithm, or a scientific discovery, the curriculum provides a student with the opportunity to be firmly grounded in the fundamentals of design and the visual arts, while also taking courses in science, math, history, philosophy, and theology. As students progress through the tiered design program, they develop as a designer, as an intellectual, and as a moral person, prepared to address the social, ethical, and political circumstances influenced by the design profession.</p><p>At its core, the Notre Dame visual communication design program asserts that the designer can make a difference not only in the strategic plan of a business but also in the world. During their time on campus, students develop projects that aspire to positively influence the lives of culturally diverse people, critique the ethical dimensions of contemporary culture, and give visual form to complex social issues. As design professionals, Notre Dame graduates will be responsible for the future of our visual culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>industrial design concentration</head><p>Industrial designers give form to virtually all mass-manufactured products in our culture. They seek opportunity and advantage through identifying and solving problems. Their creative contributions impact the utility, appearance, and value of our tools and environment. Their most innovative solutions lie at an intersection of what is knowable and what is possible.</p><p>The industrial design profession demands excellent organizational skills, an awareness of visual and tactile aesthetics, human behavior, human proportion, material, process, and the responsible appropriation of resource, during and after use. Designers express conceptual proposals through a combination of well-developed drawing, physical modeling, computer modeling, writing, and verbal skills. Designers best serve the consumer through sensitive and innovative collaboration with art, science, engineering, anthropology, marketing, manufacturing, and ecology. Properly implemented, industrial design affords greater benefit, safety, and economy to all participants and recipients impacted by the product development cycle.</p><p>Notre Dame's Industrial Design Program (NDID) is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and maintains student chapter affiliation with the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA). NDID interacts with regional, national, and international corporate design and consulting offices in the form of annual conferences, sponsored projects, field trips, and internships.</p></div>

Through the major, the collaborating departments seek to blend the programs of study to ensure that students will achieve advanced linguistic and cultural competency in a foreign language as well as excellent preparation in Economics. The balance of economics with languages and culture courses should attract motivated students and inspire them to undertake a challenging course of study that will prepare them for post-graduate studies and/or professional career opportunities in the international arena. International Economics majors will learn how aesthetic and cultural categories and value judgments are shaped by economic trends and political conditions and how political conditions and economic trends are influenced by aesthetic and cultural trends.</p></div>

The Department of Film, Television, and Theatre curriculum includes study of the arts of theatre and performance, film and video, and television. Our goal is to provide students with intellectual and intuitive resources for analysis and production of these performing and media arts. We seek both to encourage and inspire intellectual discipline and curiosity as well as to discover and nurture student creativity. We offer, therefore, both a scholarly and creative context for education of the general liberal arts student at Notre Dame as well as the individual seeking an intensive preparation for advanced study in these fields. In an interdisciplinary spirit of collaboration, students in this department investigate film, television, and theatre (and occasionally other media) as complex cultural phenomena to develop skills in analysis, evaluation, and theory formation as well as to engage in creative production.</p><p>Students graduating from this department have numerous postgraduate choices. Many of our graduates seek careers in law, medicine, business, education, public service, or other professions. Others will pursue careers in theatre, film, or television. However, we are not a professional training program. Rather, we seek to provide the creative and technological tools for student scholar/artists to build a basis for advanced study and professional careers in the arts should they so desire. It is our hope that those whose work and determination lead them to seek careers in these fields will be challenged and assisted by their liberal arts curriculum. Our courses provide tools to understand the analytical, technical and imaginative processes of the field, whether pursued as future work, study, or as an enhancement of intellectual life.</p><p>For more information and up-to-date listings of courses and FTT events, visit ftt.nd.edu.</p><p>program of studies.

Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary academic program in the College of Arts and Letters at Notre Dame. Gender Studies analyzes the significance of gender-and the cognate subjects of sex, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, religion, and nationality-in all areas of human life, especially in the social formation of human identities, practices, and institutions. Gender Studies gives scholars the methodological and theoretical tools to analyze gender and its cognates in their chosen disciplines in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Gender Studies also provides its students and alumni with an intellectual framework in which the analysis of gender and its cognates can be creatively and critically applied to their personal, familial, professional, and civic roles. In the context of the Catholic identity of Notre Dame, Gender Studies facilitates the study of the intersection of gender and religion in the shaping of ethics, culture, and politics. Alongside our diverse array of courses drawn from across the University, our summer internship and academic-credit internship programs emphasize the holistic and practical life applications of a Gender Studies education at Notre Dame.</p><p>Gender Studies offers students a major, a supplementary major and a minor.

The Department of Music offers students a variety of musical experiences in accordance with its two objectives: (1) to provide all students, regardless of their major, knowledge and training in music through introductory, historical and theoretical courses, through participation in large and small ensembles, and through applied instrumental or vocal study; and (2) to provide intensive curriculum and training for the student who chooses music as a major. Students majoring in music will choose a concentration in Theory and History or in Performance. Each concentration offers an honors option for students intending to pursue professional study in the field after graduation.

Neuroscience is a relatively young, exciting, and fundamentally interdisciplinary field devoted to the scientific study of the nervous system. Neuroscience encompasses the study of problems from multiple disciplinary perspectives at different levels of analysis in human and non-human organisms. It includes, for example, the study of molecular mechanisms in individual neurons and the coordination of millions of neurons into neural systems. Problems range from investigation of the evolution of nervous systems in basal vertebrates to the application of neuroscience to education and law.</p><p>Neuroscientists also seek to develop neurologically plausible models of human thinking, affect and behavior.</p><p>Neuroscience creates a context for scholarly conversation about the nature of mind, brain and behavior. It engages experts in collaboration across diverse fields, including biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, engineering, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, physics and psychology. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the major, the curriculum includes flexibility such that it can be customized to best prepare students for a variety of future careers. Students studying neuroscience will be prepared to pursue professional degree programs (medical, dental, veterinary, clinical psychology, or other health professions) and graduate programs in areas such as neuroscience, biological sciences or psychology. , and a course in formal logic (PHIL 30313; the logic requirement can also be fulfilled by PHIL 43907 or MATH 10130, but the latter does not count toward the classes required for the major: students taking it must take an additional elective); at least two seminars at the 4xxxx-level; and three electives at the 3xxxx-or 4xxxx-level.</p><p>Students pursuing a major in philosophy with a concentration in philosophy, science, and mathematics follow an overlapping, but distinct, course of study. The courses required for a concentration in Philosophy, Science, and Mathematics are distributed as follows: Either the two-course University Requirement or (for students who took course in Catholicism Across the Disciplines in place of the 2nd University Requirement) the first University Requirement and an elective at 2xxxxlevel or higher; the Core Seminar in Philosophy, Science, and Mathematics (an intensive team-taught seminar offered every fall); a course in logic (PHIL 30313 Formal Logic or a more advanced option); a survey of the history of philosophy (either Ancient &amp; Medieval Philosophy, PHIL 30301, or History of Modern Philosophy, PHIL 30302); two other upper-level philosophy courses, taught at the 3xxxxor 4xxxx-level, at least one of which will be in the philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, or logic; and three majors-level electives in science or mathematics.</p><p>Students who are pursuing either a regular philosophy major, or the major with concentration in philosophy, science, and mathematics, may also elect to pursue the honors Track. Honors philosophy majors complete all the requirements for the regular major and in addition write a senior thesis. Students writing the senior thesis enroll in PHIL 48499 Senior Thesis in both semesters of the senior year (the equivalent of two regular 3-hour seminars). To be eligible for the honors major, and thus for the senior thesis, a student must ordinarily maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above in courses in the major. Students considering the senior thesis are encouraged to have completed at least two of the three core courses (the two history surveys and formal logic) AND three 4xxxx-level seminars by the end of the junior year.</p><p>Students majoring in other departments may take a minor in philosophy by completing the following course of study: the two University Required Philosophy courses or (for students who took course in Catholicism Across the Disciplines in place of the 2nd University Requirement) the first University Requirement and an elective at 2xxxx-level or higher; the two-course sequence in the history of philosophy (Ancient and Medieval Philosophy, PHIL 30301, and History of Modern Philosophy, PHIL 30302); one elective at the 3xxxx-or the 4xxxx-level; and one elective at the 4xxxx-level.</p><p>All 4xxxx-level philosophy courses are writingintensive, requiring at least 20 pages of written work that may take various forms: reflections on readings, class presentations, or shorter or longer research papers. Students planning to go on to graduate studies in philosophy or related disciplines typically write a senior thesis as well.</p></div>

The joint major is intended for undergraduates who are intrigued by philosophical and theological ideas and who have an equal commitment to both disciplines. It seeks to equip such students to handle theology and philosophy adeptly. The major is structured, providing undergraduates with a suitable introduction to the study of both disciplines, but also flexible, granting students considerable scope for the pursuit of their own interests.</p><p>The joint major offers the opportunity for an informed investigation of religious and philosophical ideas and should appeal especially to those who intend to pursue graduate work in philosophy or theology.</p><p>The joint major incorporates the University requirements in the two departments and most of the formal requirements of the first majors in theology and philosophy. Students in the joint major will take the two-semester sequence in Christian Traditions and an upper-level course in Scripture. The joint major, however, does not require the one-credit proseminar in theology.</p><p>Other formal requirements are peculiar to the joint major. Students will study a classical language for two semesters. (For practical as well as pedagogical reasons, this will normally be Greek.) Majors will also be expected to take one joint seminar. Led by a theologian and a philosopher, the joint seminars are offered every spring and will examine an issue in which the differing approaches of philosophy and theology may prove fruitful. The topic and instructors will change from year to year. Finally, each major will submit a senior thesis prepared under the direction of two advisors, drawn from each department. At the option of the directors, this thesis may be presented and discussed in an informal colloquium consisting of the other students in the joint major.</p><p>The remaining courses in the joint major will be at the discretion of the student. Normally taken at the 40xxx level, there should be an equal distribution in the electives between theology and philosophy. However, students who wish may devote up to six hours within the joint major to additional language work. These hours may add to the classical language previously studied, or used to begin another language of significance for philosophical and theological work.</p><p>The joint major differs from a first major in one discipline and a supplementary major in the other in that the latter requires 55 credit hours, whereas the joint major requires 60. Furthermore, the joint major calls for language instruction beyond what the University requires for all undergraduates. Finally, the joint seminars should prove especially challenging, inviting students to explore important topics in an interdisciplinary way. These features should make the joint major particularly attractive to students preparing for advanced study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program of Liberal Studies</head><p>Chair: Fundamental to the Program is a conception of a liberal arts education that aims to avoid the separation of the humanities into isolated disciplines. The Program seeks to provide a unified undergraduate education in all of the liberal arts, including music and the natural sciences. For this reason, the Program is not to be equated with a "general humanities" educational Program. The study of literature, philosophy, natural and social science, theology, history, and the fine arts will take place within a larger unifying conception of the liberal arts that cuts across many of the disciplinary boundaries suggested by these terms. Because the goal of the Program is to provide more than an introduction to various subject matters, none of the tutorials or seminars stands alone in the Program. The curriculum grows organically over the three years, with each course presuming all of its predecessors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Tom Stapleford Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C.,</formula><p>Although the Program provides education in the liberal arts, it also considers the liberal arts in themselves as insufficient for a complete education. The liberal arts are the critical tools of learning, but they are also to be related to the larger search for genuine understanding and philosophic wisdom. Philosophy, which explores the basic questions of epistemology, ethics, and politics, is also related to the claims of the Christian tradition. The Program maintains specific tutorials in the various disciplines to enable the relationships among them to develop systematically and also to foster a concern with what unifies or transcends them.</p><p>The normal method of instruction in the Program is through the reading and discussion of primary texts. The student is asked to take an active role in the learning process. Particularly in the seminar, the authors of the great books are considered to be the primary teachers.</p><p>The Program requires writing throughout the curriculum, especially in the tutorial classes. In the final year, all students are required to write a senior thesis, usually involving extensive research, under the direction of a faculty advisor. The senior thesis offers students a particularly intensive writing experience and an opportunity to investigate in depth a specialized topic of interest. </p></div>

Psychology is the scientific study of the behavior of organisms with a primary focus on human behavior. It is concerned with the biological and environmental determinants of behavior as reflected in the study of physiological, sensory, perceptual, cognitive, motivational, learning, developmental, aging, and social processes. The undergraduate program seeks a balance between exposure to basic psychological principles and theories and their extension to the applied areas such as child education, counseling, mental retardation, and behavioral deviancy.</p><p>The undergraduate courses are intended to meet the needs of students who plan to (1) major in psychology and later attend graduate school in psychology or affiliated fields, (2) major in psychology as part of a general cultural program, (3) obtain training in psychology as a special supplement to their major interest or (4) use psychology to satisfy social science requirements or electives.</p><p>One of the department's main features is an emphasis on opportunities for close faculty-student involvement in research projects at the undergraduate level. The research specialties in which majors may become involved range from basic research in such areas as psychophysics, human and animal learning, child development, aging, and psycholinguistics, to applied research in a community setting. Students planning to do graduate work in psychology will plan their program in close coordination with their faculty advisors. ‚Ä¢ PSY 27800 Research Lab credits are strongly recommended for any students' intent on pursuing a graduate career in psychology.</p><p>‚Ä¢ In some cases students for whom psychology is their second major may complete another statistics course <ref type="bibr">(BAMG 20150;</ref><ref type="bibr">ECON 30330, ACMS 20340 or BIOS 40411)</ref> in place of the PSY 30100 course.

The College of Arts and Letters is proud of the level of writing its undergraduates achieve. One way in which the college supports students' writing development is by requiring each department to offer at least one writing-intensive course. SOC 30900, Foundations of Sociological Theory, is the Sociology Department's writing-intensive course. There, students reflect on the quality of their own and others' writing and learn to articulate a sociological perspective in writing. Instructors in this course may spend more time doing textual analyses, going over students' writing, holding in-class writing workshops, and giving opportunities to do re-writes than in other courses. The department's 43xxx-level courses also demand high-level writing within a sociological perspective. In addition, students may opt to develop their research and writing skills by undertaking a senior thesis. If students are using the same statistics course to fulfill both the MDSC requirement and a college, university, major or other minor requirement, they must contact their dean or major advisor to see if an additional course (not another statistics course) is required or if the course can be double counted.</p></div>

The Theology Department dedicates itself to critical reflection on the historic faith of Catholic Christianity in service to our students, to the larger church, to the world of the academy, and to the general public.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why major in theology?</head><p>When the former British prime minister Tony Blair was asked what effect his embrace of Christian faith at the University of Oxford had on him, he commented simply, "I began to make sense of the world." A major in Theology at Notre Dame will challenge you to do just that.</p><p>Our majors encounter head-on the great questions of life: Where is the God of justice? What is truth? Who do you say I am? Why did God become a human? What must I do to inherit eternal life?</p><p>Yet majors in theology are challenged to do still more. They are challenged to think of their life journey not only in terms of how they might best be served by careers, but also how they might best serve others. Whether they go on to careers in law, medicine, business, journalism, education, ministry, government, or any other field, theology majors do so with an experience of intellectual and spiritual illumination that is absolutely unique.</p><p>Our majors also benefit from working closely with faculty in one of the premiere Catholic Departments of Theology in the world. Theology majors at Notre Dame have majored in a field for which Notre Dame is renowned and will study with the best of the best. In addition, our majors may have the opportunity to visit the Holy Land at the Tantur Ecumenical Institute of Theology in Jerusalem, where the department regularly hosts courses and pilgrimages during fall and spring break.</p><p>When Father Edward Sorin, C.S.C., envisioned the school that would be built next to two remote lakes in Indiana, he commented, "This college will be one of the most powerful means of doing good in the country." This faith in the great potential of the school that would be called Notre Dame emerged from his belief in a Catholic education. Theology majors at Notre Dame, having experienced the fullness of a Catholic education, are indeed powerful forces for good in this country, and in the world.</p><p>What are the requirements for the theology major?</p><p>Beyond the six theology credits required of every Notre Dame student, primary majors take 28 hours; supplementary majors take 19 hours. Each of these majors combines formally required courses and electives. The two University requirements (6 credits) are prerequisites for upper-level courses. All courses in the theology major, primary or supplementary, must be 3-credit courses and graded (with the exception of the proseminar).</p></div>

Each spring semester, the junior class of theology majors will be invited to apply; those selected will be assigned a thesis director from among the faculty of the department. A minimum grade point average of 3.66 within the major is normally expected. Seniors in the Honors Program will enroll in a one-credit Honors Colloquium as well as a two-credit directed reading course in the fall semester, and a three-credit Honors Thesis Writing course in the spring semester, culminating in the submission of a 40-55-page thesis. The Honors Program will normally consist of 37 hours, as compared to 34 hours in the regular primary major. To receive the honors designation on their transcript, students must earn an A-or higher grade on their thesis.

It seeks to equip such students to handle theology and philosophy adeptly. The major is structured, providing undergraduates with a suitable introduction to the study of both disciplines, but also flexible, granting students considerable scope for the pursuit of their own interests.</p><p>The joint major offers the opportunity for an informed investigation of religious and philosophical ideas and should appeal especially to those who intend to pursue graduate work in philosophy or theology.</p><p>The joint major incorporates the University requirements in the two departments and most of the formal requirements of the first majors in theology and philosophy. Students in the joint major will take the two-semester sequence in Christian Traditions and an upper-level course in Scripture. The joint major, however, does not require the one-credit proseminar in theology.</p><p>Other formal requirements are peculiar to the joint major. Students will study a classical language for two semesters. (For practical as well as pedagogical reasons, this will normally be Greek or Latin.) Majors will also be expected to take on one occasion the joint seminar (offered each spring). Each seminar, led by a theologian and a philosopher, will examine an issue in which the differing approaches of philosophy and theology may prove fruitful. The topic and instructors will change from year to year. Finally, each major will submit a senior thesis prepared under the direction of two advisors, drawn from each department. At the option of the directors, this thesis may be presented and discussed in an informal colloquium consisting of the other students in the joint major.</p><p>The remaining courses in the joint major will be at the discretion of the student. Normally taken at the 40xxx level, there should be an equal distribution in the electives between theology and philosophy. However, students may devote up to six hours within the joint major to additional language work. These hours may add to the classical language previously studied, or used to begin another language of significance for philosophical and theological work.</p><p>The distinctive features of the joint major should make the program particularly attractive to students preparing for advanced study.</p></div>

Students are accepted into the Program at the time of admission to Notre Dame. Although selection criteria include the promise of outstanding academic performance as demonstrated by standardized test scores and high school performance, the program is looking for more than mere academic ability. It hopes to identify students with deep intellectual curiosity and interdisciplinary interests.</p><p>The Glynn Family Honors Program offers honors sections to fulfill most of the University and college requirements in the students' first and sophomore years. Courses include the yearlong Honors Seminar (satisfying the writing and literature requirements), Honors Math, Honors Philosophy, Honors Theology, Honors Biology, and Honors Physics. Since these courses are restricted to honors students, they are smaller than non-honors sections and are usually taught in a seminar format. The instructors for honors sections are chosen from the most outstanding faculty in each college. After the first year, students' academic work will be centered in their major field of study, but each semester the program offers the opportunity to take elective courses in a variety of subjects. Additionally, honors students take two colloquia focused on senior thesis research during senior year. During the spring of senior year, all students in the Glynn program are required to submit a senior research thesis that reflects at least two semesters' work under the guidance of a faculty advisor. In Science, the research for this project usually begins sophomore year, and in Arts and Letters during the spring of junior year.

Most students elect the APH2 program because they wish to go on to medical or dental school; there are, however, students who intend to pursue other health-related careers or simply prefer the integration of science classes into the arts and letters curriculum. Medical schools encourage prospective applicants to seek a broad, liberal arts education, which enables them to develop skills that will be useful in their career and throughout life. The APH2 program provides students with all of the necessary prerequisites to prepare for the Medical or Dental College Admissions Test and can accommodate the completion of prerequisite courses for other health professions such as physical therapy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, occupational therapy, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, optometry, osteopathy, and podiatry. Students who wish to go to medical/dental school directly after graduation should aim to take the Medical/Dental College Admissions Tests in the spring of the junior year All curricular advising in reference to the APH2 major is conducted by the APH2 advisor in 104 O'Shaughnessy.

Pope John Paul II writes, "It must be asked how many Christians really know and put into practice the principles of the church's social doctrine." The U.S. bishops concur. While "Catholic social teaching is a central and essential element of our faith," it is still the case that "our social heritage is unknown by many Catholics." At the same time, graduates of Notre Dame move on to assume leadership positions, often quite advanced ones, in a broad spectrum of social spheres, including in politics, law, business, education, the media, and the military. The Catholic Social Tradition minor serves as a resource for Notre Dame undergraduates to learn the tradition so that it can inform life both before and after graduation.</p><p>The Minor in Catholic Social Tradition involves 15 credit hours of course work, including a core course (3 credits), two electives (each three credits), three one-credit colloquia/social concerns seminars, and a senior capstone course.</p><p>contact: Bill Purcell at wpurcell@nd.edu, or Todd David Whitmore at twhitmor@nd.edu.</p></div>

Nothing has done more for justice in the modern world than the development of the rule of law under constitutional principles. But for constitutional governments to secure the common good, thoughtful and educated citizens must possess certain virtues: they must understand and be able to implement, defend, and, if need be, reform constitutional institutions. The Constitutional Studies minor seeks to nurture such citizens, thereby contributing to the University's mission to pursue truth and to nurture a concern for the common good, that will bear fruit as learning becomes service to justice. The primary goal of this interdisciplinary minor is to help students acquire diverse perspectives on important questions in education. Education is a complex and challenging aspect of the human experience. It is both an end in itself and a means to many personal, professional, and spiritual goals. Thus, understanding its history and traditions, analyzing its processes, critiquing its goals, and studying its outcomes are of great importance to all of us.</p></div>

Students may undertake this in one of three ways: (1) Senior Research Seminar (ESS 43640) in fall semester of senior year; (2) Thesis in ESS (ESS 48100), an independent study completed over the course of senior year (requires approval and 2 credits of research lab); or (3) thesis in the student's major department that incorporates the study of an educational issue into the research question (requires approval and a second reader from the IEI). Students who choose the third option must take a fourth ESS elective to complete the minor.</p><p>The ESS program will accept courses marked as "Univ. Req." via the online Class Search if they are listed/cross-listed with ESS. The program will not accept CSEM courses for credit but will consider education-related USEM courses on a case-by-case basis.

The new minor is designed for students who want to pursue an interdisciplinary course of studies that focuses on the many intersections among philosophy, religion, and literature. The minor seeks to build bridges between disciplines and modes of thought which have traditionally been in dialogue with one another and which historically have been at the heart of teaching at Notre Dame.

If students choose to fulfill this requirement by taking Gateway seminars in both tracks, both seminars will count toward the 15 credit hours needed for the minor.</p><p>The capstone project. For the capstone project, each student, working directly with a professor associated with the minor, will write a research essay of approximately 20 pages on a topic that embraces philosophy and literature or religion and literature, or both. Students are encouraged to consult with a professor who is working in a different subject area from the one on which the advisor has expertise. Thus, if a student's advisor is in Theology, that student will be encouraged to consult with a literature professor who has some interest in the student's topic. We recognize that some seniors in the College of Arts and Letters are writing senior theses for their majors. In many cases it is unrealistic to expect such students to write an additional capstone essay.

Education involves more than developing just specialized skills, it involves teaching every student to recognize a role of service to the human community.</p><p>The business education program at Notre Dame seeks to expand learning beyond traditional silos and to integrate knowledge across business disciplines, in order to promote critical thought. Students develop the broader perspective they will need to lead in a complex, global economy.</p><p>The business world has always required people with initiative, a willingness to take risks and the stamina to thrive in a competitive world. To meet demands for new and better goods and services, leaders must manage operations which are extensive and multifaceted. The business leader whose job it is to put the work of many specialized people together into a smooth-working whole has traditionally developed business skills by rather accidental means: by knowing instinctively, by learning from experience, or by building upon some specialized body of knowledge.</p><p>The purpose of the business program is to focus attention directly on the skills and knowledge required by a leader today.

The educational activities of a university and a college are broader than the mere teaching of courses. Nevertheless, one of the main expressions of an educational plan is its program of instruction. Several features of the program itself and certain fundamental concepts on which it is based deserve special comment.</p><p>The college recognizes four distinguishable but interrelated types of education to which future business leaders should be exposed: (1) study in the fields traditionally called liberal arts;</p><p>(2) a basic understanding of the operation of a business enterprise; (3) an understanding of the economic and legal climate or atmosphere in which business functions and of which business is a part; (4) a professional concentration in a major for the student's in-depth educational pursuit, which will also provide some preparation for future employment.</p><p>The curriculum of the business program is approximately one-half business courses and one-half instruction in traditional liberal studies usually provided by the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science.</p><p>Mendoza College of Business students are introduced to the basic tools of business and the functions of accounting, information systems, financial management, management, business statistics, marketing, business law, and ethics during their first two years.</p><p>In the junior and senior years the student continues his or her studies using the analytical tools developed in the first two years. The student enters into a consideration of the operation of the business firm and the economic and legal climate of business. The examination of the economic climate in which business must operate is concerned with the fundamentals of money and banking, the role of the federal government in terms of its fiscal and monetary policies, and the concepts of national income accounting that afford a basis for measuring and forecasting economic change.

The college comprises five departments: aerospace and mechanical engineering, chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil and environmental engineering and earth sciences, computer science and engineering, and electrical engineering.</p><p>Since its inception, the College of Engineering has regarded the primary purpose of all higher education as the development of the intellect, discriminatory power, and judgment in all students to enable them to arrive at sound decisions in their personal lives and in the professional lives they will pursue after graduation. The programs of studies offered in the various departments of the college are, therefore, constructed to give the student a good knowledge of the basic sciences and of engineering principles, and to prepare the student for the manifold duties of an educated professional and for the cultural life of an educated person. Classroom instruction is amplified by laboratory work and design experiences that give the student insight into the application of principles to practical problems. Detailed information about the College of Engineering and its many programs can be found at engineering.nd.edu.</p><p>Engineering at Notre Dame combines technical inquiry with a creative bent (novel methods of using and producing materials, components, devices, and systems) to develop innovations that can improve the health, well-being, and quality of life for all persons. Consistent with the University's Catholic mission and heritage, the College of Engineering's mission is founded on the principle that the creation and transfer of knowledge should reflect a profound and complete respect for the dignity of all persons and for the greater common good of humanity. To appropriate the words of the University's founder, Rev. Edward A. Sorin, C.S.C., the college must be, first and foremost, a force for good in the world.</p><p>To that end, the college will continue to engage in transformational research in its core competencies-energy, biomedical/bioengineering, environmental science/engineering, and national/ personal security-as they address the important needs of humanity, while inspiring students of all levels to scholarship and service. It will also continue to develop its expertise in electronic materials and devices, wireless and information systems, natural hazard mitigation, flow physics and control, geochemistry and geosciences, hydrology, and computational science and engineering, translating research outcomes into commercial ventures as possible, so that the efforts of Notre Dame engineering researchers produce the greatest good for society.</p><p>accreditation and academic association.

Dual-degree students are eligible to join the Reilly Program in Engineering and Arts and Letters described at http://reilly.nd.edu/reilly-dual-degreein-arts-and-letters-and-engineering/.</p><p>Students pursuing this program must have strong scholastic ability and be acceptable to both the dean of the College of Arts and Letters and the dean of the College of Engineering. Application to the program is normally done by the end of the second year, but choice of a particular field in Arts and Letters may be deferred until the end of the third year.</p><p>The general sequence of courses in the five-year engineering-liberal arts program is found under "Dual Degree Programs" later in this section of the Bulletin.</p><p>combination five-Year dual-degree with the college of science. The college also recognizes that a background in the natural sciences or mathematics, which are also foundational to a strong liberal arts experience, can provide engineering students with a broader context for solving societal problems and meeting humanity's needs. Thus, in 2013, the colleges of engineering and science approved a plan of study that would allow students to earn a bachelor's degree in each college in five years.</p><p>The general requirements for this program are found under "Dual Degree Programs" later in this section of the Bulletin.  The program is structured so that a student who has completed the first three years of the bachelor's degree program, if accepted through a competitive admissions process, completes the master of business administration and the bachelor of science in engineering by the end of the fifth year. This program may require summer or intersession work.</p><p>Students who wish to pursue this program should have a superior scholastic record in their undergraduate program and must apply to and be accepted by the MBA program during their third year in the College of Engineering.</p><p>The general sequence of courses in the five-year engineering-MBA program may be found under "Dual Degree Programs" later in this section of the Bulletin. Through a special arrangement, students at Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame, Ind., may take a combination program of science classes at Saint Mary's and engineering classes at Notre Dame beginning in their sophomore year at Saint Mary's. The student will earn her bachelor of science degree from Saint Mary's at the end of the fourth year, and complete her bachelor of science in engineering degree in her fifth year at Notre Dame. combination five-Year programs with Other schools. The highly desirable objective to infuse more liberal arts and sciences work into the education of engineering students has also been met also through 3-2 engineering programs with select liberal arts institutions.  <ref type="bibr">Thomas, Houston, Tex.</ref>; Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, La., and the Atlanta University Center, comprising Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Ga., whereby the liberal arts and sciences part of a combination five-year program is given by these respective colleges and the engineering part by Notre Dame. In these dual-degree programs, the student spends three years at a college of first choice and two years at Notre Dame. After completion of the five-year program, the student receives a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree from the first college and a bachelor of science in engineering degree from Notre Dame.</p><p>The sequence of courses for any of these programs will vary depending on the program of study at the other institution. No attempt has been made to set up a rigid pattern, and each participating institution has some freedom concerning the choice and arrangement of courses, provided that the coverage in the areas of mathematics, physics, chemistry, computing, introductory engineering, theology, philosophy, history, social science, and literature or fine arts is appropriate. It is expected, however, that students will complete the equivalent of the first two years of the desired College of Engineering program before applying for transfer.</p><p>To be eligible for an undergraduate degree, the student must complete a minimum of 62 credit hours at the University with a minimum of 75% of the degree credit hours (not less than 90 credit hours) earned after high school graduation through college and university courses, and be enrolled in the last semester on the main university campus.

Students may double-count more than one course between both degrees as appropriate to eliminate unnecessary duplication in course content.</p><p>(2) Students must earn 30 usable (degree-appropriate) credits past engineering degree requirements. Usable credits are defined as credits-including AP, IB, credit-by-examination and course credits-that are of high enough level that they could be applied to degree requirements. For example, additional AP credits in economics could be used to satisfy a free elective credit in a degree program, but AP credit for statistics (ACMS 10145) cannot be used in either degree program because the class level is lower than the statistics requirements for any degree program in science or engineering.</p><p>(3) Students must complete sequences of courses in mathematics, chemistry and physics, as described in the course sequences below and the corresponding table on the following page. This requirement ensures that all necessary material is covered through a sequence of classes, and that students do not duplicate content by taking classes from more than one approved sequence.</p><p>(4) The exact set of courses a student must complete to earn both degrees will be determined by agreement between the appropriate associate/assistant deans of each college and will, naturally, depend on the pair of majors selected.

In this education, the student should acquire a thorough, integrated, and broad understanding of the fundamental knowledge in his or her field, a competence in orderly analytical thinking, and the capacity to communicate ideas to others, orally and in writing. This system of education is so arranged to develop in each student the desire and habit of continuing to learn after graduation, advancing over the years to higher levels of professional and personal stature and keeping abreast of the changing knowledge and problems of his or her profession.</p><p>Emphasis is placed on fundamental principles so that the students can develop abilities to apply these principles to the solution of new problems never before encountered by society, to the discovery of new things and to the invention of devices not learned about in books.

While the total number of hours required does depend on the two major programs, the minimum required total number of degree credits is set to be 30 degree credits beyond the college total for the college with the greatest required number of degree credits. Students with no previous background in a language should start with a beginning-level course. They take typically either nine credits over a three-semester period, eleven credits over a three semester sequence, or two semesters of an intensive language sequence (10 credits total). Students with Advanced Placement or SAT II credit may receive up to eight credit hours of langauge toward their degree. If for some reason more than eight credits appear on the transcript, only eight credits will count toward the required 124 credits. Students who arive with some background in the language they elect, but without AP or SAT II credit, will be placed by departmental examination but will receive no credit hours. Not all science courses will count toward degree credit or science elective credit for science majors. The survey science courses offered as options for non-science majors for their University science requirement will not count as a science elective or toward the minimum science credit hour requirement. Because of overlap in content with required courses for science majors, many of these courses will also not count toward the degree credit requirement (see "Science Degree Credit," later in this section of the Bulletin).</p><p>Some major programs have a science elective requirement. For a course to be a science elective, it must meet the following rules: (1) It is offered through one of the departments of the College of Science or through the college itself.</p><p>(2) It is major's level; that is, other science majors are required to take this course to meet a major requirement or it has a prerequisite course that is offered for science majors, or the Bulletin description for the course states that it is a science elective in the College of Science. Finally, the departments may place additional restrictions on allowed science electives, e.g., for biological sciences major one science elective must be a non-biology course.</p><p>All College of Science courses offered by a major program must be taken at the University of Notre Dame. If a student wants to take a course outside Notre Dame for credit toward the Notre Dame degree, prior approval of the dean's office must be obtained. This does not apply to the courses taken by a transfer student prior to attending Notre Dame.</p><p>advising. All Notre Dame science majors have been assigned an advisor in the department of their major. All advisors are members of the faculty of the College of Science. In some departments, the director of undergraduate studies for the department advises all students. In others, the director of undergraduate studies or the department office may be contacted to find out the name of the student's advisor. A complete list of names of advisors is kept on the science website.</p><p>Notre Dame students who have questions concerning the choice of a major or considering a change of major are urged to make appointments with the advisors of the departments involved. Students needing help choosing from similar majors may request an advising appointment with the associate or assistant dean of undergraduate studies of the College of Science, 215 Jordan Hall. Any Notre Dame student who is considering a health profession can recieve advising in the Center for Health Sciences Advising in 219 Jordan Hall.</p></div>

In the fall of 1983, the University inaugurated an honors program for a small number of outstanding students in the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science. A limited number of students with academic intents for each college are identified at the time of admission. Although selection criteria include the promise of outstanding academic performance as demonstrated by standardized test scores and high school performance, the program is looking for more than mere academic ability. It hopes to identify students with a deep intellectual curiosity.</p><p>The program offers honors sections to fulfill most of the University and college requirements in the students' freshman and sophomore years. At present, there is the yearlong Honors Seminar (satisfying the writing and literature requirements). Honors Calculus, Honors Philosophy, Honors Theology, Honors Biology, Honors Physics, and an array of Honors Social Science courses. Since these course are restricted to honors students, they are smaller than non-honors sections and are usually taught in a seminar format. The teachers for honors sections are chosen from the most outstanding teachers in each college. After the first year, each student's academic work will be mainly centered in his or her major field (or fields) of study, but two or more honors electives are also taken during these years. In the fall of the senior year, there is an "Honors Thesis/Research Seminar," which is followed by the "Senior Seminar" in the spring. The fall seminar is intended to be a spur to the students' capstone project, whereas the spring seminar brings the honors students from diverse majors back together for some concluding topical discussions. All honors students will also be expected to complete a special six-hour senior research honors project in their major field of study. In science, this is the culmination of a research project begun earlier, and in arts and letters, it is a two-semester project culminating in a thesis. Those writing senior theses work individually under the direction of a faculty advisor of their choosing in their major field. Funds are available for research projects during summers either at Notre Dame or other universities.</p><p>In addition to the more narrowly academic features of the honors program, students will be offered various opportunities for broadening personal, cultural, and spiritual growth. Regular colloquia, informal discussions, and cultural excursions are available. program of studies. The partnership of applied mathematics, computational mathematics and statistics brings the tools of modeling, simulation and data analysis to bear on real-world problems, producing solutions with the power to predict and explain complex phenomena. These methods, often applied computationally, are being used in a wide variety of areas in business, engineering, the natural sciences, and the social sciences.</p><p>The Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS) offers programs of study leading to the bachelor of science degree in applied and computational mathematics and statistics and to the bachelor of science in statistics. Computational skills, which are often required to solve real-world problems, will be developed continuously throughout the curriculum. For many students, significant work in an area of application will complement their core studies. Graduates of the program will be well prepared for the following post-graduate opportunities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>traCKs</head><p>The Department of Biological Sciences offers eight tracks within the Biological Sciences major. Tracks provide structure to electives to assist students' development in their fields of interest, and provide experience in a field within biology for students seeking admission to graduate school, medical school, or other programs/jobs.</p><p>Each track requires at least 14 credits, two of which can be used for Undergraduate Research. These credits are in addition to the core requirements of the Biological Sciences major listed above. Note that courses listed in more than one track will not count twice. Students may begin the core in sophomore year; however, they will be at a considerable disadvantage in scheduling requirements in the two remaining years; they also will have one year less to explore their interests in biology. 1. Students are required to take a total of six laboratories; three of the six labs will be part of the Core <ref type="figure">(Core I(a,b)</ref>, II, and the remaining three of the six laboratories are chosen among the core III through Core VI and/or BIOS electives, including 50000-and 60000-level courses. Thus, there are three required "named" BIOS labs and three additional elective BIOS labs. As an option, students who conduct a minimum of three semesters of undergraduate research <ref type="bibr">(BIOS 48498)</ref> in the same laboratory or research group at Notre Dame and earn a minimum of 3 credits (i.e., 3 x 1.0 credit), may substitute those research semesters for one of the six required labs.</p></div>

These should be taken in the sophomore year but no later than the junior year. The two-credit cell research lab (BIOS 27241) is especially ideal for those interested in obtaining summer research internships, doing undergraduate research at Notre Dame or elsewhere, and is especially critical to any graduate research career. Only one of the two available cell biology labs may count toward the required six, however.</p><p>3. Physiology should be completed by the end of the junior year for students planning to take the MCAT exam or the seventh semester for students planning to take the GRE biology subjects exam. 5.

Select non-BIOS major-level College of Science courses (i.e., those taken to meet science-major requirements and not among those designated as "Recommended University electives") that are not being used to fulfill other specific graduation requirements can be chosen with the consent of the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of Biological Sciences and counted toward the BIOS elective credits. While majors are allowed to take one 3-credit, non-BIOS lecture course and have that count toward the 41 required credits, students may also include one non-BIOS lab if it is required for that non-BIOS lecture and have that laboratory satisfy one of the six required laboratories. For example, Physical Geology <ref type="bibr">(SC 20110, ENVG 10110/20110</ref>) has a required laboratory, and majors who choose BIOS electives based on their environmental or ecological interests may elect to take Physical Geology for a total of 4 credits toward the 41 required credits. Majors who might have transferred into BIOS from BCHM and had taken the required biochemistry (CHEM 30341) lecture and laboratory course will be allowed to count both the lecture and laboratory toward the 41 credits. The same would be true of other relevant science courses (e.g., analytical chemistry, physical chemistry) as approved by the director of their major and the associate dean of the College of Science.</p></div>

This ensures that the student will be able to meet the standard medical-school admission requirement of two English courses. Medical ethics and biochemistry are also generally required or highly recommended. students majoring in biological sciences please note: the biology survey courses (10101-10119) satisfy the science requirement for non-science majors at Notre Dame. They do not satisfy the science requirements for science majors at Notre Dame or elsewhere. Students may not take courses with overlapping or similar lecture material such as BIOS 10101 and 10110 or BIOS 10107, 10118, and 10119, for example. A table listing these overlapping courses is on the final pages of the College of Science section of this Bulletin.</p><p>Also, Biostatistics (BIOS 40411/42411) is highly recommended for all students planning on a health related professional program or a graduate program, especially in ecology, environmental biology, or other field of life science. A non-BIOS/Science elective can be any 30000-50000-level course other than those required, and approved by the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of Biological Sciences.

A sample curriculum for second majors is given below. Note: Only the courses for the second major are listed. The Minor in Sustainability is a course of study for undergraduates from broadly diverse academic disciplines. It examines the footprint of humanity on Earth's systems and ways to reduce that footprint to achieve social well-being and environmental protection. Faculty from multiple Colleges teach the principles and practices of sustainability from varied perspectives to provide a unique and dynamic curriculum. The curriculum is designed to augment disciplinary coursework in an area of major study so that students learn to integrate diverse ways of thinking and appreciate interdisciplinary problem-solving.</p><p>Students in the minor receive training in the principles and practices of sustainability through formal courses and independent study. Graduates of the minor will be equipped with knowledge and skills about sustainability, an ability to communicate about sustainability, and an imperative to implement sustainable practices. Graduates will be prepared to make substantive contributions to the development of more sustainable practices, practices that benefit their personal and professional lives, the lives of others, and the lives of future generations. Students will also be well positioned for in-depth study on sustainability at the post-baccalaureate level. Finally, the study of Catholic traditions and social and environmental ethics will help students understand the role that religious commitment can play in achieving sustainability.</p><p>Students can apply for admission to the minor in their first year, sophomore year, or junior year by contacting the director of the minor. They are required to take a gateway course "Sustainability: Principles and Practices", an interdisciplinary course taught by faculty from multiple departments across the University. This course should be taken at the beginning of study in the minor, but students do not need to declare the minor to enroll.</p><p>Students then select from a list of approved courses totaling at least 3 classes of at least 9 credits. These courses fall into four categories (Design, Impacts, Social Institutions, and Individual Behavior and Values) and are tagged as such using the course attributes which are searchable via the University's online Class Search. Students must take two courses outside of their College, except for Arts and Letters students who may take one liberal arts course and one social science course. They also must take courses from three out of the four elective categories. Students who wish to take two electives in the same category may petition for an exception, provided that the two classes are providing substantially different disciplinary approaches to sustainability. One-credit seminars such as those offered by the Center for Social Concerns can be accumulated to give the equivalent of one 3-credit course. Students planning to study abroad are encouraged to petition for approval of relevant courses at their international institution before they leave campus.</p><p>Students must meet with the director of the minor in sustainability to discuss their capstone projects during the spring semester of their penultimate year, but they are encouraged to set up an initial meeting sooner. They are required to submit a brief description of their project proposal at the end of their penultimate year and identify a faculty member who has agreed to serve as their advisor. Students will receive feedback on their proposals from the Sustainability Minor Advisory Board and may be required to resubmit their proposals with modifications to gain approval. Students wishing to start their project earlier (for example, the summer before their junior year) should submit their project proposal before they begin their research. During the fall of their final year, students will enroll in a capstone seminar (SUS 43000) and one credit of independent study (SUS 48001). As part of the requirements for SUS 48001, they will complete a research paper thoroughly exploring existing scholarship on their project topic. During the spring of their final year, students will enroll in a second credit of independent study (SUS 48002) and complete their capstone project.</p><p>Additional details about the Minor in Sustainability can be found online at http://sustainabilitystudies. nd.edu.</p><p>program of studies.

Mathematics has had a profound effect upon civilization since ancient times, when the legend originally inscribed on the entrance to Plato's academy was "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here." It was equally true during the medieval period, when arithmetic and geometry constituted two of the seven subjects considered essential for a liberal education. It has been said that the second most influential book in the span of Western civilization-after the Bible-is Euclid's Elements. Although mathematics is usually associated with science and technology in the modern mind, it seems apparent from the writings of the great mathematicians of the 17th and 18th centuries that religious belief played a great role in their pursuit of mathematics. They saw the "system of the world" obeying mathematical laws and as a consequence felt impelled to study mathematics so as to better appreciate the world's Creator.</p><p>Mathematics continues to have a profound influence in our century. From the theory of relativity, with its applications to the study of the large-scale structure of the universe, to the development of the modern computer, with its manifold applications in science, technology and business, mathematics has played a fundamental role. It is surely the most universal of all scientific tools, and the student equipped with a strong mathematical background will be in the enviable position of being able to employ his or her expertise in any area in which rigorous thought and precision of results are mandated.</p><p>The department is dedicated to the development of undergraduate studies, to the teaching of mathematics to scientists, engineers and teachers, to graduate education and research, and to the discovery of new mathematics. The entire faculty is involved with undergraduate affairs, and students have the opportunity of associating with scholars of international repute.

Neuroscience encompasses the study of problems from multiple disciplinary perspectives at different levels of analysis in human and non-human organisms. It includes, for example, the study of molecular mechanisms in individual neurons and the coordination of millions of neurons into neural systems. Problems range from investigation of the evolution of nervous systems in basal vertebrates to the application of neuroscience to education and law. Neuroscientists also seek to develop neurologically plausible models of human thinking, affect and behavior.</p><p>At the University of Notre Dame, the neuroscience and behavior major is an interdisciplinary program that includes both Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts tracks. This description covers the BS track only (see the Arts &amp; Letters section for description of the BA track). The requirements for the major are essentially the same, including three foundational neuroscience and behavior Core courses, and an introductory neuroscience and behavior laboratory course beginning the fall of the sophomore year. The tracks differ in how they fulfill college requirements. Required courses and electives for both the BS &amp; BA that will satisfy the major credit requirements are drawn primarily from the Departments of Biological Sciences and Psychology. Undergraduate research and approved electives in other departments are also encouraged.</p><p>Research within the neuroscience and behavior program is reflective of the diversity of the field, with faculty pursuing research spanning from cellular and molecular approaches to architectural design and policy. Faculty are not housed within a specific department, but are affiliated based off their research interests; the uniting theme across disciplines is the understanding of the brain and behavior.</p><p>Students choosing an undergraduate major in neuroscience and behavior are well prepared for admissions to medical school, physical therapy or other professional schools, or to continue on for graduate study <ref type="bibr">(e.g., Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., M.S., MPH)</ref>. Graduates who wish to enter the work force directly from their undergraduate studies are desirable candidates in careers ranging from industry, biotechnology, biotechnology sales, health-related research, health-related consulting, government, education, or policy.</p><p>This major requires a minimum of 61 credits in the College of Science. Students should discuss their specific choices with the program's undergraduate adviser.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>sCIenCe PreProFessIonal PrograM (sCPP)</head><p>Healthcare in the United States has been undergoing a sea change including health systems, best clinical practices, and training, extending even into the pre-professional undergraduate years. There is an emphasis on broader and deeper education and interest in professionals on the healthcare team beyond the physician is expanding rapidly. This major is designed to allow those seeking to enter any of the health professions to customize their undergraduate education to fulfill the prerequisites for a variety of health professions schools. The biggest change has come from medical admissions with a new 7.5 hour MCAT exam and a changing emphasis on competencies rather than a checklist of prerequisites. There is an emphasis on a depth of science competency (e.g. biochemistry, research methods, and statistics) and an added emphasis on the psychosocial aspects of care.</p><p>With the new holistic model of pre-medical education, this major offers flexibility to study across science departments and space in the schedule to add depth in the humanities or social science by adding a second major or minor. This department also provides general elective courses, open to all majors, that address clinical practice and medical systems (See the following section on the Hillebrand Center).</p><p>There are 24 credit hours of science elective courses required beyond the core sciences. These include most upper level science courses taught across the traditional science departments (biological sciences, chemistry, physics and mathematics). The classes are taken during the school year and only occasionally, with consultation with your advisor, should students take any of the major courses in the summer. The Notre Dame College of Science does not allow transfer of science courses with the exception of preapproved courses through Notre Dame International Programs. Those students who wish to matriculate directly to medical school after graduation should plan to take cell biology, statistics and biochemistry by the end of junior year in order to take the MCAT at the end of that year. Students planning to attend PA or PT programs should plan physiology and anatomy during the junior year. Student involvement in research is encouraged and up to 2 credit hours per semester for 3 semesters taken in one of the traditional science departments can count toward the 24 science elective credits (total of 6 maximum).</p><p>Non-science courses are important in preparation for health professional schools. The AAMC Admissions Initiative has identified development of cultural competence, ethics, communication skills and background in human behavior as critical in the competencies of future physicians. Because of this, students should take multiple courses in social science, humanities and ethics.</p><p>The major allows students to customize their development for the scientific and non-scientific competencies for health professions schools. Students are also advised to chart their progress through an e-portfolio and fill out their academic preparation with experiences in service, clinical settings, teamwork, reliability, and in leadership. Experience in being responsible for the well-being of others is a key factors in preparation for the health professions.</p><p>Information concerning preparation for admission to schools of medicine, dentistry, physician assistant, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health, post-baccalaureate nursing, as well as information on several other allied health careers, is available for all majors from the Center for Health Science Advising, 219 Jordan Hall of Science.</p></div>

Thus, only students of superior scholastic ability should consider this as an option.</p><p>Students are warned that it is almost certain that completing a double major in two sciences will require total credits well over the college minimum of 124. Conflicts in scheduling of required courses may occur; neither the college nor the departments undertake to reschedule courses for the sake of double majors. For these reasons, it must be emphasized that completing a double major may well require more than four years. Only one degree is awarded (degrees in science do not specify a field). This program, instituted in 1994, offers students the opportunity to better integrate studies in science and in management. The student completing this program will have a background in management as well as the first professional degree in one of the undergraduate majors of the College of Science. Because it is a demanding program, only those students of superior scholastic ability who have the aptitude, motivation and maturity necessary for the combined graduate and undergraduate program should apply. Those with outstanding internship experiences in business will be looked upon favorably. Advisors for the program are available for consultation about the advisability of applying for the program and about meeting the particular needs of students pursuing this program.</p></div>

Every dual-degree student is also expected to participate in the orientation for the MBA program. This program will occupy the entire day for the two weeks prior to the first day of classes. Orientation is mandatory for all students beginning the MBA program.</p><p>Students in the five-year science/MBA program are also required to:</p><p>(1) Complete a minimum of 48 MBA credit hours and maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 to successfully complete the program.</p><p>(2) Take all MBA courses in their fourth yeaer.</p><p>(3) Maintain full-time student status (minimum courseload of 12 credit hours per semester).

(Courses within the same group are shown in the same row and are also enclosed within parentheses; courses listed within the same column generally show a typical normal progression through course work.) In every case, only one course per group should be counted for degree credit. Generally, only the course taken last should be counted.

The third field is a natural grass field.Construction of Compton FamilyIce Arena, a stateof-the-art, two-sheet ice facility, began in March 2010 south of the Joyce Center. The rink (200' x 90') in the main arena (capacity ~5,000) is named in honor of legendary Irish coach Charles W. "Lefty" Smith Jr., while an Olympic-sized (200' x 100') auxiliary rink sits on the basement level. The facility includes offices, locker rooms, strength, cardio and other training areas for the Notre Dame hockey program as well as locker rooms, service and support staff and areas necessary to operate campus and community hockey, skating and other recreational ice sport usage. For Irish games and other hospitality functions, O'Brien's, a club area with adjacent premium seating is available on the mezzanine level. The facility opened on October 18, 2011, and Notre Dame played its first hockey game in the new building on October 21 against RPI.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

The Department of East Asian Languages &amp; Cultures provides the resources and instruction necessary for success in these areas. The department is dedicated to providing rigorous language training in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, as well as courses taught in English on Chinese, Japanese, and Korean philosophy, religion, literature, and culture. Complementary courses in other disciplines are listed in this Bulletin under departments such as history, philosophy, theology, political science, economics, and anthropology.Completion of the fourth semester of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (Second Year Chinese II, Second Year Japanese II, Second Year Korean II) will satisfy the language requirement for both the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Science. Although the College of Business does not have a language requirement, it strongly supports integration of language courses into its curriculum and encourages students to participate in the study abroad programs (See "Study Abroad" under Mendoza College of Business).</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>57</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>East Asian Languages &amp; Cultures</cell></row><row><cell>East Asian Languages &amp; Cultures</cell><cell>PrograM In ChInese anD ClassICal ChInese The program in Chinese offers language classes in</cell></row><row><cell>Chair: Yongping Zhu Professors: Liangyan Ge; Michael Hockx Associate Professors: Michael C.

When necessary, students may satisfy a limited number of Program requirements by taking non-departmental courses with comparable content. Such exemptions are granted only with the permission of the Program's Director of Undergraduate Studies and are subject to strict limitations. Students normally declare a PLS major by the begin- ning of April of the first year. Declaration of major forms are available by early March in the department office (215 O'Shaughnessy) and website (pls.nd.edu). Students interested in entering the Program are urged to complete the University science and mathematics requirements in the first year.

A major course of study is offered in French, Italian, and Spanish. Minors are offered in French, Italian, and Portuguese. The study of foreign languages, literatures, and cultures provides educational opportunities relevant to an increasingly interdependent world. A crucial component of a liberal education, the acquisition of foreign-language skills enhances our powers of communication and serves to introduce us to the enduring cultural achievements of other peoples. Moreover, the study of a foreign language broadens our mental horizons, encourages us to think and act more globally, and stimulates our understanding of the traditions of other nations. Elementary and intermediate courses develop the students' ability to understand, speak, read, and write a foreign language with facility and confidence. Others trace the development of literary genres or examine a theme across periods and genres. And still others inculcate the critical and analytical skills necessary for an informed interpretation of foreign language texts.

The Department is highly interdisciplinary and in excellent position to fulfill the promise of the new integrative approach to biology. Basic research is at the center of our endeavors and fuels and inspires our teaching and training. We seek solutions to human health and environmental crises facing our society-such as finding treatments, cures and preventions for human diseases, maintaining biodiversity on land and in our natural water sources, ensuring an adequate supply of food and fresh water, and reversing the effects of pollution and climate change. Research in the department spans the wide realm of the life sciences, across scales of complex-ity-from cells and organs to whole organisms and ecosystems-and across foci as varied as infectious disease, cancer, organ regeneration, climate change and biodiversity. United through the ultimate goals of fostering human and environmental health, we believe that real-world solutions require integrative biological inquiry and multidisciplinary collabora-tion. Our department serves as a hub connecting different academic units across campus and different universities worldwide, through life science-related investigation and problem solving. Students choosing an undergraduate major in bio-logical sciences will be prepared for graduate study (M.S., Ph.D., MD/Ph.D.) leading to a research career, or for admission to medical, veterinary, and other professional schools. Graduates with a bachelor's degree may enter careers in industry, government, or health-related research laboratories. Those who wish to teach at the elementary or secondary level should be sure to include required education courses such as those offered through Saint Mary's College. policy statement on the use of Organisms in Biological sciences Teaching laboratories. Some laboratory courses offered by the Department of Biological Sciences may involve the use of living or preserved organisms. Instructors use these animal specimens in cases where this is deemed necessary for teaching important biological concepts and principles. Students who have concerns about the use of organisms in classes must, prior to registering, submit a request for alternate materials to the course instructor. It is up to the discretion of the instructor(s) as to whether and how non-organism alternatives may be substituted for biological materials in classes. Students permitted to use alternate materials are responsible for the same knowledge and application as their classmates and may be required to complete examinations that involve the inspection or handling of biological specimens.

Select courses offered in Study Abroad (UC-Dublin, UWA-Perth) also may be counted toward the ES science electives as well as select CE courses not cross-listed with SC, with permission of the ES director. Students interested in attending graduate school in environmental sciences should consider taking science electives beyond requirements of this major. For example, for admission into some graduate programs, a year of organic chemistry would be a requirement. Deviations from the approved list of science electives must be approved by the advisor for the major. 7. The economics requirement for this major is fulfilled by taking Introduction to Economics (Microeconomics) either in the first year (ECON 10010) or in the second through fourth years (ECON 20010). Note, the course ECON 13181 (Social Science University Seminar) will not fulfill the economics requirement for this major. 8. For this major, the University social science require-ment will be fulfilled by the required microeconomics course. 9. Numerous STV courses are recommended as elec-tives, including Environment and Environmentalism in History (STV 30175); Self, Society and the Environment (STV 40319) and others as approved by the ES director.

At least two of the five electives must be core electives. The curriculum for the supplementary major is: The required courses may not be taken concurrently. Introduction to Peace Studies is a pre-requisite for Perspectives on Peacebuilding, and both of those foundational courses are pre-requisites for Peace Studies Senior Seminar. The senior seminar course may only be taken during the senior year.</p></div>
