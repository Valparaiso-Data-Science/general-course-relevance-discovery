A student is responsible for being fully aware of and fulfilling all regulations and conditions contained or referred to herein or as such regulations and conditions may hereafter be amended by the University if and when it deems necessary.</p><p>As conditions of admission, the University reserves the right and power to discipline or dismiss any student who fails to comply with said regulations and conditions, and each student agrees that the University shall have such right and power of discipline or dismissal.</p><p>Copy for the descriptive chapters and the list of officers for this catalog issue were prepared as of March 1, 2019. Information about fees and expenses, financial aid, and scholarships applies to the academic year 2019-2020. Plans of study, course titles, fees, expenses, and other matters described herein are subject to change at the discretion of the University.</p><p>Southwest Baptist University is approved for the training of veterans and the dependents of veterans under Title 38, U.S. Code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Discrimination</head><p>Applicants for admission and employment, students, parents of students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with Southwest Baptist University are hereby notified that this institution does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, or marital status in employment, admissions or access to, or treatment in its programs and activities, except to the extent permitted by religious exemptions recognized by law.</p><p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) afford students certain rights with respect to their education records. These student rights are:</p><p>1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the Registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes to be inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why that part is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Southwest Baptist University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the offices that administer FERPA are: v a. Tara Parson, SBU Vice President for Administration 5. Directory Information.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Student Admission</head><p>Southwest Baptist University is in agreement with the principle of the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education "that a student with a clear educational objective should be able to complete a degree program in the shortest possible time, whether the student remains in one institution or transfers to another."</p><p>The nature and standards of courses transferred toward a degree program must correspond closely to courses offered at Southwest Baptist University and may be limited by the college or department involved. Only professional education courses transferred from two-year colleges and from senior colleges having state approved teacher education programs can be used to meet certification requirements.</p><p>A maximum of six hours of D credit will be accepted in transfer. A maximum of 30 semester hours of accredited work earned by Online Independent Study (OLIS) or extension may be applied toward SBU requirements. No more than 12 hours of this credit will be counted toward a major or minor. Applicants may transfer up to 64 semester hours of credit from two-year colleges, and these credits will transfer only as lower level  courses. Note: SBU will accept no more than 94 hours from other institutions toward a degree.</p><p>Transfer students from schools that are not regionally accredited will have their work evaluated by individual departments to determine if it is transferable (no more than 30 credit hours total will be accepted). No Bible or religion courses will be accepted from schools not regionally accredited. Graduation Requirements from regionally accredited schools will be evaluated by the individual departments to determine if they are transferable. No grade of D will be accepted from a college not regionally accredited.</p><p>Transfer students who have been dismissed from a previous institution must seek re-admittance or permission to return to that institution before being considered for admission to Southwest Baptist University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students with the Associate Degree</head><p>Transfer applicants who have completed the A.A. degree from a regionally accredited college will be permitted to transfer to SBU with all general education requirements met for the B.A., B.S., B.S.N., and B.A.S. degrees.</p><p>Students transferring with an A.S. degree will have their degree evaluated to see if it meets all the general education requirements. Transfer students must still take those courses listed as graduation requirements. An associate degree in a professional program (such as an A.A.S.N. or A.S.N.) does not satisfy this requirement.</p><p>Transfer students holding an A.A. or A.S. degree seeking teacher certification must also fulfill the general education requirements prescribed by the SBU Department of Education. (See Department of Education in the College of Education and Social Sciences.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students Without the Associate Degree</head><p>Transfer applicants who do not have an associate degree will have their transcripts evaluated on a course by course basis. Students who have fulfilled the 42-credit hour general education curriculum block outlined by the Missouri Coordinating Board of Higher Education and certified by the sending institution shall be deemed to have completed all general education requirements. Transfer students must still take those courses listed as graduation requirements.</p><p>1. All Southwest Baptist University students are required to take the ACT or SAT exam or other approved departmental placement exams for placement in English and math classes. 2. Official credentials indicating all secondary work must be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with the formal application forms. Admissions status cannot be determined until all documents are on file. 3. As part of the admissions process, an international credential evaluation is required reporting prior university study. SBU accepts evaluations from World Education Services (WES), found at www.wes.org or Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) found at www.ece.org. An official international credential evaluation should come directly to Southwest Baptist University electronically or through the mail in a sealed envelope. Transfer credit will be applied according to information reported on the official evaluation. International students who transfer work to SBU from foreign institutions are responsible for any evaluation fees associated with the transfer of credits. A letter of acceptance will be issued only when an applicant is found eligible for admission. 4. International students must provide an original bank statement demonstrating the ability to afford the cost to attend SBU for 9 months. After receiving SAT or ACT scores and GPA or ECE results, the admissions counselor will be able to provide more information the individual's cost of attendance. 5. All international students accepted for admission to Southwest Baptist University are required to purchase a 12-month medical insurance policy from a United States based company prior to campus arrival. Once medical insurance is purchased, the student must provide documentation verifying the health policy to the University Health Center. A 12-month medical insurance policy must be maintained while the international student is attending SBU.</p><p>An applicant admitted from another country must carry a minimum full academic load. A minimum load is interpreted to mean 12 academic credit hours, unless the applicant needs fewer hours to complete his or her academic program. An applicant who has qualified on the TOEFL is deemed sufficiently proficient in English to carry the minimum of 12 credit hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Procedures</head><p>The following application procedures are required for all undergraduate applicants who wish to enter Southwest Baptist University. (Admission criteria are stated on the previous pages.)</p><p>Note: MAT 0103 and MAT 0123 do not meet the mathematics general education requirements, nor do they carry college credit. They are necessary to develop the skills needed for success in future mathematics courses.</p></div>

[34 CFR 668.16(e)] These measurements shall be used to determine a student's eligibility for all federal Title IV aid and for other need-based financial assistance, unless the terms of a particular grant or funding source states otherwise. Degree seeking students in all undergraduate programs are covered under this policy. (SAP) will be reviewed at the end of every semester, and you must be meeting SAP standards or you will either be placed on Financial Aid Warning, Financial Aid Probation, or Financial Aid Suspension. Students on Financial Aid Suspension may be eligible to appeal their suspension.</p><p>The academic policy at Southwest Baptist University is designed to enable students to achieve the degree requirements for graduation. Degree requirements for graduation include a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 at the time of program completion. Satisfactory academic progress (SAP) is, therefore, measured by qualitative and quantitative standards to promote this outcome. All students must meet the requirements of both quantitative and qualitative satisfactory academic progress listed below to receive financial aid.</p><p>Quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress -Students must complete 67% of the number of credit hours for which they have enrolled to remain eligible for federal financial aid. To establish a quantitative measure, a time frame is set for students to finish a program of study. Remedial courses are not counted as hours for pace purposes.</p><p>Qualitative Satisfactory Academic Progress -Student must earn a cumulative GPA as designated below. A student's cumulative GPA includes credits for courses accepted by Southwest Baptist University from other institutions that count toward the student's degree. Withdrawals, Repeats and Incomplete Grades -Courses dropped after the drop/add period will count towards attempted hours. Repeat courses for which the student has previously earned credit will not count towards hours completed. However, they will count towards hours attempted even if credit was not previously earned. The highest grade will be the grade that counts towards the GPA calculation. Credit hours for courses for which an incomplete or deferred grade is granted will not count as hours completed but will count towards hours attempted.</p><p>Transfer Students -Transfer students are accepted from regionally accredited colleges and universities on the basis of transcripts and satisfactory student records. Credits may be granted for most standard university courses with grades of C-or higher; however the institution will transfer up to 6 hours of D. Only transferred courses accepted by Southwest Baptist University will be used in SAP calculations. Transfer students who are admitted and do not meet our quantitative and/or qualitative standard will be notified that they are on probation for their first semester.</p><p>Evaluation Period -A student's academic progress will be evaluated at the end of each academic semester. Academic semesters for traditional UG students include fall and spring terms. Summer is only included if the student is taking a summer course.</p><p>Financial Aid Warning -A status a school assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress. The school reinstates eligibility for aid for one payment period and may do so without a student appeal. This status may only be used by schools that check SAP at the end of each payment period and only for students who were making SAP in the prior payment period they were enrolled in or who were in the first payment period of their program.</p><p>Financial Aid Suspension -Once a student has been placed on Financial Aid Warning, failure to meet SAP will place them on Financial Aid Suspension. Students on Financial Aid Suspension may be eligible to appeal their suspension.</p><p>Financial Aid Probation -A status a school assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successfully appeals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAP Appeal Process</head><p>• Students who have been notified that they are on Financial Aid Suspension will be required to complete a financial aid appeal. • The first appeal, if approved, places the student on financial aid probation status and they are eligible to receive financial aid. • A second appeal places a student on financial aid probation and they must complete the appeal process again with supporting documentation. The student is eligible to receive financial aid for an additional semester but must meet stipulations outlined in the appeal decision (e.g., limited hours or repeating course to raise GPA). • Students who fail to meet SAP requirements for three consecutive semesters are no longer eligible to receive financial aid. • If a student is making progress on their academic plan but is still below the SAP requirements, a student can be granted extended probation status and continue to receive financial aid as long as appeal stipulations are being met. Failure to make progress and/or failure to follow the academic plan will result in an appeal being denied and loss of financial aid eligibility. • Extenuating circumstances include: death of family member, illness, injury, or other circumstances beyond the student's control. Appropriate supporting documentation must be provided. Students may not use the same extenuating circumstance for multiple appeals without sufficient documentation of ongoing issues. • Appeals must include a statement from the student explaining why they did not meet the SAP requirements, what has changed to allow them to meet the requirements in the next semester, an academic plan completed by the student and the advisor, and a statement from the advisor. • Students who reach the maximum timeframe due to switching majors, second majors or additional degrees, will be evaluated on a case by case basis through the appeal process (incomplete appeals will not be reviewed).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reestablishing Financial Aid Eligibility</head><p>Students may reestablish eligibility by enrolling in one or more semesters and successfully completing the course(s) without the assistance of financial aid. When a student's cumulative SAP progress is at or above 67% and they have met the required GPA for hours earned, then he or she will once again become eligible to receive financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disbursement of Funds Policy</head><p>Acceptance and authorization to credit Federal funds to the student's account is given by the online award letter process using the Student Self-Service in the MySBU Portal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glossary of Academic Terms</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Hour</head><p>Credits are usually based on the number of times a class meets each week. Courses vary in credit from one to six hours; however, there is a predominance of three credit hour classes. Each hour of credit represents the equivalent of one recitation period of 50 minutes per week or a laboratory period of 100 to 150 minutes each week per semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Full-Time Student</head><p>To be classified as a full-time student during a semester, a student must carry a credit hour load of 12 semester hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Faculty Advisor</head><p>Southwest Baptist University is characterized by an intense interest in the welfare of students and a concern that they formulate mature philosophies of life, define worthy educational-vocational objectives in keeping with their interests and abilities, and select from college resources that particular combination of studies and activities that most adequately contributes to their educational, vocational, emotional, social, and religious growth. All first-year students and transfer students who have completed less that two full-time semesters at another institution, along any students who are undecided on their major are assigned a faculty advisor in the University Success Center. Other students are assigned faculty advisors based on the number of semesters they have completed and their intended major. The advisor counsels and guides the student in planning course schedules and educational programs at SBU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System</head><p>A grade represents an evaluation of a student's academic performance in a course and is determined by examinations and other criteria. Course grades are defined as follows: A, excellent; B, above average; C, average; D, minimum passing; F, failure; and I, incomplete. In certain courses, a grade of P (passing) may be given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Points</head><p>Each semester hour of credit is valued in grade points as follows: A, four points; B, three points; C, two points; D, one point; F, no points. P grades are not assigned grade points and are not considered in computing students' grade point averages. In order to graduate, students must earn an average of two grade points (2.0 -C average) for each credit hour attempted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Grades</head><p>An incomplete (I) grade may be given when a student is doing passing work or has the possibility of earning a passing grade but is unable to complete all of the course requirements because of unusual circumstances acceptable to the instructor (e.g., illness or accident). In no case may an "I" be agreed to unless the student has completed at least 80 percent of the class. An "I" may not be used to permit a student to repeat a course or to improve a grade. The instructor must complete the Application for Incomplete Grade form and it must be signed by the instructor and submitted to the appropriate department chair and college dean for approval. The completed and signed form must then be filed in the Registrar's Office; additional copies of the form will be given to the student, instructor, academic advisor, and college dean. Requirements for completing the course and appropriate grade designations are to be specified on the application by the instructor.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the student to complete satisfactorily all of the course requirements within 120 days of the posting of the incomplete grade. If the incomplete is not cleared within this specified time limit, the I will convert to an F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-Progress Grades</head><p>An In-Progress (IP) grade may be given for courses that usually require more than one semester to complete (e.g., readings, theses, internships, or practicum courses). Requirements for completing the course and specific completion dates are to be specified by the instructor on the application. The In-Progress Grade form must be signed by the instructor and submitted to the appropriate department chair and college dean for approval. The completed and signed form must then be filed in the Registrar's Office. Additional copies of the form will be given to the student, instructor, academic advisor, and college dean.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the student to complete satisfactorily, under the supervision of the instructor, all course requirements by the specified completion date. If the in-progress grade is not cleared within this time limit, the "IP" will convert to an appropriate letter grade based on the completed work. If there are extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control, the student may request a time extension through the special academic request process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Academic Regulations</head><p>Audit A person who wishes to audit a course must have permission from the instructor and enroll as an auditor at the same time and under the same procedures as for credit. This status will permit the student to attend class but does not allow the student to take tests or have assignments graded by the instructor. A student may change from audit to credit or from credit to audit only during the time period when courses can be added. Persons who are not currently enrolled in the University must apply for admission in order to register as an auditor. (See Financial Information for cost of auditing a course.) Note: When a student audits a course, no hours are earned and the course is not calculated in the total number of hours or GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Load Limit for Credit Hours</head><p>In any semester, a student is limited to the number of credit hours that can be taken, according to their GPA. This limit includes all college courses, OLIS or otherwise, being taken at SBU or elsewhere. If a student exceeds load limit restrictions, the University will require the student to reduce load hours. The normal load for all students each semester, provided students have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00, is 16 credit hours, and the normal load for January, June, or July is 4 credit hours. First-semester first-year students are limited to 16 credit hours. Other students may be permitted to enroll in additional hours with or without special permission, depending upon their GPAs, as stated below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Hours Without Special Permission</head><p>Load limits without special permission include all college courses, OLIS or otherwise, being taken at SBU or elsewhere. Advisors will approve schedules with additional hours when the student's GPA range is one of the following:</p><p>Cumulative GPA Fall/Spring January/June/July 2.50-3.00 18 hours 5 hours 3.01-4.00 19 hours 6 hours Note: More than 6 hours in a J-term is not permitted. More than 20 hours in a fall or spring semester is not permitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Courses</head><p>Courses taken at Southwest Baptist University for which the grade is F or D may be repeated only twice. Courses taken for which the grade is C can be repeated only once. Courses taken for which the grade is B cannot be repeated. Exception to the number of times a course can be repeated may be granted only by 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog the Provost. If the course is repeated at another college or university, approval must be received from the appropriate SBU department chair or the general education committee if it is a general education course. To ensure that the course will transfer, it is recommended that the student get the department chair's or general education committee's approval prior to enrolling in the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass-Fail Option</head><p>The pass-fail option is intended to encourage students in and provide them with opportunities to pursue specialized or outside interests without penalty or reduction in GPAs. This policy provides students with the opportunity for broadening their backgrounds and gaining knowledge in fields that might allow them to be more versatile and productive.</p><p>In order to take a course that is normally offered on a graded basis, the student must complete a Pass-Fail form and submit it to the Registrar's Office before the end of the period at the beginning of the semester to add courses. This form is to be signed by the student and the Registrar.</p><p>Note: Students should be aware that some universities, graduate schools, and professional schools do not accept credit for courses that have been assigned grades of P. Students would be advised not to take P/F courses if there is a possibility that the course might serve as a prerequisite for acceptance into a graduate, professional, or some other academic program.</p><p>Students may enroll in one P/F course per semester under the following conditions:</p><p>1. Courses taken under the P/F option cannot be used to satisfy general education (except those taken as credit by examination), major, minor, professional education, pre-professional, or graduation requirements. P/F grades may be given in internships, field experiences, and ICS mission trips. 2. Honors classes cannot be taken on a P/F basis. 3. Students can make changes from graded to P/F or from P/F to graded only during the period in which courses may be added. 4. Students earning grades of A, B, or C in courses for which they were enrolled on a P/F basis will receive a P; those receiving a D or F will receive an F for the course. 5. A P grade will not affect the GPA; however, an F will adversely affect the GPA as do F's in graded courses. 6. The P/F option is not available for the repeating of courses for which students have received letter grades. 7. Instructors are not informed of students enrolled in their courses on the P/F basis. Final grades are converted to this system in the Office of the Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Declaring an Academic Major (Bolivar undergraduates)</head><p>First-year students should select an academic major during their second semester at SBU. At this time they will be assigned an advisor in their major. Those who are undecided on a major will be advised by the faculty in the University Success Center, who initially advise all entering first-year students and all transfer students who have completed less than two full-time semesters elsewhere. Some academic majors have competitive, limited enrollment and/or specific requirements which must be met before acceptance into the program. Program requirements are listed by major in other sections of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changing an Academic Major</head><p>Students may change their majors by obtaining the Request for Changing/Adding/Deleting a Major/Minor form from the office of the dean of the college in which the new major resides or from the campus director. The form is signed by both the student and an appropriate faculty member. If approval for the change of major is given, the student takes the request form to the office of the dean of the college in which the new major resides for final approval. Students advised in the University Success Center do not need to complete the Request for Changing/Adding/Deleting a Major/Minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Check -Degree Audit</head><p>When a student has earned between 70 and 80 hours toward a bachelor's degree at Southwest Baptist University, he or she must request an official program evaluation at the Registrar's Office. A student pursuing an associate degree must request a program evaluation between 30 and 35 credit hours. The program evaluation details both the student's progress and the degree requirements yet to be met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Examinations</head><p>All students are required to take final examinations. Final examinations are scheduled during the last week of each semester. In the event of unusual circumstances, students may request to take an examination at an alternate time. Such requests must be presented to the instructor of the course and the dean of the college in which the course is taught. There is a fee for rescheduling of a final exam or if decided by the instructor and dean given an incomplete (See Special Fees).</p><p>Students may request to reschedule a final exam. Students should make their request to reschedule a final exam directly to the faculty teaching the course. The faculty can choose to reschedule the exam to another day or time within final exam week, or may choose to assign an incomplete. In the case of an incomplete, the exam must be made up within 120 days after final grades are submitted. The dean will determine whether or not the final exam reschedule fee should be waived for the cause of a family emergency. Appeal of the faculty decision on reschedule of a final exam should be made to the appropriate dean. A student who has three or more final examinations on the same day can change a final exam to an alternate time without cost. It is recommended that the middle final exam be changed. This is handled through the instructor of the course and the office of the dean in whose college the course resides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance</head><p>Every course taught at Southwest Baptist University shall have an attendance policy that is part of the course syllabus. To receive the most benefit from course work, the student is expected to attend all class sessions.</p><p>• If attendance is used as a part of the student's grade for the course, the syllabus shall contain an explanation of the rationale for the attendance component of the grade and the consequences of an absence. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reporting Absences</head><p>Students should first attempt to communicate directly with their instructors regarding class absences. The following procedures exist for the purpose of enabling students to obtain official documentation in cases where absences are due to illness, family emergency, or a University-sanctioned activity.</p><p>1. Illness. Upon the first day of return to class, the student is required to provide the instructor with written verification of illness by the director of health services or from a practicing doctor or nurse. In the event that a student is absent for three or more days, the student should contact the Office of Student Life <ref type="bibr">(417-328-1885)</ref>. The Office of Student Life will notify the Office of the Provost. The Office of the Provost will notify the appropriate faculty members. 2. Family emergency. A family emergency consists of a death in the family, a serious illness of a family member, a serious accident involving a family member, or some other family crisis. A student who finds it necessary to be away from campus and absent from class due to a family emergency should contact the Office of Student Life (417-328-1885) who will notify the Office of the Provost. The Office of the Provost will notify the appropriate faculty members. 3. University-sanctioned activity. The student is responsible for ensuring that the instructor is notified by the sponsor or coach regarding the activity. The instructor should be notified prior to the class absence, and the student is responsible for all make-up work prescribed by the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes of Enrollment</head><p>The time for enrollment in classes is limited to the first seven class days of each semester. International students and those students returning from active military duty may enroll in classes during the first two weeks of each semester. Classes may be added during the first two class days of the Winterfest term and four-week summer terms or during the first four class days of the eight-week summer term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawing from (Dropping) a Class</head><p>Students may, with the approval of the advisor, discontinue (drop) any class for which they are registered. To do so, students are to procure a Drop/Add a Class form from the Office of the Registrar or their advisor, secure the signature of their advisor and the instructor of the course they are dropping, as well as the last date of attendance, and return the form to the Office of the Registrar. The recorded drop date will be the last date of attendance. Discontinuing a course will affect students' records as follows. Students who officially withdraw from a course before the end of the tenth week of class meetings (before the end of 60% of class meetings for shorter terms) will receive a W (withdraw while passing) grade for the course. After the end of the tenth week of class meetings (after the end of 60% of class meetings for shorter terms), students who withdraw from a course they are failing will receive an F grade for the course. After the end of the tenth week of class meetings (after the end of 60% of class meetings for shorter terms), students who withdraw from a course they are passing will receive a W grade for the course. Discontinued attendance of a class without securing a drop form does not constitute an official drop and will result in students being charged for the course and receiving a grade of F. An incomplete (I) grade is given only if circumstances beyond the student's control prevent completion of required course work during the semester. If the work is not satisfactorily completed within 120 days, the Incomplete (I) converts to an F. Students dropping a course will be charged $75 per dropped class after the change of enrollment period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawing from School</head><p>If a student withdraws from school after the tenth week of classes, a W (withdraw while passing) grade will be assigned in all courses in which the student is passing the course as of the date of withdrawal, and an F grade will be assigned in all courses in which the student is failing as of the date of withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administrative Withdrawal</head><p>If a student misses four or more consecutive class periods in all of his or her classes without having notified the University, the following procedure will be followed:</p><p>1. The student will be summoned by the Vice President for Student Development or the Campus Director. 2. The student will be encouraged to attend class. 3. Failure of the student to attend classes may result in the student being administratively withdrawn from his or her class schedule. 4. If the student is administratively withdrawn, then he or she will no longer be allowed to live in the dorm. 5. If the last date of attendance is prior to the last day to drop without penalty, the student who is administratively withdrawn will be given W's in all courses. 6. If the last date of attendance is after the last day to drop without penalty, the student who is administratively withdrawn will be given W's in all courses that were being passed and F's in all courses that were being failed. 7. Any student who has been administratively withdrawn for two semesters will have to apply for special permission to be readmitted to Southwest Baptist University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standing</head><p>Students are encouraged to plan their course loads in order to complete approximately one-fourth of the graduation requirements each year. However, because the abilities and the rates of progress of students vary, the following categories are delineated for assisting students in developing a reasonable academic and extra-class load. Only degree-seeking undergraduate students will have their academic progress reviewed after every regular semester. 2. Students under a notice of probation, special guidance, academic difficulty, or academic review who improve their statuses due to their Winterfest or Summer grades will be notified by the Provost. 3. Academic Review is a classification that will be given to degree-seeking undergraduate students who have attempted fewer than 12 semester institutional hours and whose institutional cumulative GPA is less than 2.000. Once students have attempted 12 or more institutional hours they will be reviewed like all other students. Students on Academic Review may enroll in a normal load for the next semester. Special restrictions may be placed upon subsequent course loads, if the student's academic progress does not improve. 4. Credit hour restrictions may be waived under special circumstances as determined by the advisor and approved by the Provost. 5. Students must be in acceptable academic standing in order to represent SBU in extracurricular activities, they must achieve academic standings that are at or above the special guidance level for their class standing. Students on Probation or Dismissal are not allowed to participate in activities representing the University. 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog 6. Students who are not in good standing will receive notification from the Provost at the end of each semester.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeal Policy</head><p>In a case in which a student has a grievance regarding a final course grade, the student should first attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor. If the grade dispute is not resolved at this level, the student may initiate a formal written appeal with the following provisions and/or guidelines:</p><p>1. Only the final overall course grade may be appealed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>No one may substitute personal judgment for that of the instructor in regard to the quality of the student's work; therefore, evidence must be shown of any deviation from established procedure that adversely affects the student in the assignment of the letter grade for the course. Deviation from established procedure is defined as assignment of a grade on a basis other than the student's performance in the course, assignment of a grade to a student by more stringent or different standards from those that were applied to other students in the course, or the assignment of a grade that does not align with the grading scheme outlined in the syllabus. 3. The appeal must be initiated within six weeks of the start of the succeeding regular academic semester (fall or spring) from the end of the course that is being appealed. 4. Any grade appeal must be submitted in writing using the Grade Appeal form obtained from the Registrar's Office. 5. The formal appeal begins when the student presents the Grade Appeal form to the instructor for his/her signature. 6. The chain of appeal is: a. The student meets with the instructor to discuss the grade. If agreement cannot be made the course instructor should sign the grade appeal form for the student who will then submit the form to the department chair. b. The department chair/program director and dean shall collect information related to the grade appeal and meet separately with the instructor and the student. If the department chair/program director and dean are in agreement that the grade should be overturned for the reasons outlined above then the they should change the grade and submit the form to have the grade changed immediately to the Registrar. If the department chair/program director does not agree that the grade should be overturned then they should sign the form and give a copy to the student. c. If the student wishes to pursue the appeal further, they should submit the form to the Provost with a request for a full grade appeal panel.</p><p>The first two of the above stages should occur within 20 school days (days must occur within a regular semester, fall or spring) of the initiation of the appeal.</p><p>If the instructor of the course is the department chairperson or program director, the student may elect to initiate the formal appeal directly to the appropriate dean. In unusual cases in which the course is taught by the dean, the student may elect to submit the grade appeal to the Provost who will convene the Grade Appeal Panel.</p><p>Any request for a review by the Grade Appeal Panel should be made within 20 school days (within a regular semester) of the most recent appeal decision. This request is made by taking the Grade Appeal form to the Office of the Provost. The Provost will send the form and any related written statements to the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee. 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog 7. The Grade Appeal Panel is to consist of three faculty members selected at random from the current Academic Advisory Committee; however, faculty members from the department or college being affected are not to be members of the panel. If the grade appeal is for a graduate level course then a member of the graduate council will also serve on the Grade Appeal Panel in lieu of one member of the Academic Advisory Committee. The chairperson of the panel is to be selected at random from the panel chosen. The Grade Appeal Panel will meet in closed session after the formal hearing for further discussion as necessary. The Grade Appeal Panel will make its final recommendation to the Provost by simple majority secret ballot.</p><p>Both the instructor and the student should be prepared to appear before the Grade Appeal Panel to present their cases formally. Witnesses may be called to support any evidence presented. A faculty member from the department affected may be called to answer any procedural questions.</p><p>The instructor and the student will appear separately before the Grade Appeal Panel to present their cases formally. Additional parties attending the hearing will be limited to those who were witnesses to any pertinent events or can provide first-hand testimony of the essential facts of the case. In addition, a faculty member from the instructor's department may be called to answer any questions related to the standard operating procedures of that department. At the discretion of the chair, the panel may separately recall either the student or the instructor to clarify any discrepancies in their respective testimonies. In extenuating circumstances, as determined by the current chairperson of the Academic Advisory Committee, previous chairpersons of the Academic Advisory Committee may be called upon to serve on the Grade Appeal Panel.</p><p>Note: This is the highest level of appeal. No further appeal is possible. 8. The recommendation of the Grade Appeal Panel will be forwarded to the Provost for action, with the understanding that there will be no grade change without the explicit recommendation of the Grade Appeal Panel. If the grade is changed, the Provost will complete and sign the Change of Grade form, which will be sent directly to the Registrar. 9.

If a student's GPA drops below 3.25, they may continue participation in the Honors Program on a probationary basis.</p><p>The Dutile Honors Program offers two tracks for completing Honors Graduation requirements:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Traditional Honors Track</head><p>First time freshmen entering the university with fewer than 30 hours dual credit completed will complete the Traditional Honors curriculum. This track requires completion of all five Honors Core Courses as well as twelve additional hours from the Honors Elective Courses</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accelerated Honors Track</head><p>First time freshmen entering the university with 30 or more hours of dual credit completed will complete the Accelerated Honors curriculum, which includes the five Honors Core courses, as well as at least six additional hours from the Honors Elective Courses. Southwest Baptist University recognizes the need to allow exceptional students to design their own course of study when their academic or career goals do not fit into any existing major. It is the desire of the Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) program to allow a course of study that would enrich the student's educational experience, maximize their curricular options, correlate university disciplines and broaden their career aspirations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Core Courses</head><p>Each student in the IDS program becomes an active partner in the formulation of his or her program of study, working in consultation with the IDS coordinator and other sources to devise an appropriate individual degree plan. The IDS program allows the student to draw upon the resources of all colleges and departments at SBU to create a degree program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Description</head><p>Students interested in the IDS major must satisfy the criteria for the program and complete a formal application process. The student, with the assistance of the IDS Coordinator, will design a curriculum plan that includes courses from various academic disciplines along with a timetable for completion, a rationale for the proposed course of study, and method of assessment. The application which includes personal data and the student's curriculum plan must be approved by Deans Council for the student to be accepted into the IDS major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Goals</head><p>• To assist students in integrating appropriate disciplines in pursuit of their academic or career goals. • To help students achieve competency for career and academic preparations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Criteria</head><p>Students interested in applying for the IDS major must meet one of the following criteria:</p><p>1. Have a minimum ACT of 24 and have completed 32 college credit hours with a cumulative grade point average of 3.00, or 2. Have a minimum ACT of 21 and have completed 32 college credit hours with a cumulative grade point average of 3.30.</p><p>Continued enrollment in the program would require maintenance of a 3.00 grade point average. Students who fall below the minimum GPA will be placed on academic probation. If it is determined by the IDS coordinator, faculty advisor, or department chair that a student is not able to continue in the program, the student would have the option of completing a minor in Interdisciplinary Studies. A student may only be on academic probation for one semester before being dropped from the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formal Application Process</head><p>A student interested in the IDS major must meet with his or her faculty advisor to discuss the possibility of a major in Interdisciplinary Studies. If the student meets the enrollment criteria, the faculty advisor refers the student to the IDS Coordinator. If the student and IDS Coordinator agree that the IDS major is both feasible and beneficial for the student, the student will complete an application form and curriculum plan. The curriculum plan will outline the proposed course of study and timetable (semester by semester plan) as well as the rationale for combining the courses. The rationale will be a theoretical 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog justification for combining the disciplines, including specific goals for either a career path or graduate studies. The student will need to justify why a major currently offered at SBU will not satisfy his or her career aspirations. The curriculum plan must also explain how the student will be assessed. It can include the completion of a portfolio, internship, major field test or a combination of the three. After consultation with the IDS Coordinator and any necessary revisions made, the student will submit the typewritten application and curriculum plan to the IDS Coordinator for approval. Once the IDS Coordinator approves the application and curriculum plan, the documents will be sent to Deans Council and the Dean of the College with the highest number of hours in the proposal will present the proposal to Deans Council. The Deans Council must approve all IDS majors.</p><p>Once the Deans Council approves the proposed course of study, the IDS Coordinator will be assigned as the student's primary advisor. The student will also be assigned an advisor in the department of the major emphasis of the student's course of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposed Curriculum</head><p>The proposed curriculum of study would include a minimum of sixty (60) hours of course study combined in a minimum of two but no more than four areas of study. At least thirty (30) hours must be upper level hours (3000-4000 level courses). The proposed course of study cannot have more than fifty percent (50%) of the courses come from any one academic department.</p><p>The degree (B.A. or B.S.) designation would be determined by the focus of the program itself. Completion of the program would meet all other University graduation requirements set out in the University catalog including forty (40) hours of upper level (3000-4000 level) courses.</p><p>A minor in Interdisciplinary Studies is only available for approved IDS major candidates who fail to complete the major due to ineligibility or change of major. The minor requires twenty-one (21) credit hours with no more than twelve (12) hours to be completed from any one department.</p><p>Changes to programs of study must follow the existing academic proposal form process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Majors</head><p>Double majors including a Major in Interdisciplinary Studies are not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades</head><p>No grade below a "C" will count toward the major.</p></div>

The 46-hour Art Core is nearly identical for each art degree and will allow ease in moving from one degree to another within the department. The Art Core is designed to give students significant exposure to a wide variety of art mediums, and a solid visual arts foundation.</p><p>The Department of Art offers two course formats, lecture courses and studio courses. A course designed around the art studio and the production of art requires significant time and serious commitment by the individual student. Due to the nature of art coursework, the student will be expected to log additional unsupervised time in the studios. As a general rule, art programs throughout the U.S. expect every credit hour of studio coursework to represent three hours of work done in the art studio.</p><p>Art Lecture Courses: For a three-credit-hour lecture art course at SBU, the student meets in the classroom with the instructor for three hours per week and is expected to spend an additional six hours per week on assigned projects. It is imperative that each student plans this additional time into his or her schedule.</p><p>The following ART courses are classified as lecture format:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art Studio Courses:</head><p>For a three-credit-hour studio art course at SBU, the students are scheduled to work in the classroom or at other select locations on or off campus for as many as six hours per week and are expected to spend three additional hours working on their own in the studio for combined minimum of nine (9) hours of studio time per week. It is imperative that each student plans this additional independent time into his or her weekly schedule. It is not recommended for a student to enroll in more than two studio art courses in a single semester. The following ART courses are classified as studio format: All art majors are required to keep a portfolio of their best artwork for presentation in comprehensive solo exhibition. Artwork must be approved by the department during the student's senior year. The Department of Art reserves the right to retain examples of work from all studio courses for the permanent collection of Southwest Baptist University, and to use reproductions of student artwork for purposes of publication and advertising, etc.</p><p>Living during the most visual culture in world history, today's studio and commercial artists have a tremendous responsibility. Serious study of the visual arts provides a basis and avenue for effective corporate and personal expression. Visual art is a contextual language, both a by-product and a catalyst of culture. Well-trained, highly skilled artists have a unique opportunity to effectively engage the visual language in order to care for culture, promote healing in society, and to reflect the creative nature of the Triune God of the Bible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Art Major -B.S. Degree</head><p>The Bachelor of Science degree for the General Art Major is designed to give the serious art student a solid, broad based foundation in the visual arts and can be earned with the completion of the specified 46-hour Art Core. This major affords the student optimum flexibility and can be supplemented with an additional major or minor from another department. This degree is designed for the individual who senses a call to the vocation and ministry of the studio artist.</p><p>This degree is also intended for the student planning to pursue a graduate degree in the studio arts, such as the Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.). The M.F.A. is the terminal degree in studio art generally required to teach studio arts at the college level. Students hoping to pursue M.F.A. studies are strongly encouraged to add at least one optional 18-hour specified Studio Concentration to the 46-hour Art Core.</p></div>

All new students (freshmen and transfer students) pursuing a music degree are first admitted to the department as pre-music, pre-music education, or pre-church music majors. Upon a successful evaluation by the music faculty, normally at the conclusion of the student's second semester at SBU, these students may be formally admitted into a music degree program. In all departmental policies and procedures, the term "music major" is intended to include these pre-majors. Students must have completed, or be concurrently enrolled in MUS 2613 Theory III and MUS 2611 Sightsinging and Eartraining III in order to enroll in any upper-level music course except ensembles and applied music. Music courses taken prior to this formal admission are applicable to the completion of the music degree. All references to music majors in this catalog are applicable to pre-music, pre-music education, and pre-church music majors as well.</p><p>As an exit examination, music majors are required to take the Major Field Test in music at the scheduled time during their last two semesters of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applied Music Placement Tests</head><p>All entering freshmen and transfer students must take a classification test in piano and in their primary applied area.

Basic class is for non-music majors or minors with less than three years of previous study. Specific requirements in applied music are listed in the Music Handbook. Applied music lessons are available in voice, piano, organ and all wind, percussion, and string instruments.</p><p>Private applied music may be taken for one credit (thirteen 30-minute lessons) or two credits (thirteen 60-minute lessons). Applied music may be taken for zero credit if it is not a degree requirement. Five hours of practice per week is required per credit hour of enrollment. Majors and minors (except general music minors) must perform once per semester in a student recital on their primary applied instrument.</p><p>In addition to weekly lessons, music majors are required to participate in a minimum of three studio classes each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jury Examination</head><p>The final examination for private applied music courses will be conducted before a jury of faculty members which includes the student's instructor. Students will be responsible for all materials covered during the semester as well as fundamental techniques and knowledge pertinent to their performing medium. The faculty jury will evaluate student performance according to proficiency levels as described in the Music Handbook. The Handbook also describes the expected rate of progression through the various levels required by each degree program. For non-music majors or music majors studying in an area outside of their primary and secondary applied areas, a jury examination is required only for scholarship recipients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Requirement</head><p>The study in the secondary applied area is intended to establish functional skill on a practical level. Whenever possible a class approach is employed which allows the student two hours per week in directed study. Students with strong background in the secondary applied area may request private study. See Music Handbook for specific requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Piano Proficiency Examinations</head><p>All music majors and minors (except general music minors) must pass a piano proficiency examination demonstrating functional piano skill. Scales, vocalises, sightreading, harmonization of given melodies, transposition, and repertoire are included in the exam. Students must continue to enroll in Secondary Class Piano each semester until this requirement is met. The tests are given at the end of each semester and are normally taken at the end of the sophomore year. Any student who passes the Piano Proficiency Examination prior to the completion of four semesters of piano study must continue enrollment in piano or organ until the completion of 4 credits.</p><p>Piano proficiency examinations for keyboard majors will be held during juries at the end of each semester. See the Music Handbook for specific requirements. This course is graded on a pass/fail system, and requires the student to attend departmental recitals and concerts and certain community music programs. These programs are listed in the Department of Music calendar and are posted each week on the Casebolt Music Center bulletin boards. Minimum attendance requirements for a passing grade will be posted on the bulletin boards at the beginning of each semester.</p></div>

If the 20 slots are not filled during the first selection cycle, a late cycle pool will be considered during February of the 192 College of Science and Mathematics 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog academic year just prior to the selection cycle for the next academic year. If slots are not filled for any one academic year, they will not roll over or be extended.</p><p>The physical therapy department recommends the completion of one of the following undergraduate degrees: Biology, Exercise Science, or Psychology. Students should carefully plan their undergraduate experience such that most prerequisites are completed prior to their senior (or application) year. Students electing to take non-recommended degree paths should make those considerations for other specific purposes and with the knowledge that those elections may increase the duration of their undergraduate experience prior to entering the physical therapy program. If there are ever any questions about the most effective and efficient undergraduate path toward entering the graduate physical therapy program, please contact the program directly.</p><p>Eligibility for awarding the HSEA is established at the point of SBU undergraduate graduation and all normal requirements must be completed at the time of recognized graduation. Successful HSEA participants will receive a scholarship upon entering the professional phase of the physical therapy program subject to the following parameters and guidelines:</p><p>1. Students will receive credit for the scholarship by attending and documenting mentoring sessions on a semester basis during their undergraduate semesters (max 8 semesters). The scholarship amount will be earned at a rate of $375 per regular semester (Fall, Spring) enrolled at SBU in which student attends the mandatory mentoring sessions. 2. The total scholarship is awarded in 3 equal installments upon entry to the SBU physical therapy program (i.e. first year, second year, and third year in equal $1000 amounts resulting in a "discount" on the annual tuition). 3. The award is not distributed as a cash award. 4. If the student does not accept the HSEA enrollment into the SBU physical therapy program, the award becomes null and void. 5. If the student does not merit entry to the SBU physical therapy program under the established guidelines as a HSEA participant, the award becomes null and void. 6. A deferment of up to 2 calendar years after earning of a bachelor's degree from SBU may be granted upon request of the HSEA participant who otherwise meets established guidelines. The spirit of this provision is a variance given to HSEA participants who meet unexpected life events beyond their control. 7. Once enrolled in the professional phase of the program, the HSEA participant must meet established unconditional matriculation requirements or the remaining award distributions will be forfeited.</p></div>

The instructor will send at least one SBU email to the student requesting student's intent prior to initiating a course withdrawal. The student has the responsibility to respond promptly to the communication and include any questions or concerns to the instructor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Request:</head><p>In the event that a student decides to withdraw from an online course, the student must initiate communication about this intent. Whether seated or online, there are five individuals involved in the drop process: student, instructor, advisor, NCAA compliance office (for student athletes only), and the registrar. The steps are as follows:</p><p>1. The student is required to send one email to both his/her course instructor and academic advisor. 2. The instructor replies to all with the last date of attendance (and any other questions or information needed). 3. The academic advisor considers the student's situation (e.g., full or part time student status, degree progress), and replies all with permission or questions. When permission is granted, the advisor also includes the NCAA compliance officer (when applicable) and the registrar on the reply. 4. The NCAA compliance officer replies all with permission or questions. 5. When permission is granted by all parties (instructor, advisor, and NCAA compliance officer), then the registrar drops the course from the student's schedule and replies all with confirmation.</p><p>Please note that the email initiated may result in conversation that leads the student to stay in the course. For that reason, the registrar will not drop the course until there is agreement and reply from all required parties. If the withdrawal is before 60% of the class meetings, then a "W" will be issued by the registrar. If the withdrawal is after 60% of the class meetings, then a "W" (passing) or F (failing) will be issued. In this context the instructor must note in the email whether the learner is passing for failing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Last Date of Attendance</head><p>Last date of attendance will be reported when a student drops an online course. Attendance in an online course should reflect a substantive activity such as discussion board activity, submission of an assignment, or test taken, during a course login to count as "attendance." Just logging into the class does not count as attendance without activity of some type. To determine the last date of attendance, the due date for the last graded activity will be used. For example, if a student submits a post on 9/7 for a graded discussion board that is due by 9/8, then the last date of attendance is 9/8. This is to be determined by the instructor prior to the student dropping the course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment</head><p>Follow the guidelines set below.</p><p>• Non-SBU Student An individual not officially admitted to the University may view the courses available on the Online Independent Study web site and enroll directly through the Department of Online Learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• SBU Students</head><p>An SBU student may not enroll in more than two Online Independent Study courses at the same time. The Department of Online Learning must approve any exception to this policy. It is recommended that a student take only one course at a time until he/she has found an optimum work rate. OLIS hours do count in the load limit restrictions. If a student exceeds load limit restrictions, the University will require the student to reduce load hours. When and where applicable, the student will be subject to existing OLIS withdrawal and grading policies. o Graduate Students Prior to enrolling in any undergraduate OLIS course, an SBU graduate student (i.e., a student who has been officially admitted to a graduate program and is working on a degree) must obtain the approval of his or her academic advisor. An SBU student may not exceed the maximum credit load through enrolling in OLIS courses. o Undergraduate Students</p><p>Prior to enrolling in any OLIS course, an SBU student (i.e., a student who has been officially admitted to the University and is working on a degree), must obtain the approval of his or her academic advisor or campus director (for off campus students).</p><p>All credit is in semester hours and may be applied to the baccalaureate degree requirements (B.S., B.A., B.A.S., B.M., B.S.N.) and associate degree requirements (A.S., A.A.) provided the following stipulations are met:</p><p>1. Student Standing -An SBU student may enroll in OLIS provided his or her GPA has not resulted in any form of academic difficulty. 2. Time Limits -A minimum time of eight weeks is required for completion of a 3 credit hour OLIS course, six weeks for a 2 credit hour course, and four weeks for a 1 credit hour course. The University is not saying a course can be completed in a "minimum time"; the University is saying that a student must allow at least the minimum time (and preferably more) in which to complete the course. The maximum time allowed to complete the course, including completing examinations, is 4 months from the official date of enrollment. A one-time 2 month paid extension may be granted from the expiration of the course. OLIS must approve any exceptions to this policy. 3. Load Limitations -Students who have been placed on academic difficulty, special guidance, probation or have an account hold are not allowed to enroll in OLIS courses.</p><p>OLIS hours do count in the load limits restrictions as detailed in the University Catalog under "Load Limit for Credit Hours." If you exceed load limit restrictions, the University will require you to reduce load hours. When and where applicable, you will be subject to existing OLIS withdrawal and grading policies. If you have been placed on academic difficulty, special guidance, or probation you are not permitted to enroll in OLIS courses.</p><p>Load limits without special permission include all college courses, OLIS, correspondence or otherwise, being taken at SBU or elsewhere. Advisors will approve schedules with additional hours when the student's GPA range is one of the following: 4. Graduation Deadline -All SBU (OLIS) or other (outside) correspondence course work (including examinations) must be completed and submitted for grading in accordance with regulations printed in the University Calendar (also listed in this Catalog). If all correspondence work is not completed and submitted by the appropriate date, the student's name may be removed from the graduation list and program unless prior arrangements have been made by the student through the student's college dean. Since SBU offers only limited number of OLIS courses and does not offer a degree program through OLIS, the expectation is that only students taking regular classroom course work along with some correspondence would fit the criteria of degree seeking students through SBU.</p><p>All college credit courses listed at the SBU Online Independent Study website are approved for veterans and other eligible persons covered in the provisions of the G.I. Bill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System</head><p>A grade represents an evaluation of your academic performance in a course and is determined by examinations and other criteria. Course grades are defined as follows: "A", excellent; "B", above average; "C", average; "D", a minimum passing; and "F", failure. The "F" grade carries no credit. A "W" is assigned if you withdraw during the second through fourth month after enrollment.</p><p>An "NC" (non-completion) grade is assessed when there is no official withdrawal or course work is not completed by the end of the first enrollment or extension dates. Your instructor may use letter grades, numerical grades, or "S" (satisfactory) and "U" (unsatisfactory) to indicate the quality of work on your assignments. Consult your course syllabus for specific details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Points</head><p>Each semester hour of credit is valued in grade points as follows: A, four points; B, three points; C, two points; D, one point; F, no points. W and NC grades are not assigned quality points and are not considered in computing your grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Documentation</head><p>An enrollment beginning on or after January 1, or on or before May 31, will be considered a spring enrollment (SC).

An enrollment beginning on or after September 1, or on or before December 31, will be considered a fall enrollment (FC). Note: An OLIS enrollment begins immediately at the time of registration. There is no pre-registration in OLIS courses. Official OLIS begin and end dates may look different than what appears in the University administrative system. A final grade will be documented using the original enrollment period as defined above. The Registrar performs grade documentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Record and Transcript</head><p>The Department of Extended Learning maintains enrollment records. When a student completes all course assignments and examinations, the Department of Extended Learning will enter the student's final grade into the University's permanent student record system.

A student may officially withdraw from a course at any time during the first four months or six months if the course was extended. No grade will be recorded for a student requesting a refund during the first 30 days. The grade of "W" will be assigned to a student if he or she withdraws during the second through fourth month after enrollment. The "W" is recorded on the official SBU transcript but does not affect the grade point average. If a student does not complete all assignments and exams within his or her course enrollment period and does not request an extension, he or she will be withdrawn automatically and assigned an "NC". If a student withdraws from a course after 30 days from the date of enrollment, he or she will not receive a refund.</p></div>
