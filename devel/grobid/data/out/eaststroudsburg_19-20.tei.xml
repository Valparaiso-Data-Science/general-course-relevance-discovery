PA TRAC allows for a seamless statewide transfer and articulation system between Pennsylvania's 14 community colleges, four state-related universities, and the 14 universities in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Transfer of courses and academic program articulation occurs in the following three ways:</p><p>• 30-Credit Transfer Framework is a complement of a minimum of 30 credits of foundation courses that can be easily transferred to any of the participating institutions. The Framework includes courses in English, public speaking, mathematics, natural science, humanities and the behavioral and social sciences.</p><p>• Articulation Agreements with Community Colleges. View existing agreements at esu.edu/transfer.</p><p>• Statewide Program-to-Program Articulation allows students who graduate with specified associate degrees to transfer as juniors into bachelor degree programs in similar fields at a participating four-year institution. At ESU, the following degree programs are part of the Statewide Program-to-Program agreements: For additional information on PA TRAC, visit esu.edu/transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Student Transfer Policy</head><p>The Student Transfer Policy 1999-01A is designed to promote a seamless transfer process for students currently attending Pennsylvania community colleges, Lackawanna College and the universities in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.

If there is not an exact match, but the course transfers as an elective, the original course title will be retained. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Transfer of Credits</head><p>Transferable credits are officially added to a student's East Stroudsburg University record upon receipt and evaluation of the official final college transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Readmission Policy</head><p>The readmission application is designed for undergraduate students who were previously registered at ESU, and have been away from ESU for one or more regular academic terms.

East Stroudsburg University follows the Pennsylvania System of Higher Education Common Calendar (Board of Governor's Policy 2002-04). The standard semester -fall and spring -includes 16 weeks where 14 weeks are used for instruction, one week is assigned for final examinations each semester and once week used for non-teaching days in the fall semester and spring break in the spring semester. In the absence of a Common Calendar, ESU will follow the USDOE guidance that defines a semester as having 15 weeks inclusive of 1 week for final examinations.</p><p>The following standards are intended to specify the minimum contact time for the assignment of one (1) semester / credit hour. Some courses may exceed these minimum standards. Additional information regarding the Academic Credit Hour policy can be found online at www.esu.edu/about/administration/provost/policies/index.cfm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Type</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance</head><p>Each professor will determine a class attendance policy for each course. The professor must notify students of the class attendance policy at the start of the semester and may do so by posting attendance requirements on the course syllabus. A copy of the policy must be kept on file in the department office. Students are required to actively participate in their courses and professors are asked to confirm a student's class participation/attendance through the Course Roster Verification process. Class attendance may impact a student's course grade per the stated attendance policy.</p><p>Excused absences, including absences for participation in approved university events, will not result in a penalty, provided that the student makes up missed work as required by the professor. In case of an extended absence during a semester (e.g., health or medical issues, family concerns, etc.), the student or a designee is encouraged to notify the Registrar in the Student Enrollment Center who will notify the student's instructors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Catalog Policy</head><p>(As applicable for Academic <ref type="bibr">Programs/Majors/Minors)</ref> An undergraduate student is subject to the academic requirements and regulations contained in the catalog for their program in effect during the semester in which the student is first registered as a matriculated student. The only exceptions to this policy are stated below: 1. A student who first attends the university during the summer will be subject to the requirements and regulations in effect for the following academic year.</p><p>2. A student who declares or changes a major or other academic program (minor, concentration) after matriculation is subject to the program requirements as outlined in the catalog in effect at the time of declaration or program change.</p><p>3. A student may choose to follow all regulations and academic program requirements in effect in the current catalog. It is the student's responsibility to meet with their adviser to discuss the requirements and the adviser will notify the Student Enrollment Center to complete the change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>A student who discontinues attendance for one or more consecutive semesters (fall/spring or spring/fall) will be subject to the regulations and program requirements in effect when the student is readmitted to the university. This includes students who are dismissed from the university for academic or disciplinary reasons.</p><p>5. Some programs are subject to requirements that originate with legal and governing authorities outside the university (for example, requirements for teacher and other professional certifications). Such requirements are sometimes subject to change for all participants on a specific date and do not lend themselves to implementation by catalog year.</p><p>6. Some academic departments place time restrictions on the completion of major courses and/or major requirements. Such restrictions are clearly articulated in the university catalog and take priority over this policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Regulations</head><p>Please note: Occasionally the university will adopt or revise a regulation (other than an academic program requirement) that cannot equitably or administratively be implemented by catalog year. In those cases all students shall be advised of the change at least one full semester in advance and through several venues before the change goes into effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Changes</head><p>A student may change curriculum or field of study of specialization only with the approval of the chair of the department the student wishes to enter. Change notifications are also sent to the chair of the student's prior program. The student's grade point average and the reasons for change will be assessed by the chair of the department into which the student is transferring.</p><p>Changes in program should be requested only after careful counseling and planning. All such changes can be made by going into the MyESU Portal and clicking on the eWarrior tab. Students will see information to change their undergraduate program of study/curriculum. Changes to major/minors/ concentrations mean that the student is to follow the catalog requirements for that program based on the year of change. It is recommended that students request a program change before applying for graduation if applicable.</p><p>Specific professional programs, such as nursing and medical technology, are limited in the number of students who can be accommodated. Students planning to enter these fields should contact the appropriate department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undeclared Major Status</head><p>New freshman and transfer students with less than 60 earned credits may apply and be admitted to East Stroudsburg University without selecting an academic major. Transfer students with 60 or more earned credits must select an academic major for admission to East Stroudsburg University. All students must declare an academic major upon or before the successful completion of 60 credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration for Semesters/Sessions</head><p>Registration is the method of ensuring continuous matriculation in an academic program. Students register for courses each semester for a subsequent semester. That is, registration for fall takes place in April, registration for winter and spring sessions takes place in October, and registration for summer sessions takes place in January. A student's course schedule is regarded as a contract and determines official enrollment. A full-time undergraduate student credit load for a regular semester is 12-18 credits. Special permission is needed for students registering for more than 18 credits. Additional tuition charges will apply.</p><p>Registration in non-classroom courses such as Individualized Instruction, Independent Study and Internships is initiated by the student by completing a Non-Classroom Card Request. Students should work with their academic department and college to secure approving signatures. Approved requests are added to the student's schedule by the Registrar in the Student Enrollment Center.</p></div>

Academic related activity include but are not limited to the following:</p><p>• Physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students.</p><p>• Submitting an academic assignment.</p><p>• Taking an exam, completing an interactive tutorial, or participating in computer assisted instruction.</p><p>• Attending a study group that is assigned by the school.</p><p>• Participating in an online discussion about academic matters.</p><p>• Initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the academic subject studied in the course.</p><p>An undergraduate student, majoring in a program that has an accelerated pathway with a corresponding graduate program (see the list above), and who meets the requirements for participating in an accelerated pathway may have the opportunity to take graduate level courses, which will count both toward the completion of the undergraduate degree and graduate degree. Each academic department determines the number of graduate credits that can be taken. Please check the specific program in the undergraduate catalog for the amount of graduate credits that can be taken to count towards both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Students are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors before electing to participate in the accelerated pathway.</p><p>In order to qualify to participate in an accelerated pathway, the student must have attained at least junior standing and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 before taking graduate courses in the intended graduate program. If the intended graduate program requires a higher GPA, the student must meet the higher GPA before taking graduate courses. Each accelerated pathway option has specific requirements. Please check the specific program in the undergraduate catalog for those specific requirements.</p><p>A student must have obtained a grade of "B" or higher in the graduate course in order for it to count towards the graduate degree program, while a grade of "C" or higher is necessary in order for it to count towards the undergraduate degree program.</p><p>A student doing an accelerated pathway may be provisionally accepted into the respective graduate program and formally admitted upon completion of his/her undergraduate degree so long as all the other program admission requirements have been met (see complete graduate degree program admission requirements in the graduate catalog).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Students Taking Graduate Courses</head><p>ESU undergraduate students may take a maximum of six graduate credits during their senior year if the following criteria are met:</p><p>1. Satisfaction of the grade point requirements for admission with full graduate standing, i.e. 3.000 GPA in the major and 2.5000 GPA overall (may be higher for some majors);</p><p>2. Verification of senior class status (completion of 90 credits);</p><p>3. Approval by the appropriate faculty member teaching the class;</p><p>4. Approval of the dean of the Graduate College. This must be submitted to the Student Enrollment Center.</p><p>All appropriate signatures must be secured prior to registering. Graduate credit that is used to satisfy graduation requirements for the bachelor's degree cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of a master's degree at ESU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades</head><p>Grades are the method of assessing student progress. Students are issued grades at mid-semester and a final grade at the end of the semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Reports</head><p>Student grade reports are available at mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Only the semester grades are entered on the student's permanent records <ref type="bibr">(transcript)</ref>. Semester grade reports are available through the student portal myESU. Specific information about access to the student portal is mailed to each student upon his or her initial enrollment at East Stroudsburg University.</p><p>It is the responsibility of each student to check grade reports at midsemester and at the end of the semester. Students are expected to check grade reports as they are available to be aware of academic performance in each course, to register for courses for the next semester, and to address issues related to course grades immediately. Grade reports are an important tool for assessing academic progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Point System</head><p>In addition to meeting course and credit requirements for graduation, students must maintain a specified academic level throughout a given curriculum as measured by quality points. The minimum number of quality points required for graduation is twice the number of credits attempted. Pass/fail courses are not used in the computation of the quality point average. Work completed at other colleges and accepted as transfer credit is not considered in computing the quality point average. The required quality point average for graduation is 2.00 or higher. Some degree programs require a higher cumulative quality point average.</p><p>Each credit grade is calculated as follows:</p><p>A 4.0 quality points A-3.667 quality points B+ 3.333 quality points B</p><p>3.0 quality points B-2.667 quality points C+ 2.333 quality points C 2.0 quality points C-1.667 quality points D 1.0 quality points E 0 quality points</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculating Grade Point Average</head><p>Calculating of grade point average is done using the steps below.</p><p>1. Grade symbols are translated into quality points per credit as listed above.</p><p>2. The university recognizes that a good grade in a three-semester-hour course requires more work than in a two-semester-hour course. Owing to this, the university follows a system which recognizes both the quality and quantity of a student's work. Under this system, the number of quality points for each letter grade (e.g. four points for an A) is multiplied by the number of semester hours of credit for the course. For example, an A in a three-semester-hour course earns a total of 12 quality points. To find out a student's quality point average, divide the total number of quality points by the total number of semester hours scheduled. This average considers both the quality and quantity of work.</p><p>3. Quality points are awarded only for work completed at East Stroudsburg University. Work completed at other colleges and accepted as transfer credit is not considered in computing the quality point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incompletes</head><p>The maximum time for completing course requirements to remove incomplete grades is one year from the end of the session in which the "I" grade was assigned. After that time, the "I" grade will automatically be converted by the Registrar to an "E," "F," or "U," based on the grade mode for the course. The student can then only earn credits for the course by registering for it again in another semester.</p><p>If a student applies for graduation in a session before the one-year period has expired, the course requirements must be completed by the end of that session, or the "I" grade will be converted by the Registrar to an "E," "F," or "U" based on the grade mode for the course.</p><p>Students who cannot complete the required coursework during the specified time period should notify the faculty member as soon as possible.</p><p>A faculty member who chooses to deviate from this policy will require the student to sign a contract specifying conditions necessary for course completion, which may include a time period for completion of less than one year or other conditions. The faculty member will also notify the Registrar of any changes to the completion date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat Grades</head><p>Undergraduate students will be limited to a maximum total of six repeats during their enrollment at East Stroudsburg University. This is an individual course count (not credit). Students cannot repeat more than six courses.</p><p>A single course can only be taken a maximum of three times. That is, the course should appear no more than three times on a transcript. The most recent grade, regardless of whether it is higher or lower, will be the grade used for the GPA calculation. All other grades earned for repeated courses will be marked as such on the student's academic transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developmental Education Courses</head><p>The Course Repeat Policy limit will not apply to Developmental Education courses such as MATH 090 and ENGL 090. However, the most recent grade will be the grade used for assessing academic progress for both the semester and overall calculations. Credits earned will count toward Class Standing (Classification Level). Credits and grades will appear on transcript but credits will not count toward the minimum number of credits required for graduation.</p><p>When students submit their "Intent to Graduate" by the established application priority deadline dates based on their completion semester, their academic record will be put through a graduation clearance process. This process requires a thorough review of the student's academic record with the collaboration of their respective department, college dean and the Graduation Services team. This process is used to certify that students will meet their degree requirements by their intended graduation date. An audit of the student's degree is performed twice during the graduation clearance process -after the "Intent to Graduate" has been declared and when all coursework is completed at the end of the semester or term. Correspondence will be sent to all students who have submitted their "Intent to Graduate" request after their degree audit has been reviewed to notify students of their graduation status. If a student has met all the graduation requirements at ESU including the credit minimum (See Graduation Residency policy), the student will be notified and the degree or certificate will be conferred by the Graduation Services team. Degrees are conferred at the end of the fall, winter, spring and summer terms during the following months: December, January, May and August respectively.</p><p>Once a degree has been conferred, the academic record is final and sealed. Changes to enrollment, courses, grades and program of study associated with the degree conferral are not permitted to the academic record of a graduate. Students who do not meet their degree requirements for the semester/term they had intended upon graduating must declare another "Intent to Graduate" and create a revised plan to complete their degree requirements in a subsequent semester or term. The official degree conferral/graduation date is posted on the student's permanent record (transcript) as the semester/term when all degree requirements have been completed and confirmed by the Registrar or the designee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Commencement</head><p>East Stroudsburg University currently holds commencement ceremonies at the end of the fall and spring semesters to recognize graduates for their academic success at the institution. Students who have officially indicated their "Intent to Graduate", registered for all remaining required coursework, or are in progress of making up incomplete ("I") grades, may be eligible to participate in the commencement exercises.</p><p>• To be eligible to participate in the December commencement ceremony, students must complete or be on track to complete their degree requirements by the end of the summer, fall or winter terms.</p><p>• To be eligible to participate in the May commencement, students must complete or be on track to complete their degree requirements by the end of the spring term. Students who will complete an established internship and/or required coursework in the summer must be registered for summer before being considered eligible to participate in a May commencement ceremony. Participating in the commencement ceremonies does not signify the completion of a student's degree program. The outcome of the final graduation clearance will determine if a student has met all university and program requirements to be considered a graduate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Honors</head><p>In order to qualify for graduation honors, a student must have completed at least 45 credits at East Stroudsburg University. These 45 credits can be accrued through any course, internship and/or field placement including student teaching in which a letter grade is assigned (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D or E) or a satisfactory grade is ascribed. The check for the 45-credit minimum includes in-progress courses during the student's graduation semester. The check for the student's cumulative grade point average is based on all graded coursework.</p><p>Students who have the appropriate cumulative grade point average at the time the honors designation is determined, and who will have met the 45credit minimum once the final semester is completed, will be granted graduation honors as follows:</p><p>Summa Cum Laude Cumulative grade point average 3.80 or above</p></div>

A domicile is the place where one intends to and does, in fact, permanently reside. Because this decision is an administrative determination, documentary evidence must be submitted to the Student Enrollment Center for consideration.</p><p>Students who believe that they are qualified for in-state residency and those who would like to be made aware of the determining factors should contact the Student Enrollment Center. Each case will be decided on the basis of all facts submitted If the student is not satisfied with the decision made by the university in response to the challenge, the student may make a written appeal to the Office of the Chancellor, State System of Higher Federal regulations require Title IV financial aid funds to be awarded under the assumption that a student will attend the institution for the entire period in which federal assistance was awarded. When a student withdraws from all courses for any reason, including medical withdrawals, he/she may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that he/she was originally scheduled to receive. The return of funds is based upon the premise that students earn their financial aid in proportion to the amount of time in which they are enrolled. A pro-rated schedule is used to determine the amount of federal student aid funds he/she will have earned at the time of the withdrawal. Thus, a student who withdraws in the second week of classes has earned less of his/her financial aid than a student who withdraws in the seventh week. Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid, and will not be required to return any funds.</p><p>Federal law requires schools to calculate how much federal financial aid a student has earned if that student completely withdraws, stops attending before completing the semester, or does not complete all sessions or parts of term (i.e. courses which are not scheduled for the entire semester or payment period for which he/she has registered at the time those sessions/parts of term began).</p><p>Based on this calculation, East Stroudsburg University students who receive federal financial aid and do not complete their classes during a semester or term, could be responsible for repaying a portion of the aid they received. Students who do not begin attendance must repay all financial aid disbursed for the term.</p><p>Returns are allocated in the following order:</p><p>• Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans Fees 28| East Stroudsburg University 2019-2020 Undergraduate Catalog Students who receive federal financial aid must "earn" the aid they receive by staying enrolled in classes. The amount of federal financial aid assistance the student earns is on a pro-rated basis. Students who withdraw or do not complete all registered classes during the semester may be required to return some of the financial aid they were awarded.</p><p>Institutions are required to determine the percentage of Title IV aid "earned" by the student, and to return the unearned portion to the appropriate aid programs. Regulations require schools to perform calculations within 30 days from the date the school determines a student's complete withdrawal. The school must return the funds within 45 days of the calculation. The Return of Title IV aid calculation process and return of funds is completed by the Office of Student Financial Aid.</p><p>For example, if a student completes 30 percent of the payment period, they earn 30 percent of the aid they were originally scheduled to receive. This means that 70 percent of the scheduled award remain "unearned" and must be returned to the federal government. Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid and will not be required to return any federal funds.</p><p>If you have been a recipient of a Federal Student Loan you must complete the exit counseling at www.studentloans.gov.

Federal financial aid includes <ref type="bibr">Federal PELL grant, Federal SEOG, Federal Work Study, Federal Direct Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized)</ref>, Federal Direct PLUS loan, and Federal Graduate PLUS loan.</p><p>The Standards of Federal Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) include Grade Point Average, percentage of cumulative credits earned, and a maximum time frame measurement. If one of the measures is not being met, the student is not making SAP and thus become ineligible for federal financial aid. All periods of enrollment are included whether or not the student received federal financial aid during that time.</p><p>SAP will be measured yearly at the end of the spring semester. Winter enrollment will be counted in your spring calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Students</head><p>A student must meet all of the following requirements in order to be making satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for federal financial aid. ESU measures SAP annually at the end of the spring semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Standard: Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)</head><p>• ESU looks at the cumulative GPA that is considered to be in good academic standing. A 2.0 CGPA is required to maintain federal aid eligibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Standard: Pass Rate</head><p>The Pass Rate is determined by the percentage of total attempted credits that were successfully earned.</p><p>• Students must successfully earn a minimum of 66.67% of the attempted credits.</p><p>• Pass Rate is calculated by dividing the cumulative credit hours earned by the total credits attempted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximum Time Frame:</head><p>• Undergraduate students are limited to a total of 180 attempted credits towards their first undergraduate degree for financial purposes. This is 150% of total credit hours required to complete an Undergraduate Degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Completion</head><p>Once the student completes all the academic requirements for his or her program, the student is considered to have completed the degree program and is no longer eligible for further federal aid for that program.</p><p>Students who fail to meet satisfactory progress at the end of each academic year shall lose federal financial aid eligibility. If the student resumes satisfactory academic progress, the student shall regain federal financial aid eligibility as long as she/he maintains satisfactory academic progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid| 31</head><p>Federal Financial Aid Appeal Process</p><p>• If, at the end of each academic year, a student is still not meeting SAP requirements, the student may submit an appeal based on extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances are personal illness or injury, a death of a close relative, or other special circumstances. The written appeal can be completed on the myESU portal and must outline the reasons that satisfactory progress was not met, what has changed that will allow the minimum standards to be met and how the student plans to improve his/her academic progress (i.e. academic plan).</p><p>• If the appeal is approved by Satisfactory Academic Progress Committee, the student regains federal financial aid eligibility as long as she/he maintains satisfactory academic progress.</p><p>• If it is determined the student will require more than one payment period to achieve SAP standards, the student will continue to be on financial aid probation with an academic plan. The academic plan will be developed collaboratively with the student, the Academic Adviser or DAEL Adviser, and the Office of Student Financial Aid. The student's progress will be monitored at the end of each subsequent payment period by all offices to determine if the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan. If the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan, the student will be eligible to receive federal aid as long as the student continues to meet the requirements and is reviewed according to the requirements specified in the plan.</p><p>• If the appeal is denied, the student will not be eligible for federal financial aid until s/he is meeting satisfactory academic progress standards.</p></div>

It is highly recommended that students gather this important information and submit it to avoid postponements in class schedules.</p><p>The university has partnered with Lehigh Valley Hospital Network-Pocono which is part of the Lehigh Valley Health Network to provide student health services at a convenient location adjacent to campus. The services are provided as part of the student comprehensive health fee and can be accessed through a swipe of a student's E-card. Basic services include medical evaluation; treatment for minor illnesses and injuries; referrals to off-campus health care specialists and support services; women's health services; tuberculosis testing; physical examinations for employment, driver's licenses and teacher certification; testing, treatment and education for sexual health concerns; and health education and information about illnesses. Chronic conditions or major health issues are referred to the student's personal physician or to a local specialist. Serious accidents and injuries are referred to the LVHN-Pocono Emergency Room. In cases where referral is necessary to either the student's physician, a specialist, the hospital emergency room or other medical facility, the costs incurred must be borne by the student. Fees for any medical treatment not provided in the center or diagnostic testing, such as lab tests, X-rays, etc. are also the responsibility of the student.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Numbers</head><p>Course descriptions are arranged by departments or by program. The course numbers are used to indicate the year in which courses are usually taken by students and/or the minimum number of prerequisite course(s) the student ought to have completed to gain admission in to the course. The student should read the catalog description of each course for more detailed information regarding the prerequisite(s) for that course. In cases where students have not completed the prerequisites for a particular course, they may request a waiver of the prerequisites from the course instructor.</p><p>Note: Students who transfer courses to the university that do not have an exact ESU course equivalent will have these transfer courses recorded on their permanent record (transcript) to either satisfy a general education requirement or a department elective. No course descriptions will appear in this catalog for each of these courses. However, these cases will meet a degree requirement in the following ways:</p><p>• Course Code 199: General Education elective (no exact match), suitable for General Education requirement in specified ESU academic department.</p><p>• Course Code 299: Departmental elective (no exact match), ESU academic department decides how the course applies toward the major.</p><p>• Course Code ELEC 299: Course that does not fit either General Education or major requirements, credit will transfer as an elective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Credit</head><p>Course credit is measured in credits. A credit represents academic work equivalent to one hour per week in class plus two hours per week of outside studying for a semester. Class periods at East Stroudsburg are generally 50 minutes in length and are regarded as class hours. A semester is 15 calendar weeks. A credit is also equivalent to 15 weeks of full-time study whether in class or outside of class. In some courses two hours of laboratory per week for a semester earns one credit, while in other courses three hours of laboratory or fieldwork per week for a semester earns one credit. For example, CHEM 353 Physical Chemistry (4) is a course in Chemistry which earns four credits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Rehabilitative Services</head><p>The conceptual framework of the teacher education program focuses on the decision-making processes of teaching and learning. The college provides programs that lead to eligibility for certification in a number of degree areas (see degree program list). Graduates of certification preparation programs receive the degree of bachelor of science or bachelor of arts and are eligible to apply for certification to teach in the schools of Pennsylvania. Students are encouraged to earn certification in several fields to enhance their employment opportunities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Teacher Certification</head><p>The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) is the certifying agent for all teacher preparation programs in the Commonwealth. All teacher preparation programs offered through East Stroudsburg University are approved by PDE to prepare teachers for certification in their respective fields. All teacher education candidates should be in frequent consultation with their academic advisors to ensure that they are meeting the appropriate program and certification requirements, which vary by program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection for the Teaching Profession</head><p>The nature and importance of teaching requires that students who seek to enter the profession must possess unimpeachable character, above average academic ability, and dispositions suitable for working with children and young adults. The teacher education faculty perceive their ultimate obligations to be to the students who will be taught by their graduates. Consequently, the student's admission to teacher candidacy and to student teaching and final institutional recommendations for a teaching certificate are not achieved solely by meeting routine academic requirements. As the student in each of these steps progresses toward final certification, the faculty of the student's certification area exercise their professional judgment as to each student's competency for the teaching profession.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission into Teacher Education Program</head><p>All education majors seeking certification must successfully complete teacher education program admission, monitoring, and exit criteria procedures. Formal admission into the Teacher Education Program generally occurs when candidates earn between 48 and 60 credits. To be formally admitted into the Teacher Education Program, candidates must meet the following criteria: Students are then admitted to candidacy in the teacher education program and are permitted to take upper level major courses. A 2.8 -4.0 QPA is required for Pennsylvania teacher certification.</p><p>The student's progress and mastery of competencies will be monitored while completing requirements in the program. All students are required to maintain a cumulative and major average as specified by Pennsylvania law and the respective departments, to remain in the program and to take teacher education classes. Only qualified teacher education majors are allowed to take teacher education classes.</p><p>Each department will provide each student a copy of its program requirements, course checklist, and expectations. Students must satisfy all program requirements to be recommended for the degree and teacher certification, including a 2.8 -4.0 QPA. Certification test passing scores are set by the Commonwealth using a sliding scale. As such, the lower a candidate's QPA, the higher they must score to pass. No candidate graduating with a QPA less than 2.8 will be certified in Pennsylvania. Candidates are responsible to ensure their final, overall QPA qualifies for certification in the Commonwealth before applying for graduation.</p><p>All applicants for teacher certification must be endorsed by the faculty adviser, the department, and the dean of the College of Education, who serves as the certifying officer for the university.</p><p>Experienced non-degree teachers, graduates of other colleges or universities, or others who need special assignments in student teaching will have their individual alternative programs planned and approved by the appropriate department and by the dean of the College of Education. Transfer students' transcripts will be individually evaluated by the department chair to determine equivalent courses to be accepted.</p><p>The Pennsylvania Department of Education requires that all certification applicants satisfactorily pass the appropriate sections of the ETS Praxis or Pennsylvania Educators Certification Tests. Students must also complete the teacher certification application and respond to immigration, criminal record, child abuse, and health statements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Student Teaching Field Experiences</head><p>The importance of providing opportunities for education students to observe and work directly with children in schools before student teaching is recognized. To make this possible, the director of the Office of Field Experiences and Partnerships works with departments to secure quality sites for students to engage in field experiences. Field experiences are required in association with most education courses. Prior to being placed in their first field experience, students must submit a negative test for tuberculosis form and clearances for Act 34, FBI and Act 151 (and other clearances as required by PDE and/or each school district).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Approval to Student Teach</head><p>The Office of Field Experiences and Partnerships coordinates student teaching assignments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Teaching</head><p>Student teaching is the culminating experience in a series of planned laboratory and field experiences. Student teachers spend a full semester off campus in a regular classroom under the guidance and direction of a fully certified, master teacher.</p><p>The university provides each student with the additional support of a university faculty member with a background in supervision and instruction. Student teaching is planned to provide an opportunity for continued professional growth in the application of theory, methods, and subject content. Students are placed in school districts with which the university has an executed affiliation agreement or articulation contract.</p><p>All student teaching arrangements are made through the Office of Field Experiences and Partnerships. It is inappropriate for students to make their own student teaching arrangements.</p><p>Student teachers are expected to comply with the following list of requirements:</p><p>1. Establishing personal transportation to and from the assigned school district.</p><p>2. Adhere to school district policies, procedures, ethics codes, schedules, and dress codes.</p><p>3. Purchase Student P.S.E.A. Liability Insurance.</p><p>4. Continue to hold current required clearances.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Faculty of Human Performance</head><p>The Pre-Professional Rehabilitation Sciences program is intended to prepare students for entry into professional programs in related rehabilitation sciences areas. This degree will prepare graduates for advanced training and education in rehabilitation health sciences and professional health programs including Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physician Assistant and Chiropractic. Graduates will also be ready to enter the rehabilitation and broader healthcare work force in entry level and pre-professional areas upon completion of the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the Professional Practice Program</head><p>Join us in the exhilarating, fast-paced Athletic Training major that is specifically designed to prepare proficient and successful entry-level, certified athletic trainers. The Athletic Trainer is a health care professional who collaborates with physicians and other health care professionals to optimize activity and participation of athletes, patients and clients. Athletic Training encompasses the prevention, diagnosis and intervention of emergency, acute, and chronic medical conditions involving the impairment, functional limitations, and disabilities.</p><p>At its inception in 1975, the Athletic Training Program was one of the few co-educational programs amid the first 25 approved curricula in the nation. Now the program is nationally accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Athletic Training Education (CaATe) and uses a competency-based approach in both classroom and clinical settings designed to teach entry-level athletic training skills. Student knowledge, skill, and professional behaviors are developed with an emphasis on clinical reasoning throughout clinical proficiencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Where Are Professional Practice Program Graduates Now?</head><p>Alumni regularly pursue advanced and related professional degrees at little or no cost through graduate assistantships. Alumni have received national recognition for their work and have become leaders in research, education and clinical practice. Many alumni serve in secondary schools, colleges and universities, sports medicine clinics and professional sports. Here are a few of the settings our alumni have chosen: public/private high schools, military service, college/university athletics, sports medicine/physical therapy clinics, corporate fitness, strength and conditioning/performance enhancement facilities, professional sports teams, U.S. Olympic Centers, hospitals, and even NASA.</p><p>Are You Interested In the Professional Practice Program ...</p><p>• Preventing, recognizing and treating sports injuries?</p><p>• Working with athletes and other physically active people?</p><p>• Learning things "hands-on" and solving "real-life" problems? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>Students transfer to our program from a variety of community colleges and other universities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission of Freshmen and Transfers</head><p>Freshmen and Transfers students are admitted to ESU in the Pre-Professional Athletic Training Major. Students are assessed after the preprofessional courses are completed to assure they meet the requirements for the professional phase of the ATEP at East Stroudsburg University contingent on meeting the Standards for Progression. A profile of the typical student who is successful in the professional phase of the major and ESU and who is successful in becoming a certified athletic trainer would include SAT scores of 1000 or above, a class rank in the top one third, an outgoing personality, a solid work ethic, good "people" skills, and a sincere interest in sports and in athletes.</p><p>The Pre-Professional phase represents a time (generally three semesters) during which the student addresses the prerequisites to the Professional Phase <ref type="bibr">(ATEP 100,</ref><ref type="bibr">202,</ref><ref type="bibr">230,</ref><ref type="bibr">235,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 285)</ref>.</p><p>Transfers: Applicants with a 2.5 quality point average will be considered for admission. Transfer students must complete all prerequisite coursework and satisfactorily complete all other prerequisites for admission to the Professional Phase of the program. Transfers should schedule an interview with the Director of the ATP as soon as possible after receiving notification of admission to the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formal admission into the Professional Phase of the Athletic Training</head><p>Program is contingent upon the Pre-Professional student meeting the standards listed below and completing the following prerequisites.</p></div>

Students can choose between two concentrations.</p><p>• General concentration: The General concentration provides a broad background in all four areas along with a few courses that examine areas of interest to the student. Typically, this concentration is chosen in coordination with a major in a related field.</p><p>• Secondary Education concentration: The Secondary Education concentration mirrors the general concentration but also includes additional courses in education. A graduate of this program will be eligible for Pennsylvania teacher certification in earth and space science for grades 7-12 (dependent on grade point average and qualifying score on teacher examination).</p><p>Students interested in a career in one of the Earth and Space Sciences are encouraged to pursue the Bachelor of Science in Physics with the Earth and Space Science concentration, which provides a strong base for future study in one or more of the Earth and Space Sciences (i.e., Astronomy, Geology, Meteorology and Oceanography).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Philosophy</head><p>The greatest focus of ROTC is on all cadets successfully completing their academic degree, competing in athletics and participating in student activities while continually developing as future leaders. Army ROTC leverages the education, values and principles of service in all students attending ESU reinforced with the best leadership development instruction in the nation. This unique combination produces leaders prepared and motivated to complete their officer training and lead elements of the most powerful Army in the world or be leaders in the civilian community.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership Development</head><p>Army ROTC develops confident leaders who will succeed in any endeavor. Army ROTC leadership training means spending time outside of the classroom, sometimes way outside of the classroom. You may find yourself leading your fellow classmates on a tactical training exercise, parachuting from a military aircraft, training with a foreign military organization, or serving as a staff officer at an Army installation.</p><p>Students regularly conduct briefings to university staff, mentor fellow students in military and civilian subjects and develop plans and training for the ROTC Battalion. Junior and senior students also have the opportunity to conduct military-sponsored internships related to their major as well as training with industry. Army ROTC also supports service learning and community support leadership.</p></div>

Army ROTC can be a college leadership program that allows you to gain valuable leadership skills and earn up to 15 elective credits toward your GPA and graduation.</p><p>You can be as involved in Army ROTC as you want to be. You may choose to take a one-hour leadership class each week or you may choose to add the military fitness class, add leadership labs or get involved in one of the Army ROTC clubs or special teams.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Description</head><p>East Stroudsburg University offers students the opportunity to participate in Army ROTC through a partnership with the Northeast Pennsylvania (NEPA) Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Battalion. The primary objective of the Army ROTC program is to offer exceptional Leadership Development Training that will serve its students in every aspect of their career, both in the military and civilian positions. The commissioning track program prepares the student to serve as an officer in either:</p><p>• Active Army • U.S. Army Reserves</p><p>• Pennsylvania (or other state) Army National Guard Whichever component you choose to serve in, there are more than 20 different specialty fields and career paths to choose from. With as little as seven hours a week you can earn as many as 21 elective credits in this extensive Leadership Development Program that concentrates on developing leaders through the demonstration and hands on practice of the seven Army Values and 16 Key Leadership Dimensions. Through this program each student will learn to lead by using a crawl, walk, and run hands-on progressions. They will plan, communicate, organize, and execute events such as marksmanship training, small unit tactics, land navigation, rappelling, paint ball, obstacle and confidence courses, and many other practical hands-on training opportunities.</p><p>The NEPA Army ROTC Battalion continually ranks in the top 10 percent of all ROTC programs nationwide and was ranked third in the Eastern United States in 2006. The NEPA Battalion has recently celebrated 50 years of commissioning officers for the Army.</p><p>The Army ROTC program can be tailored to fit any student's schedule, particularly in the freshman and sophomore years. Military Science instruction is offered at East Stroudsburg University with two-, three-and four-year programs leading to a commission as an officer in one of the three components of the U.S. Army. Any East Stroudsburg University student may participate in any basic Army ROTC course without cost or obligation.</p><p>To be commissioned as a second lieutenant, students must pass a physical examination and complete at least the final two years of the ROTC program of Military Science courses. The commissioning track consists of three components that the student will typically take each semester; Physical Training (PT), Leadership Lab, and classroom instruction. All together, the program takes as much as seven hours each week and can earn the students as much as 21 elective credits toward graduation.</p><p>The Army ROTC provides all uniforms, equipment, and textbooks required for the classes. Each semester there is a military social event and at least one optional weekend training session that includes such events as military marksmanship, cross country orienteering, military rappelling, leadership application courses and obstacle/confidence courses, even paint ball or rock climbing. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the Program</head><p>Studying a language at East Stroudsburg University offers students an ideal opportunity to broaden their intellectual horizons, improve their communication skills, and gain a genuine understanding of another culture. Students may greatly enhance their prospects of employment by pursuing language study in conjunction with such disciplines as Business, Health Studies, Psychology, Hotel/Restaurant/Tourism, English, History, Communications, and many other fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employment / Career Opportunities</head><p>As employment opportunities become increasingly international in their orientation, language majors are finding new career possibilities in the realms of international business, media or technology. With a careful selection of courses supplementing their language major, it is possible for a student to pursue graduate studies in medicine, business, or law. Whatever a student's professional interest, pursuing the study of another language can only enhance the potential for success while increasing marketability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs</head><p>The primary mission of our Department is to offer students a comprehensive program of studies in Spanish. Students may choose from a Bachelor of Arts degree --typically leading to a career in translation, business, government, non-profits, or social services --or a Bachelor of Science degree, which includes K-12 teaching certification.</p><p>Three minors are offered, each with distinct strands of language, culture and workforce-related content:</p><p>• Spanish</p><p>• Spanish for the Professions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Chinese Language and Culture</head><p>Other languages may also be offered, whether on a traditional basis or via individualized instruction or a distance modality. These include Arabic, Greek, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese and Russian.</p><p>Whatever the level of language study chosen by the student, the basic goal remains the same: to acquire useful proficiency in that language with meaningful cultural knowledge. In its pursuit of these goals, the department follows the guidelines and standards established by such professional organizations as the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), the Modern Language Association (MLA), the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP; formerly NCATE) and the various professional organizations affiliated with those languages in which degrees are offered (AATSP and CLTA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overseas Travel/Study/Internships</head><p>Global opportunities offer students unparalleled insight into different languages and cultures, and also shed new light on professional possibilities. Study abroad is a transformative experience on many levels. The great majority of ESU language majors and minors opt to spend a month, a semester or a full academic year in another country. ESU's Office of International Programs assists students with choosing a destination, academic integration of overseas credits, financial planning and issues of acculturation. As a member of the National Student Exchange (NSE) and the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), ESU ensures that students receive the widest possible selection of destinations at the lowest possible cost. In addition, internships can be arranged in the U.S. and abroad, enhancing the student's professional prospects upon graduation.</p><p>Are you interested in ...</p><p>• Becoming fluent in a second or third language?</p><p>• Gaining a competitive edge with a valuable second major or minor?</p><p>• Unique travel experiences?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Majors: Choosing and Changing</head><p>If you haven't chosen a major, don't worry. You're in good company. Many students are undecided about their majors when they enter college, and many who decided change their minds more than once before they graduate. Use your freshman year and the general education curriculum to explore academic options, and to sample ideas and approaches from other disciplines.</p><p>Examine your academic interests by asking yourself these questions: What do I do well? What subjects did I enjoy in high school? What activities did I participate in? What do I like to read about? If you have any special skills or interests, they should be apparent from how you answer these questions. A good guide to what really interests you is what you choose to do on your own, as well as your previous experiences with part-time work, volunteer work, hobbies, sports, and travel.</p></div>
