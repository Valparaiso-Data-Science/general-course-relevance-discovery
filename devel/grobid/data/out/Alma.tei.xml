			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>All members of the community -faculty, staff and trustees -are committed to creating an institution of quality centered on the growth and development of undergraduate students. The purpose of the residential college experience is to better prepare students to enter seamlessly into lives in community, vocation, family and faith.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disciplinary expertise within an interdisciplinary context of learning</head><p>The Alma Experience expects students to apply intellectual rigor to the exploration of a range of disciplines, building a broad foundation in the sciences, humanities, fine and performing arts and social sciences. This liberal arts education also prepares students to pursue advanced work, independent research and creative performances with the depth of understanding to excel in one's discipline and to perceive the connections among disciplines. The practical knowledge and skills of the liberal arts prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership within a wide array of settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engaged learning</head><p>Because education takes place everywhere and all the time, it is important both to create an exciting residential learning environment and to extend opportunities for significant learning into the community and wider world. Active participation in learning, engaged citizenship, servicedriven leadership and committed stewardship are fostered through research-based undergraduate scholarship as well as programs that support experiential, international and service-learning opportunities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical integrity, aesthetic appreciation, spiritual sensitivity</head><p>With knowledge comes obligation. To live a complete life that withstands the scrutiny of self and others, individuals must exhibit personal integrity, respect for the value of all humanity and sensitivity to the spiritual and material beauty of one's existence. We expect these principles to be modeled in the educational programs, work and daily interactions of all members of the College community.</p></div>

Some literature is also available from the Financial Services Office or Admissions Office.</p><p>Payment of tuition and fee charges can be made with cash, personal checks, bank drafts, or money orders. Payments can also be made online with a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover card, or with an e-check at the Financial Services Office Web site: www.alma.edu/paymybill.

Advance billings are available to be viewed and/or downloaded from the student portal approximately two weeks before the start of each term. Payment may be made by mail, online or in person at the Alma College Financial Services Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Miscellaneous Fees</head><p>Payment must be received by the College prior to registration, or the student will have to make payment at the Financial Services Office during registration. Students are not permitted to attend class without making satisfactory financial arrangements. Account Holds. A student's account is placed on a financial hold for the following reasons: 1. The student has withdrawn or graduated and has not paid their account balance in full. Until the account balance is paid in full, a student's transcript and/or diploma cannot be released. 2. The student is an active, current student with an account balance of $1,000 or higher. An active, current student is not able to register or be placed in (or retain) a housing assignment for a future term until the account is paid in full, or under $1,000 with a written repayment plan. Default of the repayment plan may result in loss of the student's registration and housing assignment. Late Payment Fees. Tuition and fees are due before classes start for each term. A late payment fee of 1% per month is assessed on all outstanding balances. Failure to Meet Financial Obligations. In accordance with standard practice at colleges and universities, students are required to make satisfactory arrangements with the Financial Services Office for the settlement of all financial obligations. These include student accounts, student loans, parking fines, library fines, music record rentals and other expenses.</p><p>When a student fails to meet financial obligations, Alma College reserves the right to withhold the issuance of grades, transcripts and diplomas, and to suspend a student until the obligations are met. Unpaid balances on inactive student accounts will be referred to a collection agency. The student has responsibility for all costs and fees associated with the collection of the debt. Financial Aid. Any financial aid other than a work-study grant awarded by the College for the entire year will be prorated; 50% to be available Fall Term and 50% to be available Winter Term. A work-study grant may not be deducted from charges because this aid represents funds to be earned during the year. Scholarships and grants awarded by organizations other than Alma College will not be credited until actually received. The Director of Financial Aid must be notified of any scholarship or grant awarded by organizations and agencies other than Alma College. Withdrawal from College. Students who wish to withdraw from Alma College must complete the withdrawal process by contacting the Center for Student Opportunity. If this process is not completed, students will forfeit their deposits and refunds. The College assumes that students beginning a term intend to complete it. Students who leave during a term without completing the withdrawal process may receive failing grades for course enrollments and will be responsible for any tuition, and room and board charges for the term. If a student has registered for a future term and decides not to attend that term, the student must contact the CSO to formally withdraw and be removed from those classes. Failure to do so will result in the student being responsible to pay for tuition, fees, and room and board for the term, in its entirety. Withdrawal from College Refund Policy. Tuition, room fee and student activity fee are refunded according to the following table. College scholarships, grants and/or loans received by the student will be refunded on a comparable percentage basis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal</head><p>Refunds for other non-College financial aid will be made in accordance with the rules and regulations applicable to those programs. Refund of Federal Title IV Financial Aid. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 require that when a student withdraws before completing 60% of the term, the institution must determine the percentage of Title IV assistance the student has earned. For Title IV financial aid regulations, the withdrawal date is the date on which the student states his or her intention to withdraw from the institution. The percentage is determined by dividing the total number of calendar days in the semester into the number of calendar days completed as of the withdrawal date. Any unearned aid must be returned to the Title IV program(s). Funds are returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Subsidized Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, Pell Grant, SEOG and other Title IV programs. The student must either repay the federal overpayment in full or make satisfactory arrangements with either the Alma College Financial Services Office or the federal Department of Education. The payment or arrangement for payment must be made within 45 days of the date of notification of the federal overpayment or the student will lose further eligibility of federal Title IV aid until the debt is paid in full.</p><p>Full refunds will be made for overload charges up to the second Friday of the term. No refunds for overloads will be allowed after that time. Overload Charges. Full refunds will be made for overload charges up to the second Friday of the term. No refunds for overloads will be allowed after that time. Room and Board. The room and board charge is refundable on a prorated basis during any term. Course Fees. Course fees are assessed for courses that incur unusual or extra expense. These expenditures are made on the basis of course registrations. Therefore, no refund is allowed for these fees. Spring Term. No refund of tuition for withdrawals that occur after the fifth day of classes. A full refund is provided for withdrawals during the first five days of classes. There is no refund for room charges and the board fee will be prorated. Spring Term trip fees will be refunded only if the trip costs, such as airlines, hotels and other travel fees can be recovered.

The interplay between, on the one hand, the Constitution and constitutional law, and on the other, major historical events and trends, is the focus of this course. , the relationship between the Islamic world and the West has become a topic of renewed interest and controversy. From one vantage point, Muslims and Christians have been at odds for centuries, engaged in what some have called a clash of civilizations. But some historians have questioned that interpretation. While Christians and Muslims have experienced much violence and tension, they have also managed to coexist for long periods of time and to engage in fruitful exchanges. This course examines how Christians and Muslims interacted with one another in the pre-Modern Mediterranean World (i.e., pre-1800). Few institutions in history are as infamous as the Inquisition. It represents some of the most notorious instances of intolerance and violence produced by religious belief. Our knowledge of this institution, however, too often relies upon myth. This course, thus, explores how religious authority functioned during a time very different from our own. Readings examine inquisition documents, as well as scholarship on Spain's inquisition and other inquisitions in Europe and the Americas.
