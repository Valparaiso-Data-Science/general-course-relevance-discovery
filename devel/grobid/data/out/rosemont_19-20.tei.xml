<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MISSION OF ROSEMONT COLLEGE</head><p>Rosemont College is a community of lifelong learners dedicated to academic excellence and fostering joy in the pursuit of knowledge. Rosemont College seeks to develop in all members of the community open and critical minds, the ability to make reasoned, moral decisions and a sense of responsibility to serve others in our global society.</p><p>Rooted in Catholicism, Rosemont College welcomes all faiths and is guided by the educational principles of Cornelia Connelly and the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, to meet the needs of the time.</p><p>Rosemont College values: Trust in and reverence for the dignity of each person; Diversity with a commitment to building an international community; Persistence and courage in promoting justice with compassion; Care for the Earth as our common home.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROSEMONT ROOTS</head><p>Rosemont College was founded in 1921 by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus on the Sinnott estate in Rosemont, Pennsylvania. From those early days until the present, the spirit of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus has been an integral part of the growth of the College. Holy Child education is both a clearly defined and flexible ideal. It is a tradition rooted in Christian values and expressions and attuned to learning opportunities that enable students to respond to life with joy, zeal, and compassion. Rosemont College encourages students to meet diversity and change with confidence in their own gifts and in God, who has made a covenant with the human family. Each year a mission theme is taken from the mission statement which the College explores and incorporates its meaning on campus and beyond in its activities and events.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, Cornelia Connelly, an American convert to Catholicism, founded the Society of the Holy Child Jesus and opened her first school in England. Cornelia's Society was grounded in the Incarnation: in becoming one of us, God conferred dignity on humankind. Thus, Cornelia reasoned simply, each person is worthy of respect and reverence. Cornelia Connelly, founder of the sponsoring congregation, has been the force behind Rosemont's mission to educate women and men "to meet the wants of the age." </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE LIBERAL ARTS CURRICULUM</head><p>Rosemont's liberal arts curriculum provides the student with a breadth of knowledge that makes evident the connections between often compartmentalized fields, while simultaneously providing a solid base for advanced study in a particular discipline. The curriculum instills in the student the habits of observation and precision while enabling him/her to formulate and express thoughts clearly and effectively, both orally and in writing. This in turn develops in our students the ability to reason, both inductively and deductively, and to think with the creativity -that is, the freedom -needed to find innovative solutions to problems. Learning and the study of ideas take place in an atmosphere inspired by the Christian conviction that human beings need to grow, not in isolation, but in relation to God, the universe, and other human beings. Therefore, the student is constantly presented with challenges in the hope of inspiring the development of aesthetic, ethical, and religious values.</p><p>Learning to see themselves in relation to the universe grants our students a healthy sense of perspective, and a strong sense of self, an indomitability that will allow them to follow their aspirations and to make a difference in the world.</p></div>

If Advanced Placement credit is awarded and represents a prerequisite for an upper-level course, the student is exempted from the prerequisite course. A student with 30 Advanced Placement credits may be granted sophomore standing.</p><p>Students participating in one of the cooperative programs at Villanova University must have an AP score of 4 or higher to have those credits counted in transfer regardless of the subject area. What information is protected? FERPA classifies protected information into three categories: educational information, personally identifiable information (PII) and directory information. The limitations imposed by FERPA vary with respect to each category.</p><p>Personally identifiable information can only be disclosed if the educational institution obtains the signature of the student on a document specifically identifying the information to be disclosed, the reason for the disclosure, and the parties to whom the disclosure will be made. Examples of PII include: student's name, date of birth, student ID or SSN, and other information which can be used to distinguish an individual's identity in relation to academic records.</p><p>Educational information cannot be disclosed without prior approval of the student. FERPA defines "education records" as "records, files, documents, and other materials" that are "maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a person acting for such agency or institution." This includes transcripts, GPA, grades, social security number, and academic evaluations, and records that pertain to an individual's previous attendance as a student of an institution.</p><p>Directory information can be disclosed by the institution without consent. Directory information is defined as "information contained in an education record of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed." This includes such items as a list of students' names, addresses, and telephone numbers, and also includes a student ID number (which includes electronic identifiers) provided it cannot be used to gain access to education records. Directory information, however, does not include a student's social security number nor can the social security number be used to confirm directory information. If a student decides to "opt out" of the disclosure of directory information, the "opt out" continues indefinitely.</p><p>What does the release cover? Rosemont College cannot provide information about a student's academic records, including performance in a class, grades, or registrations to a third party without written consent by the student. Information will only be provided after the identity of the third party is verified. If Rosemont cannot verify the identity they may choose not to disclose information. Student can revoke FERPA consent at any time.</p></div>

Students pursuing either of these degree programs will be allowed to count four (4) classes in their majors towards GE.</p><p>A course taken to fulfill a given category in the General Education curriculum will not count in another category for the General Education curriculum.</p><p>Unless students place at the 300-level or higher, they must take two courses in the same language, i.e. FRE 0100 and FRE 0101. Please note, if the same course is cross-listed with different prefixes, students must choose one prefix and one category for the course to fulfill the General Education requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE FIRST YEAR CONNECTION SEMINAR</head><p>The goals of the First Year Connection Seminar are to help students deepen three key connections: (1) with themselves (their strengths and interests, future plans and aspirations, self-directed learning, cultural background); (2) with Rosemont College (history and mission, collegiate-level expectations, power of a liberal arts education, co-curricular learning, bonding with faculty and other students);</p><p>(3) with the larger world (strength in diversity, global and cross-cultural knowledge and perspectives).</p><p>The seminar also seeks to develop skills and strategies that are applicable and valuable across subjects (transferable, cross-disciplinary skills) and across time (durable, lifelong learning skills), including such competencies as thinking critically, communicating effectively, accessing and evaluating information, and working collaboratively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ETHICS IN ACTION</head><p>The overarching goal of the Ethics in Action area is to provide students with a practical foundation for reasoned moral decision-making. The courses in this category seek to foster this practice by enabling students to develop the critical skills and analytical frameworks essential to identify, characterize, and resolve ethical problems likely to arise in their careers and in their lives as a whole. Each course introduces students to fundamental ethical concepts, perspectives, and theories, and explores how these bear on issues unique to the subject of the course. Through exposure to a variety of approaches including application of theory, case study analysis, narrative analysis, and decision-making procedures, students will become aware of the implications of their own ethical views, and will develop the skills necessary for both resolving ethical problems thoughtfully and for attaining a greater sense of moral responsibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING</head><p>The General Education curriculum contains an experiential education requirement for all students.</p><p>To comply with this requirement, the Office of Experiential Opportunities and Post Graduate Success coordinates internships, service learning, undergraduate research, and study abroad experiences to assist students in their learning activities. The office is a resource for students in securing internships during the academic year and the summer. Further, the office participates with faculty in the evaluation of internship goals and learning outcomes. The office also helps faculty incorporate Service Learning into their classes by developing contacts with outside community organizations. Service Learning relies on a pedagogy which involves cooperation between faculty, students and community organizations in an interactive learning experience. In an increasingly interdependent world, study abroad is an important and vital component of any educational experience.</p><p>With the assistance of this office, students can explore a large variety of study abroad options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNSHIPS</head><p>Full semester internships are student-initiated and can be arranged for qualified students in most disciplines with the approval of the faculty advisor. Students should seek information from their advisors and the Director of Experiential Opportunities &amp; Post Graduate Success.</p><p>The College encourages every student to consider taking an internship as part of the Experiential Component. Information on credit and non-credit internships is available in the Office of Post Graduate Success.</p><p>Significant criteria for internships include:</p><p> Students are required to have a GPA of at least 2.0 in order to participate in an internship.

Ordinarily, a student studies with an instructor who agrees to direct his/her work. Since Independent Study requires more initiative and organization than inclass work, the student must be able and willing to meet all of the requirements of the contract the student signs with the professor responsible for the course. Approval is acquired through the Independent Study contract submitted to the UC Academic Dean prior to the start of the semester in which the Independent Study will occur. Normally, Independent Studies are 1-3 credits, a grade is assigned, and the standard cost per credit charged.</p><p>Only under exceptional circumstances, may a student undertake a course identical to one found under Courses of Instruction in the catalogue on an Independent Study basis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SERVICE LEARNING</head><p>Service learning, the integration of course content in the classroom with service activities in the community, will be offered in selected courses. Such courses will carry the regular course credit and will fulfill the experiential requirement for graduation. Service learning classes are listed on the class schedule each semester. Students enrolled in service-learning courses must complete a minimum of 20 hours of service at their service site and submit a time sheet to the Director of Experiential Opportunities and Post Graduate Success, signed by his or her supervisor each week, to verify the completion of hours. More information about service learning can be obtained from the student's faculty advisor and the Director of Experiential Opportunities and Post Graduate Success. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENACTING THE CORE</head><p>The Experiential Component Each incoming student is required to complete an experiential component as a requirement for graduation from the Undergraduate College. Among the experiential components a student can choose are internships, service learning, undergraduate research and study abroad opportunities. These opportunities may be credit bearing and vary in the credits assigned to them or in some cases, not for credit. These experiences are related to the student's program of study and provide an important linkage between classroom theory and actual practice. Students should work closely with their faculty mentors and professors to identify the experience most suitable to the student's academic and personal goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Capstone 3 cr</head><p>The Senior Capstone is offered in a student's major. Most Senior Capstone courses are only offered in the spring semester.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HONORS COURSES</head><p>Each semester the Undergraduate College offers a series of honors courses that fulfill General Education requirements. These courses, capped at 15 students, are sections of already existing courses which offer students the opportunity for a more enriched and enhanced encounter with the material. While expectations for reading, writing, and discussion are high, the primary difference between Honors and non-Honors sections of the same courses lies not in the amount of work, but in the depth of study and critical reflection on the material. Emphasis is given to primary sources (when applicable) rather than survey texts. Additionally, in any given class, students are likely to attend one or more off-campus events. Students may not take more than two Honors courses during one semester. Courses are designated on the course listing schedule with an "H".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSES FOR THE PROFESSIONS</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC YEAR</head><p>The traditional academic year (excluding an optional summer semester) consists of two semesters, each of which is approximately 15 weeks long. Immediately after the last day of classes is a Reading Day, followed by final examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC CREDIT</head><p>The semester hour is the unit of academic credit for all courses offered during the fall, spring, and summer sessions. For information regarding course credit, consult the schedule of classes for the current semester's offerings on the iWay and the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREDIT LOADS AND STUDENT SCHEDULES</head><p>First semester first year students are limited to 15 credit hours, unless they are part of the Threeyear Bachelor's Degree program. An exception can be granted to students taking a one-credit laboratory (Science) or a course with an experiential component (Art History). No change may be made in a student's schedule after the drop/add period for the semester. Full tuition covers up to 18 credits of study per semester. Students wishing to take 18 credits must maintain a GPA of 3.0000 or higher. Students wishing to take more than 18 credits in a given semester must receive permission from the Academic Dean of the Undergraduate College and their major advisor. They will be charged additional tuition and may incur additional fees. A student on academic probation must complete an Academic Action Plan, attend regular tutoring and workshops, and should register and complete 15 credits to maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Courses should be chosen in consultation with an advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRE-REGISTRATION</head><p>With guidance from their academic advisor and the Student Academic Support Center, students choose courses for the following semester from the schedule prepared by the Office of the Registrar and posted on the IWay. Preregistration for the fall semester for currently enrolled students usually takes place in March; for the spring semester, in November. Students who do not preregister by the preregistration deadline, will not be permitted to register until one <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> week prior to the start of the next semester. Students who have not obtained faculty advisor approval during the pre-registration period will have their course selections deleted. Students that do not register, will be billed full-time tuition for the semester.</p><p>Entering first-year and new transfer students preregister for the fall semester during the late spring or summer months and for the following spring semester during the fall semester preregistration period. Students will work with SASC to select an appropriate schedule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DROP/ADD PERIOD</head><p>The drop/add period takes place at the start of each semester according to the dates published in the calendar and the hours indicated by the Registrar. A student may drop or add a course only during the period indicated on the College calendar. Students may drop and add courses via the iWay unless they are First Year students in their first semester. First semester students must submit a drop/add form, signed by their faculty advisor, to the Office of the Registrar for processing. A student wishing to withdraw from any course after the drop/add period must request a withdrawal from the course and submit the appropriate paperwork, including all required signatures to the Office of the Registrar within the appropriate time period.</p><p>Contracts for independent study or internships must be submitted on or before the registration day to the Registrar's Office. Required revisions must be submitted before the end of the drop/add period, as must signed forms to audit a course or to take a course for a pass/fail grade. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE POINT AVERAGE</head><p>The standing of a student for each semester is determined by his/her grade point average (GPA). Letter grades are given for individual courses and quality points are used to compute averages for each student at the end of each semester on both a semester and cumulative basis. These averages are determined by multiplying the quality points for each course by the credit(s) for the course and dividing the sum of these products by the sum of the credits they represent. Pass and audit grades, as well as withdrawals, do not affect averages. Courses completed at Cabrini College, Eastern University, Villanova University or SEPCHE schools under the Inter-Institutional Exchange Programs during the regularly scheduled fall and spring semesters are included in the computation of grade point averages.</p><p>A grade of F indicates that the student has failed the course. If a failure is incurred in a required course, the course must be repeated. A GPA of at least 2.0000 is required for graduation, and an average of at least 2.0000 is required in the major field. A minimum 3.000 GPA is required for students who wish to participate in the Eastern University, Villanova University or SEPCHE schools Exchange Programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE APPEAL POLICY</head><p>Students are advised that grade appeals based on the quality of the work are tough to substantiate. In addition to grades on papers, tests and quizzes, faculty may also factor attendance and class participation into grades. It is important, that the student wishing to appeal a grade have as much supporting evidence to present as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INFORMAL GRADE APPEAL PROCESS</head><p>Students who did not get the grade they were expecting for a class should first calculate their grade based on the formula published in the course syllabi. If a discrepancy arises, the student should make an appointment to meet with the instructor within ten (working) days of the start of the next semester. This is within the first two weeks of the spring semester for grades issued in the fall, and within two weeks of the start of the fall semester for grades issued in the spring. If a student is appealing a grade issued for a halfsemester course meeting in the first half of the semester, the appeal must take place within ten days of receiving the course grade.</p><p>After meeting with the student, if the instructor agrees that the grade was calculated incorrectly, a Change of Grade form should be filed by the faculty member with the Registrar's Office. If there is no discrepancy the faculty member should explain to the student why the grade issued is correct.</p><p>If a resolution cannot be reached, the appeal moves into the formal appeal process. If a student requests a review of a grade issued by an adjunct instructor who is not teaching the next semester at the College the review will be led by the Discipline Coordinator or the Division Chair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORMAL GRADE APPEAL PROCESS</head><p>A good faith effort to resolve any academic grievance between a student and faculty member must precede any formal action. Students' appeals of grades of D+, D, D-, or F that cannot be resolved informally proceed directly to the formal appeal process. Students who wish to appeal a grade of C or higher must first present their case to the Academic Standards Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TO APPEAL A GRADE OF C OR HIGHER</head><p>Students wishing to appeal a grade of C or higher that could not be resolved informally with the course instructor, must first submit their case in writing to the Academic Standards Committee within three weeks (15 working days) of the start of the semester after the semester in which they received the contested grade. The student's request must contain a signed letter stating why they are appealing the grade along with all supporting materials. The Committee will contact the course instructor and ask for supporting materials the faculty member wishes to present. If the Committee decides the case has merit, the grade appeal will proceed through the formal appeal process. If the committee decides the case does not have merit the appeal cannot proceed. The decision of the Committee is final. The Committee will not comment on the appeal so as not to prejudice further actions. If a member of Academic Standards is involved in the grade appeal that student must recuse themselves from participating in the Committee's decision.</p><p>Appeal requests that are submitted to the Committee after the third week of the semester will not be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPEALS OF D+, D, D-OR F GRADES</head><p>To begin the formal appeal process, the student must submit a signed letter to the faculty member with a copy to the Academic Dean of the Undergraduate College within three weeks (15 working days) of the start of the semester after the semester in which they received the contested grade stating why they wish to appeal the grade. The exception to this is for those appeals that must first be presented to Academic Standards. The student should submit all supporting materials to the Office of the Academic Dean. The Dean will ask the course instructor for all documentation on how the grade was calculated.</p><p>The Academic Dean will charge the respective Division Chair with reviewing all materials submitted and making a recommendation on the appeal within two weeks of receiving it. If the decision of the Division Chair is not acceptable to either the student or the course instructor, the student should contact the Academic Dean and request that the Committee of Division Chairs review the case. The Division Chairs can ask for materials other than those initially submitted by either the student or the faculty member if they believe it is necessary to rule a fair decision. Division Chairs are also encouraged to meet with the student and faculty member. The decisions of the Chairs will be stated in writing, addressed to the student and a copy sent to the course instructor.</p><p>If the decision of the Division Chairs is not acceptable to either the student or the course instructor, the student may request that the Academic Dean review all materials and render a decision. The decision of the Dean is final and binding; there is no further appeal at this point. If the course instructor is the Division Chair, the Dean will consult with the student and the course instructor to determine who the Dean will appoint to replace the Chair.</p><p>The right to proceed at each step or to stop this process is the prerogative of the student. If the student withdraws the grievance, all records pertaining to the case will be expunged. If at any point in this process the student is uncertain how to move this case forward, the student is advised to consult with his/her academic advisor.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADING SYSTEM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Grade Points Percentage</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPEATING A COURSE</head><p>A student who has received a grade of D+, D, D-, or F in a required course taken at Rosemont may repeat the course for a better grade. When a required course is repeated, the following rules shall apply:</p><p> The repeated course must be equivalent to the previous course and must be taken at Rosemont. Transfer credits do not qualify for grade forgiveness as the grade does not transfer.  The second time the course is taken it cannot be taken for Pass/Fail credit.  Both courses and grades will be recorded in the student's file and transcript.  When a student repeats a course, only the highest grade earned will be used to calculate the student's cumulative grade point average. The lower grade(s) will be forgiven in the final calculation of the student's GPA. The original grade and quality points will remain on the transcript, listed with all courses taken in a particular year and semester. All instances of a course and all grades earned will appear on the student's transcript. If a grade is replaced in the calculation of the cumulative GPA, the forgiven grade will be marked with an Asterisk (*) on the transcript and the higher grade will be marked with an "R" for Repeated.  A student who has failed a course, or has received a grade of F for a course taken at Villanova University, Eastern University or SEPCHE schools, may repeat the equivalent course at Rosemont or at the other SEPCHE institutions. If a student chooses to repeat a course at an institution other than Rosemont College, the policy for repeating a course at that institution applies.  Courses that are repeated to improve a grade are counted in Attempted Credits but only the one higher grade is counted in the Total Earned Credits. Students with repeated courses on their academic record should carefully monitor their progress towards graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REMEDIAL COURSES</head><p>Credits and grades earned for remedial courses are calculated in the semester credits earned and the semester GPA. Credits earned for remedial courses are calculated in the Cumulative GPA but are NOT counted in the overall credits earned for graduation. An example of a remedial course currently in the curriculum is RDG 0050 "Reading and Study Skills for the Successful Student." Remedial courses are normally courses numbered below the 0100 level. Remedial courses are counted in the credit hours needed for full time status. Full time status is determined by enrollment in a minimum of 12 credits per semester.</p><p>Students should check with the office of Financial Aid to determine if repeating a course may impact financial aid eligibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INCOMPLETE GRADES (I)</head><p>When a student has a serious reason that prevents the completion of course requirements (e.g., medical issues, family problems, work-related travel), the student must submit written documentation (from a physician, counselor, or employer) and request that the instructor assign a grade of "I" (Incomplete).</p><p>The student must initiate and document the request on or before the final class meeting of the semester/session. If the instructor decides to grant the request, s/he must first obtain the Academic Dean's approval on the appropriate form. The student must complete and submit all remaining course work and assignments as quickly as possible; the instructor must then submit a Change of Grade form directly to the Office of the Registrar.</p><p>Any grade of "I" that is assigned during the fall semester must be resolved no later than the following May 15; any grade of "I" that is assigned during the spring must be resolved no later than the following September 15; any grade of "I" that is assigned during the summer must be resolved no later than the following January 15. In any case where these deadlines are not met, the "I" will automatically become an "F;" grade appeals or additional time extensions will not be granted. Students and instructors are advised that grades of "I" may adversely affect the student's financial aid eligibility and/or academic standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEMPORARY GRADES (T)</head><p>Students in the UC can request an extension of time to complete course requirements by requesting a grade of "T" (Temporary). This request is limited to no more than one course in a given semester; under certain circumstances the Undergraduate College Academic Dean can grant an exemption and allow a student more than one "T" grade.</p><p>The student and the instructor must complete all information on the "T" grade form and the instructor must submit the form to the Office of the Academic Dean. Forms will not be accepted from students. The student must complete and submit all remaining course work and assignments as quickly as possible; the instructor must then submit a Change of Grade Form.</p><p>Any grade of "T" that is not satisfactorily resolved within four (4) weeks of the final class meeting of the semester will automatically become an "F". Grade appeals or additional time extensions will not be granted. "T" grades may not be changed to grades of "I" (Incomplete), and all grades of "T" in courses that serve as pre-requisites must be satisfactorily resolved before the student begins work in a subsequent course.</p><p>Students are advised that grades of "T", "W" (withdrawal) and "F" (failing) can negatively impact their financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PASS/FAIL OPTION</head><p>The pass/fail option, open to full-time students with a minimum 2.0000 cumulative average, is intended to encourage students to broaden their program of study by the pursuit of elective courses offered outside their major and general programs. A course elected under the pass/fail option is taken for credit and the student must fulfill all obligations of the course. The student's record at the end of the semester indicates for this course either pass or fail, instead of a letter grade. A failure is included in the grade point average. The pass/fail option must be approved by the instructor by the end of the drop/add period. No more than two (2) courses can be taken pass/fail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MID-TERM GRADE REPORTS AND EARLY WARNING SYSTEM</head><p>In the Undergraduate College, students receive Mid-term Grades indicating satisfactory (grade of S), marginally satisfactory (grade of S-), or unsatisfactory (grade of U) work to date. In addition, they may also receive warnings from their faculty through the Undergraduate College Early Warning System, which provides greater feedback to students about their progress in classes. Students who receive grades of S-or U or warnings from faculty are encouraged to meet with staff in the Student Academic Support Center to seek academic support as warranted. Students can view mid-term grades on the iWay. Mid-term grades are not part of a student's transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE REPORTS</head><p>Grade reports will be available to students on the iWay at the end of each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSCRIPTS</head><p>Students may obtain transcripts of their academic records from the Office of the Registrar. Requests can be made in person or by submitting an online request, located on the Registrar's web page. Transcript requests are typically fulfilled within 1-2 business days. Official transcripts Are $7.00 and can be mailed or emailed. The fee covers postage for mailed transcripts sent via USPS First Class Mail. Students/Alumni who request transcripts to be sent internationally or through and expedited method (Express Mail, UPS, or FedEx) must pay for the additional shipping costs." Transcripts will not be released for students whose financial accounts have not been cleared by Student Accounts and Financial Aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE EXAMINATIONS</head><p>In most courses, examinations are given periodically throughout the semester, with a major examination given at the end of the semester. Final examinations given at the end of the course are scheduled by the Registrar within the published examination period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREDIT BY EXAMINATION</head><p>Rosemont College students may challenge certain courses in consultation with their major advisor. The intent of Rosemont's credit by examination policy is to provide students who have acquired competence through special learning situations, such as professional experience or independent study, with the opportunity to demonstrate their competence. Students who can demonstrate mastery of course content through satisfactory performance (at least a grade of C) on a departmentally-prepared examination earn credit for the course after having paid the examination fee. The course will be listed on the student's transcript as transfer credit and does not count towards full-time status for the semester the exam is taken, the appropriate credit value will be posted but a grade will not be entered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements:</head><p> Students must be full-time and in good standing.  Students may challenge a maximum of 2 courses towards their undergraduate degree.  Students may not challenge a course which is a prerequisite for a course they have already taken or is at a lower level than what they have placed into or taken (previously or currently).  Students may not challenge a course they have already received credit for at Rosemont or another institution.  Students may not challenge a course they have failed, withdrawn from, have an incomplete in, or for a credit by exam they previously did not pass.  Students must pay for the exam prior to taking the exam. The fee covers the cost of creating and administering the exam and is due regardless of the student passing the exam.  Developmental courses cannot be challenged.</p><p> This option is only available during the fall and spring semesters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure:</head><p>1. The student should meet with their advisor to discuss the possibility of challenging a course through credit by exam. If recommended, the student must complete the credit by exam form. The exam must be taken in the same semester and prior to the end of classes for that semester. 2. The student must pay the credit by exam fee (current fee available from Student Accounts) and return the form to the Registrar's Office prior to taking the exam. 3. After the student takes the exam on the exam date, the Faculty member administering the exam will report the grade to the Registrar's office within 48 hours of the exam date. 4. If the exam was successful (C or better), transfer credit will be posted for the course challenged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES</head><p>Students in the Undergraduate College may withdraw from a course until the deadline published by the Office of the Registrar for each semester/session. Generally, this deadline is set one month prior to the last date of class. Students must complete the appropriate Withdrawal form that can be found on the iWay or through the Student Academic Support Center, and obtain all required signatures. The student will receive a grade of "W," which will not be calculated into the student's GPA. Students are advised that grades of "W" may adversely affect the student's financial aid eligibility and/or academic standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE POLICY</head><p>In the Undergraduate College at Rosemont College, regular class attendance is essential to successful academic achievement.</p><p>Absences are permitted only in cases of illness or other legitimate causes (family emergency, death in the family, etc.). Official notice that a student has presented documentation for an absence is sent from the Office of the Dean of Students to faculty on a timely basis.</p><p>In cases of an documented absence from a class, the student has both the opportunity and responsibility to make up all class work missed. Faculty members have the discretion whether or not to accept work from or schedule make-up exams or quizzes for students who miss a class without a legitimate excuse.</p><p>Students are allowed to miss the equivalent of one week of classes for any course in which they are enrolled. This amounts to three absences for a class that meets on MWF schedule, two classes for courses meeting either on a TR or MW schedule, and one class for labs and classes that meet only once a week. Absences are counted from the first day of class. Late registrants will have absences accrued beginning the first class meeting after they register. NOTE --Students with a hold from the Business Office are expected to attend the class in which they expect to enroll from the first day of the semester.</p><p>Excessive absences will affect students' grades in courses. The grade penalty for a course is defined on the syllabus and is determined by the faculty member teaching the course.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education requires that all faculty must maintain detailed attendance records showing the student's last date of attendance in a course.</p><p>Faculty have the option of submitting an "FX" grade to students who failed the course due to excessive absences. The FX grade is calculated as an "F" in the student's grade point average. For students receiving financial aid, failure from nonattendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of their financial aid. Faculty are required to provide the date when the student last attended.</p><p>While faculty, student organizations, and the ACT 101 Grant Program are strongly encouraged to schedule field trips and on-campus events so that they do not conflict with class students may be enrolled in, this may not always be possible. If a class absence is necessary because of an activity being held in another course, the faculty member teaching that course will provide the Academic Dean with a list of participants in advance of the activity, and the Academic Dean's Office will verify this absence. The ACT 101 Director will also follow this procedure. If the absence is due to an activity of a college-sponsored club or organization, the notification will come from the Dean of Student's Office. Students are not allowed more than one absence per semester due to a conflict with an activity sponsored by another course or a college organization. This absence is in addition to those allowed above. If faculty members can document that a student scheduled to attend an event or a field trip has missed too many classes, or if they are giving an exam or quiz that day, the student should attend class and not the outside activity. In that case, the faculty member teaching the course will notify the Academic Dean or the Dean of Students that the absence request has been denied.</p><p>If a student must be absent due to serious injury or illness, or due to pregnancy, for more than two weeks, they are strongly encouraged to take a leave of absence for the semester during which the illness, injury, pregnancy, or birth of the child occurs. Students should follow the Leave of Absence policy and provide the needed documentation. Students are also encouraged to meet with the Financial Aid Office as extended absences and leaves can affect aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT ATHLETES</head><p>The Athletic Department is committed to consistent class attendance and participation in classes by Rosemont's student-athletes.</p><p>Recognizing that student-athletes will occasionally miss class due to athletic competition, the Athletic Director will prepare official travel notices for each team, outlining the dates that athletes will miss classes due to scheduled competitions. These will be issued at the beginning of each semester and be sent by the Athletic Director directly to the faculty. In the event that a game has been cancelled or rescheduled, the Athletic Director will notify faculty. The Director will notify faculty if a student is no longer a member of a team, regardless of whether they quit or was asked to leave.</p><p>The Athletic Director will also notify faculty of students who become academically ineligible during the academic year. Students who are no longer academically eligible cannot attend events as a member of the team and are required to attend class.</p><p>Student-athletes have the responsibility to make themselves known to the professors teaching their classes. They are responsible for making up all class work missed due to athletic participation. They must communicate directly with their professors. The professor should set the date for make-up exams and quizzes, and for assignments to be completed and turned in. These dates should be communicated in writing to the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NOTE:</head><p>Rosemont student-athletes are not allowed to miss class to attend practices, fund raisers, picture taking sessions, etc.</p><p>If a student-athlete must be absent due to injury or hospitalization that arises from competition or practice, the Athletic Director will notify faculty and the Dean of Students. Verification from the physician or hospital, documenting the injury, will be provided to the Dean of Students when the student-athlete returns to campus. It is the student's responsibility to follow-up with each professor to arrange for completing all make-up work upon his/her return to campus.</p><p>If a student must be absent due to serious injury for more than two weeks, they are strongly encouraged to take a leave of absence for the semester in which the injury occurs. Students should follow the Leave of Absence policy and provide the needed documentation. Students are also encouraged to meet with the Financial Aid Office as extended absences and leaves can affect aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEAVE OF ABSENCE</head><p>Rosemont College acknowledges that under some circumstances, students may have to interrupt their studies at the College. Students who are in good academic standing and who plan to return to Rosemont College can request a leave of absence for medical reasons, financial difficulties, or personal/family issues, not to exceed two consecutive semesters. The exception is for students on active military service who may request a leave of absence for up to two years. International students cannot request a leave of absence unless they will be out of the country, and have obtained prior permission from the International Student Coordinator. Students must take a least one full semester on leave, however, if a student takes a leave during the first three weeks of a semester, that semester will be considered a full semester away. Students studying abroad do not need to obtain a leave of absence as they remain registered with the College.</p><p>Students enrolled in the Undergraduate College initiate the request for a leave of absence by obtaining the Leave of Absence Form from the Student Academic Support Center. A Leave of Absence must be requested before or during the semester when the student wants the leave to start. Only under extraordinary circumstances will the College consider granting a retroactive leave. The decision to retroactively begin a leave is at the discretion of the Academic Dean. Before any leave request can be considered, the student must provide all required information on the Form, including the reason(s) for requesting the leave, the appropriate documentation requested on the form, as well as the anticipated date of return to Rosemont College. In addition, before leave can be granted the student is responsible for settling all outstanding balances with the College. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COLLEGE</head><p>No student will be considered officially withdrawn as a student and eligible for appropriate refunds or deposits until the withdrawal procedure has been completed. The student must initiate the process with the Student Academic Support and include an official request to withdraw, a personal interview, and complete an online exit survey. It is also necessary for the student withdrawing (resident or commuter) to meet with the Office of Financial Aid to discuss loan repayment If withdrawing during the middle of a semester, the student will receive withdraw (W) grades in all classes and will be responsible for any charges incurred for that semester. Based on the date of the withdraw, financial aid may have to be adjusted and returned resulting in a higher balance. Students withdrawing for the current semester, must complete the withdrawal process prior to the last day of classes of that semester.</p><p>Students withdrawing after the end of the semester for a future semester, will automatically be dropped from their upcoming classes.</p><p>All College identification, keys, and property must be returned before the withdrawal procedure can be completed. The student is responsible for any outstanding charges on their account and for completing Federal loan exit counseling before transcripts will be released.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC PROBATION</head><p>The academic records of students are reviewed by the Academic Standards Committee of the Undergraduate College faculty at the conclusion of the fall and spring semesters.</p><p>Students are placed on Academic Probation for the following reasons:</p><p> First year students and new transfer students whose GPA is less than 2.0000 and greater than 0.5000  All other students whose GPA is less than 2.0000 for a given semester  Students whose semester GPA is at or above 2.0000, but whose cumulative GPA is less than 2.0000, are continued on probation.</p><p>Being placed on academic probation is meant to serve as a warning that the student's academic work is unsatisfactory and that definite improvement is necessary to continue at the College. While on probation, students are restricted to 15 credit hours per semester. Student are required to meet with staff in the Student Academic Support Center to set up an Academic Action Plan and to attend weekly tutoring sessions for their classes. Failure to do so will be noted should students find themselves in further academic difficulty.</p><p>Being placed on academic probation can affect financial aid. Students are encouraged to meet with the staff in the Financial Aid Office to discuss their particular situation.</p><p>The College reserves the right to dismiss any student who is not in good academic standing (at least a 2.000 cumulative GPA), whose conduct has been found to be in violation of College policies and procedures, or whose continuance would be detrimental to his/ her own health or to the health and well-being of others.</p><p>Academic dismissal with right of appeal can be made for the following reasons:</p><p> First year students and new transfer students whose GPA is 0.5000 or less after one semester  Students whose semester GPA is less than 2.0000 for two consecutive semesters -As part of their appeal students are also required to present an Academic Action Plan, prepared with the assistance of the Student Academic Support Center.</p><p>-Failure to include an Academic Action Plan will result in the appeal being considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by Academic Standings.</p><p>Student appeals of their dismissal from the college must be received by the Academic Dean's Office no later than that appeal deadline stated in the letter or email from the Dean's Office notifying them of their dismissal. Late submissions of appeals will not be accepted.</p><p>Students are advised that academic reinstatement does not affect the suspension of their financial aid. Students must appeal loss of their financial aid separately.</p><p>Academic dismissal without the right of appeal can be made for the following reason:</p><p> Students readmitted on appeal who do not maintain a semester GPA of 2.0000  Student who were below a 2.0000 for more than 2 semesters  A semester GPA below a .500 in a semester other than their first semester at Rosemont College.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Book and Course Material Rental Program</head><p>All students will be automatically enrolled in the College's book and course material rental program, in partnership with the College's bookstore, and will be billed accordingly. The program provides a fixed charge of $25 for each credit hour for which a student is registered. That means for a typical 3-credit course, students will pay a fixed rate of $75 for the rental of all required books and course materials for that course. The College estimates that the new rental program will save Rosemont students an average of 35% per year on the cost of textbooks and other course materials. More information on this program can be found at: www.rosemont.edu/UCBookRental.

The date of withdrawal, drop, or leave of absence is determined as being the time the Director of the Student Academic Support Center receives written notice from the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate College Tuition Refund Policy</head><p>A student who withdraws from semester-length classes may be entitled to a refund according to the schedule listed below. Fees are not refundable, except for those classes that have been canceled by the College or for students who have withdrawn before the first day of classes. The date of a Drop/Add or Withdrawal is determined by the records of the Office of the Registrar, not the date the student stops attending class. The percentage of tuition to be refunded to the student is as follows:</p><p> Students who withdraw before the first day of classes will receive 100% refund of tuition.  Students who withdraw during the first and second weeks of a new semester will receive 80% refund of tuition.  Students who withdraw during the third week of a new semester will receive 50% refund of tuition.  Students who withdraw during the fourth week of a new semester will receive 20% refund of tuition No refunds will be issued to students that withdraw after the fourth week of class.</p><p>The first scheduled meeting of a class constitutes the beginning of the refund period for that class.

Financial aid is adjusted accordingly with regard to the number of credits that have been dropped. If a student withdraws, or if a credit balance results from financial aid awards or student overpayment, a refund may be expected in the mail within a timely manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refunds for Dropped Classes in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies</head><p>A student who drops a class prior to the first scheduled meeting of a class may be entitled to a full refund if the class is formally dropped. If a student drops a class prior to the second scheduled meeting of a class, they will be entitled to an 80% refund if the class is formally dropped. If a class is dropped after the second scheduled meeting of a class, the student is not entitled to a refund. The date of a drop is determined by the records of the Office of the Registrar, not the date the student stops attending class. The refund period may change based upon the length or nature of the class. For example, Turbo classes must be dropped prior to the first scheduled class meeting. Please Note: financial aid is adjusted accordingly with regard to the number of credits that have been dropped. If you are an undergraduate student and you drop below 6 credit hours for the semester, all of your aid may have to be returned. If you are a graduate student and you drop below 4.5 credit hours for the semester, all of your aid may have to be returned. It is advisable that you consult with the Financial Aid Officer regarding the ramifications of dropping a class.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head><p>Rosemont College is committed to helping all qualified students afford a Rosemont education. Financial assistance is available to degree-seeking students or students seeking certain graduate certificates who are United States citizens or eligible non-citizens and who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis. Financial aid may consist of scholarships, grants, loans, employment, or any combination of these programs. Financial aid awards are made for one year only. A student must re-apply for financial aid each year to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional funds. Financial aid eligibility is reviewed every year and is subject to changes in family financial conditions, federal and state regulations, and/or Rosemont College policies. In addition, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress. For specific information regarding the availability of need based financial aid, please contact the Financial Aid Office at 610.520-3115. For information about merit scholarships for traditional undergraduate students, new applicants should contact the Office of Admissions at (610) 527-0200 ext. 2966.</p><p>Students wishing to be considered for any form of financial aid MUST complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the required deadline each year. The FAFSA deadline for priority review is February 15 (January 15 for admitted students).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verification Policy</head><p>Approximately one third of FAFSA filers are selected for verification. A requirement of the U.S. Department of Education, verification is the process of confirming information submitted on the FAFSA. Students are responsible for submitting requested information to complete the verification process before the semester begins. Federal student aid will remain estimated and will not be credited to the student's account until verification is complete. Additionally, students awarded Federal Work Study may not begin employment until verification is complete.</p><p>Items to be verified include: Adjusted Gross Income, U.S. income tax paid, number of family members in the household, the number of family members enrolled in post-secondary schools at least half time, untaxed income, and any other conflicting information.</p><p>Students are notified in writing by the Financial Aid Office of the documents needed to complete verification, and the following documents are those generally required to complete the process:</p><p> Student's federal income tax return transcript from the prior prior year  Parents' federal income tax return transcript from prior prior year (for dependent students)  Spouse's income tax return transcript for prior prior year (for married independent students)  Verification worksheet  Additional documents upon request Students are encouraged to utilize the IRS data retrieval tool on the FAFSA as a part of the verification process. If students and parents are able to successfully download their tax information from the IRS into the FAFSA and submit with no changes, the tax documents listed above will be waived and the verification worksheet only is required. Upon receipt of the verification documents, the school will compare the information on the submitted documents with that on the FAFSA. If discrepancies are revealed, the school will make the necessary corrections, which could result in a change in aid eligibility. The school will notify the student in writing of any changes in eligibility due to verification within one week of completing the verification process.</p><p>The school will cease processing federal student aid for students who fail to submit the required verification documents before the deadline.</p><p>If a student is selected for verification after federal student aid funds have already disbursed, the school will withhold all future disbursements of federal student aid until verification is complete. If verification results in the student's ineligibility for aid that has been previously disbursed, then the student is responsible for repaying aid for which they are not eligible. The school will notify the student in writing requesting full payment of the overpayment of ineligible aid. Any student in an overpayment status who fails to repay the overpayment or make satisfactory repayment arrangements will be reported to the U.S. Department of Education and/or to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and remain ineligible for further federal student aid until the overpayment is resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfactory Academic Progress</head><p>In order to be eligible for federal student aid, a student must be making Satisfactory Academic Progress toward degree completion requirements. Federal regulations require schools to monitor academic progress annually or more frequently to ensure each student is meeting minimum qualitative and quantitative standards. Any student not meeting either of these minimum standards at the time of evaluation will become ineligible and will remain ineligible for federal student aid until both standards are again met.</p><p>In accordance with federal regulations, Rosemont College's policy is to monitor academic progress for students in the Undergraduate College at the end of the spring semester. Academic progress for students in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies is measured at the end of the spring semester as well. In order to be making Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 (qualitative standard) for undergraduates or 3.0 for students enrolled in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies. A student must also have passed at least 67% of the credits attempted (quantitative standard). Any courses with a grade of "W" or "I" will count as classes not successfully passed. Any transfer credits shall count as credits attempted and completed but will not impact the grade point average standard. These academic progress standards apply even for semesters in which a student did not receive federal student aid.</p><p> Students who fail to meet the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress will be notified in writing by the Financial Aid Office and their financial aid will be suspended.  Students who fail to meet the academic progress standard may submit an appeal with the Financial Aid Office prior to the start of the next academic semester. The appeal form is available electronically at:</p><p>SAP appeal form -Appeals should specify mitigating circumstances, such as illness or death in the family that prevented the student from achieving satisfactory academic progress. -The Financial Aid Office may request additional documentation to support the appeal. -The student will be notified in writing of the outcome of the appeal.  If the appeal is granted the student will be placed in a status of financial aid probation for one semester. The student may also be required to complete an Academic Action Plan with the student academic support center (undergraduates) or student services (graduate and professional studies students) if it is determined it is not possible for the student to meet the qualitative and quantitative standards to make Satisfactory Academic Progress after just one semester's coursework.  If the appeal is denied the student will remain ineligible until both standards are met Students will also become ineligible for aid if they have not graduated within completing 150% of the required hours needed to complete their program as defined in the Rosemont College Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Return of Title IV Funds Policy</head><p>The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these situations.</p><p>If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term, the financial aid office recalculates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed = the number of days completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid.</p><p>Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned = (100% of the aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed during the payment period or term.</p><p>If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IV funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit balance to the institution.</p><p>If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him/her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal disbursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal.</p><p>The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after the date of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal.</p><p>Refunds are allocated in the following order: Federal Work Study-campus employment and some off-campus community service positions are available to a limited number of students with financial need. An award listed is an eligibility indicator; students will need to apply for consideration for a position. Positions are competitive and eligibility as listed on a financial aid award letter is not a guarantee of the ability to secure a position.</p><p>State Grant-grant funds awarded to undergraduate students based on eligibility according to each state's guidelines. For Pennsylvania residents, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be processed before May 1 for full consideration for a PHEAA Grant. Students receiving a PHEAA Grant must pass at least 24 credits during each academic year that a full-time state grant award is received in order to make academic progress for future state grant awards. Students must also be enrolled in at least 50% of their coursework on site versus online or they could receive a reduced grant. Students receiving a grant from a state other than Pennsylvania should check with their state agency regarding academic requirements for renewal and to see if it is transferrable to Pennsylvania.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)</head><p>What is FERPA? FERPA requires that federally funded institutions, under programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, comply with certain procedures with regard to disclosing and maintaining educational records. FERPA was not enacted to preclude the disclosure of educational records simply because the records identify a student by name; rather, it was designed to protect the student's educational information and status as a student. Parents should understand that their rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a postsecondary school at any age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who is a student?</head><p>According to FERPA, a student is an individual who is enrolled in and actually attends an educational institution. The regulations provide that attendance includes, but is not limited to, attendance in person or by correspondence. Individuals who "attend" classes but are not physically located on a campus are also students, thus including those who attend classes by video conference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic information and telecommunications technologies.</p><p>FERPA prohibits the disclosure of a student's "protected information" to a third party. This disclosure is prohibited whether it is made by hand delivery, verbally, fax, mail, or electronic transmission. Disclosure also includes the provision of access to the educational institution's career center database of student resumes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What information is protected?</head><p>FERPA classifies protected information into three categories: educational information, personally identifiable information (PII) and directory information. The limitations imposed by FERPA vary with respect to each category.</p><p>Personally identifiable information can only be disclosed if the educational institution obtains the signature of the student on a document specifically identifying the information to be disclosed, the reason for the disclosure, and the parties to whom the disclosure will be made. Examples of PII include: student's name, date of birth, student ID or SSN, and other information which can be used to distinguish an individual's identity in relation to academic records.</p><p>Educational information cannot be disclosed without prior approval of the student. FERPA defines "education records" as "records, files, documents, and other materials" that are "maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a person acting for such agency or institution." This includes transcripts, GPA, grades, social security number, and academic evaluations, and records that pertain to an individual's previous attendance as a student of an institution.</p><p>Directory information can be disclosed by the institution without consent. Directory information is defined as "information contained in an education record of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed." This includes such items as a list of students' names, addresses, and telephone numbers, and also includes a student ID number (which includes electronic identifiers) provided it cannot be used to gain access to education records. Directory information, however, does not include a student's social security number nor can the social security number be used to confirm directory information. If a student decides to "opt out" of the disclosure of directory information, the "opt out" continues indefinitely.</p><p>What does the release cover? Rosemont College cannot provide information about a student's academic records, including performance in a class, grades, or registrations to a third party without written consent by the student. Information will only be provided after the identity of the third party is verified. Student can revoke FERPA consent at any time.</p></div>

Faculty members have the discretion to accept work from, or schedule make-up exams or quizzes, for students who miss a class. Absences will affect students' grades in courses. The grade penalties are defined on the syllabus and are determined by the faculty member teaching the course.</p><p>Absences are counted from the first day of class. Late registrants will have absences accrued when they first meet a class.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education requires that all faculty must maintain detailed attendance records showing the student's last date of attendance in a course. If a student stops attending a class and does not withdrawal from the course during the prescribed time period a WN grade will be given. The WN grade is an administrative grade and will reflect the last date of the student's recorded attendance. Issuance of this grade may have financial implications for the student and impact financial aid.</p><p>Faculty have the option of submitting an "FX" grade to students who failed the course due to excessive absences. The FX grade is calculated as an "F" in the student's grade point average. For students receiving financial aid, failure from nonattendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of their financial aid. Faculty are required to provide the date when the student last attended.</p><p>If a class absence is necessary because of an activity being held in another course, the faculty member teaching that course will notify the Program Director and Academic Dean in advance of the activity. Students are not allowed more than one absence per semester due to a conflict with an activity sponsored by another course or a college organization. In the case of student athletes, refer to the Undergraduate Student Athlete Policy.</p><p>If a student must be absent due to serious injury or illness, or Family Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA), for more than two weeks, they should follow the Medical Leave of Absence Policy.

The History of Art curriculum is designed to educate students in the study of the visual culture of eastern and western civilizations, from the first marks man and woman made in caves through the contemporary art scene in the U.S. and abroad. Our many courses investigate painting, sculpture, architecture, the decorative arts, photography, and film in broad chronological and geographical exposure. Our many interdisciplinary courses explore areas of overlap between art, its making, women's issues, politics, language, criticism, and philosophy.</p><p>History of Art majors explore the History of Art Criticism, in helping to define why we think what we think and why we write what we write about the changing History of Art, based on its founding mothers and fathers.</p><p>History of Art majors are encouraged to travel abroad and experience the art of the world, first-hand. Internships help students secure on-site experience and job training at museums, galleries, advertising firms, and at many other venues.</p><p>All History of Art courses include integrated, interactive museum, gallery, or other service-learning components. These may be visits to and work in area museums and exhibiting galleries; organized travel-study options; symposia and panel discussions with educators, museum personnel, artists, conservationists, and art critics--depending on the focus and nature of the course.</p><p>Students may establish a major or minor course of study in the History of Art. Interested students are also invited to devise interdisciplinary majors linking the History of Art to other subject matters, such as foreign language, studio art, philosophy, gender studies, or other disciplines. Planning these curricula is done with the major advisor.</p></div>

The primary cause of all environmental problems is human behavior. These problems are not really problems of the environment, but are the result of a mismatch between the ways in which human beings fulfill their needs and the natural processes that maintain ecological integrity. As experts on human behavior, psychologists have the potential to serve a crucial role in halting our ecologically-destructive trajectory and promoting a sustainable future. This course will examine the connections between human behavior and its impact on the environment. It will address the need to promote environmentally responsible behaviors by applying cognitive and social theories to behaviors such as energy conservation, recycling, and material consumption.

Since the late 1960s, psychologists have studied the causes of moral, altruistic, and empathic behavior. They have examined also the dark side of human nature. Why do evil and suffering exist in the world? What are the psychological and social dynamics of how good people can turn evil? This course emphasizes a social-psychological perspective that centers on the complex interaction of personal and situational factors underpinning both good and evil behavior. That is, the conditions under which people are kind and helpful to others or, conversely, under which they commit harmful and even violent acts. The course explores various formulations of good and evil and the different answers given to it. Examination of key theories, concepts, and findings from research in social psychology as well as drawing on examples from history are the goals of this course. The lectures detail how both personal and situational forces can work in concert to transform human character for the better or worse.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 0160 COLLEGE WRITING I: COMP/CRIT THGHT Credits: 3</head><p>The first of the course's three principle assumptions is Rosemont College's School of Graduate and Professional Studies (SGPS) undergraduate programs are "reading and writing" intensive; students' opportunities for academic success are directly related to skills such as comprehension, interpretation, analysis and oral and written communication.</p><p>The college's tradition and philosophical underpinnings of "meeting the needs of the age" inspire the second assumption: Rosemont's SGPS programs target both the traditional student and the adult learner, i.e., individuals who are working, possibly raising a family, and may have been out of formal academic settings for years. The SGPS provides courses for learners who may not have the opportunity to continue or complete education within traditional educational settings. This open-ended acceptance of students from all walks of life, across all age cohorts, and across a diversity of living and educational experiences calls for all learners to begin their academic endeavors with a course that introduces concepts, clarifies expectations, and provides guidance for success.</p><p>The third assumption is based on the "learning curve." Because acceptance into the SGPS is not predicated on standardized test scores, students of all levels of experience and expertise enter the program equally. However, not every student is prepared for the demand and expectations that govern accelerated degree requirements. This particular course intends to identify those different levels of writing competence and guide students toward appropriate intervention when needed. This introductory course will help allay anxiety, assess needs, and direct learners toward a path of academic success. This course is designed to assist all learners to reflect, assess, and plan the path best suited for their personal development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROGRAM GOALS Goal 1: Ability to Structure and Craft Book-length Manuscripts</head><p>Upon graduation, students will be able to structure and craft a book-length manuscript according to the dictates and norms of their chosen genre. Objective 1(1) Students will demonstrate an understanding of the literary marketplace and the student's place in it by producing a manuscript in his or her given literary genre that is polished and marketable. Outcome 1-1(1) Students will study in depth how to analyze the works of both published writers and that of their peers, in almost all of the courses that they will take. For example students who wish to write a novel are encouraged to take CRW 7435 Novel Craft, which explores in depth the various craft elements that go into writing an effective novel.</p><p>Objective 2(1) Students will demonstrate the ability to revise manuscripts in their given literary genre, both working alone and as a participant in a workshop. Outcome 2-1(1) Students who are working on a short story collection are encouraged to take more than one section of CRW 7100 Prose Workshop, where they will craft new works as well as critique the work of peers, and read and analyze the work of published authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal 2: Ability to Think and Write Critically</head><p>Upon graduation, students will be able to write critically about structure, craft, and literary traditions regarding their own work, their classmates' work, and the work of published authors. Objective 1(2) Demonstrate an understanding of both complex literary texts and the work of fellow writers by producing critical writings, including reviews, literary analyses, craft essays, and reader responses. Outcome 1-1(2) In courses such as CRW 7443 The Full Range of Experience: Making the Personal Fictional, students will read a variety of texts and respond to those texts by writing both fiction and nonfiction, and will analyze the texts through discussion and formal response. Students will then engage in workshop where they will read and respond to each other's work.</p><p>Outcome 1-2(2) This objective is addressed in all of the Literature courses, which are taught as seminars. In LIT 7045 Self-Portraits in Literature, for example, students will read a variety of memoirs and narrative first person poetry. Then they will analyze the texts within the framework of how writers shape their experience and try to define themselves in their art through written responses and journaling. Objective 2(2) Demonstrate the ability to write and verbally provide constructive and critical feedback on basic craft elements for their given literary genre. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal 3: Prepare Students for lives as Professional Writers, Teachers, and Members of Diverse Literary Communities</head><p>Upon graduation MFA students will demonstrate the ability to teach creative writing in workshops, classrooms, conferences, writing groups, panels, and online classes, as well as, participate in the larger community of writers as members of writing groups, bloggers, interviewers, and interviewees. Students will also be prepared to work as educators, literary journal editors, and authors. Objective 1(3) Demonstrate the ability to teach creative writing and expository writing on the university level and in a variety of professional and academic venues. Outcome 1-1(3) This outcome is achieved most directly through two courses, although all courses, even workshops, require some academic writing. The first, LIT-7042 Rhetoric and Composition, teaches students composition pedagogies and the compositional and rhetorical practices associated with them. As writers, readers, teachers, and scholars, students develop the skills and experience to teach, develop, and assess critical reading, writing, and research skills in the composition classroom. The second, LIT-7041 Introduction to Critical Theory: Exploring Meaning teaches students the discipline of critical thought and its use in the study of literature and art.</p><p>Outcome 1-2(3) This outcome is achieved primarily through CRW-7440 Workshopping the Workshop, although all workshops help prepare students to run and teach their own. CRW 7440 specifically prepares students for the task of teaching writing workshops in college and graduate settings, as well, prepare students to run workshops for adults in non-credit community settings. Students read and discuss academic writings on pedagogical theory, group process/dynamics theory, and lead their own writing workshop.</p><p>Objective 2(3) Demonstrate information literacy skills and learn to value engagement with literary communities, by evaluating publications and publishers, by presenting creative and critical work for submission using the appropriate formatting and style (MLA, Chicago, APA) and attending and participating in literary events and programs. Outcome 2-1(3) This outcome is achieved through many of our special topics courses such as CRW-7425 Surviving as a Writer.</p><p>In this course students learn how to apply for college adjunct positions, how to evaluate literary journals and submit their work for publication, how to write query letters and find an agent, and also how to manage work and a writing life.</p><p>Outcome 2-2(3) Students are required to learn and demonstrate a mastery of MLA style for all critical papers written in the program. Knowledge of Chicago style is also emphasized in classes that stress manuscript preparation, and APA style is specifically covered in LIT-7042 for those students who wish to teach English composition on the college level.</p><p>Outcome 2-3(3) Students have many opportunities to participate in MFA sponsored literary events and those outside the Rosemont College community. Many of these events are free or offered to students at a reduced fee. Students are encouraged to serve as readers for literary magazines and to actively submit their work for publication. </p></div>

Respect for others and their property and the responsibility of one's own actions is expected of everyone: students, staff, administrators, and faculty. While the college does not have a written policy regarding students with criminal records, the Admissions Office application and screening process is exceedingly thorough.Campus security is monitored around the clock by the Director, full-time and part-time Public Safety Officers. All attend mandatory in-service training programs, which are updated regularly; a CPR and basic First-Aid course, and most have obtained PA State Act 235 Security Officer Certification.Public Safety Officers conduct vehicle, bicycle, and foot patrols and are charged with the enforcement of federal, state, and local laws, as well as College policies and procedures. While Public Safety Officers do not carry firearms and do not have police powers of arrest, they maintain a close working relationship with the Lower Merion Township Police Department, who assist as needed. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for promoting a secure and safe environment for all campus members and guests.</figDesc><table /><note>Note: The full text of the Department of Public Safety's Policies and Procedures can be found on the iWay.Rosemont College complies with all federal, state, and local laws.

The biology department offers two courses (Science for Life and Science Issues) that fulfill the general education requirement. Science for Life (BIO 0115) examines current topics in science that are relevant to our society. Science Issues (BIO 0130) provides a deeper exploration of biological principles and concepts. Science Issues (BIO 0130and Science Issues Laboratory (BIO 0131) are prerequisites for students that would like to major in Biology, but do not place into College Algebra (MAT 0115), to take General Biology I (BIO 0150). Students in Science Issues Lecture and Laboratory must obtain a minimum grade of B in both courses to continue into General Biology I (BIO 150&amp; 151). Chemistry in Everyday Life (CHE 0115) can be substituted for Science Issues Lecture only. A minimum grade requirement of B in Chemistry in Everyday Life is still required.</figDesc><table><row><cell>PROGRAM GOALS</cell></row><row><cell>GOAL I: Construct foundational knowledge from different fields</cell></row><row><cell>of biology.</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Students in these joint programs should work closely with their academic advisor to complete the appropriate courses and meet all of the program requirements. In addition to meeting the course requirements all students must also fulfill the General Education Requirements for the Undergraduate College. The Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology, Biology Track requires 120 credits. The Environmental Science track provides a strong foundation in the sciences which could then be applied to solve ecological issues which are fundamental to solving ecological issues at a policy and/or social level. Issues relating to protecting the environment and achieving sustainable development continue to be priorities at the local, national, and global levels. Contemporary environmental quality problems include management of biodiversity, air and water pollution, as well as the investigation of the link between human health and environment. Examples of areas that environmental professionals work in include the evaluation and management of resources at governmental and corporate levels, policy and implementation of global warming concerns, scientific and laboratory assessment as well as research opportunities in academia and the non-profit sector. This track promotes an interdisciplinary approach to environmental issues through both coursework and independent study/internship experience allowing students to address all parameters important in sustainable development. The Environmental Science Track requires 52 credits of courses in biology and chemistry. In addition to meeting the course requirements all students must also fulfill the General Education requirements for the Undergraduate College. The Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology, Environmental Science Track requires 120 credits. Health track prepares students for entry to graduate programs in the biological sciences or professional training in the medical sciences and allied health fields. This track is also required for completion of the joint programs with the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) Program, the University of the Sciences Pharm.D (Doctor of Pharmacy) and DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) Programs and the Salus University Master in Physician Assistant.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_51"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The Bachelor of Science in Accounting provides a strong foundation in areas of financial accounting and reporting, cost and managerial accounting, auditing, and federal income taxation. The major prepares students to have insight into the language, theory, and principles of accounting for careers in the private sector, industry, governmental, not-for-profit, and public accounting. The Bachelor of Science in Finance provides a specialization for students who want to pursue graduate studies and/or employment within this field. The major in Finance prepares students to work in the fields of banking, insurance, financial analysis, wealth and investment management, in the government sector: raising and deploying capital, providing support for day-to-day cash management and pension fund support. Students completing the Bachelor of Science in Finance will be well prepared to sit for the first level of the Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) or the Certified Financial Planning (CFP) exams. There is a fundamental shift occurring in the world economy in which there is movement toward an elimination of barriers to cross border business, trade and investment. Advances in technology and telecommunications have increased this interdependence by shrinking distance and allowing for an interdependent world economy, known as globalization. The Rosemont College international business program provides students with the knowledge, skills, and understanding to succeed in this rapidly changing world economy.To qualify for the Bachelor of Science in International Business, a student must complete the Business Core (40-45 credits) plus the Major Specific Courses (18 credits): Students majoring in Management take courses in all the major functional areas of business. These courses emphasize application of knowledge and theories to organizational situations, preparing students for entry into the business community. The liberal arts courses taken by the students enable them to attain proficiency in communication skills and critical thinking as they become responsible members of society.</figDesc><table><row><cell>BUS 0320</cell><cell>Legal Environment of Business</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell>BUS 0425</cell><cell cols="2">Fundamentals of Export-Import</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>BUS 0455</cell><cell>Internship or Study Abroad</cell><cell></cell><cell>1-6</cell><cell></cell><cell>Operations</cell></row><row><cell>BUS 0490</cell><cell>Senior Seminar</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell>BUS 0445</cell><cell>Supply Chain Management</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">1 Business or Accounting Elective</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">B.S., BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ACCOUNTING</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">B.S., BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MANAGEMENT</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">To qualify for the Bachelor of Science in Accounting, a student</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="3">must complete the Business Core (40-45 credits) plus the</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">To qualify for the Bachelor of Science in Management, a</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Major Specific Courses (18 credits):</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">student must complete the Business Core (40-45 credits) plus</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">the Major Specific Courses (18 credits):</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Required Courses (18 credits)</cell><cell cols="2">CREDITS</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>ACC 0210</cell><cell>Intermediate Accounting I</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell cols="2">Required Courses (18 credits)</cell><cell>CREDITS</cell></row><row><cell>ACC 0220</cell><cell>Intermediate Accounting II</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell>BUS 0340</cell><cell>Organizational Behavior</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>ACC 0350</cell><cell>Auditing</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell>BUS 0350</cell><cell>Marketing</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>ACC 0410</cell><cell>Federal Income Taxes</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell>BUS 0380</cell><cell>Strategic Policy</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>ACC 0450</cell><cell>Advanced Accounting I</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell>BUS 0445</cell><cell>Supply Chain Management</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">1 Business or Accounting Elective</cell><cell></cell><cell>3</cell><cell cols="2">2 Business or Accounting Electives</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">B.S., BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN FINANCE</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">B.S., BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MARKETING</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">The Bachelor of Science in Marketing provides a specialization</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">in marketing for students wishing to pursue a career in this</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">field or who are interested in pursuing graduate studies in</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">business.
