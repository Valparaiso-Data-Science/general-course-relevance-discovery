<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History of Smith College</head><p>Smith College is a distinguished liberal arts college committed to providing the highest quality undergraduate education for women to enable them to develop their intellects and talents and to participate effectively and fully in society. Smith began in the 19th century in the mind and conscience of a New England woman. In her will, Sophia Smith articulated her vision of a liberal arts college for women, with the purpose that "women's 'wrongs' will be redressed, their wages adjusted, their weight of influence in reforming the evils of society will be greatly increased as teachers, as writers, as mothers, as members of society, their power for good will be incalculably enlarged." Through its commitment to academic excellence and its active engagement with the issues of our time, Smith remains faithful to its founder's ideals.</p><p>The college envisioned by Sophia Smith and her minister, John M. Greene, resembled many other old New England colleges in its religious orientation, with all education at the college "pervaded by the Spirit of Evangelical Christian Religion" but "without giving preference to any sect or denomination. <ref type="bibr">"</ref> Smith has changed much since its founding in 1871. But throughout its history there have been certain enduring constants: an uncompromising defense of academic and intellectual freedom, an attention to the relation between college education and the larger public issues of world order and human dignity, and a concern for the rights and privileges of women.</p><p>Indeed, at a time when most people had narrow views of women's abilities and their proper role in society, Sophia Smith showed not only concern with the particular needs of young women but also faith in their still underdeveloped powers. After enumerating the subjects that continue to be a vital part of the college's curriculum, she added:</p><p>And in such other studies as coming times may develop or demand for the education of women and the progress of the race, I would have the education suited to the mental and physical wants of women. It is not my design to render my sex any the less feminine, but to develop as fully as may be the powers of womanhood, and furnish women with the means of usefulness, happiness and honor now withheld from them. In the fall of 1875, Smith College opened with 14 students and six faculty members under the presidency of Laurenus Clark Seelye. Its small campus was planned to make the college part of what John M. Greene called "the real practical life" of a New England town, rather than a sequestered academic preserve. College Hall, the Victorian Gothic administrative and classroom building, domi-nated the head of Northampton's Main Street. For study and worship, students used the town's well-endowed public library and various churches. Instead of a dormitory, students lived in a "cottage," where life was more familial than institutional. Thus began the "house" system that, with some modifications, the college still employs today. The main lines of Smith's founding educational policy, laid down in President Seelye's inaugural address, remain valid today: then as now, the standards for admission were as high as those of the best colleges for men; then as now, a truly liberal education was fostered by a broad curriculum of the humanities, the fine arts and the natural and social sciences.</p><p>During the 35 years of President Seelye's administration, the college prospered mightily. Its assets grew from Sophia Smith's original bequest of about $400,000 to more than $3,000,000; its faculty to 122; its student body to 1,635; its buildings to 35. These buildings included Alumnae Gymnasium, site of the first women's basketball game, which now houses the College Archives and is connected to the William Allan Neilson Library, one of the best-resourced undergraduate libraries in the country.</p><p>Smith's second president, Marion LeRoy Burton, took office in 1910. President Burton, a graduate of Yale Divinity School, was a gifted public speaker with an especially acute business sense. He used these talents to help the college raise the amazing sum of $1,000,000-a huge endowment campaign for any college at that time. With the college's increased endowment, President Burton was able to boost faculty salaries substantially and improve the faculty-to-student ratio. President Burton's fund drive also invigorated the alumnae, bringing them closer to the college than ever before and increasing their representation on the board of trustees.</p><p>Along with improving the financial state and business methods of the college, President Burton contributed to a revision of the curriculum and initiated college honors programs to recognize outstanding students. He also helped to organize a cooperative admission system among Smith, Mount Holyoke, Wellesley and Vassar, the finest women's colleges of the day. President Burton's accomplishments are commemorated today by Burton Hall, the science building that his fund drive helped to finance. When William Allan Neilson became president in 1917, Smith was already one of the largest women's colleges in the world. President Neilson shrewdly developed the advantages of large academic institutions while maintaining the benefits of a small one. Under his leadership, the size of the faculty continued to increase while the number of students remained at about 2,000. The curriculum was revised to provide a pattern still followed in many American colleges-a broad foundation in various fields of knowledge, later complemented by the more intensive study of a major subject. The college expanded honors programs and initiated interdepartmental majors in science, landscape architecture and theatre. The School for Social Work, a coeducational graduate program, was founded. And more college houses were built, mainly in the Georgian complex called "the Quad," so that every student could live on campus.</p><p>Not only did President Neilson help make Smith College one of the leading colleges in the United States, whether for men or women, but he also developed it into an institution of international distinction and concerns. President Neilson, himself a Scotsman, married to a well-educated German woman, transformed the college from a high-minded but provincial community in the hinterland of Massachusetts into a cosmopolitan center constantly animated by ideas from abroad. Between the two world wars, he brought many important exiled or endangered foreign teachers, scholars, lecturers and artists to the college. Meanwhile, as long as peace lasted, Smith students went to study in France, Italy and Spain on the Junior Year Abroad Program instituted by the college in 1924.</p><p>President Neilson retired in 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, and for one year Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, an alumna trustee, served as acting president. Herbert Davis took office as Smith's fourth president in 1940 and reaffirmed the contributions that a liberal arts college could make to a troubled world. Already during World War I a group of Smith alumnae had gone to France to do relief work in the town of Gr√©court; a replica of Gr√©court's chateau gates is now emblematic of the college.</p><p>Soon after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, the college agreed to provide facilities on its campus for the first Officers' Training Unit of the Women's Reserve, or WAVES. The college added a summer term from 1942 to 1945 so some students could graduate more quickly and go on to government, hospital or military service. Though physically isolated by travel restrictions, the college retained its cosmopolitan character as refugees came to lecture, teach and study. And foreign films were shown regularly in Sage Hall-a practice that would give generations of students their sensitivity both to other cultures and to an important, relatively new art. President Davis' administration was marked by intensified academic life, reflecting his belief that serious study was a way of confronting the global threat to civilization.</p><p>Benjamin Fletcher Wright came from Harvard to become Smith's fifth president in 1949. The college had by then resumed its regular calendar and completed several much-needed building projects, including a new heating plant and a student recreation center named for retiring President Davis. The most memorable achievements of President Wright's administration were the strengthening of Smith's financial position and the defense of academic freedom during the 1950s.</p><p>In 1950, the $7 Million Fund Drive was triumphantly completed, enabling the college to improve facilities and increase faculty salaries. In 1955, the Helen Hills Hills Chapel was completed, giving Smith its own place of worship. The early 1950s were not, though, easy years for colleges; McCarthyism bred a widespread suspicion of any writing or teaching that might seem left of center. In defending his faculty members' right to political and intellectual independence, President Wright showed great courage and statesmanship. Complementing his achievements was the financial and moral support of Smith's Alumnae Association, by now the most devoted and active group of its kind in the country. Before President Wright's term ended, the college received a large gift for constructing a new faculty office and classroom building to be named for him.</p><p>When Thomas Corwin Mendenhall came from Yale in 1959 to become Smith's sixth president, both the college and the country at large were enjoying peace and prosperity. During the 1960s, social and cultural changes stirred the college profoundly, and a series of powerful movements influenced the larger society and the academic world alike. In response to the needs of increasingly independent and ambitious students, the curriculum was thoroughly revised. Collegewide requirements were set aside and independent study encouraged. The college made more varied educational experiences available to Smith undergraduates by extending cooperation with its neighbors-Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts. And Smith joined other private colleges in the Northeast to develop the Twelve College Exchange Program. The college added buildings with the most modern facilities for the study of the natural sciences, performing arts and fine arts. The new fine arts center included the Smith College Museum of Art, now one of the most distinguished college museums in the country. To promote women's fitness, the college began plans to build Ainsworth gymnasium.</p><p>The 1960s saw the civil rights, the students' rights and the anti-war movements take root and grow at many of the country's universities and colleges, including Smith. Thanks to these movements and to the wisdom, tact and humor of President Mendenhall, the college emerged from the 1960s with a more precise awareness of student needs and an active, practical sense of social responsibility.</p><p>Meanwhile, life in the college houses was changing. The old rules governing late evenings out and male visitors were relaxed, then abandoned. Not surprisingly, when Vassar began to admit men, and Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth to admit women as candidates for degrees, some members of the college community wondered whether Smith should also become coeducational. In 1971, a committee of trustees, faculty, administration, students and alumnae studied the question in detail. The committee concluded that admitting men as candidates for the Smith degree would detract from the founding purpose of the college-to provide the best possible education for women.</p><p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s another important movement-the women's movement-was gathering momentum. This was to have a profound effect on American society and to confirm the original purpose of Smith College. The college began its second century in 1975 by inaugurating its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway, who came to Smith from Australia by way of Harvard and the University of Toronto. She was a charismatic and energetic leader with a vision for women's education, and her administration was marked by three major accomplishments: a large-scale renovation and expansion of Neilson Library, evidence of Smith's undiminished concern for the heart of the liberal arts; the rapid growth of the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, through which women beyond the traditional college age could earn a Smith degree; and exceptionally successful fund-raising efforts. Also during President Conway's administration, the Career Development Office was expanded to better counsel Smith students and alumnae about career opportunities and graduate training for women. Recognizing the rapidly growing emphasis on fitness and athletics for women, Smith completed the Ainsworth Gymnasium and broke ground for new indoor and outdoor track and tennis facilities. President Conway's contributions underscored her commitment to women's colleges and a liberal arts education in today's society.</p><p>When Mary Maples Dunn came to Smith in 1985 after many years as a professor of history and then as dean of Bryn Mawr College, Smith's student body had diversified. During its early decades the student body had been overwhelmingly Protestant, but by the 1970s, Roman Catholic and Jewish college chaplains served alongside the Protestant chaplain. All racial, ethnic and religious groups are now well represented on campus, evidence of Smith's continuing moral and intellectual commitment to diversity.</p><p>In Dunn's decade as president, the college raised more than $300 million, constructed two major buildings and renovated many more, enhanced communication on and off campus, attracted record numbers of applicants (while upholding the same academic standards) and doubled the value of its endowment. Computer technology transformed the way Smith conducted its business. And the curriculum became broader in scope, with five new majors and increased course offerings in non-Western and neglected American cultures.</p><p>In 1995 Ruth Simmons became Smith's ninth president, the first African-American woman to head any top-ranked American college or university. Simmons galvanized the campus through an ambitious campuswide self-study process that resulted in a number of landmark initiatives, including Praxis, a program that allows every Smith student the opportunity to elect an internship funded by the college; an engineering program, the first at a women's college; programs in the humanities that include a poetry center and a peer-reviewed journal devoted to publishing scholarly works by and about women of color; and curricular innovations that include intensive seminars for first-year students and programs to encourage students' speaking and writing skills.</p><p>A number of building projects were launched during Simmons' administration; most significant was a $35-million expansion and renovation of the Smith College Museum of Art, art department and art library. Construction of the Campus Center began, and the Lyman Conservatory was renovated. Simmons left Smith in June 2001, assuming the presidency of Brown University. John M. Connolly, Smith's first provost, served as acting president for one year, skillfully guiding the college through the national trauma of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath.</p><p>A widely respected scholar of Victorian literature, Carol T. Christ took up her duties as Smith's 10th president in that year, leading the institution through the economic downturn of that year and the global financial crisis of 2008. Christ's administration was characterized by an energetic program of outreach, innovation and long-range planning-including financial and capital planning-to position Smith for optimal success in a changing higher education landscape. She launched a review, conducted by members of the Smith faculty and outside Mission and History scholars, to determine the distinctive intellectual traditions of the Smith curriculum and areas on which to build. Issued in 2007, The Smith Design for Learning: A Plan to Reimagine a Liberal Arts Education builds upon Smith's history of pedagogical innovation, identifying priority areas-among them, global studies, environmental sustainability, and community engagement-for significant investment over the coming decade.</p><p>In the area of capital planning, a number of major building projects came to fruition during Christ's tenure: the renovation and expansion of the Brown Fine Arts Center; a dramatic new Campus Center; a renovated Lyman Conservatory; the impressive Olin Fitness Center; new homes for the Poetry Center and the Mwangi Cultural Center; the renovation of Lilly Hall, home of the college's School for Social Work; and the construction of Conway House, an apartment building for Ada Comstock Scholars with children. Ford Hall, a state-of-the-art, sustainably designed classroom and laboratory facility named in recognition of its lead donor, the Ford Motor Company Fund, opened in 2009; it serves as home to the college's pioneering Picker Engineering Program as well as the departments of molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry and computer science. Under Christ's leadership, Smith made significant commitments to environmental sustainability in its curriculum and campus operations, including the construction of a cogeneration facility for power and heat and the dedication of the MacLeish Field Station, a 200-acre woodland tract in Whately, Mass., for environmental education and research.</p><p>Over the decade of Christ's leadership, the student body became notably more diverse and international, reflecting a commitment to educating students who are prepared to assume leadership roles around the world. Christ extended Smith's global ties, through partnerships such as Women's Education Worldwide, an organization of women's colleges in 20 countries, and the Women in Public Service Project, a founding partnership of the Department of State and the five leading U.S. women's colleges to train a new generation of women to enter the public sector with the skills and passion to address global challenges.</p><p>Smith's 11th president, Kathleen McCartney, took office in 2013. McCartney, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), is an internationally recognized authority on child development and early education. The first in her family to go to college, she graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University with a bachelor of science in psychology, and later earned a doctorate in psychology from Yale University. A signature accomplishment of her tenure at HGSE was the creation of a three-year doctorate in educational leadership developed in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government.</p><p>Since assuming the presidency, McCartney has led a strategic planning effort that is resulting in important new academic and co-curricular programs that expand opportunities for women. She has forged partnerships with leading organizations, including the Harvard/MIT online education platform known as edX; the MassMutual Life Insurance Company, a supporter of data science initiatives; and the Posse Foundation. Under her leadership, Smith has engaged noted architectural designer Maya Lin to re-envision its historic Neilson Library in the context of its renowned Frederick Law Olmsted-designed campus. The $100 million project is scheduled for completion in 2020. Women for the World: The Campaign for Smith, which McCartney led to its culmination in 2016, raised $486 million, setting a record for the largest and most successful campaign ever undertaken by a women's college. Notably, the campaign raised close to $130 million for financial aid, including 103 new endowed scholarships.</p><p>In one of her first addresses to the Smith community, McCartney celebrated the college's long tradition of providing access to a Smith education to any tal-ented and ambitious young woman who seeks it. "We must remain committed to recruiting and supporting students regardless of the resources their secondary schools could offer, regardless of their family's circumstances and regardless of society's low expectations for some," she said. "Education for women and girls is the human rights issue of our time. <ref type="bibr">"</ref> Smith continues to benefit from a dynamic relationship between innovation and tradition. The college is very much a part of Northampton, a vibrant cultural center. Students still live in college houses, each with its own common rooms, in accord with the original "cottage" plan. And while Smith's curriculum of the humanities, arts and sciences still flourishes, the college continues to respond to emerging intellectual developments, offering majors or interdepartmental programs in such fields as engineering, environmental science and policy, data sciences, the study of women and gender, Global South development, neuroscience, Latin American and Latino/a studies, and Jewish studies, as well as concentrations-programs combining intellectual and practical experience-in such areas as archives, museum studies and global financial institutions. A vigorous culture of student-faculty research and scholarship continues to characterize the Smith experience, evidenced in part by the receipt of record-setting funding from the National Science Foundation over the last decade. Were Sophia Smith to visit the campus today she would no doubt find her vision realized, as students at her college, young women of extraordinary promise and ambition, prepare themselves for lives of leadership and distinction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smith: A Liberal Arts College</head><p>The tradition of the liberal arts reaches back into classical antiquity. Training the mind through the study of languages, literature, history, culture, society, mathematics, science, the arts and philosophy has for centuries been the favored approach in Europe and America for educating leaders. It is a general training, not intended as a preparation for any one profession. In the 19th century the liberal arts were characterized as providing "the discipline and furniture of the mind: expanding its powers, and storing it with knowledge," to which was added, "The former of these is, perhaps, the more important of the two." At many liberal arts colleges today this ideal is understood as implying both breadth and depth in each student's course of studies, as well as the acquisition of crucial skills in writing, public speaking and quantitative reasoning.</p><p>From its foundation in 1871 Smith has taken a progressive, expansive and student-oriented view of its role as a liberal arts college. To the studies of the humanities and sciences the college early added courses in art and music, a substantial innovation for its time. In the same spirit the faculty has continued to integrate the new and the old, respecting all the while the individual needs of, and differences among, its students. As an early dean of the faculty wrote, it "is always the problem of education, to secure the proper amount of system and the due proportion of individual liberty, to give discipline to the impulsive and wayward and largeness of opportunity to those who will make good use of it."</p><p>In the spirit of "individual liberty <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> largeness of opportunity" Smith College has since 1970 had no distribution requirements for graduation. In the interest of "discipline" each student must complete a major, to give depth to her studies, while to guarantee breadth she must take at least 64 credits outside the department or program of her major. As for "system," the college assigns each beginning student a faculty member as academic adviser; each student later chooses a major adviser. Students, in consultation with their advisers, are expected to select a curriculum that has both breadth and depth, engages with cultures other than their own, and develops critical skills in writing, public speaking, and quantitative reasoning.</p><p>The Smith faculty strongly recommends that students "pursue studies in the seven major fields of knowledge" listed below. Completion of a course in each of these areas is a condition for Latin Honors at graduation: to be eligible each student must take at least one course in each of the seven areas. Students who complete a course in each area will receive Liberal Arts Commendation and this will be noted on their transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Curriculum</head><p>Each discipline within the liberal arts framework offers students a valid perspective on the world's past, present and future. Therefore, we recommend that students pursue studies in the following seven major fields of knowledge: 1. Literature, either in English or in some other language, because it is a crucial form of expression, contributes to our understanding of human experience and plays a central role in the development of culture; 2. Historical studies, either in history or in historically oriented courses in art, music, religion, philosophy and theatre, because they provide a perspective on the development of human society and culture and free us from the parochialism of the present; 3. Social science, because it offers a systematic and critical inquiry into human nature, social institutions and human relationships; 4. Natural science, because of its methods, its contribution to our understanding of the world around us and its significance in modern culture;</p><p>5. Mathematics and analytic philosophy, because they foster an understanding of the nature and use of formal, rational thought; 6. The arts, because they constitute the media through which people have sought, through the ages, to express their deepest feelings and values; 7. A foreign language, because it frees one from the limits of one's own tongue, provides access to another culture and makes possible communication outside one's own society. We further recommend that students take performance courses offered in exercise and sport studies, because they provide opportunities for recreation, health and the development of skills for the complete person.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curricular Expectations and Requirements</head><p>In the course of their educations, Smith students are expected to become acquainted with-to master, as far as they are able-certain bodies of knowledge, but they are also expected to integrate that knowledge with their experience outside the classroom. The list below summarizes those curricular and co-curricular expectations. While acknowledging that education can never be defined by a listing of skills, the faculty believes that such a listing may usefully contribute to the planning of an education, and it offers the list below in that spirit, as an aid to students as they choose their courses and assess their individual progress, and to advisers as they assist in that process. The college's student learning goals, or the essential capacities, are the following:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Ability to engage across difference in place, culture and time ‚Ä¢ Creativity, curiosity and innovation ‚Ä¢ Critical and analytical thinking ‚Ä¢ Resilience and resourcefulness ‚Ä¢ Self-awareness as a learner</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Writing Requirement</head><p>Each first-year student is required, during her first or second semester at Smith, to complete with a grade of C-or higher at least one writing-intensive course. Based on their level of proficiency, students will be directed toward appropriate intensive writing courses. Ada Comstock Scholars and transfer students are also required to complete at least one writing-intensive course, with a grade of C-or higher, during their first two semesters at Smith. The WI requirement can be satisfied before matriculation based on transcript review by the registrar, in conjunction with the writing committee. Writing intensive courses devote a significant amount of class time to teaching students to write with precision, clarity, economy and some degree of elegance. That is to say, 1. to articulate a thesis or central argument, or to create a description or report, with an orderly sequence of ideas, apt transitions and a purpose clear to the intended audience; 2. to support an argument and to enrich an explanation with evidence; 3. when appropriate, to identify and to evaluate suitable primary and secondary sources for scholarly work, demonstrating awareness of library catalogues and databases and of the values and limitations of Internet resources; 4. to incorporate the work of others (by quotation, summary or paraphrase) concisely, effectively and with attention to the models of citation of the various disciplines and with respect for academic integrity; 5. to compose paragraphs that are unified and coherent; 6. to edit work until it is orderly, clear and free of violations of the conventions of standard written English (grammar, usage, punctuation, diction, syntax).</p><p>The Academic Program 12</p><p>The Academic Program For the bachelor of arts degree, there are no further required courses outside the student's field of concentration. The college does, however, make two demands of the student: that she complete a major and that she take at least 64 credits outside the department or program of her major. The curricular requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering are listed in the courses of study section under Engineering. Furthermore, students who wish to become eligible for Latin Honors at graduation or who wish to have Liberal Arts Commendation indicated on their transcripts must elect at least one course (normally four credits) in each of the seven major fields of knowledge listed previously. Each student has the freedom and responsibility to choose, with the help of her academic advisers, a course of studies to fit her individual needs and interests. The curricular expectations and requirements for the degree therefore allow great flexibility in the design of a course of study leading to the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Major</head><p>A student's program requires a minimum of 36 credits in a departmental or interdepartmental major. For the bachelor of arts degree, one-half of a student's total program, or at least 64 credits, shall be taken outside the department or program of the major. Any course (including prerequisites) which is explicitly listed in the catalogue as required for, or counting toward, fulfilling the requirements of the major shall be considered to be inside the major for the purposes of this rule. The sole exception to the 64-credit rule is that in the case of a major requiring study of two foreign languages taught within a single department or program, no fewer than 56 credits shall be taken outside the department or program of the major. The requirements for each major are described at the end of the course listings for each major department and program. Normally, cross-listed and dual-prefixed courses are also considered to be inside the major. Students should refer to the semester's schedule of classes for the most current information on cross-listed and dual-prefix courses. Students declare their majors no later than the registration period during the second semester of the sophomore year but may declare them earlier. Once the major is declared, a member of the faculty in the major department, either chosen or assigned, serves as the student's adviser.</p><p>Major programs are offered in the following areas: If the educational needs of the individual student cannot be met by a course of study in any of the specified majors, a student may design and undertake an interdepartmental major sponsored by advisers from at least two departments, subject to the approval of the Committee on Academic Priorities. Information on student-designed interdepartmental majors may be found below. Students in departmental majors or in student-designed interdepartmental majors may enter the honors program.</p><p>On its official transcripts, the college will recognize the completion of no more than two majors, or one major and one minor, or one major and one Five College Certificate for each student, even if the student chooses to complete the requirements for additional majors, minors or certificates. In addition, the college will recognize the completion of no more than one concentration for each student. Normally, only three courses from any one major may count toward both the student's major and the concentration. No minor or second major may be in the same department or program as the first major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Honors</head><p>The Departmental Honors Program is for qualified students who want to study a particular topic or undertake research that results in a significant thesis or project within their major department or program during the senior year. Interested students should consult the director of honors in the major department or program about application criteria, procedures and deadlines. Students must have permission of the major department or program to enter the Departmental Honors Program. Information regarding the Departmental Honors Program may also be obtained from the dean of the senior class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Minor</head><p>Students may consider the option of a minor in addition to a major. A minor consists of a sequence, designated by the faculty, of 20 to 24 credits from one or more departments. The minor may not be in the same department or program as the student's major. No more than two courses may be counted for both the major and the minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concentrations</head><p>A concentration gives students a way to organize a combination of intellectual and practical experiences, such as internships and service learning, around an area of interest. Students apply to concentrations and when selected they receive focused advising to help them design a program in their area of interest.</p><p>The concentration allows for more flexibility than is possible within an academic minor, and students can pursue a concentration alongside a minor or a second major.</p><p>The college currently offers the following concentrations: the archives concentration connects students with the Sophia Smith Collection, the College Archives and other archives and is designed to make our histories public through research projects and professional training; book studies connects students with the exceptional resources of the Mortimer Rare Book Room and the wealth of area book artists and craftspeople; the community engagement and social change concentration connects students to the Jandon Center for Community Engagement and helps students expand their understanding of local, national and global issues that affect communities and to develop the skills and values necessary to collaborate with communities as citizens and leaders; global financial institutions connects students to the Center for Women and Financial Independence and provides a course of study that combines academic courses, research, and fieldwork to deepen knowledge of global financial markets; the museums concentration connects students to the Smith College Museum of Art and other museums and gives students a foundation in the history of museums and the critical issues they engage; the poetry concentration connects students The Academic Program 13 to the Smith College Poetry Center and provides a course of study designed to allow students to pursue work on and about poetry through a range of experiences and courses; the South Asia concentration brings together areas of study to develop a sustained curricular and co-curricular focus on the region of South Asia; the sustainable food and climate change concentrations connect students to the Center for the Environment, Ecological Design and Sustainability <ref type="bibr">(CEEDS)</ref> and integrate knowledge in support of environmental decisions and actions.</p><p>Other academic concentrations are under development.</p><p>Each concentration offers: 1. one or more gateway courses to introduce students to the major questions or methods that define the topic. 2. a number of courses at Smith or in the Five Colleges related to the topic from which students choose four or five, with the help of her adviser; 3. internships or service learning experiences that satisfy a requirement to complete two practical learning experiences; and 4. a capstone experience such as a seminar or a guided independent project that culminates in a public presentation, usually at Collaborations in the spring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student-Designed Interdepartmental Majors and Minors</head><p>This course of study must differ significantly from an established major or minor and must include concentrated work in more than one department. For majors, at least one of the departments or programs must itself offer a major. Majors are expected to include 36 to 48 credits in related courses in more than one department. Normally, a minimum of 24 credits are at the 200 level or higher and a minimum of eight are at the 300 level. One of the 300-level courses may be the integrating project. Examples of self-designed majors include linguistics, exercise science and logic.</p><p>Minors are expected to include 20 to 24 credits in related courses in more than one department, of which no more than eight credits should be at the 100 level and at least four should be at the 300 level. Proposals for majors may be submitted no earlier than the first semester of the sophomore year and no later than the end of advising week of the second semester of the junior year. The deadlines for submission of proposals are October 15, February 1 and March 15. Proposals for minors may be submitted to the Subcommittee on Honors and Independent Programs at any time after the major has been declared but no later than the end of the first semester of the senior year.</p><p>The major or minor proposal must include a statement explicitly defining the subject matter and method of approach underlying the design of the major or minor; course lists; and, for the major, a clearly formulated integrating course or piece of work. Proposals must include letters of support from all advisers representing the areas of study central to the major and written recommendations signed by the chairs indicating approval of the departments or programs in the major.</p><p>Information about student-designed interdepartmental majors and minors is available from the dean of the senior class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Five College Certificate Programs</head><p>Five College Certificate Programs provide a directed course of study in various interdisciplinary fields through the resources available at the five area colleges. Certificate programs are offered in addition to or in conjunction with the student's major. Certificates are awarded upon successful completion of a program by the appropriate Five College faculty councils on the recommendation of designated faculty advisers from the student's home institution. Current certificate programs require that the student earn a grade of B or above in all courses counting for the certificate and many require students to demonstrate competence in a language other than English. Each institution determines the method by which competence will be measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liberal Arts and Major Advisers</head><p>Each student has a faculty adviser who helps her select and register for courses that will satisfy the broad expectations of the college and will further her personal goals and aspirations. The dean of the first-year class assigns a liberal arts adviser to each first-year student. This faculty member will continue to advise her until she chooses a major. The names of major advisers appear after each department's course listings.</p><p>Together the adviser and student devise a balanced academic program, making full use of the courses and programs available. The adviser approves all registration decisions, including changes made to the course program after the beginning of a semester. An adviser can help a student find academic and personal resources and can help her select and pursue various optional programs. It is the joint responsibility of both student and adviser to plan a course program that will lead to successful completion of all degree requirements.</p><p>In addition to aiding in the selection of courses, major advisers often counsel students about preparation for graduate schools or careers. The more clearly a student can articulate her own vision and goals, the more productive will be her relationship with her adviser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minor Advisers</head><p>A student electing a minor will have the guidance of a faculty adviser who represents the discipline, in addition to the help of her major adviser. She normally must consult with her minor adviser at the time she initially elects the minor, and again when she needs to certify that the minor has been completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineering Advising</head><p>Students who are interested in engineering should consult the faculty listed in the online course catalog under the Engineering "About" section.</p><p>14 The Academic Program</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prelaw Advising</head><p>Law schools accept students from any major; there is no prelaw curriculum. Students interested in pursuing a law degree are encouraged to pick up or print off a copy of the Lazarus Center for Career Development handout on "Law School," and bring their questions to the prelaw adviser <ref type="bibr">(Daryl Gehman, in Drew Hall)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Honor System</head><p>In 1944, the students of Smith College voted to establish the Academic Honor System in the belief that each member of the Smith community has an obligation to uphold the academic standards of the college. The basic premise on which the code is based is that the learning process is a product of individual effort and commitment accompanied by moral and intellectual integrity. The Academic Honor Code is the institutional expression of these beliefs. The code requires that each individual be honest and respect and respond to the demands of living responsibly in an academic community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Programs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accelerated Course Program</head><p>With permission of the administrative board, students having a cumulative average of at least B (3.0) may complete the requirements for the degree in six or seven semesters. Four semesters, including two of these in the junior or senior year, must be completed in residence at Smith College in Northampton. A student may not accelerate until the record for the first year is complete and a major has been declared; acceleration petitions should be submitted no sooner than the beginning of the fall semester of the sophomore year.</p><p>A maximum of 32 credits can be accumulated toward the degree through a combination of Advanced Placement (or similar), pre-matriculation, Interterm and summer school credits. Consult the Academic Rules and Procedures section for maximum credit limits in each category. Students whose acceleration plans include courses to be taken during interterm should be aware that these courses are limited both in number and in enrollment and cannot be guaranteed as part of the acceleration plan. Requests for permission to accelerate should be filed with the student's class dean at least two full semesters before the proposed date of graduation. A student who intends to study away from campus during the junior year should file her acceleration proposal at the beginning of the sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Ada Comstock Scholars Program</head><p>The Ada Comstock Scholars Program at Smith combines the rigorous academic challenges of the undergraduate program with flexibility for women beyond traditional college age.</p><p>Many women choose to work or raise a family rather than complete an education, but later wish to return to earn a degree. Established in 1975, the Ada Comstock Scholars Program allows nontraditional students to complete a bachelor's degree either part-time or full-time. Each Ada Comstock student attends the same classes and fulfills the same requirements as do all other Smith students. The program provides academic advising, orientation programs, peer advising, a center for the exclusive use of participants in the program and some housing. Career counseling and academic assistance are provided through specialized offices available on campus. Financial aid is available to all admitted students based on demonstrated need.</p><p>Reasons for becoming an Ada Comstock Scholar differ as widely as each woman's history, age, marital status, parenting circumstances and socioeconomic level. Each Ada Comstock Scholar has a high level of ability, strong motivation and at least a year of transferable liberal arts credit. This widely disparate group of women contributes vigor, diversity of perspective, intellectual ability and enthusiasm to all aspects of Smith life. Their achievements confirm the academic standard of the college.</p><p>A student admitted as a traditional first-year or transfer student normally will not be permitted to change her class status to Ada Comstock Scholar. A candidate's status as an Ada Comstock Scholar must be designated at the time of application.</p><p>For more information about the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, contact the Office of Admission at <ref type="bibr">413-585-2523; email, admission@smith.edu; or fax 413-585-2527.</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community Auditing: Nonmatriculated Students</head><p>Members of the local community who have earned a high school diploma are eligible to audit a lecture course at Smith on a space-available basis with the permission of the instructor and the registrar. Forms for the faculty member's signature and more information about auditing are available at the Office of the Registrar. A fee is charged and is determined by the type of course. Normally studio art courses are not open to nonmatriculated students. Auditors are invited to attend classes, but they do not participate in other aspects of college life. Official records of audits are not maintained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Five College Interchange</head><p>A student in good standing may take a course without additional cost during a regular semester at Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts, if the course is appropriate to the educational plan of the student and approved by Smith College. A first-semester first-year student must obtain the permission of the class dean before enrolling in a Five College course. Consult the "Academic Rules and Procedures" section for additional information and restrictions. A list of Five College courses approved for Smith College degree credit is available at the registrar's office. Requests for approval of courses not on the list may be submitted to the registrar's office. However, Smith College does not accept all Five College courses for credit toward the Smith degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smith Scholars Program</head><p>The Smith Scholars Program is designed for highly motivated and talented students who want to spend two to four semesters working on projects of their own devising, freed (in varying degrees) from normal college requirements. A student may apply at any time after the first semester of her sophomore year and must submit a detailed statement of her program, an evaluation of her proposal and her capacity to complete it from those faculty who will advise her and two supporting recommendations from instructors who have taught her in class. The deadlines for submission of proposals for the Smith Scholars Program are November 15 and April 15 of the student's junior year. The proportion of work to be done in normal courses will be decided jointly by the student, her adviser(s) and the Subcommittee on Honors and Independent Programs. Work done in the program may result in a group of related papers, an original piece of work, such as a play, or some combination of these.</p><p>A Smith Scholar may or may not complete a regular departmental major. Further details, guidelines and applications are available from the dean of the senior class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad Programs</head><p>Smith College offers a wide variety of study abroad opportunities, from Smith's own programs in Western Europe to Smith consortial and other approved programs all over the world. For the Smith programs in Florence, Hamburg, Geneva and Paris, an online program application must be filed by early February with the Office for International Study. Students interested in all other study abroad programs file an online study abroad credit application in addition to separate program applications. The deadline for fall, spring and full-year The Academic Program 15 programs is mid-February of each year, with a few exceptions for some spring semester options. Students should contact the Office for International Study for information on deadlines and procedures.</p><p>For all study abroad programs, the Smith College comprehensive fee is charged. The comprehensive fee, covering tuition, room and board when classes are in session, is the same as the comprehensive fee for a year's study in Northampton. Smith pays tuition, room and board on behalf of the student to the study abroad program or the host institution.</p><p>Students are responsible for all expenses and all travel during program breaks or vacations. Incidental expenses vary according to individual tastes and plans, and funds for such expenses are not covered by the comprehensive fee.</p><p>All students who wish to study abroad must obtain approval from the Office for International Study. Students must be in good standing in academic and student conduct matters with a minimum GPA of 3.0, have a declared major and have no shortage of credit at the time of application to be approved for study abroad. All prospective candidates are urged to seek advice, beginning in their first year, concerning the best sequence of courses in the language of the country in which they wish to study. Students who spend all or part of the junior year abroad may apply for admission to the departmental honors program at the beginning of the senior year. Any student wishing to spend any part of the senior year abroad must petition the Administrative Board through the class dean. Students should note that a year or semester abroad does not count toward the required two years in residence at Smith College.</p><p>Students attending programs with yearlong courses receive credit only if they have taken the final exams and final grades have been issued by the host institution.</p><p>In all instances, Smith reserves the right to approve, retract or deny a student's participation on study abroad. Normally, students who withdraw from a Study Abroad Program are withdrawn from Smith and may not return to the college the following semester. Please refer to the Institutional Refund Policy for additional information regarding institutional charges and financial aid adjustments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smith Programs Abroad</head><p>The Smith Programs Abroad provide students in a variety of disciplines the opportunity for study in foreign countries. Smith faculty direct or advise the four programs in Europe: France (Paris), Germany (Hamburg), Italy (Florence) and Switzerland (Geneva). During the academic year students either board with local families (Paris and Florence) or live in student residence halls <ref type="bibr">(Geneva and Hamburg)</ref>. During vacations the college assumes no responsibility for participants in the Smith programs, and students are free to travel, although by special arrangements in some programs they may stay in residence if they prefer.</p><p>Students in Florence, Geneva and Hamburg have single semester and yearlong options of study. The Smith in Paris program is a full-year academic program only. On all Smith Programs Abroad, students normally receive 16-18 credits per semester or a total of 34 credits for the academic year.</p></div>

Students enjoy fine facilities and services in a stimulating environment. The college continually improves its library and museum holdings, which are already among the finest in the country, and upgrades its equipment to give students here every technological advantage.</p><p>Smith attracts faculty members and students who are intellectually energetic and highly motivated. Together, we form a community with a variety of talents and interests, skills and training, and from diverse religious, cultural, political, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Many groups, activities and events arise from our broad range of interests. Members of the Five College community are welcome in classes and at most campus events. Their participation expands even further the perspectives and experiences represented.</p><p>All undergraduate students at Smith are part of the Student Government Association, which supports approximately 130 student organizations and their projects and programs. These organizations enrich the lives of their participants and of the general community through a wealth of concerts, presentations, lectures, readings, movies, workshops, symposia, exhibits and plays that enhance the rhythm of campus life. Academic and administrative departments and committees, resource centers, individual faculty members and alumnae also contribute to the already full schedule.</p><p>The pace and style of campus life vary greatly, as each woman creates the academic and social lifestyle best suited to her taste. Daily campus life includes periods both of great activity and movement and of quiet and intense concentration. There is time for hard work, for listening and speaking, for learning and teaching and for friends, fun and relaxation. The extracurricular social, athletic and cultural events on campus, in Northampton, and in the Five College area keep this an exciting center of activity. Each student learns through the overwhelming choices open to her how to develop and sustain a pace of life that is balanced and fulfilling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Athletic Facility Complex</head><p>Just as Alumnae Gymnasium was the "state of the art" facility back in 1892 when women's basketball was first introduced, today's four-building athletic complex is equally impressive. The facility houses two gymnasiums, an athletic training room and the Human Performance Laboratory. Ainsworth Gymnasium provides a swimming pool with one-and three-meter diving boards, five international-sized squash courts, two fitness studios and a 24-foot-high climbing wall. The indoor track and tennis building, the site of three national NCAA track meets, includes four tennis courts and a 200-meter track.</p><p>The Olin Fitness Center features aerobic machines: treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, step mill and rowing machines. The Fitness Center has two free weight areas and many fixed weight machines. The facilities of the sports complex are augmented by 30 acres of athletic fields. Field hockey and lacrosse teams play on the lighted artificial turf field with soccer, rugby and ultimate, encircled by a 3/4-mile cinder jogging track. A new softball facility with brick dugouts, bleachers for 200 and a press box, and a new 400-meter all-weather track were installed in the summer of 2017. For those who enjoy the peaceful solitude of a run through the woods, there is a 5,000-meter cross-country course and 11 lighted outdoor courts. The boathouse on Paradise Pond is home to the Smith Outdoors Program and is open for novice rowers or canoe paddlers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Services</head><p>The same standards of confidentiality apply to the doctor-patient relationship at Smith as to all other medical practitioners. Medical Services offers a full array of exams and testing; nutrition counseling; routine physicals for summer employment and graduate school; immunizations for travel, flu and allergies; and on-site laboratory services.</p><p>In case of unusual or serious illness, specialists in the Northampton and Springfield areas are available for consultation in addition to service provided at a nearby hospital.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Counseling Service</head><p>The Counseling Service provides consultation, individual and group psychotherapy and psychiatric evaluation and medication. These services are strictly confidential. The Counseling Service is available to all students, free of charge. It is staffed by licensed mental health professionals and supervised graduate interns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Education</head><p>The wellness education program integrates innovative wellness initiatives into students' academic, residential and extracurricular activities. The program provides opportunities for students to take leadership roles in health education on campus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Health Insurance</head><p>The college offers its own insurance policy, underwritten by an insurance company, that covers a student in the special circumstances of a residential college. It extends coverage for in-and outpatient services not covered by many other insurance plans. However, this policy does have some distinct limitations. Therefore, we strongly urge that students consider continuing their precollege health insurance. Failure to waive the college health plan will result in automatic enrollment in it.</p><p>The college maintains certain regulations in the interest of community health as outlined in the college handbook and expects all students to comply. Before arriving at the college, each student must complete her Health Pre-Admission Information Form and send it to the Health Services. It is important to note that Massachusetts law now mandates that students must get the required immunizations before registration. Students accepted for a Study Abroad Program or who plan to participate in intercollegiate sports or certain exercise and sport programs may be required to have a physical exam by a college practitioner first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religious Expression</head><p>The college encourages student spiritual development and many expressions of religious faith on campus. The Center of Religious and Spiritual Life (CRSL) is housed in the Helen Hills Hills Chapel. The director of the center is responsible for overseeing the program, advising student religious organizations and promoting a spirit of mutual understanding, respect, and interfaith collaboration.</p><p>The college has relationships with local religious liaisons who serve as advisers to student religious organizations and provide opportunities for students to engage with the larger Northampton community. An interfaith advisory group of students meet weekly to discuss the spiritual needs of students, plan joint activities and foster dialogue. The center prioritizes contemplative practice, religious literacy, social justice and spiritual care, and also provides regular hospitality programming through its kitchen and lounge, offering meals and spaces for gathering in times of stress or need. The CSRL strives to meet the special needs of all students not just those who affiliate with an organized religious path. Center staff work with local clergy and faith leaders who help nurture the spiritual 22</p><p>The Campus and Campus Life lives of students and provide opportunities to worship and observe. All students are welcome regardless of belief system or religious affiliation. Information about events can be found at www.smith.edu/religiouslife. The Helen Hills Hills Chapel is home to a robust arts program as well. The Center for Religious and Spiritual Life sponsors concerts, lectures, films and exhibits by student and faculty musicians, and visiting artists. The college organist directs Handbell Choir rehearsals in the chapel and uses the Aolian-Skinner organ for teaching and performances.</p><p>The CRSL collaborates with dining to respect dietary needs relating to religious observance. Kosher and halal meals are available to students in the Cutter-Ziskind dining room during the week. In addition, students prepare and host a kosher Shabbat meal and community gathering each Friday evening. A Jummah lunch is offered at noon every Friday for the Muslim community with the location rotating between the Helen Hills Hills Chapel and the prayer area in the basement of Wright Hall. Religious holidays such as Christmas, Ramadan, Passover, and Diwali are observed in collaboration with student and community groups.</p><p>College policy states that any student who is unable because of religious observance to attend classes, participate in an examination, study, or work on a particular day will be excused from such activities without prejudice and will be given an opportunity to make them up, provided such make-up work does not create an unreasonable burden on the college. No fees will be charged for rescheduling an examination. It is each student's responsibility to request an excused absence from a faculty member well in advance of a religious holiday. In certain instances the CRSL will consult with students, faculty and staff when a religious consideration is in question. Students can also speak with the director of religious life/college chaplain when a religious consideration is raised with respect to housing needs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Achievements</head><p>Smith College encourages students to strive for excellence in their chosen fields of academic endeavor and honors those who achieve distinction in their academic performance. Each year approximately 25 percent of the graduating class is awarded the bachelor of arts degree with Latin Honors and/or departmental honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latin Honors</head><p>Latin Honors are awarded to eligible graduating seniors on the basis of the cumulative grade point average for a minimum of 48 graded credits earned during the sophomore, junior and senior years. Only grades from Smith College courses and courses taken on the Five College Interchange are counted; Smith Study Abroad grades are considered Smith grades. No grades from exchange programs in this country or abroad are counted. Pluses and minuses are taken into account; grades of P/F (Pass or Fail) or S/U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory) do not enter into the calculations.</p><p>If a student spends one of her sophomore through senior years away from Smith (with the exception of the Smith Programs Abroad), the grades from the remaining two years will be used. Grades from the first year are never counted. The minimum grade point average for Latin Honors varies each year depending on the overall grade distribution in the senior class and is not published. The degree may be awarded cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude on the basis of meeting eligibility requirements and of a very high level of academic achievement.</p><p>Students who wish to become eligible for Latin Honors at graduation must elect at least one course (normally four credits) in each of the seven major fields of knowledge (literature, historical studies, social science, natural science, mathematics and analytical philosophy, the arts, and foreign language). Course listings in this catalog indicate in curly brackets which area(s) of knowledge a given course covers.</p><p>Please note that one year of an introductory language course or one course at a higher level satisfies the foreign language Latin Honors requirement. Students who are non-native speakers of English may, with the permission of a class dean, offer any two courses in the English department at the 100 level (or one course at a higher level in the English department, the comparative literature program or in classics in translation) to satisfy the "foreign language" part of the Latin Honors requirement. The class dean will notify the registrar that such an arrangement has been approved. Any appeals should be sent to the dean of the faculty. Nonnative speakers of English are considered to be those who indicated on their advising form that English was not their first language, have had several years of education in a school where the language of instruction was other than English, and can read, write and speak this language. Eligibility for Latin Honors may be affected by the decisions of the Honor Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Honors</head><p>A departmental honors program allows a student with a strong academic background to do independent and original work in her major. The program provides recognition for students who do work of high quality in the preparation of a thesis and in courses and seminars. Departmental honors students must also fulfill all college and departmental requirements.</p><p>Successful completion of work in the honors program (an honors thesis and at least one honors examination) leads to the awarding of the bachelor of arts degree with the added notation "Honors," "High Honors" or "Highest Honors" in the student's major subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Dean's List</head><p>The Dean's List is made up of students who represent the top 25 percent of the student body based on the total records for the previous academic year. Students must be enrolled full-time at Smith for the full year to be named to the Dean's List.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phi Beta Kappa</head><p>Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized undergraduate honor society in the United States. The Greek initials stand for the society's motto "Love of learning is the guide of life." Since 1776, the mission of the society has been to foster and recognize excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The Zeta of Massachusetts Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society was established at Smith College in 1905. The rules of eligibility are set by the chapter in accordance with the national society; election is made on the breadth and excellence of overall academic achievement.</p><p>To be eligible for election, a student must have satisfied the Latin Honors distribution requirements and completed 58 graded credits of Smith course work, not counting the first year. Study abroad programs count for Smith credit only if they are Smith programs. Courses taken in the Five College consortium count as Smith credits. All other courses including those taken S/U may count for distribution requirements, but not as credits in the calculation of the GPA nor as part of the total credit requirement.</p><p>Elections are held twice a year. In late fall of their senior year, "junior" Phi Beta Kappa members are elected on the basis of their academic records through the junior year. At the end of the spring semester, more seniors are elected based on their complete academic record. For questions about election criteria, students and faculty are urged to consult with the president or secretary of the chapter. More information about the Phi Beta Kappa Society, its history, publications and activities can be found at www.pbk.org.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Society of the Sigma Xi</head><p>In 1935 Smith College became the first women's college to be granted a charter for the establishment of a chapter of the Society of the Sigma Xi. Each year the Smith College Chapter elects to membership promising graduate students and seniors who excel in science.</p></div>

It is also a financial challenge for many families. At Smith, we encourage all qualified students to apply for admission, regardless of family financial resources. Our students come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. The Office of Student Financial Services has an experienced staff to assist students and parents in both the individual financial aid application process and the educational financing process in general. We work with families to help them manage the financial challenge in a variety of ways, through financial aid, loans and payment plan options.</p><p>Many Smith students receive financial assistance to pay for college expenses. Smith College participates in all the major federal and state student aid programs while funding a substantial institutional grant and scholarship program from its endowment.</p><p>We realize that financing a college education is a complex process, and we encourage applicants and their families to communicate directly with us. Our experienced educational financing staff in the Office of Student Financial Services is available to work with you. Inquiries may be made by calling 413-585-2530 between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesdays (Eastern time).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Your Student Account</head><p>Smith College considers the student to be responsible for ensuring that payments-whether from loans, grants, parents, or other third parties-are received in a timely manner. All student accounts are managed by the Office of Student Financial Services. Initial statements detailing semester fees are available online on or about July 15 and December 15. Email notifications will be sent to all students on or about the 15th of each month in which there is activity on the account. Students who wish to designate a parent or other third party to be notified of bills and to have the ability to make payments on their student account must set the designee up as an "authorized user" through their online account. Important: no paper bills are mailed.</p><p>The college's comprehensive fees associated with the beginning of the semester are due and payable in full by specific deadline dates, well in advance of the beginning of classes. The payment deadline for fall is August 10. For spring, the payment deadline is January 10. Payment must be received by these dates to avoid late payment fees being assessed. Checks should be made payable to Smith College and include the student's name and ID number on the front.</p><p>After any payment is due, monthly late payment fees, which are based on the outstanding balance remaining after any payment due date, will be assessed at the rate of $1.25 on every $100 (1.25 percent) that remains unpaid until the payment is received in full, on or before the next billing month in which the student is invoiced. If you have questions regarding any charges or credits on your bill, contact the Office of Student Financial Services.</p><p>In cases where students default on financial obligations, the student is responsible for paying the outstanding balance including all late payment fees, collection costs and any legal fees incurred by the college during the collection process. Transcripts and other academic records will not be released until all financial obligations to the college have been met.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Payments for each month's bill must be received by the Office of Student Financial Services by the payment due date. If paying by mail, please allow at least five to seven business days for mail and processing time. If paying in person, payment should be made before 4 p.m. on the payment due date. Electronic ACH payments made through our online billing service are credited immediately.</p><p>The college expects the student to fulfill her financial responsibility and reserves the right to place limitations on the student for failure to do so. The consequences of nonpayment include possible loss of housing assignment, and prevention of: a) registration for future semester courses, b) receipt of academic transcripts, c) receipt of diploma at commencement, d) approval for a leave of absence or study-abroad program, and e) participation in leadership training opportunities. The college also reserves the right to have the student administratively withdrawn and may refer such account for collection in her name. Students and parents are welcome to contact the Office of Student Financial Services for assistance in meeting payment responsibilities.</p><p>Most credit balance refunds are issued on request, by direct deposit into the account the student has on file with the payroll office. Credit balances that result from a PLUS loan are generally issued to the parent borrower, unless that parent has authorized that refunds go to the student. With the student's written release, credit balance refunds may be issued to the parent or the designee of the student. * Room and board will be billed as a combined charge.</p><p>As part of her expenses, a student should be prepared to spend a minimum of $800 per year on books and academic supplies. In addition, a student will incur additional expenses during the academic year that will vary according to her standard of living, personal needs, recreational activities and number of trips home. Student Activities Fee The $284 student activities fee is split between the two semesters and is used to fund chartered student organizations on campus. The Student Government Association allocates the monies each year. Each spring, the Senate Finance Committee of the SGA proposes a budget that is voted on by the student body.</p><p>Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid 32 Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2018-19 Optional Fees</head><p>Student Medical Insurance-$2,368 The $2,368 Student Medical Insurance fee is split between the two semesters and covers the student from August 15 through the following August 14. January graduates are covered only through January 14 in their senior year. Massachusetts law requires that each student have comprehensive health insurance; Smith College offers a medical insurance plan through Gallagher Koster Insurance (www.gallagherstudent.com) for those students not otherwise insured. Details about the insurance are mailed during the summer. Students are automatically billed for this insurance unless they follow the waiver process outlined in the insurance mailing. Students must waive the insurance coverage by August 10 in order to avoid purchasing the annual Smith Plan. If a student is on leave on a Smith-approved program that is billed at home-school fees, a reduced charge may apply. For students who are admitted for spring semester, the charge will be $1,375 for 2018-19.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Fees and Charges</head><p>Enrollment Deposit-$500 Upon admittance, a new student pays an enrollment deposit which serves to reserve her place in the class and a room if she will reside in campus housing. The $300 representing a general deposit component is held until six months after the student graduates from the college. The $300 is refunded only after deducting any unpaid fees or fines and is not refunded to a student who withdraws (including an admitted student who does not attend). The $200 representing a room deposit component is credited $100 in July toward fall semester charges and $100 in December toward spring semester charges. For midyear transfer students, all $200 is credited toward spring semester charges.</p><p>Fee for Musical Instruction-$690 per semester (one-hour lesson per week) Music fees are covered by the college for all declared minors and majors. Students who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant).</p><p>Practice rooms are available to Smith College students with first preference given to those registered for music instruction. Other Five College students may apply to the chair of the music department for permission to use the facilities. Practice rooms may be available for use by other individuals in last order of preference upon successful application to the chair of the music department.</p><p>There is no charge for Five College students, faculty and staff for use of the practice rooms. For other individuals, the following fee will apply.</p><p>Use of a practice room, one hour daily $25</p><p>Fee for Riding Classes-per semester Riding lessons are available to all students at the college. The lessons are held at Soneleigh-Burnham Equestrian Center in Greenfield, Massachusetts (a 20 minute ride from the Smith College campus). Smith College has vans available for students to drive to Greenfield. The Smith riding team uses this facility for practice and horse shows. The fee for each semester is $950. Questions can be directed to the Athletics Department at 585-2706.</p><p>Studio Art Courses-per semester Certain materials and supplies are required for studio art courses and will be provided to each student. Students may require additional supplies as well and will be responsible for purchasing them directly. The expenses will vary from course to course and from student to student. Required materials $138 Additional supplies $59</p><p>Chemistry Laboratory Course-$25 per semester Continuation Fee-$60 per semester Students on leave of absence or attending other institutions on exchange or junior year abroad programs will be assessed a continuation fee to maintain enrollment status at the college.</p><p>Overdue Balance Fee Any balance outstanding for fall after August 10 or for spring after January 10 is considered overdue. Overdue balances will be assessed a late fee of $1.25 per $100 each month they remain outstanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insufficient Funds Fee</head><p>If a payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, a charge of $20 will be added to the student account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incorrect Account Number Fee</head><p>If an incorrect or invalid account number is entered into our TouchNet payment system when a payer is attempting to make a payment, a $5 charge will be added to the student account.</p><p>Early Arrival Fee-$150</p><p>Late Registration Fee-$35 Students who make registration changes after the registration period will be assessed a fee for each change.</p><p>Bed Removal Fee-$100 Students who remove their beds from their campus rooms will be charged a bed removal fee.</p><p>Health/Fire/Safety Violation-$5 per item A minimum fine of $5 per item will be charged for items left in public areas such as corridors, stairways or entrances. These items create a hazard and violate compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as city and state building, fire and safety codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Institutional Refund Policy</head><p>A refund will be calculated if a student withdraws on or after the first day of classes but before the point when the college is considered to have earned all the tuition, room, board and mandatory fees (hereinafter called institutional charges) for which the student was charged. Credit balances remaining on any account will be refunded to the appropriate person or agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjustment of Institutional Charges and Institutional Aid</head><p>Any student who withdraws prior to the first day of classes will receive a 100 percent adjustment of institutional charges and insurance. All disbursed Title IV aid, institutional aid, state and other aid will be returned to the appropriate account by the college. A student who withdraws after the first day of classes, but before the time when she will have completed 60 percent of the period of enrollment, will have her institutional charges and institutional aid adjusted based on the percentage of class attendance.</p><p>If a student should withdraw from an off-campus program, which is billed by Smith (for example: Study Abroad, Picker and Smithsonian Programs), the normal college refund policies apply as long as all payments can be recovered by the college. If payments made on behalf of the student to other entities cannot be recovered by the college, the student is responsible for unrecoverable costs.</p><p>Students who withdraw from study-abroad programs that are approved, but not administered by Smith College will have a proration of charges and aid based on the enrollment dates of the program, rather than those of Smith College. After the 60 percent point of the program term, the student is not entitled to a refund of charges and is also responsible for unrecoverable costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Students Receiving Title IV Federal Aid</head><p>Per federal regulations, a student earns her aid based on the period of time she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than Federal Work Study, must be returned to the appropriate federal agency. During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time she remains enrolled. A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60 percent point earns all the aid for the payment period. For example, if the period of enrollment is 100 days and the student completes 25 days, then she has earned 25 percent of her aid. The remainder of the aid must be returned to the appropriate federal agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Charges</head><p>If a student has not waived, or has accepted the medical insurance and withdraws from the college during the first 31 days of the period for which coverage is purchased, and she has not used the insurance, she will not be covered under the plan and a full credit of the premium will be made. Insured students withdrawing at or after 31 days will remain covered under the plan for the full period for which the premium has been paid and no refund will be made available.</p><p>Other charges, such as library fines, parking fines and infirmary charges are not adjusted upon the student's withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contractual Limitations</head><p>If Smith College's performance of its educational objectives, support services or lodging and food services is hampered or restrained on account of strikes, fire, shipping delays, acts of God, prohibition or restraint of governmental authority, or other similar causes beyond Smith College's control, Smith College shall not be liable to anyone, except to the extent of allowing in such cases a pro-rata reduction in fees or charges already paid to Smith College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment Plans and Loan Options</head><p>Smith offers a variety of payment plan and loan options to assist you in successfully planning for timely payment of your college bill. ‚Ä¢ Semester Plan ‚Ä¢ Touch Net Payment Plan Smith also honors parent and student loan options.</p><p>Details on loan options and the payment plan can be found on the Web at www. smith.edu/about-smith/sfs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>We welcome women from all economic backgrounds. No woman should hesitate to apply to Smith because of an inability to pay the entire cost of her education. We meet the full documented financial need of all admitted undergraduates who have met the published admission and financial aid deadlines. Awards are offered to applicants on the basis of need, and calculated according to established college and federal policies. An award is usually a combination of a grant, a loan and a campus job.</p><p>Smith College is committed to a financial aid policy that guarantees to meet the full financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students who meet published deadlines. The college does operate under a need-sensitive admission policy that typically affects less than 6 percent of our applicant pool. Each applicant for admission is evaluated on the basis of her academic and personal qualities. However, the college may choose to consider a student's level of financial need when making the final admission decision. Applicants are advised to complete the financial aid process if they will need financial help to attend Smith. Entering first-year students who fail to apply for financial aid by the published deadlines will be ineligible to receive college-funded assistance until they have completed 64 credits earned at Smith. Transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars who do not apply for financial aid by the published deadlines are eligible to apply after completing 32 credits earned at Smith. Students may apply for federal aid at any point during the academic year. International students (not U.S. citizens or permanent residents) who do not apply for aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid at any time during their tenure at Smith.</p><p>To enable the college to determine a student's need, a family completes both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service PROFILE form, requesting that data be sent to Smith. Both forms are completed on-line. The FAFSA can be accessed at www.fafsa.ed.gov (Smith College code is 002209) and the PROFILE can be accessed at www.collegeboard. com <ref type="bibr">(Smith College code is 3762)</ref>.</p><p>Students must also complete the Smith Aid Application, available at www. smith.edu/sfs/portal.</p><p>We also require a signed copy of the family's most recent federal tax returns, including all schedules and W-2's. Other forms and documents may be required, based on each family's circumstances. Once we receive a completed application, we review each student's file individually. We take into consideration the number of dependents, the number of family members in college, divorced parents and other special circumstances. For international applicants, the CSS Profile and an official income statement or income tax return are required to determine financial and eligibility.</p><p>Smith College recognizes the diversity of the modern family, and requires the submission of information regarding both legal or biological or adoptive parents, as well as spouses and domestic partners of each parent. Exceptions to this policy are made on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the Office of Student Financial Services for more information.</p><p>The college makes the final decision on the level of need and awards. Financial aid decisions to entering students are announced simultaneously with admission notifications. College policy limits the awards of Smith funds to the level of billed fees.</p><p>A student who is awarded aid at admission will have it renewed each year she attends according to her need, as calculated by the college, if she is in good academic standing. She and her family apply for aid annually with Smith College forms, FAFSA and PROFILE forms, and tax returns. The amount of aid may vary from year to year depending on changes in college fees and in the family's financial circumstances. The balance of loan, work and grant also changes, based on federal loan limits and college policy. Instructions for renewing aid are made available to all students in December. Traditional students (not Ada Comstock Scholars) are expected to complete their undergraduate studies in eight semesters, and grant aid is limited to that period, except for special programs or in circumstances involving medical withdrawal.</p><p>Ada Comstock Scholars receiving financial aid are required to make satisfactory progress toward the degree in order to continue receiving aid-that is, completion of at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic year. Progress is evaluated on a semester basis. Students not meeting this criterion are put on financial aid warning. Students may be required to appeal in writing to continue to receive federal financial aid and may become ineligible for aid if the probationary period exceeds one year.</p><p>Unless the administrative board decides that mitigating circumstances warrant an exception, no financial aid will be available to a student who is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="34">Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid</head><p>First-Year Applicants (U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Undocumented U.S. Residents) Any student who needs or may need help in financing her education should apply for financial aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission. Students must not wait until they have been accepted for admission to apply for aid. Each student's file is carefully reviewed to determine eligibility for need-based aid. Since this is a detailed process, the college expects students to follow published application guidelines and to meet the appropriate application deadlines. Students and parents are encouraged to contact Student Financial Services via email at sfs@smith.edu or by phone <ref type="bibr">(413-585-2530)</ref> with questions. Detailed information on the application process and deadlines is available on our website at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.</p><p>The consequences of not applying for aid prior to being accepted for admission include a 64-credit waiting period before becoming eligible to receive college grant aid. This means that only federal, state and private assistance would be available for the first two years of undergraduate enrollment at Smith. The college will consider exceptions to this policy only if you experience and can document an unexpected family emergency. Please note that this policy does not pertain to students who, prior to admission to Smith, applied for but were not granted need-based financial aid.</p><p>If an entering student applied for but did not qualify for need-based aid in her first year, that student may reapply for aid in subsequent years. This is particularly important for families that experience changes in family circumstances such as a sibling entering college, reductions in parent income, divorce or separation, or unanticipated medical expenses. Students who want to apply for federal aid only have a modified application process. If there are major changes to the financial resources of the family, Student Financial Services will consider a new request for aid or a review of a previous denial at any time.</p><p>The college cannot assume responsibility for family unwillingness to contribute to college expenses. There are limited circumstances that qualify a student for consideration as an independent aid applicant. Women over the age of 24, orphans and wards of the court are always considered self-supporting for federal financial aid purposes. Students who meet the federal definition of independent status are not automatically considered independent by the college. Please contact SFS to discuss questions regarding this situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>Transfer students should follow the application procedures detailed on their specific financial aid applications. Transfer students who do not apply for aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission, cannot apply for college aid until they reach junior standing and complete at least 32 credits at Smith.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ada Comstock Scholars</head><p>Women of nontraditional college age can apply to the Ada Comstock Scholars Program. Applicants for aid should complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the Ada Comstock Scholars program Application for Financial Aid and send us a signed copy of their most recent federal tax return, complete with all schedules and W-2's as well as their spouse or partner's complete tax return and W-2's.</p><p>An Ada Comstock Scholar who does not apply for aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission, cannot apply for institutional grant aid until she has completed 32 credits at Smith, although she may qualify for federal and state grants and loans before she has completed 32 credits. This policy does not apply to women who applied for, but were not granted, aid at the time of admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Applicants</head><p>Smith College awards need-based aid to international non-U.S. citizens, both first-year and transfer applicants. There is a great deal of competition for these funds, and the level of support provided from the college ranges widely, depending on particular family circumstances. Aid is determined based on the information provided by the family on the CSS Profile, along with translated tax or income statements. International students not awarded financial aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid from the college at any time.</p><p>The application deadline is January 25. Non-U.S. citizens eligible for aid have a family contribution calculated prior to admission. This family contribution will remain the same throughout the student's tenure at Smith. Any increases in tuition and fees not covered by the annual increased loan or work will be covered by an increase in the grant so that the calculated family contribution will remain the same each year. (Loan and campus job amounts, which are part of the total aid package, increase each year as part of standard college policy. For application deadlines and details, please check www.smith.edu/sfs.) U.S. Citizens Living Outside the U.S. Follow procedures for applicants residing in the United States. If your parents are living and earning income outside the United States and do not file U.S. tax returns, you should submit translated tax or income statements.</p><p>U.S. citizens and permanent residents must reapply for aid each year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy for Review and Appeal of Need-Based Financial Aid Awards</head><p>A student has the right to request a review of her financial aid award. Domestic students must reapply for financial aid each year, and thus are automatically reviewed on an annual basis. International students are given a family contribution determination at the time of admission for their entire Smith career and thus are only eligible for a review at the time of admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domestic Students</head><p>Domestic students may request a review of their financial aid awards at any time during their Smith careers if there has been a significant change in family circumstances since filing the application for financial aid or if the information on the original application was inaccurate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Students</head><p>International students seeking a financial aid adjustment after they have accepted an offer of admission must consult with Student Financial Services (SFS) to review the situation and discuss available options. The financial aid budget for international students is fully allocated each year as of the time of admission, therefore only very limited additional resources are made available to meet extraordinary circumstances. Serious consideration is only given when there has been a significant life-changing event. A life-changing event would include, but is not limited to, the death of a parent or enrollment of a sibling in a U.S. college or university. If you wish to appeal your financial aid award, please begin by contacting Student Financial Services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process</head><p>When a review is requested it is conducted by the SFS Review Committee. In most cases, their decision is final. When the issue under review would require an exception to policy, a student may request it be reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. Instructions for submitting an appeal will be provided by the SFS staff to the student if a policy is at issue. All reviews from international students for increased grant or loan assistance are considered exceptions to policy and will be brought to the attention of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee is chaired by the dean of enrollment and includes one member of the faculty, the dean of students and a member of the finance office. The director of SFS is a nonvoting member of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The student must present her appeal in writing. The committee will consider the appeal as soon as possible. It normally takes one to two weeks for this committee to convene and review the appeal(s) in question. A decision will be given in writing to the student within 48 hours after the appeal is heard. The decision of the Appeals Committee is final in all cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need-Based Financial Aid Awards</head><p>Financial aid awards are made up of loans, campus jobs and grants. A loan and job, both considered self-help, are usually the first components of an aid package, with any remaining need being met with grant aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loans</head><p>Most students borrow through the Federal Direct Ford Loan Program. Some awards may also include a Smith College loan. Most parents are eligible to borrow under the Federal Parent Loan Program. Students who receive aid of any sort from federal funds are subject to the statutes governing such aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Campus Jobs</head><p>Student Financial Services administers campus jobs. All students may apply, but priority is given to those students (about one-half of our student body) who received campus job offers as part of their aid packages. First-year students may work an average of eight hours a week for 32 weeks. Students in other classes may hold regular jobs averaging ten hours a week for 32 weeks. These monies are paid directly to each student as she earns them. They are intended primarily to cover personal expenses, but some students use part or all of their earnings toward required fees. Short-term jobs are open to all students. Additionally, a termtime internship program is administered by the Career Development Office. The college participates in the federally funded Work-Study Program, which funds a portion of the earnings of eligible students, some of them in nonprofit, community service positions and in the America Reads tutorial program. Smith College also provides a need-based employment program for those students eligible for need-based work, but not eligible for the federally subsidized Federal Work-Study Program.</p><p>No student, whether on federal work-study or not, is permitted to work more than the maximum 10-hours a week or one "full-time" position. First-year students may work a maximum of eight hours per week. Students receiving a stipend for such positions as STRIDE or HCA are not eligible for a second job. This policy attempts to offer all students an equal opportunity to work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grants</head><p>Grants are funds given to students with no requirement of repayment or work time in exchange. Most Smith College grants come from funds given for this purpose by alumnae and friends of the college and by foundations and corporations. Federal and state governments also provide assistance through need-based grants such as the Federal Pell Grant and state scholarships. Smith receives an allocation each year for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and for state-funded Gilbert Grants for Massachusetts residents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outside Aid</head><p>Outside Aid Awarded on the Basis of Student Merit or Parent Employment Smith College recognizes your achievement in being awarded merit-based aid. Outside aid based on student merit or parent employment will first reduce or replace the self-help portion of your award (work-study and federal subsidized loan). If the outside aid exceeds the total self-help portion of your award, the aid can go toward a one-time computer purchase or toward the cost of the on-campus health insurance plan. If you do not purchase or have already purchased a computer, and if you do not accept the on-campus health insurance plan, or if your merit aid exceeds these costs, outside aid will replace Smith Grant on a dollar-for-dollar basis.</p><p>Note: GEARUP scholarships are considered within this category as outside scholarships.</p><p>Student Financial Services must be notified of all outside awards. If you notify SFS by June 1, the aid will be reflected in your official award and on your first bill. If you notify SFS after September 1, the outside aid may be used to reduce Smith Grant dollar for dollar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>State and Federal Grant Assistance</head><p>These awards reduce Smith Grant eligibility dollar for dollar. Educational benefits from state and federal agencies will reduce the self-help components of the award (loan and work). Need-based loans from state or outside agencies can be used to replace dollar for dollar either the suggested federal loan or the work study award. Amounts in excess of the self-help award will replace Smith Grant dollar for dollar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music Grants</head><p>Students who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROTC</head><p>Air Force ROTC is available at most colleges and universities in western Massachusetts, including Smith College. Air Force ROTC offers two-, three-and fouryear enlistment scholarships to qualified new and continuing college students. For more information, call 413-545-2437, send email to afrotc@acad.umass. edu or visit www.umass.edu/afrotc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>From the college's beginning, students at Smith have been challenged by rigorous academic standards and supported by rich resources and facilities to develop to their fullest potential and define their own terms of success. Admitting students who will thrive in the Smith environment remains the goal of our admission efforts. We seek students who will be productive members of the Smith community, who will be challenged by all that is offered here and who will challenge their faculty members and peers to sharpen their ideas and perspectives of the world.</p><p>Each year we enroll a first-year class of approximately 600 able, motivated, diverse students whose records show academic achievement, intellectual curiosity and potential for growth. Because our students come from 48 states and 73 countries, their educational and personal experiences and opportunities vary tremendously. In selecting a class, the Board of Admission, which is made up of faculty members as well as members of the admission staff, considers each student in the light of the opportunities available to her. Included in the board's review are her secondary school record, the recommendations from her school, her essay and any other available information.</p><p>Smith College meets fully the documented financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students. About 60 percent of our students receive some form of financial assistance through grants, loans and/or campus jobs. Further information about financial planning for a Smith education and about financial aid is available in the section on Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary School Preparation</head><p>There is no typical applicant to Smith and no typical academic program, but we strongly recommend that a student prepare for Smith by taking the strongest courses offered by her high school. Specifically this should include the following, at a minimum where possible: ‚Ä¢ four years of English ‚Ä¢ three years of a foreign language (or two years in each of two languages) ‚Ä¢ three years of mathematics ‚Ä¢ three years of lab science ‚Ä¢ two years of history Beyond meeting the normal minimum requirements, we expect each candidate to pursue in greater depth academic interests of special importance to her. Candidates who are interested in our engineering major should pursue coursework in calculus, biology, chemistry and physics.</p><p>Smith College will accept college-level work completed prior to matriculation as a degree student, provided that the relevant courses were completed at an accredited college or university and were not applied to the requirements for high school graduation. We also give credit for excellent performance in Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and equivalent foreign examinations. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for further information regarding eligibility for and use of such credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entrance Tests</head><p>SAT I or ACT scores are optional for U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. Standardized tests (SAT I, ACT, TOEFL, IELTS or PTE as appropriate) are required for international citizens. SAT II subject tests are not required for any applicant. If a student wishes to submit a score or is required to do so, she should take the exams in her junior year to keep open the possibility of Early Decision. All examinations taken through December of the senior year are acceptable. The results of examinations taken after December arrive too late for us to include them in the decision-making process.</p><p>Whether required or optional, scores must come directly from the testing agency or the secondary school transcript. The College Board code number for Smith College is 3762. The ACT code is 1894.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for Admission</head><p>A student interested in Smith has three options for applying-Early Decision I, Early Decision II and Regular Decision. Visit www.smith.edu/admission for information about requirements and deadlines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Decision</head><p>Early Decision I and II Plans are designed for students with strong qualifications who have selected Smith as their first choice. The plans differ from each other only in application deadline, recognizing that students may decide on their college preference at different times. In making an application to her first choice college, a candidate eliminates much of the anxiety, effort and cost of preparing several college applications. Candidates under this plan may initiate applications to other colleges, but may make an Early Decision application to one college only. It is important to note that if accepted under Early Decision, a candidate must withdraw all other college applications and may not make any further applications.</p><p>Applicants deferred in either Early Decision plan will be reconsidered in the spring, together with applicants in the Regular Decision Plan. Offers of admission are made with the understanding that the high school record continues to be of high quality through the senior year. If they have applied for financial aid by the published deadlines, candidates will be notified of financial aid decisions at the same time as the admission decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regular Decision</head><p>The Regular Decision Plan is designed for students who wish to keep open several college options during the application process. Candidates may submit applications anytime before the January 15 deadline.</p><p>A student interested in Smith should apply using either the Common Application or the Coalition Application. Smith does not have a preference for one application over the other; both of these application types will receive equal consideration in our admission process. Please visit www.commonapp.org or www. coalitionforcollegeaccess.org for all required forms and instructions.</p><p>We realize that applying to college involves a lot of time-consuming paperwork for the applicant. It is work that we review carefully and thoroughly, and we suggest that applicants do not leave it to the last moment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>Smith College participates in the Advanced Placement Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for information governing eligibility for and use of Advanced Placement credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Baccalaureate</head><p>The amount of credit will be determined as soon as an official copy of results has been sent to the registrar's office. Guidelines for use are comparable to those for Advanced Placement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interview</head><p>We recommend an interview for all candidates. For those who live or attend school within 200 miles of the college an on-campus interview is encouraged. Others should visit our website to obtain the name of an alumna interviewer in their area. The interview allows each candidate to become better acquainted with Smith and to exchange information with a member of the staff of the Office of Admission or a trained alumna volunteer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deferred Entrance</head><p>An admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith's offer and paid the required deposit may defer her entrance to work, travel or pursue a special interest if she makes this request in writing by June 1 to the dean of admission, who will review the request and notify the student within two weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deferred Entrance for Medical Reasons</head><p>An admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith's offer and paid the required deposit may request to postpone her entrance due to medical reasons if she makes this request in writing, explaining the nature of the medical problem, to the dean of admission prior to the first day of classes. At that time, the college will outline expectations for progress over the course of the year. A Board of Admission subcommittee will meet the following March to review the student's case. Readmission is not guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Admission</head><p>A student may apply for transfer to Smith College in January or September after the completion of one or more semesters at another institution.</p><p>For January entrance, she must submit her application and send all credentials by November 15. The suggested filing date for September entrance is February 1, especially for students applying for financial aid. The application deadline is May 15. Letters from the financial aid office are mailed at the same time as admission letters.</p><p>We expect a transfer student to have a strong academic record and to be in good standing at the institution she is attending. We look particularly for evidence of achievement in college, although we also consider her secondary school record. Her program should correlate with the general Smith College requirements.</p><p>We require a candidate for the degree of bachelor of arts to spend at least two years in residence at Smith College in Northampton, during which time she normally completes 64 credits. A student may not transfer to the junior class and spend any part of the junior or senior year studying in off-campus programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Students</head><p>We welcome applications from qualified international students and advise applicants to communicate with the Office of Admission at least one year in advance of their proposed entrance. The initial email or letter should include information about the student's complete academic background. If financial aid is needed, this fact should be made clear in the initial correspondence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visiting Year Programs</head><p>Smith College welcomes a number of guest students for a semester or a year of study. In the Visiting Student Program, students enrolled in accredited, four-year liberal arts colleges or universities in the United States may apply to spend all or part of their sophomore, junior or senior year at Smith.</p><p>International students may apply to spend one semester or a year at Smith under the International Visiting Program. Applicants must be in their final year of studies leading to university entrance in their own country or currently enrolled in a university program abroad. If accepted, candidates will be expected to present examination results-Baccalaureate, Abitur or GCSE, for examplebefore enrolling. Evidence of English fluency will be required of applicants whose first language is not English.</p><p>Applicants for visiting programs should complete the Common Application for Transfer students. All required forms and instructions for completing the application are available on the Common Application website. Applications must be completed by July 1 for September entrance and by November 15 for January entrance. Financial aid is not available for these programs.</p><p>Information and application material may be obtained by visiting www. smith.edu/admission-aid or sending email to admission@smith.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission</head><p>See the Withdrawal and Readmission section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ada Comstock Scholars Program</head><p>The admission process for Ada Comstock Scholars is competitive. Particular emphasis is placed on academic achievement, an autobiographical essay and an exchange of information in the required interview. A candidate should schedule her interview appointment before submitting her application prior to the appropriate deadline, November 15 for January admission or February 1 for September admission. Interviews are usually conducted in person. Phone interviews can be arranged if distance is an issue. It is recommended that an applicant bring unofficial copies of her college transcripts to her interview appointment.</p><p>Ada Comstock Scholars are expected to have completed approximately 48 transferable liberal arts credits before matriculation at Smith. The average number of transfer credits for an admitted student is 52. Those students who offer little or no college-level work are advised to enroll elsewhere to fulfill this requirement before initiating the application process.</p><p>A candidate's status as an Ada Comstock Scholar must be designated at the time of application. Normally, an applicant admitted as a student of traditional age will not be permitted to change her class status to Ada Comstock Scholar until five years after she withdraws as a student of traditional age. A woman who meets the transfer credit guideline must apply as an Ada Comstock Scholar if she also meets the federal government's guidelines defining independent students: ‚Ä¢ at least 24 years old by December 31 of the academic year in which they enter Smith ‚Ä¢ a veteran ‚Ä¢ responsible for dependent(s) other than a spouse A brief description of the program can be found on page 14. Information about expenses and procedures for applying for financial aid can be found in the section entitled Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid. Inquiries in writing, by phone or by email may be addressed to the Office of Admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Degree</head><p>The requirements for the degree from Smith College are completion of 128 credits of academic work and satisfactory completion of a major. For graduation the minimum standard of performance is a cumulative average of 2.0 in all academic work and satisfactory completion (grade of C-or higher) of a writing intensive course in the first two semesters of enrollment.</p><p>Students earning a bachelor of arts degree must complete at least 64 credits outside the department or program of the major (56 credits for majors requiring the study of two foreign languages taught within a single department or program). Consult the "Academic Program" section for additional detail. The requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering are listed in the courses of study section under Engineering.</p><p>Candidates for the degree must complete at least four semesters of academic work, a minimum of 64 credits, in academic residence at Smith College in Northampton; two of these semesters must be completed during the junior or senior year. Courses taken through the Five College Interchange count toward the 64-credit academic residence requirement. A student on a Smith Study Abroad Program, the Jean Picker Semester-in-Washington Program or the Internship Program at the Smithsonian Institution is not in academic residence in Northampton.</p><p>Each student is responsible for knowing all regulations governing the curriculum and course registration and is responsible for planning a course of study in accordance with those regulations and the requirements for the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Program</head><p>The normal course program for traditional-aged undergraduates consists of 16 credits taken in each of eight semesters at Smith. Only with the approval of the administrative board may a student complete her degree requirements in fewer or more than eight semesters. The minimum course program for a traditional-aged undergraduate in any semester is 12 credits. A traditional-aged student who is enrolled in fewer than 12 credits in any semester is required to withdraw at the end of that semester. The student must remain away from the college for at least one semester and then may request readmission for the following semester.</p><p>Approved summer session or interterm credit may be used to supplement a minimum 12-credit program or to make up a shortage of credits. Smith students may accrue a maximum of 12 summer session credits and 12 interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree. An overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits may be applied toward the degree.</p><p>A student enters her senior year after completing a maximum of six semesters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter the senior year with fewer than 96 credits: exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student's return to campus for her final two semesters. A student in residence may carry no more than 24 credits per semester unless approved by the administrative board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Courses</head><p>Instructors are not required to hold spaces for students who do not attend the first class meeting and may refuse admittance to students seeking to add courses who have not attended the first class meetings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Permissions</head><p>Some courses require written permission of the instructor and/or chair of the department concerned before the course is elected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Rules and Procedures</head><p>A student who does not have the prerequisites for a course may elect it only with the permission of the instructor and the chair of the department in which the course is offered.</p><p>A student must petition the administrative board for permission to enter or drop a yearlong course with credit at midyear. The petition must be signed by the instructor of the course, the student's adviser and the chair of the department concerned before it is submitted to the class dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seminars</head><p>Seminars are limited to 12 students and are open, by permission of the instructor, to juniors, seniors and graduate students only. At the discretion of the instructor and with the approval of the department chair or the program director, 15 students may enroll. If enrollment exceeds this number, the instructor will select the best-qualified candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Studies</head><p>Permission of the instructor, the department chair and in some cases the department is required for the election of special studies. Special studies are open only to qualified sophomores, juniors and seniors. A maximum of 16 credits of special studies may be counted toward the degree.</p><p>The deadline for submission of the special studies application is the fifth day of classes in the semester. Normally students may not change the designated number of credits for a variable-credit special studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auditing</head><p>A degree student at Smith or at the Five Colleges may audit a course on a regular basis if space is available and the permission of the instructor is obtained. An audit is not recorded on the transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auditing by Nonmatriculated Students</head><p>A nonmatriculated student who has earned a high school diploma and who wishes to audit a course may do so with the permission of the instructor and the registrar. An auditor must submit a completed registration form to the registrar's office by the end of the second week of classes. A fee will be charged and is determined by the type of course. Studio classes may not be audited except by permission of the art faculty following a written request to the department. Official records of audits are not maintained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Registration</head><p>Early Registration Eligible students are expected to participate in the early registration periods, normally scheduled in November and April. During the two-week early registration period, students may register for no more than 19 credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adding and Dropping Courses</head><p>During the first 10 class days of a semester, a student may add or drop a course with the approval of the adviser and after consultation with the instructor. During this period, a student may register for up to 24 credits. Courses may be added online through BannerWeb during the first five class days only. From the 6th to the 10th day students may add courses with the permission of the instructor and adviser; from the 11th through the 15th day of class, a student may add a course with the permission of the instructor, the adviser and the class dean.</p><p>After the 10th day of classes a student may drop a course up to the end of the fifth week of the semester under the following conditions. 1. after discussion with the instructor; 2. with the approval of the adviser and the class dean; and 3. if, after dropping the course, she is enrolled in at least 12 credits. (This provision does not apply to Ada Comstock Scholars.) After the end of the fifth week of the semester a student may not drop a course. However, on two and only two occasions during her years at the college-once during her first year; once during any subsequent year-a student may "free drop" a course at any time up to the end of the ninth week of classes, for any reason, without penalty. The drop form requires the signatures of the instructor, adviser and class dean.</p><p>All add and drop deadlines for half-semester courses are prorated according to the above schedule and are published online each semester at the registrar's office website.</p><p>A student should carefully consider the work load entailed in a seminar or course with limited enrollment before she enrolls. A student who wishes to drop a class of this nature should do so at the earliest possible moment so that another student may take advantage of the opening. Because the organization and operation of such courses are often critically dependent on the students enrolled, the instructor may refuse permission to drop the course after the first 10 class days.</p><p>A course dropped for reasons of health after the fifth week of classes will be recorded on the transcript with a grade of "W," unless the student has the option of a free drop.</p><p>A student registers for an interterm course in November, with the approval of her adviser. In January, a student may drop or add an interterm course within the published add/drop period. (Please see the registrar's office website for registration and add/drop deadlines.) Otherwise, the student who registers but does not attend will receive a "U" (unsatisfactory) for the course.</p><p>Regulations governing changes in enrollment for courses in the Five College Interchange may be more restrictive than the above. Instructions and deadlines for registration in Five College courses are published online by the registrar's office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fine for Late Registration</head><p>A student who has not registered for courses by the end of the first 10 days of classes will be fined $35, payable at the time of registration. In addition, a fine of $35 will be assessed for each approved petition to add or drop a course after the deadline. A student who has not registered by the end of the first four weeks of the semester will be administratively withdrawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Work and Class Attendance</head><p>Students are expected to attend all their scheduled classes. Any student who is unable, because of religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from such activities without prejudice and shall be given an opportunity to make them up.</p><p>Students are asked to introduce guests to the instructor of a class before the beginning of the class if there is an opportunity and at the end if there is not.</p><p>Absence does not relieve the student from responsibility for work required while she was absent. The instructor may require her to give evidence that she has done the work assigned. In courses in which the written examinations can test only a part of the work, the instructor may rule that a student who does not attend class with reasonable regularity has not presented evidence that she has done the work.</p><p>The due date for final papers in each semester can be no later than the end of the examination period. Instructors must specify the acceptable format, exact deadline and place of delivery for final papers. If a paper or other course work is mailed to an instructor, it must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the student must keep a paper copy. It is the student's responsibility to check that work submitted by email or fax has been received by the professor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deadlines and Extensions</head><p>Only the class dean may authorize an extension for any reason beyond the end of the final examination period. Such extensions, granted for reasons of illness, emergency or extenuating personal circumstances, will always be confirmed in writing with the faculty member, the registrar and the student. An individual faculty member, without authorization by the class dean, may grant extensions on work due during the semester through the last day of final exams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Examination Period</head><p>The pre-examination study period, between the end of classes and the beginning of final examinations, is set aside for students to prepare for examinations. Therefore, the college does not schedule social, academic or cultural activities during this time. Deadlines for papers, take-home exams or other course work cannot be during the pre-examination study period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Examinations</head><p>Most final exams at Smith are self-scheduled and administered by the registrar during predetermined periods. A student may choose in which period she wants to take each exam. Exams are picked up at distribution centers after showing a picture ID and must be returned to the same center no more than two hours and 20 minutes from the time they are received by the student. Extra time taken to write an exam is considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. A student who is late for an exam may write for the remaining time in the examination period but may not have additional time. Exams that involve slides, dictation or listening comprehension are scheduled by the registrar. Such examinations may be taken only at the scheduled time.</p><p>For information regarding illness during the examination period, call Health Services at extension 2800 for instructions. Students who become ill during an examination must report directly to Health Services.</p><p>Further details of the Academic Honor Code as they apply to examinations and class work are given in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/ handbook). Regulations of the faculty and the registrar regarding final examination procedures are published online at the registrar's office website prior to the final examination period.</p><p>No scheduled or self-scheduled examination may be taken outside the regular examination period without prior permission of the administrative board. Written requests must be made to the administrative board through the class dean (not to individual faculty members). Requests to take final examinations early will not be considered; therefore, travel plans must be made accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Five College Course Enrollments</head><p>Students planning to enroll in a course at Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts may submit their requests online through BannerWeb. Five College course requests should be submitted during the period for advising and registration of courses for the coming semester. Course information is available online through the Five College online course guide or at the individual websites of the other four institutions. Free bus transportation to and from the institution is available for Five College students. Students in good standing are eligible to take a course at one of the other institutions: first-semester first-year students must obtain the permission of the class dean. Second-semester first-year students may take a course within the Five College system provided the student has earned a GPA of 3.0 or better in the first semester. A second-semester firstyear who wishes to enroll in two Five College courses needs permission from the first-year class dean. A traditional student must enroll in a minimum of 8 credits at Smith in any semester; an Ada Comstock scholar may take no more than half of her course program off campus. A student must register for an approved course at one of the other four institutions by the end of the interchange deadline (the first two weeks of the 40 Academic Rules and Procedures semester). Students must adhere to the registration procedures and deadlines of their home institution.</p><p>A list of Five College courses approved for Smith College degree credit is available at the registrar's office. Requests for approval of courses not on the list may be submitted to the registrar's office for review; however, Smith College does not accept all Five College courses for credit toward the Smith degree. Courses offered through their continuing education, extension or other nondegree programs are not part of the Five College Interchange. Students may not receive transfer credit for such courses completed while in residence at Smith College, but may receive transfer credit for those offered during interterm and summer.</p><p>Students taking a course at one of the other institutions are, in that course, subject to the academic regulations, including the calendar, grading option deadlines and academic honor system, of the host institution. Students taking Five College interchange courses will be awarded the credit value assigned by the host institution. It is the responsibility of the student to be familiar with the pertinent regulations of the host institution, including those for attendance, academic honesty, grading options and deadlines for completing coursework and taking examinations. Students follow the registration add/drop deadlines of their home institution. Regulations governing changes in enrollment in Five College courses are published online at the beginning of each semester at the registrar's office website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Credit</head><p>Smith College complies with federal regulations defining a credit hour. Normally, a four-credit course involves 12 hours per week of academically engaged time over the course of the semester. Academically engaged time is generally three class or contact hours per week plus nine additional hours of academic work for the course per week. For courses carrying more or fewer than four credits, the Smith College expectation is three hours per week of academically engaged time per credit over the course of the semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System</head><p>Grades are recorded by the registrar at the end of each semester. Grade reports are made available online through BannerWeb at that time.</p><p>Grades at Smith indicate the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A (4.0) C- (1.7) A- (3.7) D+ (1.3) B+ (3.3) D (1.0) B (3.0) D- (0.7) B- (2.7) E (0.0) C+ (2.3) S satisfactory(C-or better) C (2.0) U unsatisfactory X</formula><p>official extension authorized by the class dean M unreported grade calculated as a failure</p><p>Grades earned in Five College courses are recorded as submitted by the host institution. A Five College incomplete grade is equivalent to a failing grade and is calculated as such until a final grade is submitted. An incomplete grade will be converted to a failing grade on the student's official record if coursework is not completed by the end of the following semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Option</head><p>Coursework in any one semester may be taken for a satisfactory (C-or better)/ unsatisfactory grade, providing that: 1. the instructor approves the option; 2. the student declares the grading option for Smith courses by the end of the ninth week of classes. Students enrolled in Five College courses must declare the option at the host campus and follow the deadlines of that institution.</p><p>The fall deadline also applies to yearlong courses designated by a "D" in the course number. In yearlong courses designated by a "Y" students may elect a separate grading option for each semester. Students electing the satisfactory/ unsatisfactory (S/U) option for both semesters of a yearlong course must do so each semester. Within the 128 credits required for the degree, a maximum of 16 credits (Smith or other Five College) may be taken for the S/U grading option, regardless of how many graded credits students are enrolled in per semester. Some departments will not approve the S/U grading option for courses counting toward the major. Credits earned in courses with a mandatory S/U grading option are not counted toward the 16-credit limit.</p><p>S/U grades do not count in the grade point average. An Ada Comstock Scholar or a transfer student may elect the S/U grading option for four credits out of every 32 that she takes at Smith College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Courses</head><p>Effective in the fall 2017 semester, students may repeat for credit a course taken at Smith in which a grade of C or lower was earned. A maximum of two courses may be repeated during the student's period of enrollment. Permission of the student's liberal arts or major faculty adviser and the course instructor is required. A Smith course may be repeated at Smith only, not at another institution (including those in the Five College Interchange). A student repeating a course that was passed (a grade of D-or higher) and for which credit was earned will receive no additional course credit toward graduation. All grades earned in courses, including any repeated courses, will appear and remain on the student's transcript. Only the higher grade of a repeated course will be calculated into the term and cu mulative GPAs, however.</p><p>It is the student's responsibility to register a repeated course properly with the registrar's office at the time of registration by submitting a completed course repeat authorization form. Topics and other courses that are noted as repeatable for credit in the course description or department/program catalog section are not subject to this policy, unless the student receives permission to repeat the same topic and meets all criteria above. Students should refer to the registrar's office website (www.smith.edu/about-smith/registrar/policies-guidelines) for the complete course repeat policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance Credits</head><p>Students are allowed to count a limited number of performance credits toward the Smith degree. The maximum number allowed is indicated in the Courses of Study section under the appropriate departments (dance, exercise and sport science, and music). Excess performance credits are included on the transcript but do not count toward the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shortage of Credits</head><p>A shortage of credits incurred by failing or dropping a course may be made up by an equivalent amount of work carried above the normal 16-credit program, or with approved summer session or interterm courses accepted for credit toward the Smith College degree. In the case of failure in a course or dropping a course for reasons of health, a shortage may be filled with a student's available Advanced Placement or other pre-matriculation credits. Any student with more than a two-credit shortage may be required to complete the shortage before returning for classes in a subsequent semester.</p><p>A student enters the senior year after completing a maximum of six semesters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter her senior year with fewer than 96 credits; exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student's return to campus for her final two semesters. A student may not participate in a Smith-sponsored or affiliated Study Abroad or exchange program with a shortage of credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>A student who attends another accredited college or university and requests credit toward a Smith College degree for the work done there: 1. should make her plans in accordance with the regulations concerning offcampus study and, in the case of seniors, in accordance with the regulations concerning academic residence; 2. should obtain, from the registrar's office, the guidelines for transferring credit. Official transcripts should be sent directly to the registrar from the other institution; 3. must, if approved to study abroad, have her program approved in advance by the Committee on Study Abroad. Final evaluation of credit is made after receipt of the official transcript showing satisfactory completion of the program.</p><p>A student may not receive credit for work completed at another institution while in residence at Smith College, except for interterm courses and courses taken on the Five College interchange. Credit is not normally granted for online courses.</p><p>Transfer credit policies and guidelines are published online at the registrar's office website and are available in the office. Students may not transfer credit for academic work completed at an international institution while withdrawn from the college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Session Credit</head><p>Students may accrue a maximum of 12 approved summer session credits toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and pre-matriculation credits. With the prior approval of the registrar, summer credit may be used to allow students to make up a shortage of credits or to undertake an accelerated course program. For transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars, summer session credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interterm Credit</head><p>The college may offer courses for credit during the interterm period. Such courses will carry one to four credits and will count toward the degree. The college will consider for-credit academic interterm courses taken at other institutions for transfer credit. The number of credits accepted for each interterm course (normally up to 3) will be determined by the registrar upon review of the credits assigned by the host institution. Any interterm course designated as 4 credits by a host institution must be reviewed by the class deans and the registrar to determine whether it merits an exception to the 3-credit limit. Students may accrue a maximum of 12 approved interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits. Normally, students may not take more than 4 credits during any one interterm at Smith or elsewhere. For transfer students, interterm credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum.</p><p>The interterm may also be a period of reading, research or concentrated study for both students and faculty. Faculty, students or staff may offer noncredit instruction or experimental projects in this period. Special conferences may be scheduled and field trips may be arranged at the discretion of individual members of the faculty. Libraries, the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures, practice rooms and physical education facilities will remain open at the discretion of the departments concerned. This period also provides time for work in libraries, museums and laboratories at locations other than Smith College.</p><p>Students returning from a fall leave of absence or study elsewhere may participate in interterm, but are not guaranteed housing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Credit Earned Before Matriculation</head><p>Smith College will accept college credit with a grade of B-or better earned at an accredited college or university before matriculation as a first-year student. Such credit must be approved according to Smith College guidelines for transfer credit and submitted on an official college or university transcript. Such credits must be taken on the college or university campus with matriculated degree students and must be taught by a college or university professor. The course may not be listed on the high school transcript as counting toward high school graduation. Note that the restriction of 32 credits applied toward the Smith degree holds for any combination of Advanced Placement (AP) and/or college credit earned before matriculation. Prematriculation credits may be used in the same manner as AP credits toward the Smith degree and may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. Summer credits earned before matriculation will be counted in the 12-credit limit of summer credit applicable to the Smith degree. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, International Baccalaureate (IB), other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted towards the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>Smith College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. AP credit may be used with the approval of the administrative board only (1) to make up a shortage of credits incurred through failure; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> to make up a shortage of credit incurred as a result of dropping a course for reasons of health; or (3) to undertake an accelerated course program. AP credit may not be added to a student's record to make up for a failing grade received as a result of an Honor Board sanction.</p><p>Credits are recorded for scores of 4 or 5 on most AP examinations. The credits to be recorded for each examination are determined by the individual department. For students entering the college in September 2012 and later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP and other prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree.</p><p>Students who complete courses that cover substantially the same material as those for which AP credit is recorded may not then apply that AP credit toward the degree requirements. The individual departments will determine what courses cover the same material.</p><p>The individual departments will determine placement in or exemption from Smith courses and the use of Advanced Placement credit to fulfill major requirements. No more than 8 credits will be granted toward the major in any one department.</p><p>AP credit may be used to count toward the 64 credits outside the major department or program but may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Baccalaureate and Other Diploma Programs</head><p>Credit may be awarded for the International Baccalaureate (IB) and some 13thyear programs outside the United States. The amount of credit is determined by the registrar upon review of the final results. Such credits may be used toward the Smith degree in the same manner as AP credits and may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, IB, other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standing</head><p>A student is in good academic standing as long as she is matriculated at Smith and is considered by the administrative board to be making satisfactory progress toward the degree. The academic standing of all students is reviewed at the end of each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>A student whose academic record is below 2.0, either cumulatively or in a given semester, will be placed on academic probation for the subsequent semester. Probationary status is a warning. Notification of probationary status is made in writing to the student, her family and her academic adviser. Instructors of a student on probation may be asked to make academic reports to the class deans' offices during the period of probation. The administrative board will review a student's record at the end of the following semester to determine what action is appropriate. The administrative board may require such a student to change her course program, to complete summer study or to withdraw from the college. Any student on academic probation who is required by the Administrative Board to earn credit at another institution must earn a B-or better in each course in order for the course to transfer for credit at Smith.</p><p>In general, a student on probation is advised to take no more than 16 credits. She may not enroll in courses through the Five College interchange, and may not run for or hold elected or selected office, either campus wide or within her house. A student on probation is not considered to be in good academic standing, is not eligible to study abroad, and may not compete in intercollegiate athletics or club sports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standards for Satisfactory Progress</head><p>A student is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree if she remains on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters. In addition <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> for students of traditional age, the record cannot have more than an eight-credit shortage for more than two consecutive semesters <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> for Ada Comstock Scholars, at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic semester must be completed satisfactorily. Students not meeting this criterion may be placed on academic probation or required to withdraw; if students are receiving financial aid, they will be placed on financial aid warning and may become ineligible for financial aid if the probationary period exceeds one year. Further information is available from the class deans' office and the Office of Student Financial Services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absence from Classes</head><p>A student who is absent from classes for more than four weeks in any semester will not receive credit for the work of that semester and will be administratively withdrawn from the college.</p></div>

There will be no refund for tuition or room fees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administrative Board</head><p>The administrative board administers the academic requirements defined by faculty legislation. In general, academic matters affecting students are referred to this board for action or recommendation. The board consists of the dean of the college (chair), the class deans, the dean of the Ada Comstock Scholars, the registrar and three faculty members appointed by the president.</p><p>Petitions for exceptions to academic regulations are submitted in writing to the administrative board through the class dean, with appropriate faculty approvals. The administrative board will reconsider a decision only on the basis of gross error in procedure, new information that was not available at the time the original decision was made or extreme bias on the part of the Administrative Board. Appeals based on disagreement of the decision will not be considered.</p><p>The board has the authority to take action with respect to the academic performance of individual students, including the requirement that a student must leave the college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Academic Grievances</head><p>The Smith College community has always been dedicated to the advancement of learning and the pursuit of truth under conditions of freedom, trust, mutual respect and individual integrity. The learning experience at Smith is rooted in the free exchange of ideas and concerns between faculty members and students. Students have the right to expect fair treatment and to be protected against any inappropriate exercise of faculty authority. Similarly, instructors have the right to expect that their rights and judgments will be respected by students and other faculty members.</p><p>When differences of opinion or misunderstanding about what constitutes fairness in requirements or procedures leads to conflict, it is hoped that these differences will be resolved directly by the individuals involved. When disputes cannot be resolved informally by the parties involved, procedures have been established to achieve formal resolution. These procedures are explained in detail in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/handbook).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Privacy and the Age of Majority</head><p>Under Massachusetts law, the age of majority is 18 and carries full adult rights and responsibilities. The college normally communicates directly with students in matters concerning grades, academic credit and standing.</p><p>In communications with parents concerning most matters, it is normally college policy to respect the privacy of the student and not to disclose information from student educational records without the prior consent of the student, consistent with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). At the request of the student, such information will be provided to parents and guardians. Students may authorize the release of information from their education records to their parents by completing the appropriate form at the registrar's office.</p><p>However, FERPA makes clear that information from the educational records of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes may be disclosed to the parents without the student's prior consent. It is the policy of the college to notify both the dependent student and her parents in writing of probationary status, dismissal and certain academic warnings. Any student who is not a dependent of her parents, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, must notify the registrar of the college in writing, with supporting evidence satisfactory to the college, by October 1 of each academic year.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Smith College offers men and women graduate work leading to the degrees of master of arts in teaching, master of fine arts and master of science. The oneyear post-baccalaureate program in mathematics is designed for women who need additional preparation before applying to graduate programs in mathematics. In special one-year programs, international students may qualify for a certificate of graduate studies or a diploma in American studies. In addition, master of arts and doctoral programs are offered in the School for Social Work Each year more than 100 men and women pursue such advanced work.</p><p>Smith College is noted for its superb facilities, bucolic setting and distinguished faculty who are recognized for their scholarship and interest in teaching. Moreover, graduate students can expect to participate in small classes and receive personalized attention from instructors.</p><p>Most graduate courses, which are designated as 500-level courses in the course listings, are planned for graduate students who are degree candidates. The departments offering this work present a limited number of graduate seminars, advanced experimental work or special studies designed for graduate students. Graduate students may take advanced undergraduate courses, subject to availability and according to the provisions stated in the paragraphs describing the requirements for the graduate degrees. Departmental graduate advisers help graduate students individually to devise appropriate programs of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>To enter a graduate degree program, a student must have a bachelor's degree or its equivalent, an undergraduate record of high caliber, and acceptance by the department concerned. Applicants who wish to be considered for financial aid must submit all required application materials by the deadline date for their programs of interest. (Refer also to the Financial Assistance section.) The deadline for fall entry for most programs is January 15 and spring entry November 1. If no financial aid is needed, most master's degree programs will accept late applications for fall until April 1. Exceptions: master of fine arts in dance, January 5, with no late applications and no spring admission; master of science in biological sciences, no late applications and no spring admission; master of arts in teaching, rolling admission beginning December 1 and ending May 1; and post-baccalaureate/mathematics, March 15 for fall, October 15 for spring.</p><p>Applicants must submit the materials listed on the application for admission, including the formal application form, the $60 application fee, the official transcript of the undergraduate record, letters of recommendation from instructors at the undergraduate institution, and (in some cases) the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must submit official results from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). International applicants from English-speaking countries must submit results from the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). All candidates must also submit a paper written in an advanced undergraduate course, except for MFA/playwriting candidates, who must submit one or more full-length scripts or their equivalent. Direct correspondence and questions to the Office of Graduate and Special Programs.</p><p>Smith College is committed to maintaining a diverse community in an atmosphere of mutual respect and appreciation of differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate and Special Programs</head><p>Residence Requirements Students who are registered for a graduate degree program at Smith College are considered to be in residence. A full-time graduate student takes a minimum course program of 12 credits per semester. A half-time student takes a minimum course program of eight credits per semester. With the approval of his or her academic adviser and the director of graduate and special programs, a student may take a maximum of 12 credits for degree credit at Amherst, Hampshire or Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts. No more than two courses (eight credits) will be accepted in transfer from outside of the Five Colleges. We strongly recommend that work for advanced degrees be continuous; if it is interrupted or undertaken on a part-time basis, an extended period is permitted, but all work for a master's degree normally must be completed within a period of four years. Exceptions to this policy will be considered by petition to the Administrative Board. During this period, a continuation fee of $60 will be charged each semester during which a student is not enrolled at Smith College in course work toward the degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leaves of Absence</head><p>A student who wishes to be away from the college for a semester or academic year for personal reasons may request a leave of absence. The request must be filed with the director of graduate and special programs by May 1 for a fall semester or academic-year leave; by December 1 for a second-semester leave. No leaves of absence will be approved after May 1 for the following fall semester or academic year and December 1 for the spring semester, and the student must withdraw from the college.</p><p>A leave of absence may not be extended beyond one full academic year, and a student who wants to be away from the college for more than one year must withdraw.</p><p>A student on a leave of absence is expected to adhere to the policies regarding such leaves. A student's tuition account must be in good standing or the leave of absence will be canceled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Programs</head><p>Grade requirements vary, depending on the program. The master of science in biological sciences, master of fine arts in dance, and master of fine arts in theater require that all work to be counted toward the degree (including the thesis) must receive grades of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. Students in the master of science in exercise and sport studies are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or higher throughout the program, and the master of arts in teaching requires a student to have at least a 3.0 grade point average at the time of graduation in order to have earned the degree. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. The requirements described below are minimal. Any department may set additional or special requirements and thereby increase the total number of courses involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Master of Science in Biological Sciences</head><p>The Department of Biological Sciences maintains an active graduate program leading to the master of science in biological sciences. The program of study emphasizes independent research supported by advanced course work. Candi-dates are expected to demonstrate a strong background in the life sciences and a clear commitment to independent laboratory, field and/or theoretical research. The department offers opportunities for original work in a wide variety of fields, including animal behavior, biochemistry, cell and developmental biology, ecology, environmental science, evolutionary biology, genetics, marine biology, microbiology, molecular biology, neurobiology, plant sciences and physiology. Students pursuing the M.S. degree are required to participate in the Graduate Seminar (BIO 507) and are expected to undertake a course of study, designed in conjunction with their adviser, that will include appropriate courses both within and outside the department.</p><p>A thesis is also required of each candidate for this degree. It may be limited in scope but must demonstrate scholarly competence; it is equivalent to a two-semester, eight-credit course. A copy must be presented to the committee for deposit in the library. The thesis may be completed in absentia only by special permission of the department and of the director of graduate and special programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Master of Science in Exercise and Sport Studies</head><p>The graduate program in exercise and sport studies focuses on preparing coaches for women's intercollegiate teams. The curriculum blends theory courses in exercise and sport studies with hands-on coaching experience at the college level. By design, the program is a small one, with only 15 to 20 candidates in residence. This makes it possible for students to work independently with faculty and coaches. Smith has a history of excellence in academics and a wide-ranging intercollegiate program composed of 14 varsity sports. Entrance into the two-year program requires a strong undergraduate record and playing and/or coaching experience in the sport that a student will be coaching. Individuals who do not have undergraduate courses in exercise physiology and kinesiology should anticipate work beyond the normal 51 credits. For more information, contact the Department of Exercise and Sport Studies, Smith College, Northampton, MA 01063, 413-585-3971.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cities of Light: Urban Spaces in Francophone Film</head><p>From Paris to Fort-de-France, Montreal to Dakar, we study how various filmmakers from the Francophone world present urban spaces as sites of conflict, solidarity, alienation and self-discovery. How do these portraits confirm or challenge the distinction between urban and non-urban? How does the image of the city shift for "insiders" and "outsiders"? Other topics to be discussed include immigration, colonialism and globalization. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>French Travel Writing and Self-Discovery</head><p>A survey of Francophone travel writing from the 16th to the 21st centuries. Students are exposed to a literary form that achieved popularity and cultural prestige early on, was then significantly challenged and diversified, and is presently enjoying a resurgence. We consider fictional and nonfictional accounts reflecting various geographies of travel and migration. While early voyagers tended to assert the relative superiority of French culture, subsequent generations of travelers abandoned discovery for self-discovery, and critiqued colonialism instead of indigenous cultures. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discourses of Development</head><p>This course interrogates and historicizes the problem of "development" in 20thcentury Africa. In doing so, we query the assumptions made by colonial officials, postcolonial leaders, social scientific experts and local communities as they sought to understand and articulate African pathways into a largely ill-defined social and economic modernity. Key subjects of enquiry include an analysis of the relationship between western and non-Western "modernities," and explorations into the link between knowledge and power in our own interpretations of the past and of the so-called "underdeveloped world." Enrollment limited to 18. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission</head><p>The Department of Africana Studies investigates the social, historical, cultural and aesthetic works and practices of populations of African descent throughout the diaspora. A multidisciplinary endeavor, our interrogations begin not with race as an assumed concept but as a site of profound social formation that must be considered in relation to gender, class, nation, ethnicity, religion and sexuality. We understand our mandate to be two-fold: to provide a coherent, grounded body of knowledge for our majors and minors as well as to serve the broader academic and cocurricular needs of the college. In all of these endeavors, we emphasize the need for students to develop their analytic capacities.</p><p>A student in our department is first a critical thinker, one who learns to ask questions, seek connections, unpack what is invisible or ignored. Our courses emphasize close reading, research and writing, and our curriculum expects students to think about the Caribbean, Africa and diaspora communities in Europe and elsewhere. In support of this expectation, we encourage students to travel abroad.</p></div>

Guided by a general research topic or theme, students are exposed to different methods for asking questions and gathering evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Soul and Post-Soul</head><p>Beginning with Nelson George in 1992 scholars have invoked "post-soul" to describe black culture and politics after the civil-rights era. Scholars use "postsoul" to frame discussions of the socioeconomic and political changes arising after the 1960s; conceptualize cultural identity by differentiating it from black arts/soul era arts and politics; and theorize black aesthetic productions of the period (e.g. literature, performance, visual arts, music). Using soul and post-soul as organizing conceits, this course will give students an introduction to, and practice in, the tools of intellectual investigation in the study of African-American history and culture/ racial formations. Students will read, attend lectures and learn from scholars whose work is based in particular disciplines (especially history, literature, cultural studies and the social sciences). You will also learn the challenges and opportunities made possible by doing interdisciplinary research. Through the multi-and interdisciplinary approach to a single topic or text (in the case of this semester, soul and post-soul), students will learn how scholars in each discipline ask certain kinds of research questions, take certain kinds of research approaches; and how to put these various methods in conversation with each other. Finally, students will also have an opportunity to develop their own research project related to the focus of this course (race, ethnicity, and the social construction of identity) by means of library and media-based research. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approaches to the African Diaspora</head><p>Using theories and conceptualizations of the African diaspora as a case study, this course gives students an introduction to and practice in the tools of intellectual investigation in the study of black history and culture/racial formations in the United States and internationally. Students read, attend lectures and learn from scholars whose work is based in particular disciplines (especially history, literature, cultural studies and the social sciences). You also learn the chal-lenges of and opportunities made possible by doing interdisciplinary research. Through the multi-and interdisciplinary approach to a single topic or text (in the case of this semester, the diaspora), students learn how scholars in each discipline ask certain kinds of research questions and take certain kinds of research approaches, and how these various methods in conversation with each other. Finally, students develop their own research project related to the focus of this course (race, ethnicity and the social construction of identity) by means of library and media-based research. In this course we examine contemporary African-American families from both a sociocultural and socioeconomic perspective. We explore the issues facing African-American families as a consequence of the intersecting of race, class and gender categories of America. The aim of this course is to broaden the student's knowledge of the internal dynamics and diversity of African-American family life and to foster a greater understanding of the internal strengths as well as the vulnerabilities of the many varieties of African-American families. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exiles, Transplants and In-betweeners: Literatures of the African Diaspora</head><p>Same as ENG 316. This seminar focuses on some of the major perspectives, themes, and theoretical underpinnings in the field of African diasporic studies. We read 20th-and 21st-century fiction and nonfiction from a range of cultural traditions that explore the conditions of displacement and uprootedness which characterize the African diaspora; we also investigate the transformations of culture and identity that result from forced and voluntary migrations. The course's primary focus is on literary depictions of transnational identities and communities and questions of citizenship and belonging, in fiction by and about "inbetweeners" who inhabit cultural and national borderlands. Our investigation draws primarily from novels, but may also include examples from other genres, including poetry, short stories and memoir. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Afro-Brazilian Culture</head><p>Considering the myth of a "racial democracy", how have black Brazilian artists constructed memory and identity through their artistic production? How do the politics of race, gender, class, sexuality, and national identity shape Afro-Brazilian cultural (con)texts? This course explores a multi-genre selection of Afro-Brazilian literary texts from the 20th and 21st centuries to examine the connections between cultural production and identity politics. Our study will also consider other types of Afro-Brazilian artistic expressions such as music, performance, and visual culture. This course also provides an opportunity for students to develop comparative inquiries on the black diasporic experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blackness, Being and Becoming</head><p>This class uses canonical literature, as well as cultural productions and critical theory, in order to explore blackness as a modern racial formation (i.e. an idea with material consequences) and an identity. Beginning with the 19th century slave narrative tradition, and moving through the 20th and 21st centuries, we will explore how African Americans use written, sonic and visual languages to resist Eurocentric projections of otherness onto black bodies. Using theoretical frames-such as fugitive and unmoored subjectivity, demonic grounds, and the black interior-students will critically engage representational works that mediate on "blackness" not only in terms of nonbeing, but also in terms of becoming. In other words, we will treat the black imagination as a critical site of inquiry because of its construction of racialized subjectivity as varied, complex, and evolving. Examples from sonic and visual culture will be drawn from multiple sources. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Political Economy of Development in Africa</head><p>Since postcolonial times, Africa has seen both hope and despair for its development. This seminar explores the roles of many factors in the development of African states and the uplifting from poverty of individual Africans. In particular, we look at infrastructure and investment; health and education; trade; finance and markets; the choice of policy; and the effects of institutions, governance and politics. We also try to make sense of the differences and the similarities among the various paths to development in Africa. This seminar examines the various forms of black "politics," broadly conceived, that emerged and developed in the wake of the modern civil rights movement to the present time. Major topics of concern include: black nationalism and electoral politics, black feminism, resistance to mass incarceration, the war on drugs, black urban poverty, the rise of the black middle class, reparations, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decolonization, Nation and Political Imagination in Africa</head><p>This course explores the politics of decolonization and nationalism in 20th-century Africa, while paying particular attention to the ways in which diverse groups of Africans-women, ethnic and racial minorities, political exiles, youth and expatriates, among others-articulated their unique views of the "nation" as they made the transition from colonial to self-rule. Key topics include issues of resistance and collaboration in African anticolonial movements, gender and popular culture in late colonial and postcolonial Africa, the Cold War, and the promise and disappointment of the postcolonial state. Enrollment limited to 18 students. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remembering Slavery: A Gendered Reading of the WPA Slave Interviews</head><p>Despite the particular degradation, violence and despair of enslavement in the United States, African American men and women built families, traditions and a legacy of resistance. Using the WPA interviews-part of the New Deal Federal Writers Project of the 1930s-this course looks at the historical memory of former slaves by reading and listening to their own words. How did 70-through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle? The course examines the WPA interviews as historical sources by studying scholarship that relies heavily on them. Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slavery. Students write an original research paper using the WPA interviews as their central source. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Race and Rebellion: Palenques and Cimarrones in the Americas</head><p>Most accounts of the slave trade and antislavery and abolition movements reflect European historical points of view. Few are the original documents by former slaves, but many are the actions and events documented in archives and chronicles regarding revolts. The goal of this class is to search for the voices and actions of the cimarrones, the "rebellious subjects" that sought freedom from the moment they were captured. The class explores the cultural phenomena of cimarronaje and the many run-away enclaves formed by Africans throughout the Americas. Attention is given to strategies of resistance particularly in Brazil, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Gay '80s</head><p>In this seminar, we look at the gay culture in the 1980s. In this regard, we consider four particular aspects: the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and the activism that engages this crisis; the explosion of underground and mainstream art (visual art, music, literature, film, theater) that showcases an interest in thinking about sexuality, gender and gender normativity, sex and eroticism, and intersectionality; the decade's culture of conservatism, especially in relationship to the legacy of the '60s and the '70s; and the emergence of queer studies scholarship. To act, to perform is to speculate with your body. Theatre is a transformative experience that takes performer and audience on an extensive journey in the playground of the imagination beyond the mundane world. Theatre asks us to be other than ourselves. We can for a time inhabit someone else's skin, be shaped by another gender or ethnicity, become part of a past epoch or an alternative time and space similar to our own time but that has yet to come. As we enter this "imagined" world we investigate the normative principles of our current world. This course investigates the counterfactual, speculative, subjunctive impulse in overtly speculative drama and film with a particular focus on race and gender. We examine an international range of plays by such authors as Caryl Churchill, Because of the wide-ranging interests and methods included within the interdisciplinary American studies program, careful consultation between a student and her adviser is crucial to the planning of the major.</p><p>In order to structure their studies of American society and culture, majors select a focus-such as an era (e.g., antebellum America, the 20th century) or a topical concentration (e.g., ethnicity and race, urban life, social policy, material culture, the family, industrialization, the arts, the media, popular culture, comparative American cultures)-which they will explore in at least four courses. It is expected that several courses in the major will explore issues outside the theme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies</head><p>Because American studies courses are located primarily in two divisions, humanities and social sciences, students are to balance their studies with courses in each. Courses taken S/U may not be counted toward the major.</p><p>Requirements: 12 semester courses, as follows:</p><p>‚Ä¢ 201 and 202.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Eight courses in the American field: at least four must be focused on a theme defined by the student; at least two must be in the humanities and at least two in the social sciences; at least two must be devoted primarily to the years before the 20th century; at least one must be a seminar, ideally in the theme selected (340/341 does not fulfill the seminar requirement Since the 1950s rock 'n' roll and other forms of youth-oriented popular music in the U.S. have embodied rebellion. Yet the rebellion that rock and other popular music styles like rap have offered has often been more available to men than women. Similarly, the sexual liberation associated with popular music in the rock and rap eras has been far more open to "straight" desires over "queer." This course will examine how popular music from the 1950s to the present has been shaped by gender and sexuality, and the extent to which the music and its associated cultural practices have allowed artists and audiences to challenge gender and sexual norms, or alternately have served to reinforce those norms albeit with loud guitars and a heavy beat. Enrollment limited to 20 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curating American Memories</head><p>Which histories become part of national memory, and which do not? This course interrogates the intellectual, political and pedagogical bases of literature, museums and public history in the U.S. from the 18th century to today. We devote part of our time to the theoretical readings that will ground our inquiry: texts range from museum studies, anthropology and sociology, to history, literary studies and cultural studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMS 229 Native New England</head><p>In this course we interrogate the space now known as "New England" by learning about it as a land with histories, peoples and life ways that predate and exceed the former English colonies and current United States. We devote our semester to studying the cultural distinctiveness of the Native peoples of New England-for example, the Mohawk, Mohegan, Abenaki, Wampanoag and Schaghticoke peoples-and to understanding the historical processes of encounter, adaptation, resistance and renewal that have characterized Native life in the area for centuries. We explore histories of the pre-and post-"contact" period through the perspectives of various Native communities, and discuss the legacies of these histories for Native New England today. institutional networks that support conservative coalition-building and the propagation of conservative ideas (media, think tanks, PACs); the "tribal" polarization of the American political parties around issues such as race, gender, sexuality, climate change, and gun control. We will seek especially to analyze and interpret the election of Donald Trump as the nation's 45th president. Enrollment limit of 25.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AMS 235 American Popular Culture</head><p>This course offers an analytical history of American popular culture since 1865. We start from the premise that popular culture, far from being merely a frivolous or debased alternative to high culture, is an important site of popular expression, social instruction and cultural conflict. We examine theoretical texts that help us to "read" popular culture, even as we study specific artifacts from a variety of pop culture sources, from television shows to Hollywood movies, the pornography industry to spectator sports, and popular music to theme parks. We pay special attention to questions of desire, and to the ways popular culture has mediated and produced pleasure, disgust, fear and satisfaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culture and Catastrophe</head><p>According to a growing number of social theorists and scientists, the critical task of our time is to grasp the environmental conditions, economic systems, technological developments, and political ideologies that have set us on a path to converging and compounding catastrophes: climate change, resource exhaustion, inequality, social fragmentation, and political repression. This course begins by examining how these conditions have shaped American culture, and asks why news broadcasts, the entertainment industry, and social media so often respond to crises with distraction, diversion, disinformation, fear-mongering, and scapegoating. We explore the efforts of artists and activists to devise expressive forms (in visual arts, fiction, poetry, essays, movies, music) to constructively confront social and environmental hazards. </p></div>

As we examine these works, we grapple with questions of interviewing, structure, ethics, fair representation and more. This critical approach informs the course's workshop component, in which students compose and revise their own stories, receiving feedback from peers as well as the instructor. This seminar examines the history, functions and meanings of museums in society, focusing primarily on the art museum in the United States. Drawing on the ever-growing literature on museology, we look critically at the ways that museums-through their policies, programs, architecture and exhibitionscan define regional or national values, shape cultural attitudes and identities, and influence public opinion about both current and historical events. As the course is concerned with both theory and practice, and the intersection of the two, we make use of the rich resources of the Smithsonian as well as other museums in Washington, D.C. Class discussion is balanced with behind-thescenes visits/field trips to museums, where we speak with dedicated professionals who are engaged in innovative and often challenging work in the nation's capital. <ref type="figure">(</ref> The minor in ancient studies provides students with the opportunity to consolidate a program of study on the ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds based on a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Courses in history, art, religion, classics, government, philosophy and archaeology make up the minor.

This course studies past cultures and societies through their material remains and explores how archaeologists use different field methods, analytical technique and theoretical approaches to investigate, reconstruct and learn from the past. Data from settlement surveys, site excavations and artifact analysis are used to address economic, social, political and ideological questions across time and space. This course is taught from an anthropological perspective, exploring key transitions in human prehistory, including the origins of food production, social inequality and state-level societies across the globe.

The course provides students with a solid foundation for Anthropology 89 evaluating and contextualizing current methodological and theoretical trends within archaeology. Case studies illustrate the diversity of archaeological thought, interdisciplinary approaches to studying material culture, and innovative directions in the field of anthropological archaeology. Discussions of practice address the roles and responsibilities of archaeologists in heritage management, museum development, and community outreach. Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ANT 223 In Sickness and in Health: Biopolitics, Public Health, and Medicine in East Asia Same as EAS 223. What happens when states focus on their citizen's potential productivity and discipline to serve the interests of the nation? Biopolitics or the regulation and optimization of populations relies on biomedicine, science, statistics, laws, and policies to ensure the health and future of the nation. Using an anthropological lens the course examines how trajectories of East Asian history, politics, and science intersect with health in our globally connected futures. From SARS, AIDS, and Avian Flu, the dynamics of public health and medicine in East Asia offer an opportunity to develop insights into the relations between states, populations, and citizens. (E) {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ANT 224 Anthropos in the Anthropocene: Human-Environment Relations in a Time of Ecological Crisis Same as ENV 224. Anthropology seeks to understand human life in all its complexity, but what constitutes "the human" is far from straightforward. This course examines the changing ways that "Anthropos" is being understood in an era of rapid global climate change and our planet's sixth mass extinction event, both driven by human activities. We review perspectives on the relationship between humans and their environment from various cultural perspectives, considering how they engage notions of race, class, and gender, and what they imply for nature conservation. Topics include modernity, pets, cyborgs, kinship, symbiosis, extinction, species invasions, settler colonialism, and the Anthropocene concept. Enrollment limit of 30. {S} Credits: 4 Colin B Hoag Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ANT 226 Archaeology of Food This course explores (1) how and why humans across the globe began to domesticate plant and animal resources approximately 10,000 years ago, and (2) new directions in the archaeology of food across time and space. The first part of the semester focuses on the types of archaeological data and analytical methods used to understand the "agricultural revolution." Case studies from both centers and noncenters of domestication are used to investigate the biological, economic and social implications of changing foodways. During the remainder of the semester, emphasis is placed on exploring a number of foodrelated topics within archaeology, such as the relationship between agriculture and sedentism, food and gender, the politics of feasting, and methods for integrating archaeological and ethnographic approaches to the study of food across the globe. This course is also offered at Mount Holyoke College in fall 2018 (ANT 216). {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ANT 229 Africa and the Environment In Western discourses, African environments are defined by violence, famine, and degradation-symptoms of African cultures that resist Western values such as private property, democracy, and environmentalism. This course encourages students to think critically about such portrayals by learning about specific environments in Africa and how humans have interacted with them across time. The syllabus is anchored in cultural anthropology, but includes units on human evolution, the origins and spread of pastoralism, the history of colonial conservation science, and more. Topics covered include gender, race, land grabbing, indigenous knowledge, the commons, the "cattle complex," desertification, oil, dams, and nationalism. {H} {N} {S} Credits: 4 Colin B.

These approaches include social organization and individual agency, adaptation and evolution of human culture, culture and personality, economic behavior, human ecology, the anthropology of development and change, and postmodern interpretation. ANT 249 Visual Anthropology This course considers the unique perspectives, techniques and theories that anthropology offers for understanding the visual world. We focus on the production of visual materials (photographs and films, in particular) by anthropologists, as well as on the anthropological analysis of visual artifacts produced by other people. We consider the historical (particularly colonial) legacies of visual anthropology as well as its current manifestations and contemporary debates. Particular attention is paid to issues of representation, authority, authenticity, and circulation of visual materials. Enrollment limited to 30.

Through ethnographic and historical readings, film and discussion, this course examines how issues pertaining to women and gender relations have been highlighted in political, economic and cultural institutions. The course compares the ways that Asian women have experienced these processes through three major topics: war and revolution, the gendered aspects of work and women in relation to the family. This course is co-sponsored by, and cross-listed in, the East Asian Studies Program. </p></div>

This course traces significant anthropological approaches to the study of religion, asking what these approaches contribute to our understanding of religion in the contemporary world. Topics include religious experience and rationality; myth, ritual and magic; rites of passage; function and meaning; power and alienation; religion and politics. Readings are drawn from important texts in the history of anthropology and from contemporary ethnographies of religion. {S} Credits: 4 Pinky Hota Normally offered each academic year Seminars ANT 317 Seminar: The Anthropology of Landscape-Space, Place, Nature Landscapes have long figured as a backdrop for anthropological studies, but recently the landscape has emerged as an object of deeper interest. From abandoned city blocks in Detroit, the shores of Walden Pond, the savannas of Eastern Africa, or the Chernobyl exclusion zone, landscapes are potent social and material phenomena. In this course, we explore theories of landscape from different disciplinary perspectives, and then use them to think through the ways that landscapes present themselves to anthropologists and their subjects. Topics include post-industry, colonial gardens, the US "West," invasive species, environmental racism, time, capitalism, cartography and counter-mapping, and environmental conservation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethnographic Writing</head><p>Anthropological writing must convey the life-worlds of people and the textures of ethnographic encounters and fieldwork, and engage with and refine anthropological theories. How can writing do all of this at once? And as we craft a narrative, what do we leave out? Do we really describe ethnographic "reality" or do we create anthropological fictions? Why then do we look to ethnographic accounts to understand societies and cultures? Anthropological writing has dealt with these questions and more since its inception but most profoundly since the 1980s. In this class, we read pieces that reflect on and innovate with writing as anthropological praxis, the doubts that have riddled it and the larger developments these doubts have engendered around issues of fact versus fiction, representation, narrative style, writing as a form of political action and the creation of knowledge. We also workshop ethnographic writing in class to observe these tensions in our own work, understand them as rites in the creation of anthropological knowledge and work through them to craft anthropological narratives. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biopower, Biopolitics, and Governance</head><p>The obesity epidemic, personalized cancer treatments, and the commercialization of surrogate pregnancy represent manifestations of Foucault's conception of biopower or the regulation of the lives of individuals and populations. While institutions like law, medicine, and public health can make visible state interests in bodies and population, more indirect social processes operate to the same ends. For example, advertising and consumer products indirectly shape norms and ideals convergent with government interests. This seminar explores the workings and limitations of biopower, biopolitics, and governance through case studies drawn from anthropology. Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years Traditional Chinese Medicine: Transformations and Transitions in China, Japan and the U.S. With a history of over 4,000 years, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is often perceived as a timeless, unchanging medical tradition. TCM, however, has undergone numerous transitions and transformations throughout its history. TCM has also traveled throughout the world where its principles and theories have been adopted in the development of medical systems in Japan and Korea among others. In the past 30 years, TCM has gained increasing popularity and credibility in the U.S. and Europe. This course examines how Traditional Chinese Medicine, much as any medical system of theory and practice, responds to historical and contemporary social, economic and political forces within China and in countries such as Japan and the U.S. Students explore the broad question as to what constitutes TCM through time and across cultures as a means to better understand the processes of translation and transformation of theories, beliefs and practices in different cultural, political, economic and social contexts.

We begin with a historical overview and introduce the field's core vocabulary and theoretical paradigms. We then turn to the role of the social sciences in the evolving discussion of medical ethics, noting the late engagement of medical anthropology. A core question is whether there is a meaningful distinction between an anthropology of medical ethics and an anthropology in medical ethics. Students select a medical ethics issue to explore in depth, with the goal of determining the sociocultural context that has shaped the way the issue is framed. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ANT 347 Seminar: Topics in Anthropology Topics course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Anthropology of Multiculturalism</head><p>In the United States, the idea of multiculturalism has come to symbolize the right of communities with distinct cultures to maintain their own ways of living in a diverse national society. Similar politics of difference have developed in other countries in the world. But is multiculturalism the same idea in every national context? How do the different histories of countries in North or South America, Europe, Asia or Africa influence the way that these different national multiculturalisms develop? How do trans-national trends in the politics of culture and diversity get adapted to work in these different contexts? The course will focus on specific historic and ethnographic studies that document the relationship between the culture and history of different national and local communities and trends of contemporary multicultural traditions. A range of readings will introduce general topics which students will apply to specific contexts for their own research. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Politics of Language</head><p>Language policies have emerged as a particularly contentious space in which national and minority groups express their sense of collective identity and rights. Demanding respect for minority languages, and promoting their use in daily life or mass media, becomes especially important in cases where language loss is associated with forced cultural assimilation or different forms of discrimination. In this seminar, each student develops a case study of language rights issues based on a particular language or language group. Topics can include the politics of bilingual education, the representation of minority languages in different media, the relationship to language and human rights, and the practical work of language revitalization. The interdepartmental minor in archaeology is a complement to any one of several departmental majors. Archaeological methods and evidence can be used to illuminate various disciplines and will aid the student in the analysis of information and data provided by field research.</p></div>

A list of approved courses is available on the program website at www.smith.edu/arch. 3. A project in which the student works outside of a conventional classroom but under appropriate supervision on an archaeological question approved in advance by her adviser. The project may be done in a variety of ways and places; for example, it may be excavation (fieldwork), or work in another aspect of archaeology in a museum or laboratory, or in an area closely related to archaeology such as geology or computer science. Students are encouraged to propose projects related to their special interests. This project may be, but does not need to be, one for which the student receives academic credit. If the project is an extensive one for which academic credit is approved by the registrar and the advisory committee, it may count as one of the six courses required for this minor.</p><p>No more than two courses counting toward the student's major program may be counted toward the archaeology minor.

Utilizing the lens of interdisciplinary animals studies we explore how the Romans thought with animals representationally in ways which may initially seem familiar but prove to be distinctively different in culturally specific ways. Considering how the human/animal binary works in a past culture has the potential to reveal something about how systems of knowledge and power are structured and maintained.

These powerful visualization tools produce compelling seamless worlds, but ones which raise challenging questions of interpretation. By seeking to understand the models and assumptions on which these virtual worlds are based we delve into contemporary and ancient modes or viewership, identity and spatial experience. In particular, students will select and research an object or objects for which to develop an "object biography," through which the people who produced, used, and re-used these objects might be accessed. Additional attention is given to the place of objects in archaeological practice and narratives. Members of the Archives Advisory Committee serve as advisers to students in approving course selections and internships.</p><p>The archives concentration is designed to make our local, regional, national and international histories public through research projects and professional training. Through a combination of academic coursework, practical experience and independent research projects, students learn about the institutions and repositories that shape knowledge and understanding of our collective pasts through the collection, preservation, interpretation and display of artifacts, manuscripts and representation of historic sites. The concentration creates an interdisciplinary community of students engaged in first-hand use of primary sources in the arts and architecture, medicine, law, history, social activism, the histories of institutions, communities and professional organizations. Through a sequence of courses, students gain knowledge of the theory and practice of archives and public history methods through which these materials are shaped into compelling narratives. Through practical experiences in two internships, students learn about archival acquisition, processing and description skills, and building finding aids that make collections available for scholarly use. Students in disciplines in which archival research is already featured (such as history, American studies, and the study of women and gender) as well as in the sciences and a wide array of social sciences are encouraged to apply. Requirements 1. The archives concentration is open to any student by application (see www. smith.edu/archives for deadlines and application process).

In addition to some short secondary source readings, students then choose preselected documents from 14 designated collections and in conversation with each other, both in class and in five written responses on Moodle, discuss the ways in which a particular individual or organization has addressed issues of economic injustice-what worked, what did not, what needs to happen next. Graded S/U only. Credits: 1 Kathleen Banks Nutter Normally offered each interterm ARX 106 Oral Histories and Archives In this week long course, students will be introduced to oral history as both a form of evidence and as a method. We will explore the oral history collections in the archives-including Voices of Feminism, Population and Reproductive Health, Living Women's History, Documenting Lesbian Lives, and the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project-in order to evaluate oral history as a primary source. What do we learn from oral testimony that is different from traditional archival sources? How do we read this kind of text? And how are these sources produced? You will also be introduced to oral history methods in order to prepare for theses and/or independent research projects that employ this research strategy. Enrollment limited to 16; priority given to Archives concentrators. Graded S/U only. Credits: 1 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ARX 107 Making Teaching and Learning Tangible: Understanding Childhood Through the Archives Children's experiences are often left out of history and historical accounts. Yet, children and youth feel empowered when they can encounter themselves in history. This course has students work through a question using the SSC collection that examines situated childhoods. In addition, students learn how to formulate their own research question and gather archival documents that facilitate lesson plans or discussion with elementary, junior high and high school students about the expectation of children and childhood at different points in history. This course is suited for students who have a passion for child development or who want to develop their pedagogical repertoires. Enrollment limit of 25. Graded S/U only.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>200-Level Lecture Courses ARH 200 China in Expansion</head><p>During the formative periods when the local and global forces simultaneously took actions in shaping Chinese civilization, the functions of images and objects, the approaches to things, and the discourses around art underwent significant shifts, not only responding to but also mapping out the "Chineseness" in visual and material culture. This course of early Chinese art investigates diverse media-bronze vessels, sculptures, murals, textiles, architecture and other visual and material forms-in relation to political and military conquest, cross-cultural exchange, the dissemination of ordinary practices, and the formation of identities. Key terms/issues for the course will include expansion, connection, and materiality. Prompted by recent concerns about 'fake news' and the proliferation of digitally manipulated photographs, the course explores the history of the illustrated press from its nineteenth-century origins to today. How did images contribute to readers' sense of what is worthy of attention in the realm of politics, fashion, and the arts? How did practices of pictorial reporting influence the unfolding of events? In what ways did arts periodicals prompt the emergence of artistic forms that blurred traditional distinctions between media? Case studies shed light on the history printing, the graphic arts, and the multifaceted legacy of historical news images today. The Beauty of Beasts in the Ancient Roman World From animal fables, to pets, to heroic named beasts who died in the amphitheater, the visual culture of the ancient Roman world was filled with images of animals. Dogs, cats, birds, asses, elephants, lions, tigers, leopards and myriad others appear in contexts from luxury villas to funerary monuments. Utilizing the lens of interdisciplinary animals studies we explore how the Romans thought with animals representationally in ways which may initially seem familiar but prove to be distinctively different in culturally specific ways. Considering how the human/animal binary works in a past culture has the potential to reveal something about how systems of knowledge and power are structured and maintained.

Dealing with a range of genres of manga and manga-related media-illustrated narrative scrolls, woodblock prints, popular picture books, strip comics, and animated cartoons-we revisit traditional notions of what the popular visual form has been and can be. Some of the themes we address include narrativity and visuality, production of satirical imagery and visual modernity, and censorship.  <ref type="bibr">Europe and</ref><ref type="bibr">North America, 1400-1900</ref> What motivated individuals and corporate bodies to collect and display varieties of objects, works of art among them, and how did those paired activities forge social identities, generate fascination, and productively frame knowledge of the world? Among the topics considered are the indissoluble Plinian link between art and nature on the one hand, and cabinets of curiosities (Kunst-und Wunderkammern) on the other; the art market; the design of purpose-built galleries, museums, and libraries; the illustrated recording or publication of renowned collections ("paper museums"); the nineteenth-century foundation (or reconstitution) of national and municipal art collections.

These powerful visualization tools produce compelling seamless worlds, but ones which raise challenging questions of interpretation. By seeking to understand the models and assumptions on which these visual worlds are based, we delve into contemporary and ancient modes of viewership, identity and spatial experience.

By lack, excess, or hybrid permutations, they unsettled the boundaries between the human, the animal, and the monstrous, opening up a creative space for the deployment of the marvelous, written as well as visual. Broad questions about cultural identity and alterity are examined through the prism of case studies that draw on a broad range of sources, from illuminated manuscripts, sculpted works, world maps to encyclopedias and travel accounts.

Enrollment limited to Smith College Senior ARS majors. The arts and technology minor engages students and faculty from across the campus and from all three academic divisions. The emphasis is on arts plural, including art, music, dance, theater and film, and on technology broadly conceived, including computer science, engineering, mathematics and statistics, physics, and other interested departments. This interdisciplinary minor provides students with a strong foundation in media arts and technology studies, while laying the groundwork for more advanced work in this area. Two primary strengths of the minor are the broad range of topics and approaches to which students are exposed, and the individualized nature of each student's trajectory through the minor. The field of arts and technology is by nature diverse and rapidly changing, and therefore requires broad exposure, as well as self-direction and high motivation from the student. With careful and attentive advising, our students are able to navigate this complex field successfully, while developing the background and experience necessary for more advanced work.</p><p>Although each student's path through the minor is unique, all students must meet certain core requirements. The requirements entail six courses structured into three layers: a specific foundational level, a flexible intermediate level and a culminating Special Studies. Students take one or more of the foundation-level courses to discover how technology is employed in various fields of art, to experience the process of art critique and to identify the areas of creativity in which they are interested. The intermediate-level courses provide a progressive interdisciplinary structure that guides students to embrace at least two disciplines, at increasingly advanced levels of artistic and technological stages. The sixth course is a Special Studies the student designs with her advisers. There are many exciting possibilities, including collaborations with other students, and venues for performance, exhibitions, demonstrations and publications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Minor</head><p>Requirements Six semester courses: at least one foundational course, at least three intermediate courses, and a culminating Special Studies. Students are encouraged to incorporate appropriate Five College courses and to design their intermediate course plan in consultation with an arts and technology minor adviser. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemistry of Art Objects</head><p>In this museum-based course, chemistry is discussed in the context of art. We focus on materials used by artists and how the chemistry of these materials influences their longevity. Current analytical methods as well as preservation and conservation practices are discussed along with examples from the Smith College Museum of Art. Course meetings take place in the museum and consist of three hours of lecture, discussion and demonstration. Polymeric materials are ubiquitous in our society and play a vital role in many of the technologies that we use on a daily basis (e.g., clothing, electronic devices, drug formulations, medical implants). Chemistry is central to development of new materials for advanced technologies and this course will provide an introduction to the fields of polymer chemistry and macromolecular assembly. Topics include methods and mechanisms in polymer synthesis and assembly, characterization of polymer structure and properties, and applications of polymers. Special focus will be given to polymers used in biomedical applications. Prerequisite: CHM 111 or 118 and CHM 222. An understanding of basic chemical principles and an introduction to organic chemistry will be necessary for students to understand topics in polymer chemistry. The interaction of light with molecules is central to studies of molecular structure and reactivity. This course builds on students' understanding of molecular structure from the core sequence (CHM 111-224) to show how many types of light can be used to interrogate molecules and to shed some light on their behavior. The combined classroom/laboratory format allows students to explore light-based instruments in short, in-class exercises as well as in longer, more traditional labs. The course culminates with an independent project that allows students to explore some of the ways light is used in cutting-edge chemical research. Prerequisites: 222 or permission of the instructor.

Greek GRK 100Y Elementary Greek A yearlong introduction to ancient Greek through the language of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the two 8th-century epics that represent the culmination of a long and rich tradition of oral poetry. The ancients regarded these poems as unparalleled masterpieces; the great tragedian Aeschylus called his own plays "crumbs from Homer's table," and both epics have endured over the millennia and are still alive and relevant. Identity, love, seduction, loyalty, the tension between individualism and community, between home and adventure-these are some of the very human issues the Odyssey explores. Students will learn all the fundamentals of Greek vocabulary and grammar, and experience the joy of reading Homer's Odyssey in the original. Credits: 5 Rebecca Worsham Normally offered each academic year GRK 214 Greek Poetry of the Archaic Age An exploration of the poetic masterpieces of the Archaic period.

Theorists and practitioners continue to debate how to bring community issues into the classroom and how best to bring students into the neighborhoods surrounding their colleges and universities. This course considers these issues through exposure to both the literature of community engagement and the experiences of those who practice its different forms. CCX 120 serves as a gateway course for the Community Engagement and Social Change concentration. As such, one of the primary purposes of the course is to give students exposure to the varied opportunities available at the college for engaging with communities. Specifically, the course focuses on volunteer opportunities, course-based engagement and examples of community-based research. Within and across these different approaches, we identify and explore the ethical issues that characterize community partnerships and the best practices that attempt to address these issues. Students also interact with peers, faculty, guest speakers, and community members who provide firsthand perspectives on the local practice of CBL and the critical needs in surrounding communities.

This course is an introduction to the GYROTONIC method (meaning circular toning). It is designed for dancers of all levels and will focus specifically on applying this movement system to dance technique. Students will learn exercises designed to simultaneously lengthen and strengthen muscles, support joint stability and mobility, stimulate circulation, build core strength through breath support, enhance coordination, and promote a practice of mindful movement. The course will meet in group sessions as well as private sessions to address the specific concerns of each student. Credits: 1 Members of the department Normally offered each academic year DAN 291 Yoga for Dancers Rather than working from a singular movement approach, emphasis in this course is placed on understanding the dynamic relationship of both dance and yoga from multiple perspectives. We explore how these two practices reflect, inform and enhance each other through their anatomical/energetic organization and alignment strategies, movement logic and sequencing, and embodied awareness in motion and stillness. Investigating a variety of yogic structuring principles that address the technical, restorative and performancerelated issues of the dancer, we work to refine standing, sitting, reclining and arm-supported postures, and then incorporate this information into the creation and performance of dancing phrases. First-year MFA students enroll in this course to fulfill the graduate dance production requirement (usually stage managing a dance concert). Enrollment in DAN 507 takes place in the semester when the student completes the dance production assignment, as scheduled by the faculty. Credits: 2 Chris Aiken Normally offered both fall and spring semesters DAN 515 Creative Process and Choreography I First-year MFA students enroll in this course to accrue independent study credit for their grad event choreography, but only in the semester when their grad event piece is not created within a choreography course <ref type="bibr">(DAN 521 or DAN 553</ref> </p></div>

Choreographic ideas developed in this class are based on the premise that design elements can be used as source materials for choreographic intent. In addition to studies and projects, weekly writings are assigned. Credits: 5 Chris Aiken Normally offered in alternate years DAN 560 Scientific Principles in the Teaching of Dance This course is designed to assist graduate students as they teach dance technique. The principles of anatomy, injury prevention and rehabilitation, and nutrition are examined in relation to fundamentals of dance pedagogy; expressive dance aesthetics are examined formally within a context of current body science. Through analysis of body alignment, safe and efficient movement patterns, and proper nutritional needs, students learn methods that increase efficiency, clarity, strength and coordination and that ultimately achieve desired aesthetic goals. Class work includes lectures, experiential application, and computer analyses to reinforce a rigorous understanding of the scientific </p></div>

Topics may include writing and cultural identity; language, technology and popular culture; gender, language and the literary arts. The topic of this semester is the written script of these languages, including the aesthetics of writing (e.g., calligraphy), technology and communication, and the politics of written language forms. The course introduces the distinct characteristics of each of these languages, and traces interactions among their writing systems in history and today's world. We also discuss how the written language influences cultural and national identity This course introduces the historical, social and ideological background of "standard Japanese" and the Japanese writing system. We look at basic structural characteristics of the language and interpersonal relations reflected in the language, such as politeness and gender. We also address fluidity and diversity of linguistic and cultural practices in contemporary Japan. This course is suitable for students with little knowledge about the language as well as those in Japanese language courses. All readings are in English translation. Through readings, viewings, critical analysis and discussion, students analyze the texts within their specific cultural and historical contexts and gain a deeper understanding of Japanese society and culture.

In modern times, the novel has also been frequently transformed into TV drama series, movies, plays, operas, and dance performances. In this seminar, we will study in depth the novel's representations of both popular and high culture, from traditional society, arts, and poetry to garden, clothing, food, and other everyday customs. We will examine the diverse themes and issues displayed in the novel, such as fate and human will, the interplay of illusion (dream) and reality, love and enlightenment. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. The major in East Asian studies reflects the emergence of East Asia politically, economically, and culturally onto the world scene, especially during the last century, and anticipates the continued importance of the region in the future. It also offers students an opportunity to develop a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the great civilizations of the Asia Pacific region. The program in East Asian studies is an interdisciplinary major that combines language study with courses in anthropology, art, economics, government, history, and religion. Majors graduate from the program with a firm grasp on the culture and history of the region, as well as a command of at least one language. Thus, the program prepares students for post-graduate endeavors ranging from graduate school to careers in the public and private sectors dealing with East Asia.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineering</head><p>To adequately address the challenges facing society in the 21st century, there is a critical need for broadly educated engineers who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets. Engineers must have the understanding needed to address the cultural, political, and economic realities of our times, along with the technical depth to appropriately frame complex problems using ethical reasoning. The preparation for such a path is argued to be effectively achieved in a liberal arts setting.</p><p>At Smith, the engineering degrees offered are based on rigorous plans of study integrated with the liberal arts and sciences. There are two possible paths for the study of engineering at Smith College. The first is the ABET-accredited bachelor of science (S.B.) in engineering science, and the second is the bachelor of arts (A.B.) in engineering arts. More detailed information about both degree options can be found below.</p><p>The Picker Engineering Program's educational objectives are to produce graduates who, within a few years of graduation, will:</p><p>1. incorporate their knowledge and understanding of the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences in the application of their engineering education; 2. apply their engineering education in service to humanity; 3. enter the engineering profession or graduate school if they choose one of those pathways; 4. consider the impact of their professional actions on society; 5. demonstrate leadership in their personal and professional endeavors; and 6. have advanced their professional development by acquiring new skills and knowledge.</p><p>Prior to graduation, all students majoring in engineering science are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (the FE), administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying.</p></div>

The bachelor of science degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The American Society for Engineering Education, identifying the critical need for broadly educated engineers, points out that the design of an engineering curriculum should "recognize the pitfalls of overspecialization in the face of an increasing demand for graduates who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets." An integral component of the program is the continuous emphasis on the use of engineering science principles in design. This culminates in a final capstone design project that incorporates broad-based societal aspects. Students are encouraged to pursue a corporate and/or research internship to complement their classroom instruction. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively and work in team settings. Smith's highly-regarded writing intensive first-year curriculum ensures that engineering students begin their engineering curriculum with appropriate communication skills that will be refined during the remainder of their studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EGR 350 Seminar: Engineering and Cancer</head><p>The understanding, diagnosis and treatment of human disease all increasingly rely on contributions from engineering. In this course, we study some of the ways in which engineering is contributing to the study and clinical management of cancer. Students gain an understanding of the molecular, cellular and genetic basis of cancer, and use that perspective to consider ways that engineering approaches have been and can be used to study and treat cancer. Prerequisites: EGR 220 or 270 or 290, BIO 132 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit of 12. {N} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years EGR 351 Seminar: Introduction to Biomedical Engineering There are countless challenges in medicine that engineering can help to address, from the molecular scale to the level of the entire human body. This course introduces students to engineering problem solving approaches to explore important biomedical questions. We integrate our learning of underlying biological systems with developing engineering thinking to examine those systems. We use mathematical tools to interpret and model the behavior of various biological phenomena. Upon completion of this course, students are able to identify open medical needs and propose ways in which engineering can contribute to understanding and meeting those needs. Prerequisites: PHY 210 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit of 12. Credits: 4 Sarah Jean Moore Normally offered in alternate years EGR 360 Seminar: Advanced Thermodynamics Significant challenges underlie our ability to effectively harness, convert and distribute energy. This course builds on a fundamental knowledge of thermodynamics to understand the operating principles behind, and characterize the limits of, energy generation and conversion technologies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EGR 375 Strength of Materials</head><p>This course introduces students to the fundamentals of mechanics of materials from a static failure analysis framework. Structural behavior is analyzed, along with the material and geometric contributions to this behavior. Lecture topics are complemented with hands-on project work designed to help students make connections between the theoretical and experimental behavior of materials The goal of this seminar is to introduce students to several approaches used to model, understand, simulate and forecast engineering processes. One approach covered is the use of artificial neural networks-a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) with connections to the brain. Other approaches covered are based upon probability and statistics and include auto-regressive moving average (ARIMA) processes. Although students learn about the theory behind these approaches, the emphasis of the course is on their application to model processes throughout the field of engineering. Some examples include earthquake ground motion, financial markets, water treatment and electrical systems. Acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of AI, students also investigate the possibilities of machine consciousness. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EGR 410D Engineering Design and Professional Practice</head><p>This two-semester course focuses on the engineering design process and associated professional skills required for careers in engineering. Topics include a subset of the following: the engineering design process, project definition, design requirements, project management, concept generation, concept selection, engineering economics, design for sustainability, design for safety and risk reduction, design case studies, teamwork, effective presentations, professional ethics, networking, negotiation and intellectual property. This course is required of all senior engineering students pursuing the B.S. in engineering science and must be taken in conjunction with EGR 421D, EGR 422D, or EGR 431D The purpose of the English major is to develop a critical and historical understanding of the English language and of the literary traditions it has shaped in Britain, in the Americas and throughout the world. During their study of literature at Smith, English majors are also encouraged to take allied courses in classics, other literatures, history, philosophy, religion, art, film and theatre. Fuller descriptions of each term's courses, faculty profiles, and other important information for majors and those interested in literary study can be found on the department's Web page, accessible via the Smith College home page.</p><p>Most students begin their study of literature at Smith with English 120 or a first-year seminar before proceeding to one of the courses-199 or 200-that serves as a gateway for the major. First-year students who have an English Literature and Composition AP score of 4 or 5, or a score of 710 on the Critical Reading portion of the SAT, may enter one of the gateway courses in the fall semester. Those first-year students who have taken a gateway course in the fall may, after consultation with the instructor, elect a 200-level class beyond the gateway in the spring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Minor</head><p>The minor in English consists of six courses to be distributed as follows: two gateway courses <ref type="bibr">(ENG 199,</ref><ref type="bibr">200)</ref>; three additional English courses (no more than two of which can be writing workshops) chosen in consultation with the minor adviser; one seminar. Only one elective course may be at the 100 level (ENG 120 or a FYS in literature). No course counting toward the minor may be taken for an S/U grade.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Requirements</head><p>The English major requires at least ten semester courses. The following requirements aim to provide majors with a broad understanding of literatures in English, acquaint them with the key questions and intellectual strategies that shape the discipline of literary study, and offer them the opportunity to work independently at an advanced level. Students in the classes of 2019 and 2020 may complete the creative writing emphasis by taking three writing workshops, at least two at the advanced level, and by fulfilling the capstone requirement with a literature seminar plus a third advanced workshop (or any of the alternatives listed in the major requirements) and may choose not to take ENG 395. Beginning with the class of 2021, only the requirements above will be in effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Major in English with a Literary Emphasis</head><p>We also ask students to develop a deliberative plan for their major in consultation with their advisers, to be revised and updated every semester. Students may if they wish design a special focus within the major by choosing three courses related by genre (such as poetry, fiction, drama), historical period, methodological approach or any other category of interest.</p><p>Courses that fulfill requirement number 2 above include but are not limited to <ref type="bibr">ENG 250,</ref><ref type="bibr">256,</ref><ref type="bibr">257,</ref><ref type="bibr">260</ref>; courses that fulfill requirement number 3 include but are not limited to <ref type="bibr">ENG 222,</ref><ref type="bibr">229,</ref><ref type="bibr">230,</ref><ref type="bibr">236,</ref><ref type="bibr">239,</ref><ref type="bibr">241,</ref><ref type="bibr">246,</ref><ref type="bibr">248,</ref><ref type="bibr">249,</ref><ref type="bibr">267,</ref><ref type="bibr">277,</ref><ref type="bibr">278,</ref><ref type="bibr">282,</ref><ref type="bibr">309,</ref><ref type="bibr">312,</ref><ref type="bibr">319,</ref><ref type="bibr">334,</ref><ref type="bibr">387,</ref><ref type="bibr">391,</ref><ref type="bibr">AFR 209,</ref><ref type="bibr">360,</ref><ref type="bibr">AMS 230,</ref><ref type="bibr">CLT 205,</ref><ref type="bibr">266.</ref> One course in film, a foreign or comparative literature, or dramatic literature offered through the theatre department may count toward the major; courses in any of these categories that are cross-listed in English do not count against this limit. While only one course in creative writing may count toward the ten required courses for the literature emphasis, we encourage majors with interests in creative writing to choose additional courses in this area. Only one elective first-level course (e.g., ENG 120, ENG 135) or one FYS taught by a member of the English Department may count toward the major. ENG 118 does not count. No course counting toward the major may be taken for an S/U grade. We strongly recommend that all students take at least one historical sequence: <ref type="bibr">ENG 200,</ref><ref type="bibr">201;</ref><ref type="bibr">ENG 202,</ref><ref type="bibr">203;</ref><ref type="bibr">or ENG 231,</ref><ref type="bibr">233,</ref><ref type="bibr">235.</ref> Students interested in graduate school in English literature would be well advised to take a course in literary theory and should be aware that most doctoral programs in English require a reading knowledge of two foreign languages. Students interested in high school teaching would be well advised to take both the English <ref type="bibr">(200,</ref><ref type="bibr">201)</ref>  Applicants to honors must have an average of B+ or above in the courses they count toward the major, and an average of B or above in all other courses. During the senior year they will present a thesis, of which the first complete formal draft will be due on the first day of the second semester. After the readers of the thesis have provided students with their evaluations of this draft, the student will have time to revise her work in response to their suggestions. The final completed version of the thesis will be due after spring vacation, to be followed during April by the student's oral presentation and discussion of her work. Students in honors will normally be given priority in seminars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Map My Words: Writing About Borders and Belonging</head><p>This course is designed to get you thinking about maps to generate ideas for your writing. Our main focus will be learning to write logical, complex academic essays, and assignments will include four essays, blog posts, and a presentation, accompanied by lessons on rhetoric, revision, structure, grammar, and research basics. Questions addressed in discussions, readings, and essays will include: Is a map a rhetorical document? Is there bias in the language of maps? How do maps and essays hide the process of creation? What histories of exploration and exploitation are communicated (or silenced) by the act of mapping? (E) WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hope and Fear: The Power of Persuasion</head><p>We are immersed in a culture of persuasion: advertisers make claims, politicians' promises. Yet, despite what we believe about how we make decisions, successful persuasion is often based more on emotion than logical evidence. We examine the rhetoric of persuasion from the ancient Romans to the intentionally addictive nature of social media in order to separate the hype from the content and to develop our own, authentic persuasive styles. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p><p>The Space in Our Identity: Writing About Home Home is more than the physical structure where we reside. Home is where we live in every sense: the physical sense, yes, but also the spiritual, romantic, ideal and maybe even mythical. All of these aspects of home, hometown, home country, or adopted home serve to shape our identities. In this course, we explore the importance of these spaces, be they physical or metaphysical, to the construction of "home" and how these terms, whether we accept them wholly, shun them entirely or experience them via travel, dictate to us and others a sense of self and identity. Can be repeated for credit with a different topic. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Youth Activism, New Media and Social Change</head><p>Reading and writing analytical essays about the topic of global youth activism, new media technologies and social change. Topics include analysis of international youth activist movements in diverse social and political contexts and the ways in which the use of new media technologies has impacted a multitude of social change efforts. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p><p>On the Road When we leave the places we call home, we become travelers. How much of ourselves do we take with us? How much do we leave behind? These questions confront the adventurer and the immigrant, the philosopher and the rogue.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>All the World's a Stage</head><p>We live in a world where everybody seems to be performing. We see this in the political arena and on reality TV shows. We see it on websites like YouTube and on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. In this class, we look at how our lives have grown more performative in the advent of new concepts like "reality," "sincerity," "self" and "friend," and what that means for us as individuals and as a society.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Water: Science and Politics</head><p>The management of global water resources presents a major challenge for the 21st century. Water defines the boundaries of the livable world. It's crucial for drinking, energy, travel, irrigation and food. But water can also transmit disease, flood homes and spread contamination. Students in this course hone their science-writing skills while exploring contemporary problems related to water. They focus on presenting scientific data, reasoning and controversies in accurate but lively language, while learning and writing about the politics surrounding water use. Sources include scientific research papers, government reports, newspaper articles, and op-ed pieces. May be repeated once for credit with a different instructor. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p><p>No, Seriously... What's so Funny? Writing About Humor Nietzsche called maturity the rediscovered seriousness of a child at play. What is the meaning of comedy, in light of this "seriousness of the child at play?" Why do we laugh, at what and in what way? How do we distinguish silly comedy from serious comedy? This course examines such questions on comic platforms including film, music, videos, short stories and cartoons. We explore the "structure" of the comic moment as viewer or listener encounters surprise, transgression or enchantment, especially in 20th-century comedy, and the affectivity of the comic encounter from pure "clowning" to savage social commentary. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered both fall and spring semesters</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consumer Culture</head><p>Reading and writing analytical essays about the pervasive effects of consumerism in American culture. Topics include analysis of advertisements, consideration of the impoverished in a consumer society, the use of advertising in schools, the marketing of fast food in American culture and the meaning of consumer goods in our daily lives. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered both fall and spring semesters</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Worth a Thousand Words</head><p>This course explores and analyzes the popular saying, "a picture is worth a thousand words." The saying is generally interpreted to suggest that a complex idea can be expressed in just one picture. But it also raises questions about the complex meanings of pictures and the complex process of interpreting them. We analyze images and discuss essays about the politics of interpretation. There may be opportunities to bring some of your own pictures into the course. Bilingual students and nonnative English speakers are especially invited to register for this section.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bad History</head><p>George Santayana famously wrote, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it," but can anyone remember all the past? Which past should I remember? Whose past? Maybe history isn't one memorizable narrative, but billions of individual stories and perspectives. Even if you told your own life story, which events would you include or leave out? Would you tell it as a tragedy? Comedy? Coming-of-age story? In this class, we consider the distance between history and myth, story and storyteller, the event and how it's remembered. We uncover histories, doubt histories, and write our own.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is Happiness?</head><p>This course explores the scientific and philosophical expressions of our deepest emotions. Our discussion will center on Daniel Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness, and will include essays by scientists, neurologists, philosophers and psychologists-all of whom engage meaningfully and surprisingly with the interplay of our senses, emotions and acculturation. By the end of the course, students will have a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the ways emotionality affects our lives and decisions. (E) WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How to Live</head><p>Through wide-ranging readings from ancient philosophy to contemporary memoirs, we engage this most essential question: How are we to live our lives? Philosophers and artists, farmers and writers, religious leaders and political activists have given us a rich variety of approaches to this question, envisioning utopias both large and farm-small, proposing maxims to live by, conducting private and public experiments, condensing hard-won knowledge into prose. The range of forms of these provocative writings leads to this class's second question: How are we to write about matters? Can be repeated for credit with a different topic. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing About Science</head><p>Reading and writing about current scientific topics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What's for Dinner? Writing About Food</head><p>Michael Pollan writes in Omnivore's Dilemma that the U.S. suffers from a "national eating disorder"-that essentially, we don't know what to eat. This course examines that confusion, considering which of the many diets available to us-vegan, slow food, locavore-is truly healthy; what roles ethnicity, gender and class play in our choices; and how pervasive hunger is in the United States. Students read from the spectrum of food writing and hone their own writing in a variety of genres ranging from academic essays to restaurant reviews. Prerequisite: One WI course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limited to 15. WI Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 135 Introduction to Writing Creative Nonfiction Students learn to use literary techniques to write factual, engaging narratives that read like fiction. Based on research, interviews and personal experience, creative nonfiction encompasses a wide range of genres, including memoir, travel writing, nature writing, science writing, food writing and biography. Prerequisites: one WI course. Enrollment in each section limited to 16. Course may be repeated once on a different topic. (E)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creative Nonfiction About Place and Travel</head><p>In creative nonfiction writing, authors of fact-based essays and memoirs use the same craft tools as novelists-from description and dialogue to reflection, scene, structure and exposition-to tell a story. We sharpen these tools with writing and reading assignments that draw from the linked themes of place and travel, and how the passage of time changes perspectives on both. You don't have to be a seasoned traveler to join the course: you can write about any place at all, including home. We also use the Smith College Archives to write about the place we all know and share at different times in its history. Students may respond to assignments and prompts in traditional written essays; graphic essays (comics); or digital essays. Either way, be prepared to write frequently in class and out, read well, participate in class discussion, and be ready to explore your world with new eyes. Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing About the Arts</head><p>Students write true stories about art, music, theater, film and dance that read like a novel. Writing assignments include a profile of an artist or performer, a review of a performance or an exhibit, and a personal essay exploring how a work of art, theater or music influenced the author. The essays read like fiction, relying on character, pacing, scenes, structure and sensory details. Unlike fiction, these stories are based on facts gathered through research, observation and interviews. The course offers tools and an approach to writing to help students develop a writing process that works for them. Enrollment limited to 16. (E) Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p><p>Writing About Health and Healthcare in the U.S. This course teaches students how to use the tools of narrative nonfiction to write compelling, engaging, informative pieces about issues and ideas surrounding health and healthcare. We read and discuss works that illuminate the experiences of health and illness, and that examine how American society and the medical establishment respond to these. Each student develops her voice, her sense of purpose and her authority as a writer, while strengthening her relationship with her reader. Students practice revising for style, structure and accuracy. Enrollment limited to 16. Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing About Sports</head><p>Through reading, in-and-out-of-class writing, and editing one another's work, students learn different forms of creative non-fiction essays through a focus on the topic of sports. Among other subjects, students may explore their own sports backgrounds, the dynamics of individual sports, sports ethics, the lives and careers of sports figures, and subjects like momentum: where does it come from and where does it go? Students are encouraged to use sports-related material in the Smith Archives and explore our sports rich environment, including Smith athletics and local landmarks such as the Basketball Hall of Fame. Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years Writing About the Senses Sight, sound, touch, smell, taste: Everything we know reaches us through our senses. We share a world filtered through a million sensibilities-finding the words to convey what we hear, see, smell, taste, and feel is one of the most fundamental skills a writer can develop. In this class, we will hone our descriptive powers to go beyond the obvious and uncover language that delights and surprises us even as we write. We will learn to use one sense to write about another, combine them in powerful metaphors, and explore how our senses shape the narratives that drive us. Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 136 Journalism: Principles and Practice</head><p>In this intellectually rigorous writing class, students will learn how to craft compelling "true stories," using the journalist's tools. They will research, report, write, revise, source, and share their work-and, through interviewing subjects firsthand, understand how other people see the world. We will consider multiple styles and mediums of journalism, including digital storytelling. Prerequisite: One WI course. Students should focus their attention and effort on academic exposition and argumentation before learning other forms of writing. Enrollment limit of 16. (E) Credits: 4 Nancy E.

In this class students are encouraged to riot (on the page) while reading widely, from Basho to Bishop, in order to understand the ways in which poetry gives voice to the ordinary and the ineffable. Students study a variety of poetic forms and styles as well as the essential elements of craft. In addition to writing short analytical essays, students write and revise their own original poetry. Enrollment is limited to 20. WI {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered both fall and spring semesters</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reading and Writing Short Stories</head><p>Writing comes from reading. In this course, we explore how other writers have used the short story form and, in so doing, have become part of a tradition-a tradition that students in the class, as writers themselves, will join. While we work on at least one analytical paper, much of the work in this class involves the creation of short stories. We work on such elements as plot, theme, characterization, description and dialogue. Students are welcome to explore any genre they wish in their own writing. WI {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered both fall and spring semesters ENG 125 Introduction to Creative Writing This course familiarizes students with key aspects of structure and form in poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. We focus in turn on such elements of creative writing as imagery, diction, figurative language, character, setting, and plot. Students draft, workshop, and revise three pieces of writing over the course of the semester, one each in the genres of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. </p></div>

Fall gateway courses are open to first-year students with the English Literature and Composition AP score of 4 or 5, or a score of 710 on the Critical Reading portion of the SAT, or by permission of the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 199 Methods of Literary Study</head><p>This course teaches the skills that enable us to read literature with understanding and pleasure. By studying examples from a variety of periods and places, students learn how poetry, prose fiction and drama work, how to interpret them and how to make use of interpretations by others. English 199 seeks to produce perceptive readers well equipped to take on complex texts. This gateway course for prospective English majors is not recommended for students simply seeking a writing intensive course. Readings in different sections vary, but all involve active discussion and frequent writing. What it would be like to hear the squirrel's heartbeat, to open one's mind fully to the sensations and impressions of the world around us? The image belongs to George Eliot, who in Middlemarch suggested we couldn't bear it; we would die of a sensory overload, the "roar on the other side of silence." The novelists of the generations that followed tried to live in that roar: to explore the stream of consciousness, to capture the way we make sense of experience and order out of our memory's chaos. Readings in George Eliot, Henry James, Virginia Woolf and others. {L} Credits: 4 Michael E. Gorra Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 223 Contemporary American Gothic Literature</head><p>This course traces the emergence of a 21st-century gothic tradition in American writing through texts including novels, films and television shows. We analyze the shifting definitions and cultural work of the Gothic in contemporary American literature in the context of political and cultural events and movements and their relation to such concerns as race, gender, class, sexuality and disability. From the New Mexican desert to the rural south, from New York City, San Francisco and the suburbs of Atlanta to cyberspace, these literary encounters explore an expanse of physical, psychological, intellectual and imagined territory. {A} {L} Credits: 4 Andrea Stephanie Stone Expected to be offered in the next 3 years Frankenstein not only describes fears about monstrosity and accelerating technology; it also sets the stage for continuing discussions about gender, reproduction, race, ethics, and disability. To celebrate this groundbreaking novel's 200th anniversary, this co-taught class will explore the making of the text, alongside its monstrous legacy in contemporary culture. We will look at the novel's influences and afterlives -from the Frankenstein collection in Smith's rare book room to a range of films, electronic novels, and comics that reveal the enduring role of gothic monstrosity today. Meets on alternating days at Smith and Amherst College. Enrollment limit of 36. (E) {L} Credits: 4 Lily Gurton-Wachter Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 228 Children's Literature Shapes speak to us. Prose shapes us. From the picture book to the chapter book, we will explore the ways in which literature for children invents the child reading that literature. And we will attempt to break through our natural nostalgia for works we know to rediscover their innovative and experimental nature. In so doing, we will see these works work their magic on themes that will become familiar throughout the semester: identity, nostalgia, interiors and exteriors, authority, independence and dependence and, of course, the nature of wild things. Works may include Peter Rabbit; Where the Wild Things Are; Winnie-the-Pooh; Alice in Wonderland; Peter Pan; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Secret Garden; The Giver. {L} Credits: 4 Gillian Murray Kendall Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 229 Turning Novels Into Films: Imperialism, Race, Gender and Cinematic Adaptation "Not as good as the book," is a frequent response to film adaptations of novels. Adaptation studies, an interdisciplinary field that combines literary and film studies, rejects this notion of "fidelity" (how faithful a film is to its source) and instead reads literature and film as equal but different artistic and cultural forms, where the film may translate, transmute, critique, or re-interpret the novel. This course will look closely and analytically at some paired fiction and film adaptations that focus on issues of imperialism, race, class, and gender. We'll begin with some classics (Austen's Mansfield Park, Forster's Passage to India), move to international postcolonial fiction and film (Tagore's Home and the World, Ondaatje's The English Patient), and end with U.S. texts about non-white, hyphenated citizens (Lahiri's Namesake, Stockett's The Help). We will also read some critical and theoretical essays to frame our key concepts and conversations. Prerequisites: At least one college level course in literature or film. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 230 American Jewish Literature Explores the significant contributions and challenges of Jewish writers and critics to American literature, broadly defined. Topics include the American dream and its discontents; immigrant fiction; literary multilingualism; ethnic satire and humor; crises of the left involving 60s radicalism and Black-Jewish relations; after-effects of the Holocaust. Must Jewish writing remain on the margins, too ethnic for the mainstream yet insufficiently multicultural for contemporary gatekeepers of diversity? No prerequisites. {H} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 231 Inventing America: Nation, Race, Freedom This course will focus on the extraordinary burst of literary creativity that coincided with the emergence of a new American nation. From its conflicted founding episodes to the crisis of the Civil War, American writers interpreted and criticized American life with unmatched imaginative intensity and formal boldness, taking as their particular subject both the promise of freedom implicit in the nation's invention-and the betrayals of that promise: in the horrors of slavery, and in the subtler entrapments of orthodox thinking, constricted vision, a self-poisoning psyche, and a repressive or unjust social life. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 232 London Fog: Victorian Secrets, Sensations and Subversions</head><p>The deadly fog that hung over London throughout the 19th century was both a social reality and a pungent metaphor for a metropolis in which it seemed that almost anything could be hidden: secrets, crimes, identities. But sometimes the fog parts-and then comes scandal. We'll begin with Dickens' anatomy of the city in Bleak House; move on to sensation novels by Wilkie Collins and Mary Elizabeth Braddon, which contest and subvert the period's gender roles; look at murder with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Jekyll; urban bombings with Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent; and end with a neo-Victorian novel by Sarah Waters. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years ENG 233 Re-forming America: Region, Race, and Empire Re-forming the nation after the Civil War was no easy feat. During the period between 1865 and 1914, how did regions recently at war with one another view America differently? How did people of different races, classes, genders, and other identities define their relationship to the nation? What role did empire-building, science, and industrialization play in the re-forming of America into the superpower that it would become in the twentieth century? This course engages American writers as they explore these and other questions of meaning, value, and power-with an emphasis on writers who shaped, critiqued, and stood apart from their rapidly changing society. We explore these issues by reading a selection of environmental poetry in conversation with key texts from the environmental humanities. Central to the discussions: the sublime and the aesthetics of landscape and wilderness; garbage and the poetics of waste; the ethics of representing animal and plant life; the relation between landscape, labor, and power; and how ecopoetry intervenes in debates about climate change. {L} Credits: 4 Lily Gurton-Wachter Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 238 What Jane Austen Read: The 18th-Century Novel A study of novels written in England from Aphra Behn to Jane Austen and Walter <ref type="bibr">Scott (1688</ref><ref type="bibr">Scott ( -1814</ref>. Emphasis on the novelists' narrative models and choices; we conclude by reading several novels by Austen-including one she wrote when 13 years old. This course aims to identify, analyze, and complicate the dominant narrative of U.S. suburbia vis-√†-vis the postwar American novel. While the suburb may evoke a shared sense of tedium, U.S. fiction positions suburbia as "contested terrain," a battleground staging many of the key social, cultural, and political shifts of our contemporary age. Reading novels and short stories by writers like Toni Morrison, Hisaye Yamamoto, John Updike, Chang-Rae Lee and Celeste Ng, we assess the narrative construction of the suburb as a bastion of white domesticity, as well as the disruption of this narrative through struggles for racial integration. Enrollment limit of 20. {L} Credits: 4 Jina Boyong Kim Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 249 Literatures of the Black Atlantic</head><p>Visiting the pulpits, meeting houses and gallows of British North America to the colonial West Indies and docks of Liverpool to the modern day Caribbean, U.S., Canada, U.K. and France, this course analyzes the literatures of the Black Atlantic and the development of black literary and intellectual history from the 18th to the 21st century. Some key theoretical frameworks, which help inform our study of literature emerging from the Black Atlantic, include diaspora, transnationalism, internationalism and cosmopolitanism. Readings range from early African diasporic sermons, dying words, poetry, captivity and slave narratives to newspapers, essays, novels, drama and film. {L} Credits: 4 Andrea Stephanie Stone Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level III</head><p>Courses numbered 250-299. Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors; first-year students admitted only with the permission of the instructor. Recommended background: at least one English course above the 100 level, or as specified in the course description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 250 Chaucer's Canterbury Tales</head><p>A contextualized close reading of Geoffrey Chaucer's ambitious and enduring literary project, The Canterbury Tales, with attention to language change, narrative technique, the representation of varied and distinctive medieval voices, and the poem as vivid introduction to life and thought in the later Middle Ages. Not open to first year-students. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each academic year ENG 255 What Makes a Tale Worth Telling: Reading the 19th Century Story Same as CLT 255. How did the modern short story emerge-why, where, when? What is its relation to other forms of short fiction-the Italian novella or the German novelle, or the fairy tale? Why are they often so elaborately framed, with their kernel presented as a kind of oral performance: a story told by one character to another? Why do they so often rely on the fantastic and the unlikely-and how, by the end of the century, did the story come to concentrate instead on the mundane and the ordinary? What, in short, makes a tale worth telling? Readings in Goethe, Hoffman, Hawthorne, Gogol, Turgenev, Maupassant, Verga, Kipling, Chekhov, Jewett, and others. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 264 Faulkner</head><p>The sustained explosion of Faulkner's work in the dozen-odd years between The Sound and the Fury and Go Down, Moses has no parallel in American literature. He explored the microtones of consciousness and conducted the most radical of experiments in narrative form. At the same time he relied more heavily on the spoken vernacular than anyone since Mark Twain, and he made his "little postage stamp of native soil" in northern Mississippi stand for the world itself. We read the great novels of his Yoknapatawpha cycle along with a selection of short stories, examining the linked and always problematic issues of race, region and remembrance in terms of the forms that he invented to deal with them. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 267 Asian American Literature Although we sometimes think only of modern-day authors like Amy Tan or Jhumpa Lahiri when we think of Asian American literature, in fact Asian Americans have been writing and publishing in English since at least 1887. In this course, we read selected Asian American poetry, novels, short stories, plays and films produced from the late 19th century until the present. We consider how works engage with issues that have always concerned Asian Americans, like identity development and racism. Also, we pay attention to how works speak to concerns specific to their period, such as the exclusion acts of the 1880s, the proletarian movement of the 1930s, the decolonization of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries since the 1940s, and the increasing size and diversity of the Asian American population in the late 20th century. At all times, we attend closely to matters of language and form. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 271 Imagining Evil Same as GER 271. This course explores how artists and thinkers over the centuries have grappled with the presence of evil -how to account for its perpetual recurrence, its ominous power, its mysterious allure. Standing at the junction of literature, philosopy, and religion, the notion of evil reveals much about the development of the autonomous individual, the intersection of morality, freedom and identity, and the confrontation of fantasy and history. Readings include literary works from Milton, Goethe, Blake, Kleist, E.T.A., Hoffmann, Tolkien, Le Guin; theoretical texts from Augustine, Luther, Nietzsche, Freud, Arendt. In English. {L} Credits: 4 Craig R. Davis, Joel P. Westerdale Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 273 Bloomsbury and Sexuality</head><p>Members of the Bloomsbury movement led non-normative (what many now call queer) lives. The complexity and openness of their relationships characterized not only the lives but also the major works of fiction, art, design, and critical writings its members produced. "Sex permeated our conversation," Woolf recalls, and in Bloomsbury and Sexuality we'll explore the far-reaching consequences of this ostensible removal of discursive, social, and sexual inhibition in the spheres of literature, art, and social sciences. The course will draw from the art of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, the writings of E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Radclyffe Hall, Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and others, along with contemporary queer theory. {L} Credits: 4 Cornelia D.J. Pearsall Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 274 The Pleasures of Not Thinking: Romanticism and the Irrational Romantic writers were obsessed with uncertainty, ignorance, and the irrational, unthinking mind. Concerned with the unusual ideas that surface when we are sleeping or spaced out, absorbed or intoxicated, Romanticism embraced reason's alternatives: forgetting, fragmentation, stupidity, and spontaneous, uncontrollable emotion. From Wordsworth's suggestion that children are wiser than adults to Keats's claim that great writers are capable of remaining uncertain without reaching for fact or reason, Romantic poets and novelists suggested that we have something to learn from not thinking. We will read texts by Austen, Blake, Burke, Coleridge, Cowper, De Quincey, Freud, Kant, Keats, Locke, and Rousseau. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 275 Witches, Witchcraft and Witch Hunts</head><p>This course has two central ambitions. First, it introduces themes of magic and witchcraft in (mostly) American literature and film. We work together to figure out how the figure of the witch functions in stories, novels and movies, what witches and witchcraft mean or how they participate in the texts' ways of making meaning. At the same time, we try to figure out how witches and witchcraft function as loci or displacements of social anxiety-about power, science, gender, class, race and politics. Since the identification of witches and the fear of witchcraft often lead to witch panics, we finally examine the historical and cultural phenomenon of the witch hunt, including both the persecution of persons literally marked as witches and the analogous persecution of persons (Communists, sexual outsiders, etc.) figuratively "hunted" as witches have been. Open to students at all levels, regardless of major. (E) {L} Credits: 4 Michael T. Thurston Normally offered in alternate years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 277 Postcolonial Women Writers</head><p>A comparative study of 20th-century women writers in English from Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia and Australia. We read novels, short stories, poetry, plays and autobiography in their historical, cultural and political contexts as well as theoretical essays to address questions such as: How have women writers addressed the dual challenge of contesting sexism and patriarchy from within their indigenous cultures as well as the legacies of western imperialism from without? How have they combined feminism with anti-colonialism? How have they deployed the act of writing as cultural work on multiple counts: addressing multiple audiences; challenging different stereotypes about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity? What new stories have they told to counter older stories, what silences have they broken? How have they renegotiated the public and the private, or called attention to areas often ignored by their male contemporaries, such as relations among women, familial dynamics, motherhood, bodily desire, or the gendered effects of migration and diaspora? Writers include Anita Desai, Kamala Das, Thrity Umrigar, Deepa Mehta, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Nawal el Saadawi, Jamaica Kincaid, Michelle Cliff, Zadie Smith, Sally Morgan. Prerequisite: a WI course. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 285 Introduction to Contemporary Literary Theory</head><p>What do we do when we read literature? Does the meaning of a text depend on the author's intention or on how readers read? What counts as a valid interpretation? Who decides? How do some texts get canonized and others forgotten? How does literature function in culture and society? How do changing understandings of language, the unconscious, class, gender, race, history, sexuality or disability affect how we read? "Theory" is "thinking about thinking," questioning common sense, critically examining the categories we use to approach literature or any discursive text. This course introduces some of the most influential questions that have shaped contemporary literary studies. We start with New Criticism but focus on interdisciplinary approaches such as structuralism, poststructuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, New Historicism, postcolonialism, feminism, queer, cultural, race and disability studies with some attention to film and film theory. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate work. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years ENG 293 The Art and History of the Book Same as ARH 247. Will books as material objects disappear in your lifetime? Or will the book, a remarkably long-lived piece of communication technology, continue to flourish and develop alongside its electronic counterparts? This course surveys the artistry and history of books from the ancient world through medieval manuscripts, hand press books, and machine press books to the digital media of today. We discover how books were made, read, circulated and used in different eras, and explore the role they have played over time in social, political, scientific and cultural change. The course involves extensive handson work with books and manuscripts from across the centuries and sustained engagement with current debates about book, print and media culture. Admission limited to 12 by permission of the instructor. <ref type="bibr">Group</ref>  </p></div>

Students will analyze and discuss each other's stories, and examine the work of established writers. Writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. A writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. Enrollment limited to 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fiction Through Photography</head><p>This course uses concepts and methods of photography to advance students' fiction-writing abilities and comprehension. Students take photographs as a way of grappling with issues of focus, framing, depth of field, point of view, "flatness," timing, and other precepts of photography that are transferable to writing, and include their photographs in their fictional pieces. The point of the course is not to improve students' photo abilities (and no pre-req skills or special equipment are required), but to use photography to enhance writing skills and understanding. Final product is a publishable short story. {A} {L} Credits: 4</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factual Fiction</head><p>Even the most imaginative fiction is grounded in a tangible world, and writing it well requires skilled observation as well as expression. ENG 206 is a creative-writing course that will advance students' fiction-writing abilities by refining techniques of observation. Students will report on such aspects as "process" and "place" and will employ that reporting in composing short stories, using gathered real-world facts to bring fictional pieces into focus and greater brilliance. Readings and assignments will explore the interplay of fact and imagination in fiction. Finished stories produced by students will be work-shopped in class. {A} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 216 Intermediate Poetry Writing</head><p>In this course we read as writers and write as readers, analyzing the poetic devices and strategies employed in a diverse range of contemporary poetry; gaining practical use of these elements to create a portfolio of original work; and developing the skills of critique and revision. In addition, students read and write on craft issues, and attend Poetry Center readings/Q&amp;A's. Writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. Enrollment limited to 12.</p></div>

Imaginary settings-whether they be Narnia or New York -involve the creation of spatially coherent locations, a backstory and a world that is peopled. In this course, students examine fictional worlds and learn to build those worlds themselves. This class is not limited to but is recommended for students interested in fantasy, science fiction or speculative fiction. Writing sample and permission of the instructor are required. Enrollment limited to 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Landscape and Cityscapes of Creative Fiction</head><p>In this course, we explore the constructed worlds made by some wonderful writers and build fictional worlds of our own.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing Women</head><p>Women have historically exerted their voice and power through writing, even as the professional trades of journalism and publishing have historically been unwelcoming of their presence. This class will examine reporting and writing by and about women, and engage students in the practice of writing about gender, feminism, and women's lives. Students will produce their own researched and reported magazine-style project, while inspecting how the media represents feminist issues and analyzing the works of other writers who have probed women's conditions and concerns. We will grapple with questions of reportage, structure, ethical obligations to one's subject, fair representation, and more. Credits </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comedy y Cultura: Your Humorous Life</head><p>The student learns how to mine a unique humorous life adventure from their cultural identity and turn this distinct experience into a funny short story. Weekly writing, storytelling, and performing exercises will allow the student to find their unique voice, acquire the skills to read their story out loud, emphasizing the comedy in their autobiographical work through their storytelling. Students examine storytellers who use humor as their vehicles: Michele Serros, Adelina Anthony, Monica Palacios, Marga Gomez and more. The class culminates in a public presentation of original short performances.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Members of the department Normally offered each academic year</head><p>Level IV 300-level courses, but not seminars. These courses are intended primarily for juniors and seniors who have taken at least two literature courses above the 100-level. Other interested students need the permission of the instructor. Seminars in the English department stand as the capstone experience in the major. They bring students into the public aspects of intellectual life, and the papers they require are not only longer but also different in kind from those in 200-level classes. These papers require a research component in which students engage the published arguments of others, or at least demonstrate an awareness of the ongoing critical conversation their work is entering. But such work proves most useful when most available, and so we also require that students present their thinking in some way to the semi-public sphere of the seminar itself.</p><p>All students who wish to take a seminar must contact the instructor by the last day of the preregistration period. The instructor selects the students admitted from these applicants. Enrollment limited to 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 308 Seminar: One Big Book</head><p>This capstone course offers an intensive research-based study of a single important work of literature in English, seen in its social, historical, and intellectual context on the one hand, and in terms of its reception history on the other. Course may be repeated once for credit with different topic and instructor. Permission of the instructor required. Enrollment limited to 12. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renaissance Color Across Media</head><p>Since Newton's experiment with prisms in 1666, color has been considered a matter of physics (light rays at frequencies between 700 and 420 nanometers) and physiology (stimulation of rods and cones in the retina). During the two centuries preceding Newton, however, such assumptions were challenged by chromaticism in musical lines, coloratura singing, and the deployment of rhetorical colors in verbal texts. This seminar will study cross-media examples of color in verbal fictions, paintings, dramatic performances, and music. Participants contribute one 1000-word response paper, accompanied by five questions for class discussion, and a final 3500-word paper pursuing one theme or concern across at least two media. Permission of the instructor is required. Enrollment limited to 12. {A} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 312 Seminar: Seminar: Converts, Criminals and Fugitives: Print Culture of the African Diaspora, 1760-1860 This seminar explores the varied publications produced by people of African descent, America, Canada and England, including early sermons and conversion narratives, criminal confessions, fugitive slave narratives and the black press. We consider these works in terms of publishing history, editorship (especially women editors), authorship, readership, circulation, advertising, influence, literacy, community building, politics and geography. We examine their engagements with such topics as religion, law economics, emigration, gender, race and temperance. Smith's manuscript and periodical holdings offer us a treasure trove of source materials. Permission of the instructor is required. Enrollment limited to 12. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 318 Blackness and the Long Poem Amid the political and cultural discourses of racial struggle, justice, and equality during the twentieth century, poets of the African diaspora turned frequently to the epic tradition and the genre of the long poem as a means of exploring and expressing complex Black histories and identities. This seminar surveys the emerging tradition of the long poem of Blackness from Aime Cesaire to Harryette Mullen, situating individual poetic projects in the specific cultural conjunctures that provoked them and theorizing the peculiar values of the long poem for these poets' moments and purposes.

Thurston Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 323 Seminar: Toni Morrison Same as AFR 360. This seminar focuses on Toni Morrison's literary production. In reading her novels, essays, lectures and interviews, we pay particular attention to three things: her interest in the epic anxieties of American identities; her interest in form, language and theory; and her study of love. {L} Credits: 4 Flavia Santos De Araujo Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 327 Robin Hood: Legendary Outlaw In this seminar, we trace the evolution of the legend of the greenwood outlaw with his merry men and (later) his intrepid ladylove, through medieval popular tale, ballad, drama, lyric, novel, and film-from first mention in the late Middle Ages to recent works and current events. Everyone knows the social bandit who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, hated by the authorities and loved by the people, but few have read the early formative texts that first inspired this unceasingly popular legend. We also explore and add to the rich legacy of Robin Hood criticism. Permission of the instructor required.

After reviewing some of the writings of Homer, Virgil and Shakespeare that were most influential for British poets of the 19th and 20th centuries, the course moves from Tennyson, Hardy and Kipling to the poets of the first and second world wars (Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and others). We situate the poetry with relevant historical and theoretical materials, as well as prose responses to war by authors such as Vera Brittain and Virginia Woolf. We end by reading poets who did not see combat (W.B. Yeats, W. H. Auden, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath) but whose work is nevertheless profoundly concerned with the complex relation of the martial to the lyrical, the destructive to the creative.

While some see it as an opportunity to express themselves, others feel constrained by mainstream expectations. Hence, a few Asian American writers have played with the genre, sometimes in radical ways, in order to do new kinds of aesthetic and cultural work. Memoirs and antimemoirs for consideration include those by Maxine Hong Kingston, Agha Shahid Ali, Paisley Rekdal, Amanda Ngoho Reavey, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Thi Bui, Bao Phi, and Lynda Barry.

The objectives of the major are to prepare students to transcend disciplinary boundaries, combine analytical and communication skills with a well-rounded understanding of the environment, and translate this knowledge into meaningful action and innovative solutions. Four integration courses form the intellectual and organizational core of the major. Each course brings together frameworks, proficiencies and knowledge from natural and social sciences in an explicitly integrative fashion to explore and analyze important environmental topics at local, regional, national and global levels. Additional introductory courses provide breadth in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and statistics, and introduce students to fundamental aspects of disciplines important to understanding human-environment interactions. Students gain depth of knowledge by choosing a coherent sequence of electives with a clear environmental focus. Students are strongly encouraged to engage in environmentally oriented internships, independent research or study-away opportunities. Prospective majors should consult with an ES&amp;P faculty adviser in choosing their courses. In their first semesters, students are encouraged to enroll in one of the introductory courses (see list) and an appropriate integration course (101), as well as statistics.</p><p>Requirements: The ES&amp;P major requires 14 courses.

In many science fiction narratives, the end of the world spells disaster. A future is imagined in which sinister forces threaten the continuation of life as we know it. In other narratives, leaving the world behind may represent a kind of liberation: from the tedium of everyday life, or from oppressive contemporary social and political systems. This course presents a series of investigations focused on compelling moments, themes and expressions within the wider universe of science fiction. Each case study enables us to imagine the world's end from a different perspective. Each also demands that we carry out our investigation across and between various forms of media. {A} Credits: 4</p><p>Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FMS 244 Global Media: The Musical! This course examines the film musical as a global genre traversing a range of media, not only including film but also theater, television, social media and recorded music. Since the advent of synchronous sound film, the musical has become one of the global film industry's most enduring and profitable genres. What has made the musical so successful the world over? Though much critical and scholarly attention has been paid to the Hollywood studio-era musicals of the 1930s-'50s, the scope of our investigation is global and our focus is on more recent iterations of the genre. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FMS 285 Screenwriting</head><p>This class explores modes of screenwriting that give weight to cinematic elements usually ignored by orthodox screenplay form. We treat the pictorial and audio-visual as content rather than mere style, and we explore ways to write the visual in addition to dialogue. Throughout the class, the emphasis for student writing is on personal content and human-scaled stories rather than historical film genres. First-Year Seminars are interdisciplinary courses that enable faculty and firstyear students to engage in extensive inquiry about an issue, topic or problem.</p><p>First-Year Seminars are writing intensive and focused on the seminar-style of investigation; they are not survey courses or introductions to a specific discipline. They afford the faculty and students an opportunity to explore a subject broadly and intensively.</p><p>First-Year Seminars are voluntary, but we encourage students to enroll in them since they aim to give new students a unique introduction to collegelevel learning. First-Year Seminars are small (normally 16 students) and are restricted to first-year students. They incorporate the development of intellectual capacities that form the foundation of a successful liberal arts education. In addition to focusing on writing, the seminars help students develop some or all of the following skills: critical thinking, speaking, research and working independently and collaboratively. First-Year Seminars are also effective in showing students how to integrate student support services into their academic pursuits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FYS 100 My Music: Writing Musical Lives</head><p>This first-year seminar begins with an exploration of our own musical lives. What does the particular constellation of material that we call "My Music" tell us about who we are, where we come from, and how we relate to the world? After analyzing and comparing musical lives within the class, we will read selected case studies and collaboratively design a musical biography project. Each student will curate one person's musical life story, gathering data through oneon-one interviews, weaving together their interlocutor's words with their own interpretations, and ultimately reflecting on what they have learned from the experience. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 Margaret Sarkissian Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 101 The Lives of Animals: Literature and the Nonhuman In this course, we will track animals across a range of poems, stories, novels, essays, and films that try to imagine what it is like not to be human. From stories of people transforming into animals to texts that insist that we have no clue what animals really feel, we will consider the various ways that writers distinguish-or refuse to distinguish-humans from other animals. Why, we will ask, are literature and art so haunted by animal life? We will discuss zoos, pets, fables, cartoons, animal rights, vegetarianism, anthropocentrism, and extinction. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

Students in this course attempt to decipher this history by careful examination of field evidence. Class meetings take place principally outdoors at interesting geological localities around the Connecticut Valley. Participants prepare regular reports based on their observations and reading, building to a final paper on the geologic history of the area. The course normally includes a weekend field trip to Cape Cod. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {N} Credits: 4 John B. Brady Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 107 Women of the Odyssey Homer's Odyssey presents a gallery of memorable women: Penelope above all, but also Nausicaa, Calypso and Circe. Helen plays a cameo role, while Clytemnestra is regularly invoked as a negative example. Together these women define a spectrum of female roles and possibilities: the faithful wife, the bride-tobe, the temptress, the adulteress, the murderer. We begin with a careful reading of the Odyssey, then study the afterlife of its female characters in the Western literary tradition. Readings are drawn from authors both ancient (Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Ovid) and modern (H.D., Robert Graves, Louise Gl√ºck, Margaret Drabble). This course counts toward the classics, classical studies and study of women and gender majors. Enrollment limited to 16 firstyear students. (E) WI Credits: <ref type="bibr">4 Scott A.

The aim is to give students the skills to assess critically various arguments that invoke the Bible or religious tradition and authority, wherever they come from on the political spectrum. Students are introduced to the Bible and biblical scholarship, as well as learn about different understandings of biblical authority and views of applying the Bible to contemporary political and ethical debates.

How do reviewers form their critical responses to theatre and dance performances as well as to films? The seminar explores different critical perspectives. The students attend live performances and film and video screenings, and write their own reviews and critical responses. This course counts toward the theatre major. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {A} {L} Credits: 4 Kyriaki Gounaridou Expected to be offered in the next 3 years States, and their interventions (ideological and geographical) engage an even broader territory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FYS 128 Ghosts</head><p>This course explores what Toni Morrison in Beloved calls "the living activity of the dead": their ambitions, their desires, their effects. Often returning as figures of memory or history, ghosts raise troubling questions as to what it is they, or we, have to learn. We shall survey a variety of phantasmagorical representations in poems, short stories, novels, films, spiritualist and scientific treatises and spirit photography. This course counts towards the English major. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 Cornelia D.J. Pearsall Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FYS 137 Of Minds and Molecules: Philosophical Perspectives on Chemistry and Biochemistry</head><p>What is the "shape," "size," or "color" of a smell? We often use vision as a metaphor when describing our perceptions from our other senses, but does this limit what we perceive? How do the (often visual) models that chemists use, and the metaphors that are associated with those models, affect what chemists study? For example, what do we mean when we speak of molecular "switches" or "brakes"? How do the metaphors and the kinds of languages that chemists use differ from those used in the arts? Is chemistry a single discipline, sharing a common language? Is it even an autonomous discipline at all, or is it reducible to physics? We will explore these questions from a philosophical perspective, using examples drawn primarily from chemistry and biochemistry. The course is designed for first-year students who would like to explore current conceptual issues that challenge some of the common beliefs about science. Enrollment limited to 20 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 Nalini Bhushan, David Bickar Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>

WI {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 142 Reacting to the Past In Reacting students learn by taking on roles, in elaborate games set in the past; they learn skills-speaking, writing, critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and teamwork-in order to prevail in complicated situations. Reacting roles do not have a fixed script and outcome. While students adhere to the intellectual beliefs of the historical figures they have been assigned, they must devise their own means of expressing those ideas in papers, speeches or public presentations. Class sessions are run entirely by students; instructors guide students and grade their oral and written work. It draws students into the past, promotes engagement with big ideas, and improves intellectual and academic skills. Enrollment limited to 24 first-year students. WI {H} Credits: 5 Joshua Birk, J.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FYS 146 Can Women Have Adventures?</head><p>We will examine contemporary girls' adventure in novels and films. These fictions rework the classic patterns of "boys' books" to create heroic girls meant to inspire young female readers. We begin with two classic 19th-century boys' books to situate our readings of contemporary girls' adventures. We will focus on the structure of the girls' adventure landscape by creating maps and writing blog posts for each fiction asking questions such as: What significant boundaries do the fictions imagine? What gender and class ideas do they enforce? How do boy and girl heroes differ? What does a girl hero do? Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

Field experiences are complemented by readings, quantitative work with GIS, engagement with local historical collections and resources, participation in local events, and class discussions. Students in the course will learn about the place in which they are living by exploring its cultural landscape history as it relates to the river that run through us. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 Reid W. Bertone-Johnson Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 152 Demons, Deities, and Despots: The Myths, Magic, and Madness of Islands This course explores the island as a mythical blank space, a paradise, a noman's land that encourages humankind's "primordial" impulses. We associate islands with adventure, wilderness, freedom, magic, dystopia and utopia. In the cultural imaginary, the island exists to be invented, discovered, and reinvented. We will consider a wide range of texts (and some films) from the isles of the Odyssey (home to seductive goddesses, a fairy-tale virgin princess, giant cannibals, and lotus addicts) to Prospero's magic kingdom, Swift's Lilliput, Peter Pan's Neverland, Golding's man-made dystopia (Lord of the Flies), Jean Rhys's Jamaica (Wide Sargasso Sea), and Jamaica Kincaid's Antigua (A Small Place).

WI {A} Credits: <ref type="bibr">4 Joseph George McVeigh</ref> Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 160 The End of the World as We Know It: The Post-Apocalyptic Novel We explore a wide range of literary scenarios that depict the collapse of civilization in the wake of plague-like disease and/or nuclear war. The motif of the post-Apocalyptic novel has become common, yet its roots go back as far (and further than) Jack London's The Scarlet Plague and Mary Shelley's The Last Man. In the works we will be examining, we witness the attempts of the few survivors of catastrophe to create a new world, or merely to live in a world in which the past casts a vast shadow over the present. The society that comes forth from these worlds can be anarchic, dystopic, utopian or a combination of these. Some works we explore include Alas, Babylon; On the Beach; Riddley Walker; The Postman; A Canticle for Leibowitz; The Chrysalids; The Road and others. Film adaptations are shown as part of the course. Enrollment limited to 16 firstyear students. WI Credits: 4 Gillian Murray Kendall Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>

Davis Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 173 Through the Green: Reading the Landscape of Golf The game of golf is an experience shaped by (bio)-mechanics, sociocultural contexts, historical conditions, and the landscape of the course itself. In this seminar, we will focus primarily on the environmental and sociocultural conditions of play. This approach takes in race, class, gender and bodies, the historical scope of golf in the United States, its roots to Scotland and its global appeal. Additionally, we will explore the landscape and layout of the golf course itself. Here we will examine the architectural renderings of courses ranging from recreational spaces to the privileged environs of renowned courses built by world class architects.

Translation is a fundamental human activity; the way individuals perceive the world influences their interpretation and understanding of all communication. Traditional forms of translations and interpretation will be studied along with adaptation/transformation of literary texts into films and different art forms. Topics studied include: translation, theories, ethics of translation, invisibility/visibility of translators, transculturation, subtitling and dubbing, machine translation and globalization. Competence in a language other than English or enrollment in a foreign language course is not required, but highly recommended. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FYS 177 The Tranquil(ized) Fifties</head><p>In popular culture and some political discourse, the 1950s appear as a lost paradise of a decade, a time of peace and prosperity, a golden age from which American culture has fallen. Any serious examination of the period, though, reveals not the fact of tranquility so much as the act of tranquilizing as Cold War tensions roiled internationally and political and social unrest continually erupted in the domestic sphere. Studying selected works of art and literature from the 1950s, this course explores some key episodes of this dynamic of conflict and conformity. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

Why and how we educate women are interdisciplinary questions that draw in fascinating ways on issues of national identity and culture. In this seminar, we will explore the history and sociology of this subject, First-Year Seminars 227 beginning in our own country, at the very start of America's public school system, and ending with a global perspective, considering the challenges of educating women in countries where female literacy is still deeply contested.

Members of this seminar explore these questions by focusing on local museums and exhibitions. From a behind-the-scenes look at the Smith College Museum of Art to an examination of hidden gems like the botanical sciences herbarium collection or that cabinet of curiosities which is Mount Holyoke's Skinner Museum, we research the histories of these collections and analyze the rationale of varying systems for ordering objects. By learning the critical skills of visual analysis and by grappling with the interpretations of art historians, anthropologists and psychologists, we attempt to come to an understanding of how knowledge is constructed in the context of display and how visual juxtapositions can generate meaning.

We examine the question of whether banlieue authors can escape various pressures: to become native informants; to write realistic rather than fantastical novels; to leave the "ghetto"; to denounce the sometimes difficult traditions, religions, neighborhoods and family members that have challenged but also molded them. Often seen as spaces of regression and decay, the banlieues nevertheless produce vibrant cultural expressions that beg the question: Is the banlieue a mere suburb of French cultural life, or more like one of its centers? </p></div>

How do these portraits confirm or chal-lenge the distinction between urban and non-urban? How does the image of the city shift for "insiders" and "outsiders"? Other topics to be discussed include immigration, colonialism and globalization.

Starting with the French New Wave, this course examines films that look at France's capital city differently, as a place where various urban, cosmopolitan, and/or diasporic subcultures live side by side, often unbeknownst to one another. Films by directors such as Truffaut, Godard, Varda, Sautet, Rohmer, Denis, Assayas, and Klapisch. {F} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FRN 253 The Lady, the Knight and the King An introduction to the main cultural and literary currents that shaped Medieval France, a period whose values and concept of "literature" were dramatically different from our own.

How did they represent female characters in their works and what do their statements about authorship reveal about their understanding of themselves as writing women? What do we make of anonymous works written in the feminine voice? Readings include the love letters of H√©lo√Øse, the lais and fables of Marie de France, the songs of the trobairitz and women trouv√®res, and the writings of Christine de Pizan. {F} {L} Credits: 4 Eglal Doss-Quinby Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FRN 340 Topics in 17th-and 18th-Century Literature Topics course.</p></div>

How did good taste, galanterie and wit, still crucial to French identity and sociability today, take root? In this course, students will examine the social practices, spaces and networks that defined French society, politically and culturally, from the height of the Ancien R√©gime up to the French Revolution. Students will also be exposed to digital humanities methods and theories, combining the study and praxis of these approaches, in order to reflect on how their use of digital tools and "virtual" teamwork change the ways in which they produce, share and disseminate knowledge. {F} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>

Scandalous pleasure seeker or devoted mother? French Queen or Austrian spy? Instigator of the French Revolution or innocent victim? More than two hundred years after her execution, Marie Antoinette continues to fascinate, caught between history and myth and open to conflicting interpretations. How can we understand the persona behind or in the body that proliferated so many meanings? How can we trace the origins and the impacts of those meanings? Does Marie Antoinette's semiotic body continue to signify for us? We'll examine Marie Antoinette from a variety of perspectives: archival sources, documents and letters, biographies, portraits, both official and unofficial, caricatures, pornographic pamphlets, and fictional works such as plays, novels and films in which she figures. The course will incorporate a role-playing unit reenacting her trial, during which every member of the class will play the role of one of the important participants. Some film screenings. {F} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FRN 343 Cultural Wars at the Theater What effects does theater have on its audience and society at large? Does it corrupt the public and society, as J.-J. Rousseau argued, or on the contrary, can it morally reform its audience and society, as Diderot believed? The debate about the moral and political uses and misuses of theater animated the public, the philosophes and their critics, as well as the state, from the mid-17th century until the R√©volution, and on to today. We will study the way authors, critics and the theater itself responded to the debate, from the classical drama of Racine and Moli√®re, to the street theater of the Paris fairs and the influence of the Com√©die italienne, from the new genres of the drame bourgeois to the liberation of the theater during the Revolution, and in the 20th and 21st centuries from the uses of theatre to resist the German occupation during WWII to the recent debate about the censoring of a new staging of Voltaire's Le Fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Proph√®te, and the contemporary theatre of Ariane Mnouchkine which aims to raise the political consciousness of an audience to the crisis of global migration today. There will be a number of film screenings.</p></div>

Students examine both cultural productions and social science texts: memoirs, psychoanalytical literature, activist statements, sociological studies, feature films, fashion, performance art, blogs and news reports. France has historically been the leading European host country for immigrants, a multiplicity of origins reflected in its current demographic make-up. Topics include: the hyper-sexualization of black and brown bodies, France as a Mediterranean culture, immigrant loneliness in Europe, intermarriage and demographic change, the veil and niqab, as well as sexual nationalism and homo-nationalism. {F} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years </p></div>

Students are exposed to a literary form that achieved popularity and cultural prestige early on, was then significantly challenged and diversified, and is presently enjoying a resurgence. We consider fictional and nonfictional accounts reflecting various geographies of travel and migration. While early voyagers tended to assert the relative superiority of French culture, subsequent generations of travelers abandoned discovery for self-discovery, and critiqued colonialism instead of indigenous cultures. Countries and regions surveyed include the Holy Land, Turkey, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Central and West Africa, the United States, Iran, France, Indonesia and Thailand. {F} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FRN 392 Topics in Culture Topics course.</p></div>

The work of certain writers -often women and often Wharton, von Arnim and Colette-is categorized as small in scope, narrowly focused and therefore marginal in some ways. Here are questions, based in part on readings in landscape and domestic design theory, that we can ask to help us see their work differently: When and how is it appropriate to juxtapose writers' biographies on their fiction? How do they represent domestic discord -loss, rage, depression-in their fiction? In particular, how do local landscapes and other domestic spaces-houses, rooms, gardens -figure in this representation? Texts include novels, short stories, correspondence, excerpts from journals, and other autobiographical writing: Prerequisite: one other literature course at any level, or permission of the instructor.

How does land become a landscape? How does space become a place? Scientists study and manipulate landscapes as do politicians, builders, hunters, children, artists and writers, among others. In this course, we examine how writers, in particular, participate in placemaking, and how the landscape influences and inhabits literary texts. The course includes some landscape history and theory, visits by people who study landscape from nonliterary angles, and the discovery of how landscape works in texts in transforming and surprising ways.

Why did the U.S. government fail to prevent the 9/11 attacks, and what can be done to ensure against such attacks in the future? This course considers these and other questions through the lens of the U.S. intelligence community. The modern American intelligence system was established in the wake of World War II, and has since grown to comprise seventeen different agencies requiring upwards of $80 billion per year in funding. We review the history of this system, both at home and abroad, with special attention to the Central Intelligence Agency and its often controversial role in U.S. foreign policy. Prerequisites: Junior or Senior standing; at least one course each in American politics and international relations. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years</p></div>

We begin with readings of Aristotle, Rousseau and Mill to introduce some issues associated with the ideal of democratic self-government: participation, equality, majority rule vs. minority rights, the common good, pluralism, community. Readings include selections from liberal, radical, socialist, libertarian, multiculturalist and feminist political thought. Not open to first-year students. {S} Credits: 4 Gary L. Lehring Expected to be offered in the next 3 years GOV 268 Utopian/Dystopian Visions and Political Theory Thomas More penned his novel Utopia in 1516, and in 1868 John Stuart Mill coined 'dystopia' as the antithesis of More's idyllic vision. But the word utopia literally translates as "nowhere land." This course will explore the question how the exploration of "what could be" has been and remains a central focus in the work of much of political theory. Serving as both an exemplar and a warning of planned political societies, utopian and dystopian literature is always engaged in the work of making, unmaking, and remaking the possibilities for the original political question, "How should we govern?" Enrollment limit of 25. {S} Credits: 4 Gary L. Lehring Normally offered in alternate years GOV 269 Politics of Gender and Society An examination of gender and sexuality as subjects of theoretical investigation, historically constructed in ways that have made possible various forms of regulation and scrutiny today. We focus on the way in which traditional views of gender and sexuality still resonate with us in the modern world, helping to shape legislation and public opinion, creating substantial barriers to cultural and political change.

But what exactly does democracy entail? Is it an institution, a practice, a value, a virtue? This lecture course provides a survey of different historical and theoretical answers to these questions, from the foundations of self-government in ancient Athens through the present day. {S} Credits: 4 Erin R.

Are citizens morally obligated to obey unjust laws? How do we know when a law is unjust? What kinds of protest actions are justified? Is violence ever legitimate? This course will engage student with these questions by reading classic and contemporary texts from both philosophers and practitioners of forms of disobedience and resistance. Texts include works by John Rawls, Judith Shklar, Henry David Thoreau, MK Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Hannah Arendt.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Politics of Heterosexuality</head><p>This course explores the social and political construction of heterosexuality; it's interaction with race, class and gender; and the queer resistances to heteronormativity that have formed to oppose it. Examining heterosexuality as a form of social and political privilege, we explore the ways in which it acts as a coercive yet successful cultural norm, often disappearing as a category of investigation altogether. Attention is paid to rendering visible the historical, political, economic and social forces that have contributed to the construction and maintenance of a coerced and coercive heterosexuality, while simultaneously exploring the uniqueness produced through the intersections of heterosexuality with race, class and gender. These intersections reveal the many ways that heteronormativity has been deployed as a form of political organization of the body politic, even as it produces multiple locations of resistance for politicized bodies. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Political Theory of Michel Foucault</head><p>This course examines the work of Michel Foucault , French philosopher, social critic, historian and activist, and generally acknowledged as one of the most influential of the thinkers whose work is categorized as poststructuralist. Foucault's various inquiries into the production of knowledge and power have formed the paradoxically destabilizing foundation for much of the work on the status of the human subject in post-modernity. We explore the theoretically rich and dense approaches undertaken by Foucault, as well as illuminating his central ideas that seem to challenge much of what political theory accepts as a given. From The Birth of the Clinic, The Order of Things and Discipline and Punish to his later works including The History of Sexuality, The Use of Pleasure, and The Care of the Self, attention is given to how his works simultaneously advance and critique much of the canon of political theory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Politics, Wealth and Inequality</head><p>Since Plato and Aristotle, wealth inequality has been the subject of political interrogation. In the last 50 years, most economic benefits have gone to the top 1 percent of the population; corporations and the very rich have paid lower taxes and corporations have received more corporate support from government while federal, state and local budgets for social welfare programs have been cut and working people's salaries have fallen. This course examines and compares what contemporary political theorists and mainstream authors have to say about the connection between wealth, inequality and the health of a political system. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years GOV 369 African American Political Thought This seminar examines central questions in African American political thought: freedom and domination; power, powerlessness, and subjectivity; inclusion, exclusion and autonomy; the meaning of race and its relationship to citizenship, democracy, and nationhood; and political action, resistance, and emancipation. In this course, we will take up the study of African American political thought both as political thinking generated by concrete historical experiences of enslavement, colonialism, violence, and resistance/resilience; but also, as political thinking that engages, challenges, and fundamentally shapes the core conceptual categories of modern political theory. Prerequisite: coursework in political theory or coursework in the history of political thought.  The history major comprises 11 semester courses, at least six of which shall normally be taken at Smith, distributed as follows: 1. HST 150: The Historian's Craft 2.

The Silk Roads, long distance networks that allowed people, goods, technology, religious beliefs and other ideas to travel between China, India and Rome/Mediterranean, and the many points in between, developed against the backdrop of the rise and fall of steppe nomadic empires in Inner Asia. We examine these as interrelated phenomena that shaped Eurasian encounters to the rise of the world-conquering Mongols and the journey of Marco Polo. </p></div>

It examines the struggles of these countries to preserve or regain their independence and establish national identities in a rapidly emerging and often violent modern world order. Although each of these countries has its own distinctive identity, their overlapping histories (and dilemmas) give the region a coherent identity. We also look at how individuals respond to and are shaped by larger historical movements. HST 222 (C) Aspects of Japanese History Topics course.</p></div>

How Japanese women and men have constructed norms of be-havior in different historical periods, how gender differences were institutionalized in social structures and practices, and how these norms and institutions changed over time. The gendered experiences of women and men from different classes from approximately the seventh through the 19th centuries. Consonant with current developments in gender history, exploration of variables such as class, religion and political context that have affected women's and men's lives HST 229 (C) A World Before Race?: Ethnicity, Culture and Difference in the Middle Ages Twenty-first century scholars argue that race is a constructed social identity that began to coalesce around the seventeenth century. But were they right? In this course, we will look to the Middle Ages to challenge the consensus that racial constructions were a byproduct of modernity. Does race function differently between the world of Latin Christendom and that of the dar al-Islam? What are the advantages and dangers of using the prism of race to analyze ethnic, cultural and religious differences in this medieval period? What does studying race in the Middle Ages teach us about contemporary conceptions of race? Enrollment limit of 18. HST 234 (C) Global Africa This course interrogates how scholars have engaged the "transnational" and "global" in African history. In doing so, the course explores the complex networks of identities, loyalties, and attachments forged by diverse groups of African peoples in their attempts to live within and transcend the boundaries of the modern nation-state.

In doing so, we query the assumptions made by colonial officials, postcolonial leaders, social scientific experts and local communities as they sought to understand and articulate African pathways into a largely ill-defined social and economic modernity. Key subjects of enquiry include an analysis of the relationship between western and non-western "modernities," and explorations into the link between knowledge and power in our own interpretations of the past and of the so-called "underdeveloped world."

What do black archives look like and what do they offer us? How do they expand the way we consider archives in general? This course seeks to address these questions by examining the conception and development of black archives, primarily, although not exclusively, as they arose in the United States across the twentieth century. This interdisciplinary colloquial course explores the historical and theoretical perspectives of African American women from the time of slavery to the postcivil rights era. A central concern of the course is the examination of how black women shaped and were shaped by the intersectionality of race, gender and sexuality in American culture. Not open to first-year students.

A major problem created by the establishment of slavery based on race by the 1660s was what was to be the status of free blacks. Each local and state government addressed the political, economic, and even religious questions raised by having free blacks in a slave society.

It introduces students to the growing body of material culture studies and the ways in which historic landscapes, architecture, furniture, textiles, metalwork, ceramics, foodways and domestic environments are interpreted as cultural documents and as historical evidence. Offered on-site at Historic Deerfield (with transportation available from the Smith campus), the course offers students a unique opportunity to study the museum's world-famous collections in a hands-on, interactive setting with curators and historians. Utilizing the disciplines of history, art and architectural history, anthropology, and archaeology, we explore the relationships between objects and ideas and the ways in which items of material culture both individually and collectively convey patterns of everyday life.

The seminar readings focus on case studies about contemporary challenges in preservation, access and interpretation of archival materials. In a variety of media, students analyze how these materials become part of a meaningful and usable past for general audiences. In addition, each student completes an independent project, usually an exhibit that draws upon their own expertise developed through their coursework and their practical experiences. Enrollment limited to 15. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Twentieth-Century Revolutions</head><p>This seminar provides students with an introduction to the problem of "revolution" in twentieth-century world history. In doing so, the course will comparatively examine a number of revolutionary contexts, including the Soviet Union, Algeria, Iran, and black radical politics in Africa and its diaspora. Throughout the course, we will thus question the complex interplay between the theorizing of revolution and the lived, historical experiences on the ground. Moreover, key to the course will be the students' completion of their own primary-source driven research project on a topic of their choosing connected to the course theme. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Women and World War I: The Smith College Relief Unit</head><p>How did women imagine their place in a war defined as quintessentially masculine? That is a central question in this seminar, which surveys women's varied contributions to the war effort. Then students undertake archival research in the papers of the Smith College Relief Unit (SCRU), a unit comprised of Smith alumnae who led reconstruction efforts in one of the regions of France most devastated by the war. By studying the letters these women wrote home, and other archival sources, students undertake a research project using the SCRU papers to address broader questions engaging women's complex relationships with the war. Remembering Slavery: A Gendered Reading of the WPA Slave Interviews Despite the particular degradation, violence and despair of enslavement in the United States, African American men and women built families, traditions and a legacy of resistance. Using the WPA interviews-part of the New Deal Federal Writers Project of the 1930s-this course looks at the historical memory of former slaves by reading and listening to their own words. How did 70-through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle? The course examines the WPA interviews as historical sources by studying scholarship that relies heavily on them. Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slavery. Students write an original research paper using the WPA interviews as their central source. This is an advanced community-based research seminar in which students work closely with archival materials from the Sophia Smith Collection and other archives to explore histories of resistance, collective action and grassroots organizing among domestic workers in the United States, from the mid-19th century to the present. This work has historically been done by women of color and been among the lowest paid, most vulnerable and exploited forms of labor. We work closely with and in service of several organization of women of color, immigrant women and families, helping them to use history as an organizing tool in their current campaigns. This means meeting with domestic work organizers in person and virtually, collecting archival materials for them, and making the materials accessible in an online interactive timeline and other formats </p></div>

It is an independent course, but participation in it is also dependent on the students' roles as teaching assistants in HST 150. Key pedagogical themes and debates explored in the class include issues around student engagement, teaching research and writing, and what it means to help students learn to think historically. Students in the course will also develop their own research project centered on historical pedagogy as well as design their own course. Smith's Program in the History of Science and Technology is designed to serve all Smith students. Courses in the program examine science and technology in their historical, cultural and social contexts, and the ways in which they have shaped and continue to shape human culture (and vice versa).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratories of Modernity 1800/1900</head><p>This course investigates the interchange of ideas between the realms of the natural sciences, philosophy and literature, focusing primarily on the turns of the 19th and 20th centuries. We examine the important influence of scientific developments on cultural production during these pivotal periods, while at the same time exploring the cultural environments that fostered these scientific innovations. The emphasis is on modes of observation and the notions of the observing subject that they reflect. At the center of discussion are literary, scientific and philosophical texts-along with a few films-that negotiate the intersection of perception, documentation and communication.

The course focuses on post-World War II culture and students learn how Italian traditional artistic and craft excellence was negotiated with technological modernization and the creation of a mass-consumer society. By looking at Italy's achievements in sectors such as fashion, interior design, automobiles, architecture and advertising, students learn how, in the course of a century, designers, stylists and industrialists played a critical role in manufacturing an iconic Italian image made of luxury and glamour appealing to domestic and international consumers. By reaching across linguistic and cultural barriers, this course fosters understanding of different worldviews and introduces students to the varied field of translation in order to develop their critical thinking skills and broaden their intercultural awareness. Translation is a fundamental human activity; the way individuals perceive the world influences their interpretation and understanding of all communication. Traditional forms of translations and interpretation will be studied along with adaptation/transformation of literary texts into films and different art forms. Topics studied include: translation, theories, ethics of translation, invisibility/visibility of translators, transculturation, subtitling and dubbing, machine translation and globalization. Competence in a language other than English or enrollment in a foreign language course is not required, but highly recommended. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

The course begins with a focus on reading, pronouncing and recognizing Arabic alphabet and progresses quickly toward developing beginner reading, writing, speaking and listening proficiencies as well as cultural competence. It covers vocabulary for everyday use, and essential communicative skills relating to real-life and task-oriented situations (queries about personal well-being, family, work, and telling the time). Students will acquire vocabulary and usage for everyday interactions as well as skills that will allow them to read and analyze a range of texts at the Novice level. In addition to the traditional textbook exercises from AlKitaab series, students will write short paragraphs and participate in role plays, presentations and conversations throughout the year. No pre-requisites for this course. Enrollment limited to 18 students Credits: 5 May George, John O. Weinert Normally offered each fall ARA 101 Elementary Arabic II This is a continuation of First-Year Arabic I. Students will complete the study of the Elementary Arabic AlKitaab book series along with additional instructional materials. Following ACTFL proficiency standards, students should be at the Intermediate-Low level by the end of this course. Emphasis will be on the integrated development of all language skills -reading, writing, listening and speaking -using a communicative-oriented, proficiency-based approach. By the end of this semester, students will acquire vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and language skills necessary for everyday interactions as well as skills that will allow them to communicate with a limited working proficiency in a variety of situations, read and write about a variety of factual material and familiar topics in non-technical prose. In addition to the textbook exercises, students will write short essays, do oral and video presentations and participate in role plays, discussions, and conversations throughout the semester in addition to extra-curricular activities. Enrollment limited to 18 students. Prerequisites: Arabic 101 or equivalent. {F} Credits: 5 May George, John O. Weinert Normally offered each spring ARA 200 Intermediate Arabic 1 According to the ACTFL standards, this course is Intermediate Low Arabic. It covers the four skills of the language. Writers at the intermediate level are characterized by the ability to meet practical writing needs, such as simple messages and letters, requests for information, and notes. In addition, they can ask and respond to simple questions in writing. At the intermediate level, listeners can understand information conveyed in simple, sentence-length speech on familiar or everyday topics while readers at the same level can understand information conveyed in simple, predictable, loosely connected texts. Readers rely heavily on contextual clues. They can most easily understand information if the format of the text is familiar, such as in a weather report or a social announcement. Speakers at the intermediate level are distinguished primarily by their ability to create with the language when talking about familiar topics related to their daily life. They are able to recombine learned material in order to express personal meaning. Students should expect text assignments as well as work with DVDs, audio materials and websites. Exercises include writing, social interactions, role plays, and the interplay of language and culture. Prerequisite is ARA 100Y or the equivalent. {F} Credits: 4 John O.

We examine the question of whether banlieue authors can escape various pressures: to become native informants; to write realistic rather than fantastical novels; to leave the "ghetto"; to denounce the sometimes difficult traditions, religions, neighborhoods and family members that have challenged but also molded them. Often seen as spaces of regression and decay, the banlieues nevertheless produce vibrant cultural expressions that beg the question: Is the banlieue a mere suburb of French cultural life, or more like one of its centers? {F} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each academic year FYS 157 Syria Beyond the Headlines Syria today is at the center of turmoil that is remaking the Middle East and challenging global security.

HST 229 (C) A World Before Race?: Ethnicity, Culture and Difference in the Middle Ages Twenty-first century scholars argue that race is a constructed social identity that began to coalesce around the seventeenth century. But were they right? In this course, we will look to the Middle Ages to challenge the consensus that racial constructions were a byproduct of modernity. Does race function differently between the world of Latin Christendom and that of the dar al-Islam? What are the advantages and dangers of using the prism of race to analyze ethnic, cultural and religious differences in this medieval period? What does studying race in the Middle Ages teach us about contemporary conceptions of race? Enrollment limit of 18. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Popular Music of the Islamic World</head><p>Music is a thorny issue in many Islamic societies. There is often tension between hardliners who believe that music has no place in Islam and thus try to prohibit it and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music. Despite this, there is an incredible variety of vibrant popular music traditions throughout the Islamic world. In this course, we engage with Islamic debates on popular music, explore music in a variety of cultures (e.g., Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Senegal and Turkey), and examine the ways they illuminate different themes (forms of Islam, issues of diaspora, gender considerations, musical diversity, etc. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Holy Land</head><p>This course examines the concept of the "Holy Land" according to the religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It explores the ways the Holy Land has been defined and sanctified in scripture and in works of art, architecture, literature, poetry and film. It also explores the ways that political rulers have tried to tap into the sanctity of the Holy Land to promote their own legitimacy. The course emphasizes the significance of the common heritage of the Holy Land, as well as how it has inspired religious and political conflict. Enrollment limited to 20. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jihad</head><p>The persistence of the ideology of jihad in modern Islam drives revivalists and apologists to disagree over the meaning of "jihad" and whether it should be understood to necessitate violence or as an interpersonal spiritual struggle. This course examines the most important modern debates about Jihad and how each position engages and appeals to the foundational Islamic sources (e.g. Qur'an, Muhammad, Sharia/Islamic Law) and Islamic history for legitimacy. It also explores the factors that make the rhetoric used by modern jihadists popular among certain Muslim constituencies, inspiring them to wage holy war against "infidels" as well as fellow Muslims. Course may be repeated for credit with a different topic. Enrollment limited to 35. {H} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years REL 249 Islamic Popular Music Same as MUS 249. Music is a complex issue in many Islamic societies. There are tensions between those who believe music has no place in Islam and try to prohibit it, those for whom it is a central component of mystical devotion, and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music, a core part of the self-identification of young people everywhere. Despite this, there is an amazing variety of vibrant popular music throughout the Islamic world. This course will explore the religious debates over music and the rich musical tradition (including religious music) in Islam. {A} {H} Credits: 4 Suleiman Ali Mourad, Margaret Sarkissian Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>

It examines the formation of a variety of schools of practice of Shari øa from very early on in Islamic history until today and the way Muslim jurists have maintained the relevance of Shari øa to their respective societies and times. It covers topics such as: the theory and application of Shari øa, purpose of Shari  øa, sources of Shari  øa (e.g., Qur'an, Muhammad, customs), hermeneutical tools (e.g., reason, public good, doubt), and the laws themselves. The course also discusses the interaction of Shari øa with other legal systems, especially in the context of today where Shari øa is restricted to a small realm (primarily family and personal law). Limited to juniors, seniors (and others by permission of the instructor). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sex and the Medieval City</head><p>This course examines the medieval understanding of sex and the woman's body within an urban context. We read medieval texts on love, medicine and women's sexuality by Iberian and North African scholars. We investigate the ways in which medieval Iberian medical traditions have viewed women's bodies and defined their health and illness. We also address women's role as practitioners of medicine, and how such a role was affected by the gradual emergence of "modern" medical institutions such as the hospital and the medical profession. The Museums Concentration gives students a foundation in the history of museums and the critical issues they engage. Through a combination of academic coursework, two internships and independent research, students learn about institutions that shape knowledge and understanding through collection, preservation, interpretation and display of material culture. The Museums Concentration provides a unique opportunity at the undergraduate level for students to consider how their academic studies might connect to their future lives and careers. Students are introduced to issues such as community access, cultural ownership and public accountability-areas of study that will be important whatever they decide to do after Smith.</p><p>The Museums Concentration draws on the educational resource of the Smith College Museum of Art's collection of more than 25,000 original works of art and the other special collections at Smith, on the expertise of SCMA's professional staff, and on the exceptional academic programs of Smith College and the other Five Colleges that support learning in this area.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MUS 106 American Sounds</head><p>This course surveys developments in the history of American music, with a primary focus on the 20th century. We pay particular attention to blues and country music, two styles that arose early in the century and provided the foundation for much of what followed. The course may cover other styles such as: blackface minstrelsy, Tin Pan Alley, folk, jazz, classical or varieties of Latino music. Throughout, we attend to musical aspects of these styles, and connect them to larger historical themes and social issues concerning race, class, gender and the making of "American" identity through music. This course explores different approaches to the study of music as a cultural phenomenon. We consider basic questions, such as: Why is music so often at the center of our most profound personal and social experiences? Why is music a fundamental means of connecting with our own lives, our communities and the wider world in which we live? Through in-depth reading and in-class discussion, we study the institutions of music (concerts, recording studios) and the varied practices of music making <ref type="bibr">(classical, popular; amateur, professional)</ref>  Music has long played an important role in both memorialization and monumentalization. In this class, we use music as a lens through which to consider the agendas and values behind public displays of memory, history, and political strength. We will study music written to commemorate victims of war, state violence, and illness, from requiems to 9/11 memorial works. We will also consider how composers, performers, and listeners have participated in monumentalizing historical or political occasions, from composer anniversary celebrations to national anthems. {A} {H} Credits: 4 Andrea Moore Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>

Musically, the development of jazz is traced from the early styles that took root in New Orleans and Chicago to the challenging "free jazz" sounds of the 1960s and the 1970s, and into the current "postmodern" moment of jazz history. Historically, the course considers such issues as the key importance of race to the social development of jazz, the shifting status of jazz as "popular" or "art" music, and the nature and significance of improvisation as a medium of creative expression in 20th century American culture. Some previous knowledge of African American music and history or permission of the instructor required.

In this course, we explore metal and punk as interrelated musical responses to the "crisis" that beset post-1960's rock, and use the two genres as a lens for examining the nature and definition of popular music genres, the status of rock music as commodity, the politics of "noise," and the shifting qualities of the rock audience from the 1970s to the present. Enrollment limited to 20 students. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African Popular Music</head><p>This course focuses on twentieth century African popular music: it examines musical genres from different parts of the continent, investigating their relationships to the historical, political and social dynamics of their respective national and regional origins. Regional examples like highlife, soukous and mbaqanga will provide the basis for assessing the significance of popular music as a creative response to the colonial and postcolonial enviromnet in Africa. Themes explored include the use of music in the construction of social identity and the interaction of local and global elements. This course is an introduction to the music, life, and legacy of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music inspired generations of composers and performers across genres. In addition to studying some of his works in depth and his biography, we will explore the cultural and historical context in which he worked, raising questions about performance, instruments, religious life, and patronage. We also look at his influence on music in the nineteenth century, the controversies around his St. John Passion in the twentieth, and his legacy in the twenty-first century. {A} {H} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years</p></div>

We often use vision as a metaphor when describing our perceptions from our other senses, but does this limit what we perceive? How do the (often visual) models that chemists use, and the metaphors that are associated with those models, affect what chemists study? For example, what do we mean when we speak of molecular "switches" or "brakes"? How do the metaphors and the kinds of languages that chemists use differ from those used in the arts? Is chemistry a single discipline, sharing a common language? Is it even an autonomous discipline at all, or is it reducible to physics? We will explore these questions from a philosophical perspective, using examples drawn primarily from chemistry and biochemistry. The course is designed for first-year students who would like to explore current conceptual issues that challenge some of the common beliefs about science. Enrollment limited to 20 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 Nalini Bhushan, David Bickar Expected to be offered in the next 3 years PSY 313 Seminar in Psycholinguistics Topics course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Major</head><p>Advisers: Members of the department Physics is crucial to understanding our world. Physics challenges our imagination, provides insight into our most important challenges and leads to great discoveries and new technologies. Physicists are problem solvers whose analytical skills and training make them versatile and adaptable. A foundation in physics provides a gateway to interdisciplinary careers incorporating many scientific and educational fields, including astronomy, engineering, biology, chemistry, climate science, environmental science, geoscience, mathematics, medicine and teaching. The undergraduate physics curriculum at Smith stresses the fundamental principles, concepts and methods of physics with emphasis placed on analytical reasoning, problem -solving and the critical evaluation of underlying assumptions in theory and experiment. Built around the core courses that achieve this goal, the major allows options within the requirements that provide flexibility to students primarily interested in interdisciplinary applications of physics.</p><p>The requirements for the major are as follows: <ref type="bibr">117,</ref><ref type="bibr">118,</ref><ref type="bibr">210,</ref><ref type="bibr">215,</ref><ref type="bibr">240,</ref><ref type="bibr">317,</ref><ref type="bibr">318,</ref><ref type="bibr">319,</ref><ref type="bibr">327,</ref><ref type="bibr">350</ref> (at least 4 credits), 360 (or an approved 300 level alternative in physics or a related field), and 399.</p><p>While students are typically discouraged from taking PHY major requirements S/U, it may be allowed, after consultation with a student's major advisor and approval of the Department.</p><p>Students double majoring in engineering may substitute EGR 220 for PHY 240 but are encouraged to take both.</p><p>Students may substitute CHM 331 for PHY 327 and CHM 332 for PHY 319. This option is intended for students double majoring (and/or planning on graduate work) in chemistry.</p><p>Students double majoring in astronomy and/or planning on graduate work in astrophysics may substitute AST 330, 335, 337 or 352 for PHY 360 as their 300 level physics elective.</p><p>Students planning on graduate work in chemistry may substitute CHM 335, 336, 338, or 398 for PHY 360 as their 300 level physics elective.</p><p>Students planning on graduate work in the geosciences may substitute GEO 309 or 311 for PHY 360 as their 300 level physics elective.</p><p>Students may repeat PHY 360 for credit in the major, with permission of the department.</p><p>Students are advised to check with members of the physics department to choose appropriate course substitutions; other courses may qualify, with advanced permission of the department.</p><p>Physics majors and minors are advised to acquire a facility in scientific computing and numerical analysis (e.g. CSC 111 Introduction to Computer Science or CSC 205 Modeling in the Sciences) and to learn to design and fabricate a working tool, instrument or device in the Center for Design and Fabrication. Students planning graduate study in physics are advised to take as many 300 level physics courses as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Education Track</head><p>Advisers: Members of the department Besides the standard physics major, we also offer a physics education track within the major. The regular major track includes 300 level course requirements necessary for preparation for graduate school. The education track replaces some of the upper level courses with courses in physics pedagogy and education and engages students in practical experience in the physics classroom. Students interested in teaching and science journalism should consider this track. </p></div>

Administering of GRE practice exams will be used as an assessment tool of this understanding and of relevant analytical skills needed for problem-solving. Each student, with the approval of her major adviser, elects a carefully planned program of course selections designed to meet the following requirements: 10 semester courses including the foundational courses in psychology <ref type="bibr">(100,</ref><ref type="bibr">201,</ref><ref type="bibr">202)</ref>. Students should normally complete these foundational courses by the end of their sophomore year. Foundational courses must be taken using the regular grading option (not S/U).</p><p>Competence in the major is demonstrated by sufficient breadth of course selections from the various substantive areas, as well as adequate depth of course selections. Breadth is achieved by selecting at least one course within each of the department's three curricular areas. Depth is achieved by selecting two colloquia as well as two courses at the advanced level (300-or above), at least one of which is a seminar. Furthermore, depth requires that at least one course at the advanced level combines with the student's other courses to create a constellation of three courses that represent a depth in a field of study that is important to the student and recognized by the department. Students may count no more than three 100-level courses toward the major, not including PSY 100. Although we discourage the use of the S/U option for courses in the major, students are allowed to take one non-foundational course S/U. All students (including transfer students) must take at least one colloquium and one advanced seminar within the department.</p><p>Students are encouraged to attend departmental colloquia. Students planning careers in academic or professional psychology, social work, personnel work involving guidance or counseling, psychological research, or paraprofessional occupations in mental health settings or special education programs should consult their major advisers regarding desirable sequencing of courses.</p><p>Information about graduate programs in psychology and allied fields may be obtained from members of the department.</p></div>

We also recommend that students take PSY 201 prior to, or concurrent with, PSY 202.</p><p>PSY 100 Introduction to Psychology An introductory course surveying fundamental principles and findings in classical and contemporary psychology. Topics typically include: the brain, learning, memory, development, emotion, behavioral genetics, personality, social psychology, psychopathology, and therapies. In addition to these topics, students will learn how to read and summarize primary psychological research. Students attend a weekly lecture and must enroll in a discussion section that meets twice per week. An in-depth examination of controversial issues of concern to the study of the psychology of women and gender. Students are introduced to current psychological theory and empirical research relating to the existence, origins and implications of behavioral similarities and differences associated with gender. We examine the development of gender roles and stereotypes, power within the family, workplace and politics, and women's mental health and sexuality, paying attention to social context, and intersectional identities.

We begin with a historical overview of the field including a review of the major systems of psychotherapy (psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive and humanistic). We then devote some time to developing critical skills for reading the scientific literature. These skills are nurtured throughout the semester as we move through the major research on psychotherapy "outcome" and "process." Outcome research traditionally asks the question, "Does psychotherapy work?" We explore the field's current position on that question and demonstrate that it leads naturally to the process question, "How does psychotherapy work?" We discuss the current literature on this question and gain some "hands-on" experience with psychotherapy process measures. Course readings are supplemented with videotapes and transcript material from actual psychotherapies.

This course examines the notion of blasphemy-its meanings, the invisible boundaries it presupposes both in some of the world's major religious traditions and in secular contexts, and the different ways of seeing it often signifies. Based on case studies, it explores contemporary public uses of the term, the competing understandings of the "sacred" it often assumes, and the cultural and political challenges the term presents in a globalized society. The course considers the implications of the public charge of blasphemy in light of issues such as: the religious and the secular; humor and satire; commodification and consumerism; "insiders," "outsiders," and cultural appropriation; art, film, and the sacred; museum conservation and display; free speech and human rights. The rise of Jewish philosophy and mysticism (Kabbalah) in the Islamic world and in medieval Spain, and the development of these theological and intellectual trends as decisive influences upon all subsequent forms of Judaism. Analysis of Jewish philosophy and mysticism as complementary yet often competing spiritual paths. How did Jewish philosophers and mystics consider the roles of reason, emotion and symbols in religious faith and practice? What interrelations did they see between the natural and divine realms, and between religious, philosophical and scientific explanations? Expressions of philosophy and mysticism in religious texts, individual piety, popular practice and communal politics.

Readings include major philosophic, mystical and political works in addition to primary sources on the lives of Jewish women and men, families and communities, and messianic and popular movements. Throughout the course, we explore tensions between assimilation and cohesion, tradition and renewal, and history and memory. As devotional object, political symbol, and art commodity, the icon is revered as sacred, vilified as reactionary, and displayed and sold as masterpiece. This course examines the complex world of the Russian icon from its ancient Byzantine roots, to its modern branding as "other," and its recent reemergence in the turbulent public sphere of post-communist Russia.

By pursuing coursework in a broad array of disciplines, students will gain an appreciation for the different methodological approaches scholars use in their study of this highly diverse and dynamic region of the world.</p><p>The Area Studies track consists of 11 courses, which include the following requirements: ‚Ä¢ Four semesters of language instruction, usually fulfilled by taking RES 100Y</p><p>(a year-long introductory course to the Russian language) or RES 120 (an intensive 8-credit semester-long course which covers a year of Russian), and RES 221 and RES 222 (the combination of which is equivalent to second-year Russian). Students are welcome to pursue the study of another language relevant to the region. Students who place out of first-or secondyear Russian (or other relevant language) will consult with their advisor or Program Director on how best to fulfill the four-semester language instruction requirement. Students are highly encouraged to continue the study of Russian (or another language of the region), especially in a study abroad program, in order to achieve an advanced level of fluency. Credits earned in study-abroad language courses may count toward the fulfillment of the major requirements. ‚Ä¢ Six semester <ref type="bibr">(4-credit)</ref> courses, at least one of which will include a semester course taught in Russian (equivalent to RES 331) or another relevant language. In developing their area of concentration, students are strongly encouraged to seek out courses that span a broad range of disciplines, including anthropology and sociology, art and film, government/political science/ international relations, history, literature, and religion. ‚Ä¢ A 300-level seminar, a research-based Special Studies, or a Senior Honors Thesis (which is a year-long project that counts as two courses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language and Literature Track</head><p>The Language and Literature Track provides the opportunity for students to focus closely on the language, literature, and cinema of Russia, Eastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students are expected to achieve advanced proficiency in Russian or another relevant language, and to engage closely with works of literature and film in the original language of study. While focusing on the language, literature, and cinema of one or more culture in the region, students in this track are also encouraged to explore correlated disciplines represented in the REEES curriculum.</p><p>The Language and Literature track consists of 11 courses, which include the following requirements:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Six semesters of language instruction in Russian, or another relevant language of the region. For Russian, this will usually be fulfilled by taking RES 100Y (a year-long introductory course to the Russian language; this may also be fulfilled by taking the equivalent RES 120, an intensive single semester course), RES 221 and RES 222 (the combination of which is equivalent to second-year Russian), and RES 331 and RES 332 (the combination of which is equivalent to third-year Russian). Students who place into a higher level of Russian or another language, on the basis of existing knowledge, will consult with their advisor or Program Director on how best to fulfill the six-semester language instruction requirement. While six semesters of language instruction in Russian, as well as courses in other languages of the region, are normally offered at Smith or in the Five Colleges, students in the Language and Literature track are highly encouraged to enroll in a study abroad program (or comparable program in the United States). Credits earned in these language courses will count toward the fulfillment of the major requirements, while they may also provide the opportunity for students to achieve a higher proficiency in the language. ‚Ä¢ Four semester (4-credit) courses in literature or film, only one of which will normally be at the 100-level. Normally, one of these courses will be in nineteenth century literature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOV 223 Russian Politics</head><p>This course examines recurring issues facing the Russian state and its citizens: the complex interplay between formal institutions and informal politics, patterns of cooperation and antagonism in relationships with other countries, and the "resource curse." It also addresses the importance of public opinion in a hybrid political regime; the use of the Internet and the mass media; and human rights in contemporary Russia. It examines history to provide sufficient context, but will concentrate on the period between the end of the Soviet Union and the present day. Enrollment limit of 40. {S} Credits: 4 Alla N. Baranovsky Expected to be offered in the next 3 years HST 240 (C) Stalin and Stalinism Joseph Stalin created a particular type of society in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. Stalinism became a phenomenon that influenced the development of the former Soviet Union and the Communist movement worldwide. This course covers the period on the eve of and during the Russian Revolution, Stalinist transformation of the USSR in the 1930s, WWII and the onset of the Cold War. We consider several questions about Stalinism: Was it a result of Communist ideology or a deviation? Did it enjoy any social support? To what extent was it a product of larger social forces and in what degree was it shaped by Stalin's own personality? Did it have total control over the people's lives? Why hasn't there been a de-Stalinization similar to de-Nazification? How is Stalinism remembered? The course is a combination of lectures and class discussions. {H} Credits: 4 Serguei Glebov Expected to be offered in the next 3 years HST 241 (L) Soviet Union in the Cold War Focuses on the history of the Soviet Union during the "greater Cold War," that is, between World War II and the disintegration of the USSR.

This interdisciplinary course explores how Russian writers, filmmakers, and artists have represented the vast territory comprising Imperial Russia, the USSR, and the Russian Federation, from the Enlightenment to present. In addition to considering how artistic production has reflected and shaped understanding of the Russian "anthropocene," we will compare these works with cultural production of the Western tradition. The course also explores initiatives to legislate and transform the Russian environment, which often precipitated ecological and social disasters. Religion RES 242 The Russian Icon: Culture, Politics and the Sacred Same as REL 242. How can we explain the unique aura of the Russian icon? As devotional object, political symbol, and art commodity, the icon is revered as sacred, vilified as reactionary, and displayed and sold as masterpiece. This course examines the complex world of the Russian icon from its ancient Byzantine roots, to its modern branding as "other," and its recent recent reemergence in the turbulent public sphere of post-communist Russia. Topics include: the production and reception of icons; theology and visual "presence"; visuality and spirituality, religious seeing and visual practices; the secularization of the sacred; historical memory and national identity; modern art and film; visual warfare and contemporary protest movements.

Mills, the "sociological imagination" allows us "to grasp history and biography and the relations between the two within society." This course will help students develop their sociological imaginations by reading memoirs written by both U.S. and international authors who've published in English, and asking sociological questions of the stories being told. We will move beyond appreciation for the "troubles [that] occur within the character of the individual and within the range of [their] immediate relations with others" to a recognition and analysis of social facts, geo-political issues and social problems illuminated through these individual stories. Prerequisite: SOC 101. Enrollment limit of 20 (E) WI {H} {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department SOC 250 Theories of Society This course introduces majors to widely used theoretical perspectives that inform the sociological imagination.

But the processes governing media production and reception are often taken for granted, immersed as we are in a highly mediated social world where preconceived notions about "the media" and its effects hold sway. This class will challenge conventional wisdom about how media and communication technologies work by critically exploring the history of media institutions, assesing the media's powers of persuasion, focusing on media as an occupation, and examining the struggles over media representation by marginalized groups across traditional media and new digital platform.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cosmopolitanism</head><p>What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan person-a global citizen? Can one simultaneously construct one's identity in terms of one's nationality, gender, ethnicity and/or other more local forms of community and be truly cosmopolitan? If so, how? If not, which is the better approach? Is there one distinctive way of being cosmopolitan, or might there be varieties of cosmopolitanism arising in different cultural contexts, for instance, under colonial rule or conditions of exile? Is it self-evidently true that being a cosmopolitan person is a good thing, for an individual or a society? What are some of its challenges? We will read essays by Kant, Mill, Nussbaum, Rawls, Rorty, Naipaul, Said, Tagore, Gandhi, Appiah and others with a view to examining and assessing different answers that have been proposed to these and related questions.

Through the study of primary sources and some recent re-interpretations of historical events, the class reflects on how Latin American culture was shaped by the legacy of colonialism and the persistent struggle to leave it behind. Special attention is paid to the clashing interactions between the indigenous populations, creole elites in a conflicted dialogue with the cultures of Europe and North America, and Africans brought to the continent as slaves.

We will make reference in particular to films that portray experiences of loss, dealing with topics such as grief, memory and recovery. The class will study films dealing with both public and private loss, reflecting on the differences and similarities between the two. Films looking at losses that resulted from events that affected the whole nation turn their attention to those events. By contrast, films dealing with individual loss tend to privilege the characters' emotions. In both cases the focus on loss allows for reflections on identity, memory, and the future-reflections that blur the apparent boundary between the private and the public. Focusing mainly on films from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, students will reflect on the wider social significance of these films in reference to the context where they were made.

We study the Italian pinups of postwar cinema, the Latin lover figure, representations of Fascism, the Bel Paese myth, portraits of the lower classes and the immigrants. Directors include Amelio, Antonioni, Bertolucci, De Santis, De Sica, Germi, Moretti, Ozpetek, Pasolini, Sorrentino and Visconti. Conducted in English. Films with English subtitles.

We pay particular attention to several questions: in what contexts did modern African literature emerge? Is the term "African literature" a useful category? How do African writers challenge Western representations of Africa? How do they articulate the crisis of independence and postcoloniality? How do women writers reshape our understanding of gender and the politics of resistance? Writers include Chinua Achebe, Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele and Ama Ata Aidoo. We also watch and critique films such as Blood Diamond, District 9, Tsotsi and The Constant Gardener. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each fall CLT 266 Studies in South African Literature and Film Topics course. : 4 Members of the department Normally offered each spring FRN 230 Colloquium in French Studies Topics course.

Using texts such as Aim√© C√©saire's A Tempest, Rachel Ingalls' Mrs. Caliban, Lemuel Johnson's Highlife for Caliban, Gloria Naylor's Mama Day and Michelle Cliff's No Telephone to Heaven, we seek to understand how postcolonial, feminist and postmodern rewritings of The Tempest transpose its language and characters into critiques of colonialism, nationhood, race, gender and difference. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each academic yearModern South African Literature and Cinema A study of South African literature and film with a particular focus on adapta- tion of literary texts to the screen. We pay particular attention to texts and films in which violence-political, economic, psychical, xenophobic, homophobic etc.-is the main focus. For what purposes do South African filmmakers adapt canonical and contemporary texts, biographies and memoirs to the screen? How do these adaptations help us visualize the relationship between power and vio- lence in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa? How do race, class, gender, sexuality and ethnicity complicate how we define, conceptualize and critique racial, political and gender-based violence in South Africa? Texts and films may include Njabulo Ndebele's The Cry of Winnie Mandela, Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country, Andr√© Brink's A Dry White Season, Mahamo's The Last Grave at Dimbaza, John Wood's Biko (Cry Freedom), Anne Mare du Preez Bezdrob's Winnie Mandela: A Life (Winnie) and Athol Fugard's Tsotsi. We also study film classics such as The Voortrekkers, Zulu/Zulu Dawn and Sarafina as well as transcripts and footages of testimonies from the Truth and Reconcilia- tion Commission hearings.

Departing from ethnographic approaches that mask the identity of individual musicians and treat African societies as collectives, this course emphasizes the contributions of individual West African musicians whose stature as master musicians is undisputed within their respective communities. It examines the contributions of individual musicians in the ever continuous process of negotiating the boundaries and identities of African musical practice. Key subjects include the construction of the colonial state, African experiences with colonial rule, the dilemmas of decolonization and life in an independent Africa.</figDesc><table><row><cell>{H} {S} Credits: 4</cell></row><row><cell>Jeffrey S.

In addition to developing an historical understanding of the Khoisan and Bantu-speaking peoples, students must also know the history of Europeans and Asians of the region. The focus of this course is to understand the historical, cultural and economic inter-relationships between various ethnic groups, cultures and political forces which have evolved in Southern Africa since about 1600. {H} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years HST 234 (C) Global Africa This course interrogates how scholars have engaged the "transnational" and "global" in African history. In doing so, the course explores the complex networks of identities, loyalties, and attachments forged by diverse groups of African peoples in their attempts to live within and transcend the boundaries of the modern nation-state. As a result, over the course of the semester, the class will investigate issues of trade, nationality, citizenship, race, and identity as it queries the many ways in which Africans have shaped (and reshaped) their views of themselves and communities over seemingly vast distances in time and space. {H} Creditsthe Atlantic slave trade on West and Central Africa. {H} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years HST 258 (L) Modern Africa This course provides an introductory survey of African history under colonial rule and beyond.

In particular, we look at infrastructure and investment; health and education; trade; finance and markets; the choice of policy; and the effects of institutions, governance and politics. We also try to make sense of the differences and the similarities among the African politics, and introduces students to various theoretical and analytical approaches to the study of Africa's political development. Central themes include the ongoing processes of nation-building and democratization, the constitutional question, the international relations of Africa, issues of peace and security, and Africa's political economy.

In the ensuing Hellenistic (Greek-oriented) commonwealth that spanned the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia and India, Greco-Macedonians interacted with Egyptians, Babylonians, Jews, Iranians, Indians and Romans in ways that galvanized ideas and institutions such as the classical city as ideal community, cult of divine kings and queens, "fusion" literatures, mythologies and artistic canons and also provoked nativist responses such as the Maccabean revolt. Main topics include Greeks and "barbarians," Alexander and his legacies, Hellenism as ideal and practice, conquerors and natives, kings and cities/regions, Greek science and philosophies, old and new gods.

Through iterative and digital processes which engage light and air as their main references, students integrate drawing and making to construct and reconstruct lines in both virtual and physical space, and in two and three dimensions. Materialization of digital processes is tested through multiple full-scale, physical models. Through the act of making and remaking constructed lines, students oscillate between intuitive and critical modes of thinking, while further developing foundation level design skills including analytic drawing, digital fabrication, and issues relating to scale and site specificity.

For Homer and the poets who came after him it raised such questions as: What justifies going to war? What is the cost of combat and the price of glory? How does war affect men, women and children, winners and losers?

Food plays a central role in how we think of home-how do scents, spices, rituals, and preparations inform our sense of self and community? Studying selected works of fiction, film, oral history, and essays, we will explore the ways in which you, as well as refugees, migrants, immigrants, exiles, and √©migr√©s, understand and conceptualize home, belongig, and "otherness." {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FYS 101 The Lives of Animals: Literature and the Nonhuman In this course, we will track animals across a range of poems, stories, novels, essays, and films that try to imagine what it is like not to be human.

These fictions rework the classic patterns of "boys' books" to create heroic girls meant to inspire young female readers. We begin with two classic 19th-century boys' books to situate our readings of contemporary girls' adventures. We will focus on the structure of the girls' adventure landscape by creating maps and writing blog posts for each fiction asking questions such as: What significant boundaries do the fictions imagine? What gender and class ideas do they enforce? How do boy and girl heroes differ? What does a girl hero do? Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students.

In addition to considering how artistic production has reflected and shaped understanding of the Russian "anthropocene," we will compare these works with cultural production of the Western tradition. The course also explores initiatives to legislate and transform the Russian environment, which often precipitated ecological and social disasters.{H} {L} {S} Credits: 4 Thomas Lee Roberts Normally offered in alternate years CLT 215 Arthurian Legend Same as ENG 204. Medieval legends of Arthurian Britain as they developed in Wales, France, and England, and more recent retellings.

All readings in translation. {H} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 220 Colloquium: Imagining Language This course explores the ways in which philosophers and artists have imagined the links between language and the world. We read mostly pre-20th century theories of language-Plato's Cratylus, St. Augustine's On the Teacher, Locke on language from the Essay, Herder and Rousseau on The Origin of Language, Freud on jokes-and link them to novels, poems and other artwork by (mostly) 20th-century artists such as Louis Zukofsky, May Swenson, Lewis Carroll, Richard Powers, Xu Bing, Russell Hoban and others who focus on the materiality of language, on words as things. Readings are accompanied by weekly exercises such as rebuses, invented etymologies, alphabet poems, portmanteau words, emoticons and so on. {L} Credits: 4 Margaret Bruzelius Normally offered each fall ENG 224 Frankenstein: The Making of a Monster At the age of 19, Mary Shelley began writing the first science fiction novel.Frankenstein not only describes fears about monstrosity and accelerating technology; it also sets the stage for continuing discussions about gender, reproduction, race, ethics, and disability. To celebrate this groundbreaking novel's 200th anniversary, this co-taught class will explore the making of the text, alongside its monstrous legacy in contemporary culture. We will look at the novel's influences and afterlives -from the Frankenstein collection in Smith's rare book room to a range of films, electronic novels, and comics that reveal the enduring role of gothic monstrosity today. Meets on alternating days at Smith and Amherst College.Enrollment limit of 36. (E) {L} Credits: 4 Lily Gurton-Wachter Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 230 "Unnatural" Women: Mothers Who Kill their Children Some cultures give the murdering mother a central place in myth and literature while others treat the subject as taboo. How is such a woman depicted-as monster, lunatic, victim, savior? What do the motives attributed to her reveal about a society's assumptions and values? What difference does it make if the author is a woman? We focus on literary texts but also consider representations in other media, especially cinema. Authors to be studied include Euripides, Seneca, Ovid, Anouilh, Christa Wolff, Christopher Durang, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and others. {L} Credits: 4 Thalia A. Pandiri Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 232 Modern Chinese Literature Same as EAL 232. Can literature inspire personal and social transformation?

Readings are in English translation and no background in China or Chinese is required. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each fall CLT 242 What and Where Is Main Street? Where is Main Street? What times, spaces or places does the expression conjure? Are there equivalent concepts and places in other cultures? What are the aesthetics, the life and livelihoods, the politics that we associate with it? How are images and the concept manipulated to affect us, in the arts, in environmental issues, and in public discourse? When do we treasure this landscape, and when do we flee it? We begin by looking at American Main Streets, and then explore related concepts in British, French, German and Russian texts and other media. Prerequisite: one course in literary studies. {L} Credits: 4 Ann Leone Expected to be offered in the next 3 years ENG 249 Literatures of the Black Atlantic Visiting the pulpits, meeting houses and gallows of British North America to the colonial West Indies and docks of Liverpool to the modern day Caribbean, U.S., Canada, U.K. and France, this course analyzes the literatures of the Black Atlantic and the development of black literary and intellectual history from the 18th to the 21st century. Some key theoretical frameworks, which help inform our study of literature emerging from the Black Atlantic, include diaspora, transnationalism, internationalism and cosmopolitanism. Readings range from early African diasporic sermons, dying words, poetry, captivity and slave narratives to newspapers, essays, novels, drama and film. {L} Credits: 4 Andrea Stephanie Stone Expected to be offered in the next 3 yearsCLT 253 Literary EcologyLiterary ecology focuses on bio-social themes in literature-how human beings construct their relationship to their environment through literature and landscape art. We read works by "nature writers," from the Romantic poets to early ecologists like John Muir and John Burroughs, and by contemporary writers such as John McPhee and Annie Dillard. We also analyze issues of contemporary eco-criticism and consider an expansion of the current range of canonical texts to include a broader diversity of viewpoints. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 255 What Makes a Tale Worth Telling: Reading the 19th-Century Story Same as ENG 255. How did the modern short story emerge-why, where, when? What is its relation to other forms of short fiction-the Italian novella or the German novella or the fairy tale? Why are they often so elaborately framed, with their kernel presented as a kind of oral performance; a story told by one Character to another? Why do they so often rely on the fantastic and the unlikely-and how, by the End of the century, did the story come to concentrate instead on the mundane and the ordinary? What, in short, makes a tale worth telling? Readings in Goethe, Hoffman, Hawthorne, Gogol, Turgenev, Maupassant, Verga, Kipling, Chekhov, Jewett and others. {L} Credits: 4 Michael E. Gorra Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 260 Health and Illness: Literary Explorations How do languages, social norms and economic contexts shape experiences of health and illness? How do conceptions of selfhood, sexuality, belonging and spirituality inform ideas about well-being, disease, intervention and healing? This cross-cultural literary inquiry into bodily and emotional experiences also explore Western biomedical and traditional Chinese diagnosis and treatment practices. From despair and chronic pain to cancer, aging and death, how do sufferers and their caregivers adapt in the face of infirmity or trauma? Our study also considers how stories and other genres can help develop resilience, compassion and hope. Enrollment limited to 19. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years SPN 260 Latin American Cultural History Topics course. May be repeated with a different topic. Normally offered both fall and spring semesters.Decolonizing Latin American LiteratureThis course offers critical perspectives on colonialism, literatures of conquest and narratives of cultural resistance in the Americas and the Caribbean. Decolonial theories of violence, writing and representation in the colonial context inform the study of literary and cultural production of this period. Readings explore several themes including indigenous knowledge, land and the natural world; orality, literacy and visual cultures; race, rebellion and liberation; slavery, piracy and power, and the coloniality of gender. Prerequisite: SPN 220 or equivalent. Enrollment limited to 19. {F} {H} {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 266 Studies in South African Literature and Film Topics course. -political, economic, psychical, xenophobic, homophobic etc.-is the main focus. For what purposes do South African filmmakers adapt canonical and contemporary texts, biographies and memoirs to the screen? How do these adaptations help us visualize the relationship between power and violence in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa? How do race, class, gender, sexuality and ethnicity complicate how we define, conceptualize and critique racial, political and gender-based violence in South Africa? Texts and films may include Njabulo Ndebele's The Cry of Winnie Mandela, Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country, Andr√© Brink's A Dry White Season, Mahamo's The Last Grave at Dimbaza, John Wood's Biko (Cry Freedom), Anne Mare du Preez Bezdrob's Winnie Mandela: A Life (Winnie) and Athol Fugard's Tsotsi.

(E) {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each springCLT 271 Writing in Translation: Bilingualism in the Postcolonial Novel A study of bilingualism as a legacy of colonialism, as an expression of exile, and as a means of political and artistic transformation in recent texts from Africa and the Americas. We consider how such writers as Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o (Kenya), Assia Djebar (Algeria), Patrick Chamoiseau (Martinique) and Edwidge Danticat (Haiti/U.S.) assess the personal and political consequences of writing in the language of a former colonial power, and how they attempt to capture the esthetic and cultural tensions of bilingualism in their work. {L} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 273 Cosmic Cold War: Russian and Western Science Fiction in Political Context Same as RES 273. How did the "final frontier" of space become a "front" in the Cold War? As the US and USSR competed in the Space Race, science fiction reflected political discourses in literature, film, visual art, and popular culture. This course explores Russian and Western science fiction in the contexts of twentieth-century geopolitics and artistic modernism (and postmodernism), examining works by Bogdanov, Kubrick, Tarkovsky, Butler, Haraway, Pelevin, and others. The survey considers science fiction's utopian content and political function, as well as critical and dystopian modes of the genre. No prerequisites or knowledge of Russian required; first-year students are welcome to enroll. {A} {H} {L} Credits: 4 Thomas Lee Roberts Expected to be offered in the next 3 years RES 275 Avant-Garde as Lifestyle: Cinema and Socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Explores the avant-garde film traditions of Eastern and Central Europe, including works from the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The course focuses on how avant-garde filmmakers engaged with the socialist project in the USSR and Eastern Bloc, and its call for new forms, sites, and life practices. We will investigate how avant-garde cinema represents everyday life amidst the public and private spaces of socialism. In approaching the relationship between cinema and space, we will consider examples of architecture (Constructivist, Functionalist, Brutalist), as well as theoretical writings by and about the avant-garde. Conducted in English, no prerequisites. {A} {H} {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years CLT 277 Jewish Fiction What is the relationship between the homeless imagination and imagined homecomings, political upheaval and artistic revolution, the particularity of national experience and the universality of the Jew? Focuses on four masters of the 20th-century short story and novel: Franz Kafka's enigmatic narratives of modern alienation; Isaac Babel's bloody tales of Revolution; Isaac Bashevis Singer's Yiddish demons and Nobel prize laureate S. Y. Agnon's neo-religious parables of loss and redemption.

Enrollment limited to 25. {L} Credits: 4 Anna Botta Normally offered each fallCLT 330 Capstone Seminar in Translation StudiesSame as TSX 330. The capstone seminar brings together a cohort of concentrators to discuss the final translation project that each student undertakes with the guidance of their adviser in the concentration and to situate the project within the framework of larger questions that the work of translation elicits. The seminar readings focus on renowned practitioners' reflections on the difficulties and complexities of translating, the obstacles, discoveries and solutions that the translator encounters. We read a series of essays that engage with the conflicting interpretations and nuances of translations in 14 languages of Ferdinand Oyono's iconic 1956 African novel, Une vie de boy. We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Open to students in the Concentration in Translation Studies and students in comparative literature. Enrollment limit of 12 students. Prerequisite: CLT 150. {L} Credits: 4Comparative Literature in the Age of CosmopolitanismsThe concept of cosmopolitanism has recently gone through a process of democratization. Dismissing the singular "cosmopolitanism" as a form of Eurocentric universalism, critics today study a plurality of cosmopolitanisms, focusing on transnational experiences, both elite and subaltern, Western and non-Western. How can we study comparative literature within this new framework? If the Western canon is no longer setting the standards, what are the new aesthetic POR 381 Seminar in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies Topics course. Normally offered each spring. This course addresses diverse modes of representing nature and the environment in Brazil, from the pre-colonial period to the present. Drawing upon visual arts, film, poetry, fiction and non-fiction, we will consider mytho-poetic accounts of the creation of the land, colonial accounts of flora, fauna and plantation agriculture, 19th-century scientific expeditions, Romantic and Modernist associations of nature and national identity, rural social movements and ideas of rural authenticity, and global orientations of contemporary "earth art" and "ecopoetry." Deepening our understanding of the diversity of Brazilian landscapes and ecologies and historical forces that have shaped them, we will consider ways in which gender, class, ethnicity and ideology are implicated in different paradigms of environmental representation.

Q {N} {S} Credits: 4 Decoding the Experts: Modeling the Impact of Climate Change The U.S. estimates the cost of carbon is $37/ton. Is this estimate too low? Too high? What will emission reductions cost? This course is a cooperative research effort to understand and evaluate the Integrated Assessment Models used to estimate the costs and benefits of carbon emission reductions. We begin with the IPCC predictions of the physical impacts of climate change and then turn to the economic models that translate physical predictions into cost estimates. Emphasis on understanding and critiquing the logic of the models and learning how differing assumptions translate into a wide range of reported estimates. course emphasizes careful assessment of both message and audience to design effective communication strategies for complex topics. Students develop the ability to read, interpret, and critique environmental research from a variety of disciplines; to consider the needs and motivation of their audience; to develop evidence-based arguments tailored to a particular audience; and to articulate those arguments clearly and concisely. Prerequisite: one semester of statistics. 101 and 201/202 are strongly recommended. Enrollment limited to 25. Natural Resource Management and Environmental Justice in the US and the Global South This course will examine the connections between natural resource management and environmental justice in the US and the Global South. We will study the benefits and limits of traditional top-down approaches to the management of forests, land, fisheries, biodiversity, underground resources, water, food, and genomes in different parts of the world. By discussing case studies of environmental justice issues from tar sands mining in Alberta to the impact of biofuels and GMOs on local populations in Mexico, students will question and rethink the management of natural resources.

In the service of this urgent, impossible ambition, documentarians have used myriad forms of media and produced some of each form's most complex works. This course examines how they have done so, concentrating on different approaches to documentary(observational, ethnographic, essayistic,  autobiographical), and considering work in photography, film, television, radio/ podcasts, websites and virtual reality. Throughout the semester, we interrogate the boundaries of the documentary mode; the unique ethical considerations of doing documentary work; and the social, cultural and technological factors that shape documentary's history and current practice. {A} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 yearsFMS 241 Screwball ComedyClassic screwball comedies were produced in a 10-year period from Capra's ItHappened One Night (1934)  to Sturges' Miracle at</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

How are Westerns reflective and symptomatic of vital issues in United States history and culture? How does the genre help shape and define how Americans think of themselves? How did the genre change over the post-war period, and what does this tell us about the changing needs, ideas, and ideologies of both American filmmaking and the United States itself? We consider the classical films of John Ford and the revisionist work of Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman, as well as other canonical Westerns, considering the way they were used to think through historical and cultural events like the Red Scare, Civil Rights and the development of a more robust Queer Public Sphere. We also consider more recent developments and changes in the genre as produced by Reagan's tenure as the Cowboy President (including US foreign policy in Latin America) and, currently, shifts in the genre affected by digital technology and the Age of New Film and Media Studies 221 symptomatic of as well as influential on historical periods, major events and social movements, and the ways in which film genres evolve in relation to both cultural change and the rise and fall of the Hollywood studio system. Among the questions we'll consider: How did the Depression have an impact on Hollywood film style and form? How were evolving ideas about American motherhood puzzled out in American cinema of the period? What were some of the important differences between the way mainstream U.S. cinema and European film represented World War II? How did Civil Rights and the Red Scare become appropriate topics for Westerns? Did the lighthearted veneer of the fluffy sex comedies of the sixties actually hide some serious questions about labor, independent female subjectivity and heteronormativity? Particular and sustained attention will be paid to relations among gender, genre, race and class. {A} {L} Credits: 4 and new media modes; and 3) how women as stars, writers, producers, and directors shape and respond to, work within and against, dominant considerations of how women look (in every sense). {A} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 yearsFMS 249 Queer Cinema/Queer Media From the queer avant-garde of Kenneth Anger and Su Friedrich, to The Kids Are All Right and Glee, the queer in film and television is often conflated with gay and lesbian representation on screen. Instead of collapsing queer cinema into a representational politics of gay and lesbian film and television, we look at theories and practices that uphold what queerness means in a contemporary framework of America neoliberalism and transnational media. Screenings include the New Queer Cinema classics Paris Is Burning, It Wasn't Love and Poison, and work by multimedia artists including Shu Lea Cheang, Issac Julien, Carmelita Tropicana and PJ Raval. Readings by Alexander Doty, Thomas Elsaesser, Kobena Mercer, Jasbir Puar, B. Ruby Rich, J. Halberstam, Jose E. Munoz, Chris Straayer and Hayden White. {A} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 yearsFMS 250 Global Cinema After World War IIThe post-war period was a time of increasing globalization, which brought about a more interconnected and international film culture. But it was also a time during which certain key national cinemas defined, or redefined, themselves. This course examines both trends, as well as focuses on the work and influence of significant directors and landmark films, emphasizing not only cinematic and cultural specificity, but also cross-cultural, and transhistorical concerns. What makes a film Italian or Brazilian or British? How does national identity help shape any country's cinema, and how do films help shape national Italian Neo-realism, French New Wave, New German Cinema, Brazilian Cinema Novo, Chinese Fifth Generation, Hong Kong Action Cinema, and the films of Ousmane Sembene, Thomas Gutierrez Al√©a, Satyajit Ray, Akira Kurosawa, Julie Dash and Spike Lee. Satisfies the media histories requirement for the film and media studies major. {A} Credits: 4 Alexandra Linden Miller Keller Expected to be offered in the next 3 years FMS 260 Digital Media and Participatory Culture Among the claims made for the newness of new media is the assertion that new media are interactive, turning the passive consumers of "old" media into active, engaged participants. This course explores the shape of this technologicallyenabled "participatory culture" and will also investigate cracks in the foundation of the alleged digital utopia. To what extent are new technologies democratizing and to what extent do they offer new forms of surveillance and control to the powers that be? What social and economic factors govern "convergence culture?" How have fan cultures evolved as their material networks of conventions and zines go digital? {A} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 yearsFMS 261 Video Games and the Politics of PlayAn estimated 63% of U.S. households have members who play video games regularly, and game sales routinely exceed film box office figures. As this medium grows in cultural power, it is increasingly important to think about how games make meaning. This course serves as an introduction to Game Studies, equipping students with the vocabulary to analyze video games, surveying the medium's genres, and sampling this scholarly discipline's most influential theoretical writing. The particular focus, though, is on the ideology operating beneath the surface of these popular entertainment objects and on the ways in which video games enter political discourse. Enrollment limit of 30. Film in the Digital Age Film, a dominant entertainment form in the twentieth century, faces sweeping changes in the twenty-first. Digital technologies are widely replacing film cameras and projectors, theatrical exhibition continues to decline as audiences watch movies on smaller and smaller screens, and the list of other entertainment forms competing for the public's attention grows longer each year. Appropriating Peter Greenaway's provocation, "Cinema is dead, long live cinema," this course will consider the challenge digital media present to film's primacy, but also the ways in which film has survived and thrived during this and previous periods of dramatic technological change. Prerequisite: FMS 150.FMS 280 Introduction to Video ProductionThis course will provide a foundation in the principles, techniques, and equipment involved in making short videos, including: development of a viable story idea or concept, aesthetics and mechanics of shooting video, the role of sound and successful audio recording, and the conceptual and technical underpinnings of digital editing. You will make several short pieces through the semester, working towards a longer final piece. Along with projects and screenings, there will be reading assignments and writing exercises.

How and when is the idea of nation a counterproductive way to think about cinema? How do ideas of history and self inform cinema, and vice versa?

In other words, what are the broad approaches scholars have taken to the study of media, and what specific methodological strategies have proved most effective? We begin with theory as one such method-one that zooms out to ask broad questions about the essential nature of a medium. Our history unit shifts the focus to how media are impacted by and implicated in the progression of time and culture. Finally, our criticism unit features strategies for analyzing individual media objects. Prerequisite: FMS 150. How are cultural attitudes toward violence and death reflected in and shaped by films?

How did the concept of the foreigner evolve as confrontations with other nations, other religions, other ethnicities put into question France's conception of its own society and culture? We examine a range of texts (treatises, pamphlets, novels, theatre, ballet h√©ro√Øque) in which "otherness" and foreignness is explored.

What were the moral dilemmas and the political risks that Parisians faced as they struggled to survive? And how are we, today, to judge this historical period and those who lived through it? Students experience this difficult period through a global simulation in which each creates a character with a specific identity and past-a secret collaborator, a Jewish immigrant, a resistance fighter, a closeted homosexual, an avant-garde artist, a reporter, the widow of a soldier who fought under Mar√©chal P√©tain in WWI-and representing the diversity of the Parisian population at the time. Each student writes her character's "memoirs" reacting to historical as well as personal events from her unique perspective.

We examine the relationship between mythology, archaeology and historical memory, the evolution of the city-state, games and oracles, colonization, warfare and tyranny, city-states Sparta and Athens and their respective pursuits of social justice, wars with Persia, cultural interactions with non-Greeks, Athens' naval empire and its invention of Democracy, family and women, and traditional religions and forms of new wisdom, and the trial and death of Socrates in 399 B.C. Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic World The career and conquests of Alexander the Great (d. 323 B.C.) wrought farreaching consequences for many in Europe, Asia and Africa. In the ensuing Hellenistic (Greek-oriented) commonwealth that spanned the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia and India, Greco-Macedonians interacted with Egyptians, Babylonians, Jews, Iranians, Indians and Romans in ways that galvanized ideas and institutions such as the classical city as ideal community, cult of divine kings and queens, "fusion" literatures, mythologies and artistic canons and also provoked nativist responses such as the Maccabean revolt. Main topics include Greeks and "barbarians," Alexander and his legacies, Hellenism as ideal and practice, conquerors and natives, kings and cities/regions, Greek science and philosophies, old and new gods. This course provides context for understanding early Christianity, Judaism and the rise of Rome. Monarchy to the end of the Republic, including the Struggle of the Orders, conquests and citizenship, wars with Carthage, encounters with local cultures in North Africa, Gaul and the Greek East, challenges of expansion and empire, rich versus poor, political corruption, and the Civil Wars of the Late Republic.

With Emperor Augustus, the traditional Republican form of rule was reshaped to accommodate the personal rule of an Emperor that governed a multiethnic empire of 50 million successfully for several centuries. Imperial Rome represents the paradigmatic classical empire that many later empires sought to emulate. We trace how this complex imperial society evolved to meet different challenges. Topics include: the emperor and historical writings, corruption of power, bread and circuses, assimilation and revolts, the Jewish war, universal and local religions, early Christianity, Late Antiquity, migrations and the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. This course offers context for understanding the history of Christianity, Judaism and the early Middle Ages.Rome, Late Antiquity, and The Decline and Fall of the Roman EmpireThis course investigates the many-layered levels of the city of Rome's complex history and cultures from its origins to the seventh century, focusing especially on the period of the Antonines in the second century and ending in the late seventh century. Special attention will be given to the social, cultural, and political history of Rome, the era of Constantine and his "New Rome," the catastrophes and triumphs of the late Roman empire, paupers, emperors and kings, bishops and popes, myths, legacies, and deep secrets.(E) {H} Credits: 4 Members of the department Slaves and Slavery in the Ancient World Slaves comprised up to a third of the population in Classical Athens and Rome and slavery was deeply embedded in every aspect of ancient life. We examine how slaves and slavery shaped Greece and Rome in comparison with other "slave societies" and in their own terms. Topics include debt and slavery, race and ethnicities of slaves, slave management and economy, sex trade, treatment of slaves, gladiators, slave revolts, daily resistance, representations of slaves in art and literature, slave narratives, slavery in ancient philosophy and religion, and shift from classical slavery to medieval serfdom.

From the hope of liberty and equality to the exclusion of marginalized groups that made whiteness, maleness and native birth synonymous with Americanness. How African Americans, Native Americans, immigrants and women harnessed the Declaration of Independence and its ideology to define themselves as citizens of the United States. {H} Credits: 4 Survey of the major economic, political and social changes of this period, primarily through the lens of race, class and gender, to understand the role of ordinary people in shaping defining events, including industrial capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, mass immigration and migration, urbanization, the rise of mass culture, nationalism, war, feminism, labor radicalism, civil rights and other liberatory movements for social justice. {H} Credits: 4 This course examines the primary documents and contentious historical debates surrounding the import of slave resistance, primarily in the American South.

While becoming familiar with the existing narratives about lesbian/queer lives, students are introduced to the method of oral history as a key documentation strategy in the production of lesbian history. What are the gaps in the literature and how can oral history assist in filling in the spaces? What does a historical narrative that privileges categories of gender and sexuality look like? And how do we need to adapt our research methods, including oral history, in order to talk about lesbian/queer lives? Our texts include secondary literature on 20thcentury lesbian cultures and communities, oral history theory and methodology, and primary sources from the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC). There are no specific disciplinary prerequisites, but the course is wellsuited for juniors and seniors with a background in History or East Asian Studies. Although the course focuses on East Asia, students are welcome to research other theaters of the war. {H} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years</figDesc><table><row><cell>History</cell></row><row><cell>HST 343 Seminar: Problems In World History HST 265 (L) Members of the department Topics course.</cell></row><row><cell>Normally offered each fall</cell></row><row><cell>HST 266 (L) Emancipation and the Afterlife of Slavery Examines the longevity of the U.S. Civil War in historical memory, as a pivotal period in the development of American racism and African American activism.

Yet the central historiographical question remains: why didn't U.S. slaves overthrow enslavement like Haitian slaves did on Santo Domingo? Enslaved people challenged slavery in a variety of ways including violence, revolts, maroon communities, truancy, passing, suicide and day-to-day resistance.

For more information on the Hebrew program, or if you have a question about language placement, please contact Joanna Caravita. The Bible and the American Public Square We examine what the Bible (and to some extent the broader Jewish and Christian traditions) have to say about controversial issues that have divided Americans in the past (e.g., slavery) and present (e.g., abortion). The aim is to give students the skills to assess critically various arguments that invoke the Bible or religious tradition and authority, wherever they come from on the political spectrum. Students are introduced to the Bible and biblical scholarship, as well as learn about different understandings of biblical authority and views of applying the Bible to contemporary political and ethical debates. This course counts toward the Jewish studies and religion majors. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI {H} {L} Credits: 4 Many biblical texts question whether God consistently rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked. Prominent examples include Job, Ecclesiastes and certain Psalms, but similar ideas occur in the Torah and the Prophets. While focusing most deeply on Job, this course introduces students to an array of biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, as well as some post-biblical and even modern literature, to illuminate the Hebrew Bible's discourse surrounding this issue. {H} {L}REL 223 The Modern Jewish ExperienceA thematic survey of Jewish history and thought from the 16th century to the present, examining Jews as a minority in modern Europe and in global diaspora.

What does the particular constellation of material that we call "My Music" tell us about who we are, where we come from, and how we relate to the world? After analyzing and comparing musical lives within the class, we will read selected case studies and collaboratively design a musical biography project. Each student will curate one person's musical life story, gathering data through oneon-one interviews, weaving together their interlocutor's words with their own interpretations, and ultimately reflecting on what they have learned from the experience. Enrollment limited to 16 first-year students. WI Credits: 4 Margaret Sarkissian Expected to be offered in the next 3 years MUS 101 Introduction to World Music Music may not be a "universal language," but it is a universal phenomenon; every culture has something that we recognize as music. This course introduces you to a number of musical systems-traditional, classical and popular-from around the world and uses case studies to explore the complex relationships between music and culture. By engaging with music analytically, as musicologists (paying attention to the sounds you hear) and ethnographically, as anthropologists (paying attention to the cultural context), you learn basic principles that enhance your understanding of music globally speaking. No prerequisites. {A} {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered each academic yearMUS 102 First NightsThis course serves as an introduction to the history of Western music by studying in detail the first performances of a small number of singularly important works in the Western tradition including Orfeo (Monteverdi), Messiah (Handel), the Ninth Symphony (Beethoven), the Symphonie fantastique (Berlioz), and Le Sacre du printemps (Stravinsky). Using Thomas Kelly's textbook First Nights (which treats these five compositions), we analyze musical monuments as aesthetic objects and consider their relation to such issues as exoticism, politics and religious belief, as well as the status of this canon in the early 21st century. {A} {H} Credits: 4</figDesc><table><row><cell>Andrea Moore</cell></row><row><cell>Normally offered each fall</cell></row><row><cell>MUS 105 Roll Over Beethoven: A History of Rock</cell></row><row><cell>This course provides a critical survey of rock music, tracing the music's develop-</cell></row><row><cell>ment from blues and blackface minstrelsy to heavy metal, grunge, and techno.</cell></row><row><cell>Emphasis throughout is placed upon understanding musical developments in</cell></row><row><cell>the context of American race and gender relations and the politics of youth cul-</cell></row><row><cell>tures in the U.S. Topics to be covered include: Elvis Presley and American race</cell></row><row><cell>relations; Jimi Hendrix and the blues; girl groups; the rise of arena rock; and the</cell></row><row><cell>significance of the DJ in hip hop.

Yet the rebellion that rock and other popular music styles like rap have offered has often been more available to men than women. Similarly, the sexual liberation associated with popular music in the rock and rap eras has been far more open to "straight" desires over "queer." This course will examine how popular music from the 1950s to the present has been shaped by gender and sexuality, and the extent to which the music and its associated cultural practices have allowed artists and audiences to challenge gender and sexual norms, or alternately have served to reinforce those norms albeit with loud guitars and a heavy beat.

This course probes the intersections of music and theatre through a survey of genres, works, artists, and practitioners.

Music is a complex issue in many Islamic societies. There are tensions between those who believe that music has no place in Islam and try to prohibit it, those for whom it is a central component of mystical devotion, and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music, a core part of the self-identification of young people everywhere. Despite this, there is an amazing variety of vibrant popular music throughout the Islamic world.

Prerequisite: LOG 100, MTH 153, or the equivalent. {M} Credits: 4PHI 108 The Meaning of Life Same as REL 108. This course asks the big question, "What is the Meaning of Life?" and explores a range of answers offered by philosophers and religious thinkers from a host of different traditions in different eras of human history. We explore a variety of forms of philosophical and religious thinking and consider the ways in which philosophical and religious thinking can be directly relevant to our own lives. {H} {L} Credits: 4 An introduction to the six classical schools of Indian philosophy. What are their views on the nature of self, mind and reality? What is knowledge and how is it acquired? What constitutes right action? We will read selections from the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Nyaya and Yoga Sutras, and the Samkhya-Karika, amongst others. At the end of the semester we will briefly consider the relation of these ancient traditions to the views of some influential modern Indian thinkers like Aurobindo, Vivekananda and Krishnamurti. Comparisons with positions in the western philosophical tradition will be an integral part of the course. {H} Credits: 4 Nalini Bhushan Normally offered in alternate yearsPHI 200 Philosophy ColloquiumIntensive practice in writing and discussing philosophy and in applying philosophical methods to key problems raised in essays written by members of the philosophy department.

Minors are encouraged but not required to take the class. Prerequisite: Two college courses in philosophy, one of which may be taken concurrently, or permission of the instructor. WI Credits: 4 Nalini Bhushan Normally offered each spring PHI 204 Philosophy and Design Design is one of the most pervasive human activities. Its effects-intended or unintended-permeate our lives. Questions abound about the role of design and the significance of being able to exercise it and of being subject to it. For example: Are there particular pleasures, as well as special responsibilities, characteristic of designing? What is the nature of deprivation imposed upon people when they lack the opportunity or the knowledge to share in the design of their living or working conditions? How much control do designers actually have over the meaning and use of what they design? {S} Credits: 4 Speciesism is the view that human beings have an inherent right to dominate non-human species and use them for human ends. The course examines critics as well as proponents of the morality of speciesism. It involves synthesizing disparate areas in philosophy (ethics, philosophical psychology, philosophy of science) and applying them to the use of non-humans in areas such as agriculture, biology, psychology and medicine. Enrollment limited to 20. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Expected to be offered in the next 3 years PHI 213 Language Acquisition Same as PSY 213.

A wide variety of approaches to resolving fundamental mathematical and semantical paradoxes have emerged in the wake of these results, as well as a variety of alternative logics including paraconsistent logics in which Philosophy 319 contradictions are tolerated. This course examines logical and semantic paradoxes and their philosophical significance, as well as the choice between accepting incompleteness and inconsistency in logic and knowledge. Prerequisite: one course in logic. {M} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate yearsPHI 221 Ethics and SocietyThis course surveys current topics in applied ethics. It introduces the major sources of moral theory from religious and secular sources, and show how these theories are applied.DesireFor many philosophical and religious thinkers, desire has been a source of some anxiety: depicted as being by their very nature powerful and insatiable, desires appear to weaken people's capacities to control themselves and at the same time to open up opportunities for other people to control them. Focusing especially on the importance of desire to a consumer society, we examine questions such as: Is it possible to make a clear distinction between need and desire? To what extent are desires plastic, pliable, amenable to reshaping? Are we in any sense responsible for our desires? {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years PHI 236 Linguistic Structures Introduction to the issues and methods of modern linguistics, including morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology and pragmatics.

The case-study method is used. Not open to first-year students.Philosophical Explorations of Humor and LaughterThis seminar focuses on philosophical accounts of some of the ethical, social and political issues raised by humor and laughter. Humor can be a forceful instrument, often deployed by the powerful in their attempts to control the powerless and by the powerless to topple the powerful. Humor tends to operate in such a way as to include some and exclude others. Its effects, intended or unintended, can be benign or hurtful. Closely examining texts from a variety of philosophical perspectives, we will explore questions such as: What have been the hopes for, and worries about, what humor achieves? Who has taken it upon themselves to offer instructions about the proper objects of and occasions for humor and laughter? What reasons have they given for doing so?</figDesc><table><row><cell>Philosophy 320</cell><cell>317 Philosophy</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Philosophy</cell></row><row><cell>Maryjane Wraga</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Normally offered in alternate years</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>PSY 314 Seminar in Foundations of Behavior Topics course.

The basis for the French studies major: FRN 230; 2. One language course at the advanced level (270, 385, or equivalent taken abroad); 3. One course on literature or culture before 1900; 4. Three additional 4-credit courses in French studies at the 300 level or higher, of which two must be taken in the senior year.</p><p>In consultation with her major adviser, a student may count toward the major up to two 4-credit courses taught in English provided they are related to French studies, and up to two 4-credit courses in fields unrelated to French studies provided they are taught in French.</p><p>All students are encouraged to fulfill requirement #3. It will be in effect beginning with the class of 2020.</p><p>No more than one course counting toward the major may be taken for an S/U grade. Students considering graduate school in the humanities are encouraged to take CLT 300 Foundations of Contemporary Literary Theory and Literary Practice: Conflicts and Consensus. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conflict and Cooperation in Asia</head><p>The seminar identifies and analyzes the sources and patterns of conflict and cooperation among Asian states and between Asian and Western countries in the contemporary period. The course concludes by evaluating prospects for current efforts to create a new "Asia Pacific Community." Permission of the instructor is required. Beginning with the work of John Rawls and his critics, we move to examine the debates raised by Rawls in the works of other authors who take seriously his idea of building a just society for all. Special attention is paid to the politics of inclusion for groups based on race, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity as their claims for rights/justice/inclusion present challenges to our rhetorical commitment to build a just and fair society for all. Successful completion of 100 or another political theory course is strongly suggested. {S} Credits: 4 Members of the department Normally offered in alternate years Advisers: Same as those listed for the major</p><p>The minor comprises five semester courses. At least three of these courses must be related chronologically, geographically, methodologically or thematically. At least three of the courses will normally be taken at Smith. Students should consult their advisers.</p><p>The S/U grading option is not allowed for courses counting toward the minor. History courses at the 100-and 200-level are open to all students unless otherwise indicated. Admission to seminars (300-level) assumes prior preparation in the field and is by permission of the instructor. 100-level and 200-level History courses are designated as either Lectures (L) or Colloquia (C). History Lecture classes are typically capped at 40 students while History colloquia have a limit of 18.</p><p>A reading knowledge of foreign languages is highly desirable and is especially recommended for students planning a major in history.

It addresses questions concerning how languages diversify, and what the connections are among them. It also asks: What do humans know when they know a language? The minor allows students to explore some of these questions, making it a useful conjunction to several majors, for example in a language, or philosophy, education, logic, psychology, computer science or anthropology. An alternative minor in linguistics and philosophy of language is listed under philosophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements:</head><p>Six courses in linguistics and related fields. 1. Basis: PHI 236 Linguistics Structures (or its equivalent at the Five Colleges e.g. LING 201 at UMass.) 2. Four linguistics-related courses (see list below).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Concentration</head><p>Four courses in an area of concentration, one of which is an upper-level capstone (300-level seminar or research-based special studies-MES 400 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Electives</head><p>Four elective courses, of which at least three must be in areas other than the student's concentration. Advanced study of a Middle Eastern language may count towards the elective courses (16 credits).</p><p>Additional Guidelines:</p><p>1. All courses taken for major credit shall be drawn from courses listed or crosslisted by the Program in Middle Eastern Studies. Any First-Year Seminar cross-listed in MES may count towards the major. 2. Students will take at least one course with a primary focus on the Middle East beyond the Arab world (Iran, Israel, Turkey) in the fulfillment of major requirements. 3. Courses in the major may not be taken S/U. 4. Capstone: Majors must take one 300-level seminar or research based MES 400 special studies course in their field of concentration. When MES 400 functions as the capstone for the major it must be a research intensive course approved as the capstone by the major adviser. 5. No more than four courses in the major may be applied toward a double major. 6. Language study beyond the requirements of the major in Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, or Turkish at Smith or within the Five Colleges is strongly encouraged. Students may apply to the Middle East Studies Committee for funding of summer language study (e, g., Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, Turkish). In addition, courses in Arabic dialects offered by any of the Five Colleges or by the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages may be applied toward the major, with approval of the student's adviser. If a course offered by the FCCSWL is worth less than 4 credits, students will be expected to make up the credit shortfall through supplemental language instruction. Participation in study abroad programs offering intensive language instruction may count toward the MES major language requirement, on approval of the student's adviser. 7. Students proficient in Modern Standard Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi or Turkish may take a placement exam in lieu of coursework. Students who place out of the MES major language requirement are expected to make up 8 credits of coursework through electives or the study of a second, approved regional language. 8. Normally, at least half of a student's courses towards the major shall be taken at Smith. Students who study abroad may petition the Program in Middle East Studies should they seek credit toward the major of non-Smith courses that exceed half of those required by the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>The Program in Middle East studies encourages students to explore study abroad opportunities which allow them to deepen their understanding of Middle Eastern languages, history and cultures. A list of Smith-approved semester and yearlong programs is available from the Office of International Study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Courses</head><p>The department offers no graduate program but in exceptional circumstances considers admitting an advanced student whose independent studies leading to the A.M. degree would be overseen by the appropriate members of the faculty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>The music department offers a range of performance courses: individual lessons, which are numbered MUS 914Y, 924Y, 930Y and 940Y; chamber music coaching (MUS 901); conducting (MUS 903); and large ensembles, numbered MUS 951 and above. Admission to individual lessons, chamber music, and some ensembles is determined by audition during fall semester orientation period and the first days of the semester. Students are accepted on the basis of musicianship, competence and potential. With the exception of voice, some prior experience is assumed. There is a lesson fee which is waived for music majors and minors. Other students may apply for departmental scholarship funds. Information and sign-up sheets for auditions may be found at the Music Department office.</p><p>When no instructor for a particular instrument is available at Smith College, every effort is made to provide students with qualified instructors from the Five College community. Such arrangements may require Smith students to travel to other campuses within the Five College system. Students wishing to study performance with Five College faculty must obtain departmental approval.</p><p>Individual voice or instrument performance courses consist of weekly private lessons, with specific expectations determined by each instructor. Lessons require a yearlong commitment and are normally taken in addition to a regular course load. Two such courses may only be taken concurrently with departmental approval. (This restriction does not apply to enrollment in MUS 901 or MUS 903, or to participation in large ensembles for credit.)</p><p>For more detailed information on instrumental and voice lessons and a list of current faculty please see the Music Department website, www.smith.edu/ music.</p><p>All performance students are encouraged to study music in the classroom.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Poetry Concentration</head><p>The poetry concentration allows students to pursue work on and about poetry through a range of different experiences and courses. Through a combination of academic study, practical work and independent projects, students gain a deeper understanding of the craft of writing, the business of publication and the dissemination of poetry to others. The poetry concentration supports the study of poetry within a range of scholarly disciplines and lets students explore areas of professional practice (writing poetry, teaching poetry, writing about poetry, translating poetry and book arts/publishing of poetry) through meaningful connections with local, regional and national presses, journals, book-arts centers and other sites where poetry is made, critiqued and taught. The concentration draws on the educational resources of the Poetry Center and the Mortimer Rare Book Room, as well on the unique expertise of poets and artists working both at the college and in the larger Pioneer Valley. For more information see www. smith.edu/poetry. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Three electives</head><p>One of these electives must include any 200-level poetry/literature course (literary analysis, not creative writing) in any department.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Two practical experiences</head><p>Coursework is complemented by at least two practical experiences relating broadly to the field of poetry. These may include both internships and paid or volunteer work. Depending on what is offered, PYX 300 or 400 may be taken to satisfy the capstone requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Capstone Course</head><p>Five possible foci or strands may be pursued in the poetry concentration. The total combined coursework accrues no fewer than 19 credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENG 112 Reading Contemporary Poetry</head><p>This course offers the opportunity to read contemporary poetry and meet the poets who write it. The course consists of class meetings alternating with public poetry readings by visiting poets. On five selected Tuesdays, the course also includes Tuesday Q&amp;As with the poets, which meet from 4-5 p.m. Students with class, lab or required work conflicts are excused from Q&amp;As. Graded Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory only. Course may be repeated. {L} Credits: 2 Members of the department Normally offered both fall and spring semesters PYX 140 The Art and Business of Poetry A required gateway course for the poetry concentration, this interactive workshop-based course offers a sampling of the diverse components of the concentration. Each daily session features faculty members and professionals from the community with particular expertise in the areas of writing poetry, printing/presenting poetry, writing about poetry, translating poetry and teaching poetry.

This course begins with linear regression models and introduces students to a variety of techniques for learning from data, as well as principled methods for assessing and comparing models. Topics include bias-variance trade-off, resampling and cross-validation, linear model selection and regularization, classification and regression trees, bagging, boosting, random forests, support vector machines, generalized additive models, principal component analysis, unsupervised learning and k-means clustering. Emphasis is placed on statistical computing in a high-level language (e.g. R or Python To act, to perform is to speculate with your body. Theatre is a transformative experience that takes performer and audience on an extensive journey in the playground of the imagination beyond the mundane world. Theatre asks us to be other than ourselves. We can for a time inhabit someone else's skin, be shaped by another gender or ethnicity, become part of a past epoch or an alternative time and space similar to our own time but that has yet to come. As we enter this "imagined" world we investigate the normative principles of our current world. This course investigates the counterfactual, speculative, subjunctive impulse in overtly speculative drama and film with a particular focus on race and gender. We examine an international range of plays by such authors as Caryl Churchill, </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Translation Studies Concentration</head><p>The translation studies concentration offers students studying a foreign language and culture an opportunity to refine their knowledge of the foreign language through translation. A student who wants to create a bridge between two majors, one of which is in a foreign language and culture and the other in a different discipline, will also find the concentration to be an important supplement to her curriculum. Student concentrators may not only be drawn to the literary side of translation; they may also seek to link their knowledge in the social sciences or sciences to their practice of a foreign language, translating governmental or legal documents, working with immigrant or refugee communities who need the help of a translator or interpreter, or translating scientific papers.</p><p>The translation studies concentration encourages study in a broad range of scholarly disciplines, including courses in the various departments of foreign languages and cultures, comparative literature, classics, film studies, American studies and English. The Poetry Center, the Five College Center for East Asian Studies, and the Five College journal Metamorphoses: A Journal of Literary Translation provide opportunities for guest translators as well as for student internships. Other resources include the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages (www.fivecolleges.edu/fclang) and the UMass Translation Center (www.umasstranslation.com).</p><p>The requirements for the concentration are deliberately flexible to allow students to pursue the translation practice that most suits their interests or needs-from literary to technical translation to the ethical complexities that arise in interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses</head><p>CLT 150 The Art of Translation: Poetics, Politics, Practice We hear and read translations all the time: on television news, in radio interviews, in movie subtitles, in international bestsellers. But translations don't shift texts transparently from one language to another. Rather, they revise, censor and rewrite original works, to challenge the past and to speak to new readers. We explore translation in a range of contexts by hearing lectures by experts in the history, theory and practice of translation. Knowledge of a foreign language useful but not required. Graded S/U only. Can be taken concurrently with FRN 295 for 4 credits. {L} Credits: 2 Carolyn Shread Normally offered each spring</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TSX 330 Capstone Seminar in Translation Studies</head><p>Same as CLT 330. The capstone seminar brings together a cohort of concentrators to discuss the final translation project that each student undertakes with the guidance of their adviser in the concentration and to situate the project within the framework of larger questions that the work of translation elicits. The seminar readings focus on renowned practitioners' reflections on the difficulties and complexities of translating, the obstacles, discoveries and solutions that the translator encounters. We read a series of essays that engage with the conflicting interpretations and nuances of translations in 14 languages of Ferdinand Oyono's iconic 1956 African novel, Une vie de boy. We compare how these translations transform the original novel and question the concept of original text as it interacts with the culture and the language into which it is translated. Students are responsible for presenting essays that focus on the particular challenges of translation that they have encountered in their individual project. Open to students in the Concentration in Translation Studies and students in Comparative Literature. Enrollment limit of 12 students. Prerequisite: CLT 150. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>The concentration is composed of six courses. In addition to the gateway course and the capstone experience, a student must take four courses, two of which should be in her language and culture of expertise, one with a focus on translation theory or practice, and one elective. In addition to the course work, students will engage in two practical learning experiences, one of which must be the equivalent of one semester on study abroad. The practical experiences do not carry credit. The combined course work in the concentration will total between 20 and 22 credits.</p></div>

The Study Abroad programs, the Office for International Study, and the Lazarus Career Center have built databases of students who have worked, interned or studied abroad with organizations or companies and that offer a ready resource for concentrators. Normally, advanced-level courses (at the 300 or above level) will be considered to be equivalent to the B2 level of the CEFRL. For students working in "critical languages"-or non-Western languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, Urdu-the level of achievement should be the 300-level at Smith and with consultation with their adviser. International students, or students whose native language is other than English, should consult with their concentration adviser on how best to show they have attained the equivalent of a B2 level in English, the language from which they will translate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E-Portfolio Language Passport</head><p>Students will be expected to develop an e-portfolio Language Passport with the guidance of the Director of the Concentration. Students may include the following in their e-portfolio: a detailed language self-assessment; a reflection on their language-learning; a reflection on how their practical experiences have deepened their understanding of the language and culture they are studying; a shortened version of the introduction to their final translation project.</p><p>Capstone: A choice of three possibilities:</p><p>1. An independent translation project (10 pages minimum, depending on the type of translation) with a substantial introduction that reflects on the obstacles, difficulties and successes of the task of translation. 2. An extra translation project within the context of an existing seminar or 300-level course in the language or culture of the student's translation focus.</p><p>(If students choose this option, the course will be in addition to the other four academic courses required for the concentration.) 3. An Honors thesis that is a translation project or reflects on translation.</p><p>Whichever of the three options the student chooses for the capstone, she will consult with her concentrator adviser. All students working on their capstone project will take TSX 330/CLT 330, a 4-credit course spring semester of their final year in the concentration. The course will include readings on issues of translation and focus on discussion of the students' projects. Offered every spring semester. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Major</head><p>The Program for the Study of Women and Gender examines gender, race, class and sexuality as important and simultaneous aspects of social worlds and human lives. This examination requires inquiry into the construction and operation of power relations, social inequalities and resistances to injustice in both national and transnational contexts. We understand women, gender, feminism and queer as politicized terms. As categories of analysis they help reveal how subjects become racialized, sexualized, gendered and class located.</p><p>Building on its origins in women's studies, our program continues to examine the experiences, ideologies, works and actions of women in a variety of national, cultural, historical and political contexts. As an interdisciplinary endeavor, the study of women and gender shows students how different academic disciplines view the operation of gender in the labor market, the family, political systems and cultural production. Research and theory emerge from these everyday realities and, in turn, feminist theory informs our analysis of political choices and our understanding of the forms of activism around the globe.</p></div>

The course begins with an introduction to key terms and debates in the field about how knowledge is produced. We focus particularly on how the power relations of gender combine with related relations of inequality/domination/oppression, such as race, class, sexuality, religion and nation. We then examine the distinguishing qualities of feminist methodologies in the social sciences, arts, humanities and sciences. The course gives particular attention to the interdisciplinary focus of feminist research and future directions of feminist methods.

While becoming familiar with the existing narratives about lesbian/queer lives, students are introduced to the method of oral history as a key documentation strategy in the production of lesbian history. What are the gaps in the literature and how can oral history assist in filling in the spaces? What does a historical narrative that privileges categories of gender and sexuality look like? And how do we need to adapt our research methods, including oral history, in order to talk about lesbian/queer lives? Our texts include secondary literature on 20thcentury lesbian cultures and communities, oral history theory and methodology, and primary sources from the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC). Students conduct, transcribe, edit and interpret their own interviews for their final project. The oral histories from this course are archived with the Documenting Lesbian Lives collection in the SSC. Prerequisite: SWG 150 or permission of the instructor.

Key queer theoretical concepts provide a framework for examining how the production gender and sexuality impacts cultural production. Through our critical engagement with a selection of films, music, television, visual art, and digital media we will discuss mainstream conventions and the feminist, queer, and queer of color interventions that enliven the landscape of popular culture with which we contend in everyday life.
