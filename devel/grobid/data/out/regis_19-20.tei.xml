<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HISTORY OF REGIS UNIVERSITY</head><p>In 1540, when Ignatius Loyola founded the Society of Jesus--a community of companions and scholars resolved to serve their fellow men --a guiding principle of the Society was that it would meet the needs of its age and would "form leaders who would carry forth into their personal and professional lives a mission of service to others." For four centuries, the Jesuit fathers have been perfecting an educational tradition of academic excellence, valuecentered education, and service to the community.</p><p>The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) is an international Roman Catholic religious order of priests and brothers known for its missionary and educational work. The Jesuit education network extends to more than 2,000 institutions of various types and levels, including 177 universities and 356 high schools. Ten thousand Jesuits and nearly 100,000 lay people provide education for more than 1.8 million students in 56 countries around the world. In the United States, there are 46 Jesuit high schools and 27 Jesuit colleges and universities.</p><p>Regis University has continued the Jesuit tradition since 1877, when a band of Jesuit missionaries from Naples, Italy, carved out a college on the edge of the desert in New Mexico, and named it Las Vegas College.</p><p>In 1884, Bishop Joseph P. <ref type="bibr">Machbeuf</ref>  2015 Long-time Regis men's basketball coach Alonzo "Lonnie" Porter retired after 38 years, a tenure unsurpassed in length by any college men's basketball coach in Colorado history. With a career record of 533-482, the five-time conference coach of the year has also amassed more victories than any other men's hoops coach in state history. His win total ranks 10th among all active NCAA Division II men's coaches and 31st all time. Sherman Alexie, named one of The New Yorker's 20 top writers for the 21st century and author of "Blasphemy" and "The Absolutely True Story of a Part-Time Indian", held a reading on the Northwest Denver campus. Nobel Peace Laureate Leymah Gbowee visited the Northwest Campus as part of the two-day Rocky Mountain PeaceJam Leadership Conference, an event that engages youth through workshops, service learning projects and opportunities to engage with local community organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY</head><p>Regis University educates men and women of all ages to take leadership roles and to make a positive impact in a changing society. Standing within the Catholic and United States traditions, we are inspired by the particular Jesuit vision of Ignatius Loyola. This vision challenges us to attain the inner freedom to make intelligent choices.</p><p>We seek to provide value-centered undergraduate and graduate education, as well as to strengthen our commitment to community service. We nurture the life of the mind and the pursuit of truth within an environment conducive to effective teaching, learning, and personal development. Consistent with Judeo-Christian principles, we apply knowledge to human needs and seek to preserve the best of the human heritage. We encourage the continual search for truth, values, and a just existence. Throughout this process, we examine and attempt to answer the question: "How ought we to live?"</p><p>As a consequence of Ignatius Loyola's vision, particularly as reflected in his Spiritual Exercises, we encourage all members of the Regis community to learn proficiently, think logically and critically, identify and choose personal standards of values, and be socially responsible. We further encourage the development of skills and leadership abilities necessary for distinguished professional work and contributions to the improvement and transformation of society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDUCATIONAL GOALS</head><p>Based on hope in the goodness of human life and responding in solidarity with Jesus Christ, "Who came to serve, not be served," we seek to:</p><p>• Provide our students with an excellent education in which they develop the ability to think critically, perceive comprehensively, and perform competently.</p><p>• Offer a liberal education in the arts and sciences that develops talent and abilities, promotes awareness of career alternatives, and provides the practical skills necessary to pursue such careers. We believe that recognizing the continuum between conceptual rigor and practical application enables our students to adapt to new situations throughout life.</p><p>• Examine the dominant values that constitute society. We provide our students with the experience and understanding necessary for establishing their own framework of values within which they can make moral judgments and personal choices. In this way, we help empower students to make a positive impact on a changing society.</p><p>• Investigate the theories, methods and data of academic disciplines, as well as their underlying assumptions and values.</p><p>• Promote an atmosphere of personal concern for each student. This includes conscientious advising, substantial interaction between faculty and students, and close attention to each individual's personal intellectual growth.</p><p>• Concentrate our limited resources as a private and independent institution on select areas and extend these resources by forming partnerships with other organizations. In this way, the University attempts to be innovative, both educationally and technologically.</p><p>• Motivate students, faculty, and staff to put their wisdom, skills, and knowledge at the service of humanity.</p><p>• Expand the presence and influence of the Jesuit vision and values, which are derived from the Ignatian, Catholic, and United States traditions of education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNDERGRADUATE CORE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FRAMEWORK AND GOALS</head><p>From its origins in the Renaissance and Reformation, Jesuit education has provided leadership in bringing the traditions of Christianity and classical learning in fruitful engagement with new developments in thought and culture. This task remains central at Regis University, where the core educational experience seeks to provide all undergraduate students with Jesuit liberal arts education. The core educational experience challenges students to reflect on tradition, continuity, and change, and to explore the question "How ought we to live?" in terms of the development of Western thought from classical to contemporary.</p><p>Inspired by Catholic tradition and Ignatian spirituality, the core educational experience at Regis celebrates the essential goodness of the world and the joy of learning. This education is grounded in the belief that faith and reason are complementary; it emphasizes the basic values of human dignity, diversity, freedom, and justice; and it promotes the formation of conscience and character through imaginative and critical discernment. The core educational experience aims to develop the whole person. It seeks not only to enable students to meet the challenges and goals of their personal and professional lives, but also to cultivate their leadership in service to others and in work for the common good.</p><p>The Regis University core educational experience engages students in an academic environment that both models and nurtures the beliefs, commitments, and goals that are central to Jesuit liberal arts education. The mentoring relationship between faculty, staff, and students is central to this experience. While required core courses are essential to the core educational experience, core goals and themes inform all academic majors and professional programs, as well as campus and community activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CORE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE</head><p>The specific structure of the core educational experience varies within each of the University's five colleges because of the different student populations and instructional formats in the Anderson College of Business , the College of Computer &amp; Information strives to cultivate respect for human diversity and a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Awareness</head><p>While contemporary individuals operate in many different social contexts, the Jesuit tradition has always been global in its horizons and outreach. Thus, the core educational experience furthers students' appreciation of the diversity of persons and cultures, the complexity of relationships in the new and evolving international order, and the impact of humans on the natural environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership</head><p>Regis University is committed to developing leaders in the service of others. Recognizing that there are many forms of leadership, the core educational experience challenges students to strengthen their personal leadership skills through academic courses, service learning experiences, and other campus and community activities. Special attention is focused on refining students' abilities to listen and to engage in dialogue in diverse settings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Consistent with the Regis University Mission and Jesuit principles, each College within Regis University expects its students to conduct themselves and maintain relationships in a manner that is characterized by honesty, integrity, authenticity, and dignity as well as mutual respect for the contributions of all the members of the Regis community.</p><p>All Regis University students and faculty will abide by the University's Academic Integrity Policy regardless of the program or College where the student is enrolled. All Colleges at the University will use and enforce this policy.</p><p>The term integrity is derived from the Latin integritas, meaning the quality of being whole, sound and unimpaired or unbroken. Academic integrity is built upon the values and virtues of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness. A failure to observe these basic values undermines the very foundations and bonds of a learning community and impairs the most basic goals of education At Regis University, academic integrity is viewed and treated as an academic matter rather than an issue of student conduct.</p><p>In order to establish and foster an environment where incidents of misconduct are socially unacceptable, all students are expected to adhere to the Regis University Academic Integrity Policy. This Academic Integrity Policy is intended to support the shared responsibility of faculty and students in maintaining an academic environment in which the values of truth and justice prevail in all activities related to learning, teaching, research, scholarship and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Integrity and the Academic Integrity Policy</head><p>Definition: Academic Integrity means that each student acknowledges that the work represented in all assignments and all examinations is his, her, or their own or is properly cited, and that he, she, or them has neither given nor received unauthorized information. Furthermore, each student agrees not to divulge the contents of any assignment or examination to another student in any semester or to alter or impede the work or progress of another student.</p><p>Students of Regis University are committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and assume full responsibility for maintaining those standards. All members of the Regis University community are expected to exhibit the qualities of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness in all academic and clinical activities, holding themselves and each other accountable for the integrity of the learning community.</p><p>It is the responsibility of each student to review and abide by all aspects of the course syllabus and agree to adhere to this Regis University Academic Integrity Policy.</p><p>The Academic Integrity Policy (sometimes referred to as the Academic Honor Code) applies to any work performed by any current or former Regis University student, regardless of the student's home college or program.</p><p>The Academic Integrity Policy prohibits cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, collusion and other forms of academic misconduct. All suspected violations, including first-time violations, will be reported via established University processes, and will be referred to the lead academic integrity officer of the college in which the offense occurred. Reporting of all offenses, regardless of the violation level, allows the University to identify repeat offenders. All faculty have access to plagiarism detection software, which can be used with or without a student's knowledge in any Regis University course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Violations of Academic Integrity</head><p>It is a violation of academic integrity to cheat, plagiarize, fabricate, collude, or otherwise misrepresent someone else's work as your own.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Levels and Sanctions</head><p>The level of an offense is initially assigned by the faculty member based upon the assessment of the offense and surrounding circumstances. Faculty may consult with the lead academic integrity officer within the College, School or Division to assess the level of any academic integrity violation.</p><p>The following serves as a guideline for the assignment of offense level. The circumstances of a given occurrence may escalate any offense to the next level as determined by the course instructor and/or the academic integrity board of the College in which the offense occurred.</p><p>A first time egregious Level III or subsequent violation of any level may result in both course and institutional penalties, including possible probation, suspension or expulsion from the University.

All faculty are expected to use the Academic Integrity Violation reporting form on Webadvisor to report incidents of fabrication, collusion, cheating, and plagiarism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Awareness</head><p>It is the responsibility of all students to familiarize themselves with the University's Academic Integrity Policy. Additionally, students should complete the online tutorial on Academic Integrity during their first term at the University.</p><p>Individual Colleges may choose how they convey this information. For example, this may occur during a New Student Orientation, First-Year Seminar, or Registration/Welcome Information Packet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals Process</head><p>Students have the right to appeal findings of academic dishonesty, or the institutional penalty for any infractions at any level. Findings may also be affirmed or modified by the appropriate academic dean. All Colleges will follow the same appeals process.

As a Jesuit institution, Regis University is deeply embedded within that heritage. Central to the tradition is the fact that the mission of the University is the driving force behind all educational programs. The mission can be no less central when the issue of assessment of student academic achievement is engaged.</p><p>From our mission, a set of University-wide Outcome Statements was developed. The goal of developing these statements was to transform our mission and educational goals into explicit and ultimately measurable declarations that capture the collective thinking of the faculties of the University. In effect, the University Outcome Statements have become the operational foundation for assessment of student academic achievement.</p><p>These University-wide learning outcome are broad-based and address every aspect of the University mission related to student learning and academic achievement, including learning within a specific academic discipline or cross-disciplinary area and learning in general education. The statements also identify the need for graduates to be well prepared for lives of work and service. Finally, the University Outcome Statements encompass some of the critical attitudes and personal values Regis feels are important for citizenship in a global society.</p><p>The University Outcome Statements are listed below. All students graduating from Regis University should have:</p><p>• In-depth knowledge of a discipline or content area.</p><p>• Knowledge of diverse cultures, perspectives, and belief systems.</p><p>• Knowledge of arts, sciences, and humanities.</p><p>• Ability to think critically.</p><p>• Ability to communicate effectively.</p><p>• Ability to use contemporary technology.</p><p>• Commitment to ethical and social responsibilities.</p><p>• Commitment to leadership and service to others. • Commitment to learning as a lifelong endeavor.</p><p>Over the past decade, the assessment of student academic achievement has gained a prominent place on the agendas of institutions of higher education. The Higher Learning Commission indicated in 1991 that a formal plan for outcomes assessment would be required to maintain accreditation.</p><p>Regis University engages in the important work of student learning assessment not to comply with our accreditor's mandate, but to ensure that we deliver on the promises made to Regis students through the Regis Nine institutional learning outcomes and through program-specific learning outcomes. All instructional, cocurricular and operational units at Regis University complete this work through active participation in the R.U. Learning assessment plan, which is accessible at www.regis.edu/assessment.</p></div>

Any relevant definition of credit hour must be consistent with these principles. Therefore, the definition of the credit hour is based on time spent in mentored learning activities that are directed toward student learning outcomes. All Regis University courses have designated student learning outcomes. To merit three credits, a course must have enough mentored learning activities that are directed toward achieving the learning outcomes. Three-credit courses require a minimum of 30 hours of mentored learning activities. All Regis courses require learners to complete individual studying, reading and writing in addition to mentored learning activities, but these activities are not counted toward credit hours.</p><p>To access the full Regis University policy regarding credit hours, please see https://www.regis.edu/About-Regis-University/Policiesand-Procedures/Credit-Hour-Policy.aspx STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY Regis University is a Jesuit Catholic University committed to excellence in its programs and services; it exists for the purposes of teaching and learning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head><p>The Office of Financial Aid strives to help as many Regis University students as funds permit. Financial aid awards are made after a student has been admitted to an eligible degree or certificate program of the University and has applied for financial aid. Most awards are based on financial need. However, a limited amount of aid is available to students without need. Students are encouraged to call 303-458-4126 or, if calling from outside the Denver Metro area, toll-free at 800-568-8932 for financial aid information. Information is also available on the Financial Aid website at www.regis.edu/financialaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOW ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED</head><p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is analyzed according to a need analysis approved annually by the U.S. Congress and implemented by the U.S. Department of Education.</p><p>Components such as income, number in family, number of household members in college, and asset strength are integrated into the formula. The need analysis attempts to determine the amount students and their families can afford to contribute toward the student's education for one year. This amount is called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Results of this analysis are forwarded to the Office of Financial Aid specified by students on the application.</p><p>The Regis University Office of Financial Aid and the state of Colorado determines a reasonable cost of education, including tuition, fees, books and supplies, room and board (for both campus resident students and students living off campus), personal expenses, and transportation costs. The budgets are designed to permit students to live at a modest but adequate standard during the period of education. The student's EFC is subtracted from the cost of the education budget to determine financial need or eligibility. Students who do not demonstrate financial need through this process may still be eligible for scholarships, Federal PLUS loan, Unsubsidized Federal Direct loan, or other forms of assistance offered by Regis University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NOTIFICATION AND DISBURSEMENT</head><p>When a student's financial aid application is complete (all forms and reports received), it is reviewed by Financial Aid personnel. If a student is eligible and funds are available, an award letter is prepared and can be viewed on WebAdvisor. The student can accept, reduce or decline their loans online. Most aid is divided into two or three equal payments, based on the number of semesters for which the student is enrolled. Federal loans require that students complete Entrance Counseling and a Master Promissory Note and funding will only disburse once these steps are completed.</p><p>Funds that have been awarded, accepted and complete are credited to the student's account within a week after the end of the add/drop period when the student has begun enrollment for the appropriate credit hours. The student will be contacted if any funds are received by check that require personal endorsement. Any funds in excess of student expenses billed by Regis University may be used for other allowable educational expenses such as books and living expenses. These funds are not available until approximately 14 days after the appropriate add/drop period. Therefore, students should plan ahead and have sufficient resources to meet these costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS</head><p>Regis University is dedicated to providing financial support to undocumented students within the limits of state and federal law. Financial aid is generally not available for undocumented students. The majority of all student aid, including Federal and Colorado student aid, requires the recipient to be a US citizen, permanent resident (green card holder), or an eligible non-citizen.</p><p>Regis University provides institutional funds to undocumented students by awarding academic and other talent-based scholarships. The majority of these scholarships are awarded at the time of admission and notice is included in the admissions letter. Students who are eligible to work in the United States can apply for on-campus student employment by completing the Student Employment Award Application at www.regis.edu/faforms. For more information visit www.regis.edu/financialaid and www.finaid.org/otheraid/undocumented.phtml.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct Loan</head><p>The Federal Direct Loan is a federal education loan designed to help students pay for college. To apply for a Federal Direct Loan, students must submit a FAFSA application. The FAFSA results determine a student's financial need, which affects the amount of subsidized loan that an undergraduate student can borrow. Students may be offered a subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan, or both. If the loan is subsidized, the federal government pays the interest while the student is enrolled and through a six-month grace period after the student has graduated or ceased to be enrolled at least halftime. Students begin to pay interest on the loan when repayment begins. Graduate students are not eligible for subsidized loans.</p><p>Students may be eligible for unsubsidized loans if educational costs remain after all other financial aid is subtracted within annual and aggregate loan limits. The unsubsidized loan amount is not determined by need. Students are responsible for the interest from the time the unsubsidized loan is disbursed until it is paid in full. Students can choose to pay the interest or allow it to accumulate and be capitalized, that is, added to the principal amount of the loan. Capitalizing the interest will increase the amount to repay.

It is not a guaranteed benefit since Regis University does not control the selection/awarding process at the other participating Jesuit colleges and universities and Regis University does not have sufficient funds to award every student who applies to attend here with FACHEX. Contact the Office of Admissions for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outside Scholarships</head><p>The Office of Financial Aid at Regis University, high school guidance offices, and public libraries have listings of scholarships provided by companies, individuals, and trusts outside the University. The Regis University website provides access to a scholarship database at www.regis.edu/financialaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>State Scholarship/Grant Programs</head><p>Some states, such as Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, offer grant and scholarship assistance for students attending Regis University. Information on these programs may be obtained from a school counselor or the Higher Educational Assistance Agency in the student's home state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Veterans' Benefits</head><p>The University is approved by the State Approving Agency of Colorado, a division of the State Board for Community Colleges and Occupational Education, to offer courses of education and training for veterans and eligible dependents under the provisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans and other eligible persons should obtain their certificates of eligibility from the regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) before entrance into the University.</p><p>The payment of benefits by VA differs according to half-time or full-time enrollment. Students who are eligible for veterans' benefits should check with the Regis University certifying official in the Academic Records and Registration office for specific information about their particular program. Additionally, students receiving veterans' benefits must notify the Regis University certifying official under the following conditions:</p><p>• the student is temporarily withdrawing from the program;</p><p>• the student is permanently withdrawing from the program;</p><p>• the student is changing programs and/or majors; or</p><p>• the student is attending another college or university.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</head><p>Federal and state financial aid funds are restricted to citizens and permanent residents of the United States. International students with F-1 or J-1 visa types who seek employment on or off campus must follow procedures specified by the Designated School Official in the Office of Global Education in order to maintain legal status. If required standards are met, International students may apply for scholarships, institutionally funded grants, and student employment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONSORTIUM AGREEMENTS</head><p>The Financial Aid Consortium Agreement is an agreement between Regis University and an eligible college to share enrollment information and records for student financial aid eligibility.</p><p>Under a Consortium Agreement, Regis University may act as the Home school, meaning the student intends to receive his or her degree or certificate from Regis. The other school acts as the Host school. Students may take classes that Regis University approves for credit at the other college, the credits are required for the degree, and those credits will be transferred to Regis. Under this agreement, students can be considered for financial aid if they are at least half-time students, combining classes at both schools the student is attending. Students must renew their consortium agreement each semester and other qualifications and limitations may apply..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration/Enrollment</head><p>Students should enroll in a degree-granting program at Regis University and create a degree plan with a Regis University advisor. This plan may be altered with the advisor's approval.</p><p>At the beginning of each semester, students must register for all courses they will take during that semester. If a student is taking courses at Regis University, he/she follows the standard registration process at Regis. Students who are taking courses at a Host school must meet with a Regis University academic advisor for pre-approval of their planned courses before they register.</p><p>When registering at a Host school, students should identify themselves as a Regis University student. If courses are taken at Regis, tuition is paid to Regis. If courses are taken at a Host school, tuition is paid by the student to the Host school.</p><p>Students attending a Host school should apply for financial aid through Regis University. Students must:</p><p>• submit a FAFSA;</p><p>• complete an Authorization to Release Information form; and</p><p>• contact the Office of Financial Aid at Regis University to complete any additional forms as appropriate.</p><p>Courses approved by the Regis University academic advisor and taken at a Host school are considered for financial aid eligibility. Students must notify the Office of Financial Aid if their enrollment plans change, since enrollment status affects financial aid eligibility.</p><p>Financial aid is not paid until the Office of Financial Aid receives verification from the Host school that a student is enrolled for the minimum required credits. This occurs after the Host schools' add/drop period. Any credit refund from financial aid proceeds is processed within two weeks after financial aid is credited to the student account at Regis University.</p><p>For more information concerning consortium agreements, students should contact the Office of Financial Aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDY ABROAD</head><p>Enrollment in a program of study that is approved for credit by the student's academic advisor may be considered as enrolled at Regis University for the purpose of being eligible for federal and state financial aid. Students who are juniors or seniors with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and clean disciplinary records should contact the Office of Global Education for approved study abroad programs. If approved for participation, interested students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS</head><p>In some cases, the student must be enrolled as a full-time student in order to qualify for financial assistance. Most aid programs allow for less than full-time attendance, but the student must generally be enrolled at least half time in order to qualify. The student award letter specifies the enrollment requirements upon which the financial aid award is based.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Status Credit Hour Requirement</head><p>Full-Time 12 or more semester hours Three-Quarter Time 9 to 11 semester hours Half-Time 6 to 8 semester hours</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Status Credit Hour Requirement</head><p>Full-Time 6 or more graduate semester hours Half-Time 3 to 5 graduate semester hours NOTE: If undergraduate classes are required for a graduate degree, the student must have at least six undergraduate semester hours to be considered a half-time student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION</head><p>All individuals required to register for the draft, in accordance with the Military Selective Service Act, must comply with this mandate or forfeit eligibility for federal student aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS</head><p>The federal and state governments require the Office of Financial Aid to monitor the academic progress of students who are receiving federal, state, or institutional assistance. All hours attempted and completed are reviewed. Cumulative grade point averages and maximum hours of financial aid eligibility are monitored once per year. The full policy for Satisfactory Academic Progress is available on the Regis University Financial Aid website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REFUNDS DUE TO WITHDRAWAL</head><p>Scholarships, grants and loan funds normally are not credited to a student's account until after the appropriate add/drop period based on the student's academic program each semester. At this time enrollment status is verified and, if required, adjustments are made. Financial aid is not credited to a student's account if no enrolled hours can be verified or enrolled hours are insufficient based on the level on the award letter. Students who completely withdraw after aid has been credited may have their aid adjusted in accordance with federal and state regulations.</p><p>Withdrawal does not eliminate financial obligation to the University. Charges owed to the University at the time of withdrawal are the student's responsibility based on the University's tuition and housing refund policies. Details of these policies are available in the Office of Student Accounts.</p><p>There are specific federal, state and University withdrawal policies regarding tuition and fees, housing charges, refunds to financial aid programs, and repayments resulting from withdrawal.</p><p>The student's withdrawal may result in a return of funds to the federal financial aid programs, and the student may have to repay those funds.</p><p>There are three situations that may require immediate repayment of financial aid funds when a student withdraws:</p><p>If University charges are reduced as a result of withdrawal, and a student account credit balance is created, these funds may be used to repay financial aid programs, depending on the amount of financial aid and the date of withdrawal.</p><p>A student may have to repay financial aid funds that are in excess of an amount determined to be reasonable for the length of enrollment. This repayment is based on federal guidelines.</p><p>If withdrawal occurs prior to fully establishing enrollment eligibility, the entire financial aid award, including any credit balance, will be repaid to the financial aid programs. This may result in a balance due to the University.</p><p>Earnings in student employment programs are paid through the time of withdrawal. Students may not continue student employment after withdrawing from the University.</p><p>Financial aid is for enrolled students only. Except in rare situations, financial aid cannot be disbursed after withdrawal. Students who receive financial aid and withdraw may lose future financial aid eligibility. Refer to the full Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy on the Regis University Financial Aid website.</p><p>Information regarding the federal regulations for calculating refunds and repayments and the order of financial aid programs to which aid is restored is included in detail on the Financial Aid website.</p><p>STUDENT ACCOUNTS TUITION, FEES, ROOM AND BOARD CHARGES Tuition, fees, and room and board charges are posted to students' accounts as they are assessed. Payments are applied to accounts when received by the University. Students may call 303-458-4126 with questions concerning their account. If calling from outside the Denver Metro area, the toll-free number is 800-568-8932.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUITION RATES</head><p>Student tuition and fees will be billed based on the tuition rate and fees associated with the student's primary college and academic program. Current tuition rates and associated fees can be found in each college section of this Catalog or on the Regis University Cost of Attendance by College page at Regis.edu FINANCIAL POLICIES Tuition, fees, and other charges described in this Catalog are good faith projections for the current academic year. They are, however, subject to change from one academic term to the next as deemed necessary by the University in order to meet its financial commitments and to fulfill its role and mission.</p><p>There may be other fees and charges that are not specified in this Catalog. These fees and charges may be ascertained by contacting the University office that administers the program or activity in which the student intends to enroll or engage. Additionally, a nonrefundable tuition deposit may be required by an individual program upon official acceptance to the University.</p><p>Regis University reserves the right to restrict and/or drop registration. The University will not register a student or issue official transcripts, diplomas, or other educational credentials or certifications to or on behalf of any student or former student with a financial obligation, which includes without limitation a financial obligation resulting from a student receivable balance, fee and fine receivable balance, Federal Perkins, Federal Nursing loan, Nurse Faculty Loan Program, and other institutional loans.</p><p>At the time of registration, the student accepts financial responsibility for all tuition and fee charges. Full payment of the student account balance is due by the published due date. If the balance is not paid by the due date, late fees will be assessed and the student account will be considered in default. It is the responsibility of the student to update Regis University with address and phone number changes and other pertinent contact information. Failure to receive invoices, reminders, or past-due notices does not relieve the student of his or her financial obligation. Students who are referred to a collection agency, even if the referral is due to an incorrect address on file, are obligated to pay any and all collection fees incurred.</p><p>Failure to pay on a past due balance will result in the account being sent to external collection agencies. Upon non-payment of a past due balance, Regis University may declare the balance due and payable. At the time of registration, students agree to reimburse Regis University the fees of any collection agency up to 33% which may not be reflected in the statement of account, which may be based on a percentage of the debt, and all the costs, fees and expenses, including late fees and all other applicable charges to Regis University. In the event this agreement is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection through legal proceedings or otherwise, it is the responsibility of the student to pay late fees, attorney fees, court fees and costs, and all other applicable charges to Regis University.</p><p>Electronic signatures are equal to signed promissory notes. Tuition deferments, payment agreements, and RPO payment plans are equal to loans and are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Disputed past due accounts shall be governed by Colorado law, excluding its conflicts of law's provisions. In the event of default, Regis University and its respective agents reserve the right to report defaulted information to the credit bureaus. Once a delinquent account that was placed with a collection agency is paid off by the student, the student will be placed on a pre-pay status for two semesters with registration for any future registrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</head><p>International students are required by law to financially support all expenses associated with studying in the United States.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sponsored Billing</head><p>Regis University can set up a direct billing arrangement with companies or agencies that are willing to cover a student's tuition and fees. Sponsors may enter into a pre-established contract provided by Regis University. For more information on the initial set-up, please contact the Sponsored Billing Representative at <ref type="bibr">303-458-4079</ref>. Students should consult with their employer or sponsor to determine if a direct billing agreement has been established with Regis University.</p><p>Once the direct billing arrangement has been set-up with the University, Regis will directly bill the sponsor once proof from the sponsorship is received. Such proof can be a financial guarantee letter from the employer that includes student name, student ID, course title(s), tuition amount, name, address, and contact information on where the bill should be sent. The financial guarantee letter should be submitted to the Office of Student Accounts by the tuition due date to be accepted. It is the student's responsibility to facilitate the submission of proof for each term. If the sponsor does not pay the balance owed, the financial obligation will then be the responsibility of the student. The student will be obligated to meet the University's financial policies outlined in this Catalog. If the sponsor payment is not sufficient to cover tuition and fees, the student will have to either pay their portion or make payment arrangements by the due date for that class.</p><p>Sponsored Billing is NOT tuition reimbursement. Tuition reimbursement means that the student is responsible for paying the tuition and is reimbursed at a later time by the employer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXX(A-D)</head><p>Courses that are taught in sequential order and require further study for topic completion.</p><p>XXX(E-W) Courses that are grouped under a broad topic or theme of study, with allowance for repeatability under different sub-topics and letter designations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE PREFIX DESIGNATION</head><p>In addition to the number identifying where a course fits within a discipline, each course is assigned a prefix that identifies the appropriate discipline, field, or department. For example, the numerical designations for courses in Chemistry are preceded by CH, in English by EN, and in Religious Studies by RS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADD/DROP</head><p>Students may add/drop courses through the end of the published add/drop period for each term/semester online through WebAdvisor. When students drop a course within the add/drop period, the course does not appear on the transcript and tuition charges are credited to the account. Course may not be added or dropped after the final day of the designated add/drop period. See withdrawal process listed below.</p><p>Each student is responsible for completing, dropping, or withdrawing from all courses listed on his or her schedule. The schedule is retained in the Academic Records and Registration office on the database system and on WebAdvisor. Credit is given only for courses that appear on the schedule. Students who are registered and fail to attend receive a grade of "F" for the courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS ATTENDANCE</head><p>Students are expected to make every effort to attend all class meetings. Attendance standards for individual courses are established in writing by the instructor at the first class session. Students unable to attend the first class must contact the instructor ahead of time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS/CLASS</head><p>Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student's control) must request in writing to the instructor a grade of incomplete (I). The "I" grade must be removed within a specified period of time or the alternate grade is assigned. More information can be found under the "Grading" heading in this section of the Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWAL</head><p>Students are permitted to withdraw from an individual course, from all courses for an academic period, or from their program. The official date of withdrawal is the day the withdrawal form is submitted and/or received by the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The student receives a grade of "W" in the course. The grade is reflected on the transcript but not calculated in the grade point average. The date of withdrawal is used to determine the rate of refund (if applicable). Tuition only (not fees and books) is refunded in accordance with University policy. Tuition refund policy information can be found under the "Tuition Refunds" heading in the General Information section of this Catalog. The withdraw process varies by college. Traditional students who withdraw before the end of the published withdraw period for a semester must inform the Dean of Students in the Office of Student Affairs, The Dean of Students has a conference with any withdrawing student and authorizes withdrawal only after determining that the student has met financial and other obligations. Students who withdraw with proper authorization receive a grade of 'W' in each course for which they are enrolled at the time of withdrawal. Students who withdraw without giving proper notification of their intention to withdraw receive a grade of "F" in all courses in which they are enrolled during the semester of withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from a Course</head><p>The withdrawal period begins the day following the add/drop period and ends at the point at which approximately 75% of the course has been completed. A student who wishes to withdraw from a course or courses prior to the published final withdrawal date for the semester can access the on-line Course Withdrawal form on WebAdvisor. The official date of withdrawal is the day the form is submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The student should print and retain his/her copy of the withdrawal form until the grade is verified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-traditional/Online Students</head><p>Students are permitted to withdraw from an individual course, from all courses for an academic period, or from their program without academic penalty. Students may withdraw from a course(s) for the current term beginning the first business day following the add/drop deadline through 75% of the term. The course withdrawal form is available online through WebAdvisor. To withdraw from a program, students should contact his/her academic advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions</head><p>Withdrawal from the Program A student who chooses to withdraw from the program must give written notice of this decision to the appropriate program director or department director. Withdrawal from the School of Physical Therapy is not allowed in the last three weeks before the end of semester without an override from the dean. Overrides will only be considered for documented medical conditions. Any student who withdraws according to these procedures may be readmitted without reapplication and review if the following conditions are met:</p><p>• The student was in good academic standing before the withdrawal;</p><p>• The student returns to the program within one calendar year of the withdrawal;</p><p>• There are no outstanding requirements from the Loretto Heights School of Nursing Student Affairs Committee (undergraduate nursing students only).</p><p>If these conditions are not met, the student must reapply to the program and be accepted for readmission. Initial acceptance into the program does not guarantee readmission. Also, readmission does not guarantee an uninterrupted sequence of course work.</p><p>Students in the School of Pharmacy and the School of Physical Therapy must submit a written request for readmission to the appropriate dean. Additionally, students may be required to pass a competency exam verifying retention of previous course material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from a Course</head><p>Students may withdraw from a course with the approval of their academic advisor and/or the appropriate department director. Traditional, Accelerated and CHOICE nursing students start the withdraw process through their academic advisor. All other students may submit the course withdrawal form available on line through WebAdvisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECIAL REGISTRATION</head><p>Special registration requests are not available on WebAdvisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INDEPENDENT STUDY</head><p>Independent Study is individually supervised research under the direction of a faculty member in a discipline or topic of study not covered in a scheduled course. Approval and registration must occur prior to the add/drop deadline. The course number generally used is 490/4900 for the undergraduate level and 690/6900 for the graduate level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECIAL STUDY</head><p>Special Study is defined as a normally scheduled course that is not available at a time or location feasible for timely completion of graduation requirements. The course prefix, number and title are the same as the regularly scheduled course. Course requirements are met under the supervision of a faculty member who is approved to teach the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXTENDED STUDY</head><p>Extended Study provides a means for students to earn one semester hour in addition to existing credit value for a course. The course prefix, number, and title are the same as the course listed in the Schedule of Courses. Extended Study requirements are met under the supervision of a faculty member who teaches the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UPPER DIVISION REGISTRATION</head><p>Traditional freshmen and sophomores are permitted to take upper division courses only if they have completed the prerequisites for the course and if they have obtained the permission of the instructor of the course. Normally, that approval is given by obtaining the instructor's signature on the Registration form prior to submitting the form to the Academic Records and Registration office. Juniors and seniors must also complete the prerequisites of an upper division course as listed in this Catalog before enrolling for the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE AUDIT</head><p>Prior to graduation, students desiring to participate in a course for personal enrichment and exploration are permitted to audit a course with written permission from an associate dean or designated administrative staff/program director. Students are expected to participate in the course by maintaining normal attendance and completing course assignments but are exempt from assigned tests. Students receive an "AU" grade with no credit earned and are charged the regular tuition rate. Some programs do not permit auditing.</p><p>Students should contact the appropriate program for information and permission regarding the audit option. The audit option must be selected by the add/drop deadline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADING INFORMATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University-Wide Course Grading System</head><p>The *Where no grade points are indicated, the grade does not calculate into the grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/No Pass Grades</head><p>Pass/No Pass (P/NP) grading is available for courses with regular grading for traditional undergraduate students in the Anderson College of Business, the College for Computer &amp; Information Sciences, Regis College, and Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions students in the Traditional Nursing program. In some graduate programs, selected courses permit P/NP grading. All Veterans must contact the certifying official in the Academic Records and Registration office before registering for a course on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Traditional and RHCHP Traditional Nursing Students Only:</head><p>• The P/NP option is available to undergraduate students who have completed 30 hours of graded coursework. Transfer students must have completed 20 hours of graded coursework at Regis University before they may exercise the P/NP option. Students on academic probation are not encouraged to take courses (with the exception of remedial courses) on a P/NP basis, but may do so with the approval of the appropriate dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The P/NP option may be exercised for only one course each semester, and the total number of hours that may be taken on a P/NP basis for credit at Regis is limited to 18 semester hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The P/NP option may be exercised for only two of the Core studies course requirements. Also, the option cannot be used for courses in the area of the major or minor, except for experiential courses such as field experience, approved by the individual departments or divisions, and for student teaching courses in the Education department.</p><p>• If a student changes his or her major and has already taken a required lower division course in the new major area on a P/ NP basis, the course meets the requirement. Upper division courses are evaluated by the department or division as to whether or not the course(s) should be accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>To register for a course on the P/NP basis, the student must obtain a special form from Enrollment Services and return it, properly completed, no later than the last day of the withdrawal period for the semester. This required form is in addition to the regular registration forms. After the last day of the withdrawal period, a student may not request a grading change for the course.</p><p>• The minimum passing level for undergraduate courses taken on a P/NP basis is a "C." The student receives appropriate hours of credit toward graduation for a "P" grade, but that grade is not calculated in the grade point average. The student does not earn credit hours for an "N" grade, nor is that grade calculated in the grade point average.</p><p>• Students enrolled in experiential courses under the P/NP option (e.g., field experience course in accounting, business administration, economics, psychology, sociology, etc., and student teaching courses in education) are eligible for the Dean's List provided they are enrolled for a total of 15 or more hours, of which 12 are graded hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades of Incomplete</head><p>A grade of Incomplete or "I" denotes that the required work for the course is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances mean, for example, that an accident, an illness, a death, or a major life transition has occurred. This grade is awarded at the discretion of the instructor and is submitted with an alternate grade (i.e., I/D, I/F).</p><p>A student must submit a written request (or school form) to the instructor that an Incomplete grade be assigned. The length of time and the remaining requirements to complete the course are determined by the instructor; however, the maximum length of time for completion is the end of the following semester. Summer semester does not apply to Regis College/Traditional Nursing students. Faculty will notify students in writing of the approval/denial of their request and provide instructions and guidelines required to resolve the Incomplete grade.</p><p>If coursework is not completed by the end of the next applicable semester and a grade change form submitted by the instructor, the Incomplete grade reverts to the alternate grade assigned by the instructor and is calculated in the grade point average. Some programs have restrictions on alternate grade assignment, so students should refer to the appropriate program or department section of this Catalog for specific information.</p><p>Due to rare circumstances, a student may request in writing that an extension of the Incomplete grade be granted. The extension must be approved by the academic dean or his/her designee for the respective program/school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequences of an Incomplete Grade</head><p>• Teacher licensure/certification or any graduation completion postings cannot be recorded on the academic transcript until Incomplete grades are changed and a set grade point average is calculated.</p><p>• Army regulations require that students receiving tuition assistance complete coursework within 60 days of when the Incomplete is assigned. Some corporations may not reimburse tuition monies if the grade of Incomplete is assigned.</p><p>• Students already on academic probation who receive an Incomplete grade will be continued on probation.</p><p>• Students who are receiving financial aid and receive an Incomplete grade will be subject to review and may be placed on Financial Aid suspension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of In Progress ("IP")</head><p>In Progress "IP" grades may be assigned to students in a graduatelevel capstone project/thesis course where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the academic period provided for assignment completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an "IP" grade may be assigned. The student can be granted a period of up to 24 months to complete the required assignments. The grade recorded on the student's record is "IP/F" or "IP/N" depending on whether the grade for the course is a letter or Pass/No Pass grade. If the student does not complete the assignment within the 24 month period, the "IP" grade reverts to the alternate "F" or "NP" grade. The decision on the completion deadline is determined by the instructor in consultation with the student; however, the final decision is made by the instructor. Some graduate degree programs may have a more restrictive maximum completion time for an In Progress grade. More specific policies may appear in the appropriate school section of this Catalog.</p><p>The student is not officially registered during the period of the "In Progress" unless the student is officially enrolled in other courses and, therefore, may not be eligible for financial aid or other benefits during the "In Progress" period.</p><p>"IP" grades will be assigned only for the graduate-level capstone courses where a project or a thesis is the primary output of the course. In Progress is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases the appropriate grade is Incomplete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPEAT GRADE IMPROVEMENT OPTION</head><p>Students have the option of improving a grade earned in a course at Regis University by repeating the same course at Regis. The following guidelines apply:</p><p>• Regardless of whether the repeat grade is higher or lower than the original grade, the last grade earned is the grade for which credit is awarded and grade points are calculated in the grade point average. All previous grades are replaced with an (R) notation and the hours are recorded as zero (0.00) with a repeat notation indicating that the course has been retaken.</p><p>• Courses taken for grade improvement must be taken with the same grading option (i.e., letter grading versus Pass/No Pass) when repeated.</p><p>• If a student withdraws from a course being taken for a repeat grade, the original grade remains on the transcript and a grade of "W" is posted to the transcript for the second course.</p><p>• The Repeat Grade Improvement Option applies only to grades earned at Regis University from the fall semester 1972 to the present.</p><p>The Repeat Grade Improvement Option may be exercised only while the course requested for repeat remains active in the University's curriculum. Substitutions of similar or revised courses for the original course are not allowed. Upon graduation the Repeat Grade Improvement Option is no longer available for that educational intent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Repeatability</head><p>Except under the grade improvement option, courses should not be repeated. It is ultimately the responsibility of the student to assure that courses are not erroneously repeated. Should a course be erroneously repeated, the last entry is the only one for which credit hours are earned and grade points are calculated in the grade point average. There is no refund of tuition for courses erroneously repeated. If a course is repeated at another institution, it is considered duplicate credit and is not accepted in transfer. The Regis course remains on the student record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals of Disputed Grades</head><p>Students should refer to the appropriate college section for policies and procedures governing grade appeals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change of Recorded Grade</head><p>No final grade of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, or W submitted to the Academic Records and Registration office can be changed unless the change has received the written approval of the appropriate academic dean or his or her designee. Once this form has been completed by the instructor, the form is submitted to the office of the appropriate academic dean or designee for approval. As of January 1, 1983, no grade may be changed after it has been on the permanent record for one calendar year. This does not include courses retaken for repeat grade improvement.</p><p>It is expected that great care and attention is given in the awarding of grades so that the need for change is minimal. It is also expected that no instructor give a grade of "I" (Incomplete) unless unforeseen circumstances make it necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Reports</head><p>Only final grades are official and entered on the student's permanent record.</p><p>Grades for all current students are available online through WebAdvisor. I Grades cannot be given over the phone or e-mailed to the student.</p><p>Under federal legislation the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (hereafter "FERPA") grades may be released to parents or other parties only with the student's written authorization unless the parent claims the student as a dependent for federal income tax purposes and provides appropriate documentation. Release authorization is available online through WebAdvisor under the parent menu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA)</head><p>Only grades and credits earned at Regis University are used to calculate the student's grade point average. The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of attempted credits. Grade points earned are calculated by multiplying the number of credits for a course by the grade points associated with the grade received. Appropriate grade points for each grade awarded by the University appear in this section of this Catalog under the University-Wide Course Grading System heading. When no grade points are indicated, the grade and the credits do not calculate into the grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDENT RECORDS</head><p>Regis University maintains an educational record for each student who is or has been enrolled at the University. In accordance with FERPA the following student rights are covered by FERPA and afforded to all eligible students at Regis University:</p><p>• The right to inspect and review information contained in the student's educational records.</p><p>• The right to request amendment of the contents of the student's educational records if believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights and the right to have a hearing concerning such amendment request.</p><p>• The right to prevent disclosure without consent, with certain exceptions, of personally identifiable information from the student's educational records.</p><p>• The right to secure a copy of the University's policy.</p><p>• The right to file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Regis University to comply with the provisions of FERPA.</p><p>Each of these rights, with any limitations or exceptions, is explained in the University's policy statement, a copy of which may be obtained from the Academic Records and Registration office or online. The point of contact within the University for the exercise of all rights and the access to all information concerning student rights under FERPA is the Academic Records and Registration office. This specifically includes, but is not limited to, the procedure for amending a student's educational record, the procedure for filing a complaint to determine accuracy of a student's educational record, the procedure for filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, and the policy for determining which individuals within the University are "school officials" and what constitutes a "legitimate educational interest."</p><p>The University may provide directory information in accordance with the provisions of FERPA without the written consent of an eligible student, unless it is requested in writing that such information not be disclosed. The items listed below are designated as Directory Information and may be released to any person for any purpose at the discretion of Regis University unless a written request for nondisclosure is on file:</p><p>• Name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, dates of attendance, class</p><p>• Photographs</p><p>• Previous institution(s) attended, major/minor field of study, awards, honors, degree(s) conferred</p><p>• Past and present participation in officially recognized sports and activities, physical factors of athletes (height and weight), and their date and place of birth Current eligible students may prohibit general disclosure of this Directory Information by notifying the Academic Records and Registration office in writing. Situations involving non-release of Directory Information that are deemed as "extraordinary" by the student should be brought to the attention of the director of Academic Records. Regis University honors the request for one calendar year only; therefore, the student must file the request on an annual basis. The student should carefully consider the consequences of any decision to withhold any category of Directory Information. Regardless of the effect upon a student, Regis University assumes no liability that may arise out of its compliance with a request that such information be withheld. It is assumed that the failure on the part of the student to request the withholding of Directory Information indicates the student's consent to disclosure.</p><p>Any questions concerning the student's rights and responsibilities regarding FERPA should be referred to the Academic Records and Registration office. General information and forms pertaining to FERPA may be found at www.regis.edu.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC STATUS NOTATIONS</head><p>Students in good standing have either no academic status notation on their transcript or an academic status of "Probation Removed" and are eligible to continue, return, or transfer elsewhere. A student with an academic status of probation ("Admitted on Probation," "Probation New," "Probation Continued"), suspension ("Academic Suspension"), or dismissal ("Academic Dismissal") has the appropriate notation recorded on the transcript. A student may continue or return when in a probationary academic status, but a suspended student is not eligible to return for one calendar year. A student who is expelled from the University is not eligible to return. All transcript notations are recorded within the appropriate semester from approximately 1950 to present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>Academic probation is an official sanction that is applied when a student falls below the minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average for the program. Academic probation may also be applied for violations of the academic integrity policy. Refer to the appropriate College section of this Catalog for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>Academic suspension is an official sanction that is applied when a student on academic probation fails to achieve the required minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average or other conditions established under their probation. Academic suspension may also be applied for violations of the academic integrity policy. Refer to the appropriate College section of this Catalog for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>Academic dismissal is an action taken by a School or College that renders a student ineligible to return to that School or College for any program of study. Academic dismissal may be imposed for serious violations of academic integrity or failure to meet the conditions of a prior academic suspension. In the case of academic suspension for grade point average, a student must have been suspended for low cumulative grade point average, been readmitted to the program on academic probation, and subsequently failed to achieve the required cumulative grade point average. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Expulsion</head><p>Academic expulsion is an action taken by Regis University that renders a student ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. Academic expulsion may be imposed by the Provost for serious violations of academic integrity or failure to meet the conditions of a prior academic suspension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCIPLINARY STATUS NOTATIONS</head><p>"Disciplinary Suspension" and "Disciplinary Expulsion" are recorded on the academic transcript within the appropriate semester. Students may petition to remove "Disciplinary Suspension" from the transcript by appealing to the Dean of Students. Notification of "Disciplinary Expulsion" appears on the transcript for five years. Following that period, a student may petition the University to have this notation removed from the transcript. A student who is expelled from the University is not eligible to return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANGES IN REQUIREMENTS</head><p>The reevaluation of requirements listed in this section is the responsibility of University councils and the Board of Trustees, and is subject to revision. The Regis University Catalog provisions in effect at the time of acceptance will prevail. All students wishing to transfer from one major and/or minor to another must meet all degree requirements at the time the transfer is made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAJOR DECLARATION</head><p>By the end of the sophomore year, each traditional undergraduate student must select a major area. In some majors, even earlier decisions are encouraged. The programs in accounting, business administration, computer science, economics, education, and the natural sciences require careful planning in order to meet all requirements in four years. For traditional undergraduate students, lower division requirements must be satisfied prior to submitting a Major Declaration form to the department for approval. Major Declaration forms may be obtained from the Anderson College of Business , the College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences, and the Regis College Dean's Office and must be filed with the appropriate department.</p><p>The major indicated on the Application for Admission form and the subsequent degree plan serve as the declaration of a major for all other Regis University programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEFINITION OF A MAJOR</head><p>The major consists of a minimum of 18 upper division hours (courses numbered 400 and above) in one subject area with grades of "C-" or better required. Most major areas require additional lower division coursework and/or additional upper division coursework beyond the minimum of 18 semester hours. See requirements for specific majors in each college section of this Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOUBLE MAJOR</head><p>To earn a double major, all requirements for both majors must be met (including a minor if either major has a required minor in a specific area). A written and/or comprehensive examination may be required in the majors selected. When both majors are offered within the same degree (e.g., Bachelor of Arts), that degree is awarded. When a double major consists of one major from the Bachelor of Arts and one major from the Bachelor of Science, a single degree, the Bachelor of Arts and Science, is awarded. When one of the majors is offered with the Bachelor of Applied Science or the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree (BSN), only the BASc or the BSN degree is awarded.</p><p>In all cases, both majors are recorded on the diploma and the transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACCALAUREATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS</head><p>No course in which the candidate received less than a grade of "D-" is acceptable credit for the Core Studies requirements. If a particular Core Studies course is also being used to meet departmental or major/minor requirements, the minimal acceptable grade for the course may be higher depending upon the program and whether the course is meeting lower-or upperdivision requirements. Students should refer to the appropriate program or department section of this Catalog for specific grade requirement information.</p><p>In addition to the completion of the academic requirements in Core Studies or major/minor requirements, the following requirements apply to each degree candidate:</p><p>• Students must complete 120 semester hours of academic coursework in which the candidate has earned a minimum cumulative Regis University grade point average of 2.000.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concurrent Baccalaureate Degrees</head><p>Occasionally, students are interested in earning two concurrent baccalaureate degrees at Regis University. The student must select one of the degrees as the first or primary degree. After admission to the primary program, the student must submit a written request for admission to the academic dean of the second program. If the dean approves the admission, that dean is responsible for notifying the dean of the primary degree program, the Academic Records office, and the student. Generally, the student completes the Core Studies requirements for the primary degree. If the second degree is offered from a college other than that offering the primary degree, the academic dean of the second college may require additional coursework to meet Core Studies requirements.</p><p>Major requirements for both degrees must be fully met. One-half of each major and one-half of any minor (if required by the major or if one is chosen) may be transferred to Regis upon entrance. All prerequisites and lower division requirements for the chosen majors and/or minors must be satisfied. Generally, courses utilized to meet upper division major requirements of one baccalaureate degree cannot be double counted to meet upper division major hours required for another baccalaureate degree unless the upper division hours are in excess of 18 hours. If necessary, substitute courses are designated by the appropriate academic dean. Each candidate must complete a minimum of 30 hours of residence at Regis for each degree. A minimum of 158 total credit hours is required to earn two degrees concurrently. In all cases, two diplomas are awarded and both degrees are recorded on the transcript.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERAL INFORMATION</head><p>Unless otherwise noted, the Anderson College of Business follows all policies and procedures as stated in the General Information section of this Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MISSION</head><p>Building on our Jesuit tradition of values-based experiential learning, the Anderson College of Business cultivates leaders of integrity who think critically, communicate clearly and implement innovative solutions to complex challenges. We partner with business and community leaders to enhance economic, environmental, and social well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How We Achieve the Mission:</head><p>Jesuit tradition: The Jesuit tradition of education focuses on the knowledge and skills one needs to succeed and also the emotional and moral sensibilities of the heart. We consider the values that drive decisions as a way to engage the whole person in their work. We also use learning experiences such as case studies, group projects, service learning, consulting partnerships, and internships to engage students with the world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>59</head><p>Cultivate leaders of integrity: Leaders are not necessarily the people at the top, but are those who influence and foster change.</p><p>We plant the seeds and support change agents who seek to initiate positive change. We guide students as they analyze ambiguous situations, communicate with others, build teams, and effectively respond to unanticipated challenges in an ethical and socially responsible manner.</p><p>Partner with business and community leaders: We seek partners who are transforming the practices and systems that will enhance the well-being of all. We challenge our students to develop sustainable and innovative solutions that balance business and economic success, environmental impact, and respect for others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VISION</head><p>To help business become stewards of society with the goal of improving the quality of life on Earth.</p><p>Based upon our collective work in reading and in conversation, our principles of stewardship guide us. These all coalesce into the overall purpose of stewardship: To improve the quality of life for all. And these principles frame stewardship as a foundational value expressed through action that protects and cares for others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VALUES</head><p>We achieve our mission by honoring and living out our core values.</p><p>• Character that demonstrates honesty, integrity, resilience and respect at all times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Competence that advances our professions and our lifelong skills of creativity, communication and critical thinking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Care for the whole person that honors the dignity of the individual in community with others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Compassionate leadership that courageously engages difficult economic, environmental and social challenges in the pursuit of a more just world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PURPOSE</head><p>Anderson College of Business offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, certificates, credit courses, and non-credit courses in both traditional and post-traditional formats.</p><p>Undergraduate offerings tailor learning to the student in the posttraditional program through classroom-based and online delivery and to students in the traditional 16-week program through classroom delivery. The College is structured to serve three general groups of undergraduate students:</p><p>• those who desire to experience a traditional undergraduate program</p><p>• those undergraduates who wish to complete a program leading to a degree and</p><p>• those who seek specialized training or knowledge to increase their competence in their current occupation or profession or to prepare themselves for a new occupation or profession.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OUR CORNERSTONES</head><p>• Learning through experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Driving change through innovation. • Building workforce capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Sustaining the earth for future generations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SERVICE LEARNING</head><p>Service Learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human, community, and business development needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning and development. Service Learning joins two complex concepts: community action, the "service" and efforts learned from that action and connect what is learned to existing knowledge, the "learning." Community-based learning serving business and nonprofit entities becomes service learning when it is connected to classroom curriculum related activities and contains opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences, thus allowing for consciousness raising and systemic change. This is particularly true for Jesuit education that has for centuries held a mission of forming men and women who seek to transform the world through service to others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANDERSON COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</head><p>Admissions requirements for Regis University students are outlined in this General Information section of this Catalog under the 'Regis University Admissions' heading.</p><p>More specific requirements for Anderson College of Business graduate degree admission can be found in this section of the Catalog under the heading 'Graduate Programs'.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOVERNING CATALOG</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Traditional Students</head><p>Traditional undergraduate students must adhere to the Core Studies requirements published in the Catalog in the year in which they entered their College. Graduating students must also meet the major(s) and minor(s) requirements as stated in the Catalog in effect when the major(s) and minor(s) were declared and approved. Undergraduate traditional students who leave the University and do not complete a Leave of Absence form--or if the form has expired (after two semesters) and they return--must meet the current Core and major/minor requirements. Requests for exceptions should be made in writing to the academic dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Traditional Undergraduate Students</head><p>Post-traditional students program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Undergraduate students have six years (72 months) from the date of acceptance to complete degree requirements. During the six-year period, students are permitted to benefit from any changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirement changes) that were implemented since the date of acceptance into the program. If the six years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission and the program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of reapplication. Further, post-traditional students who leave the University for three consecutive semesters or six consecutive eight-week terms must meet the Core and major/minor requirements of the current University Catalog at the time of return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Students</head><p>Graduate student program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Graduate students must complete all degree requirements within four years (48 months) from the date of acceptance, or move to the current catalog. During that fouryear period, students are permitted to benefit from any policy changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirements changes) that were implemented since the student's program acceptance. If the four years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission under the program of study as determined by the University Catalog requirements in effect at the date of reapplication. Further, graduate students who leave the University for three consecutive semesters or six consecutive eight-week terms must meet the requirements of the current University Catalog at the time of return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES</head><p>Students are expected to have college-level writing skills when they enter a program. These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage, and structure) along with analysis of issues, support of position, and clarity of thought. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the degree program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT ETHICS STATEMENT</head><p>An integral component of Anderson College of Business courses is student and faculty self-disclosure and the use of personal experience for the purpose of facilitating course work. Each student is expected to honor confidentiality as it pertains to student disclosure. It shall be a violation of the ethical standards to use shared information, comments, or opinions expressed by another student or facilitator/instructor in the educational setting in a manner which is intended to humiliate, embarrass, harass, damage, or otherwise injure the student in the student's personal, public or business/professional life. In addition, confidentiality must be upheld by not disclosing any information which would identify a particular individual or organization.</p><p>An additional integral component of higher education is challenging one's own perceptions and beliefs regarding the course content and integrating information as well as understanding opposing perceptions and beliefs. Thus, students have the right to choose how much they will disclose and must also accept the responsibility of respecting disclosure of other students and facilitators/instructors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT</head><p>In the spirit of the Jesuit mission of Regis University, Anderson College of Business students and faculty share responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. This includes using information technology responsibly in online and other courses. In order for faculty members to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, online courses, and other learning areas, the Anderson College of Business and the faculty expect students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner and not engage in disruptive behavior, disorderly conduct or intentionally interfere in the freedom of expression of others. "Disruptive Behavior" or "Disorderly Conduct" as applied in all academic settings and formats (i.e., classroom, online, independent study, etc.) means behavior that a reasonable faculty member or student would view as intentionally or recklessly interfering with normal academic functions, university events, or university sponsored activities.</p><p>Examples include, but are not limited to: persistently speaking or commenting without being recognized or interrupting other speakers; behavior that distracts the class from the subject matter or discussion; or, in extreme cases, physical threats, harassing behavior or personal insults; refusal to comply with faculty direction including refusal to work in a group, using a cell phone or pager during a classroom session, inappropriate mediated communication; or behavior that has a negative impact in any learning environment.</p><p>Disruptive behavior also includes any other behavior covered by the Regis University Student Handbook: Code of Conduct which can be found at www.regis.edu.</p><p>Students who fail to adhere to acceptable behavioral standards may be subject to discipline which may include reprimand, dismissal from the class, and/or expulsion from the Anderson College of Business. Students who wish to appeal a decision regarding the consequences of their behavior should follow the Appeal Process outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEARNING FORMATS</head><p>A variety of learning formats and locations offer students flexibility and options in completing graduate and undergraduate study. Among all degrees, close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice as well as opportunities to develop skills and abilities that prepare learners for changing demands of the workplace.</p><p>Students may complete Regis University academic course work through any combination of the following learning formats as availability of course format permits:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classroom-Based</head><p>Classroom-based courses are offered in eight, and 16-week academic periods, weekend intensive format, or in summer intensive format. Most traditional courses meet two or three days per week on the Northwest Campus for a total of 37 contact hours. Most post-traditional courses meet one or two days/evenings each week for a total of 32 or more contact hours. Course learning format, selection, and availability vary by campus location.</p><p>Students choosing the post-traditional format usually study a single subject area for a concentrated period of time. This course format is based on a facilitative model of learning.</p><p>Most post-traditional classes require a minimum of 19-25 hours of combined study and classroom time each week, depending on the course content, course length and the student's learning style. While this model allows for degree completion in a shorter period of time, there is an increased expectation for independent learning outside the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online</head><p>Online courses are generally offered in a post-traditional eightweek format over the Internet. These courses are designed to provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through online discussions and e-mail. Course materials generally include textbook(s) and online workshops.</p><p>Lifestyle issues--including variable work schedules, family responsibilities, physical limitations, or geographical inaccessibility--make this a viable option for students pursuing higher educational goals. Online courses have highly structured requirements and deadlines which fall within eight week academic terms.</p><p>Online students need to have computer equipment and skills at a specified minimum level. Please check with the undergraduate program for current requirements. Students should allocate a minimum of 20 hours each week for completing course assignments and participating in online discussions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CURRICULUM</head><p>Regardless of format, each course offered focuses on course objectives, required learning activities, and outcome evaluation. Close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice, as well as the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that prepare students for changing demands of the workplace.</p><p>Because effective written and oral communication skills are essential in both occupational and academic environments, the Anderson College of Business emphasizes the development of these skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACULTY</head><p>In addition to full-time faculty, the Anderson College of Business makes use of facilitators, independent study course instructors, and presenters who are frequently working professionals representing various corporations, businesses, and organizations. All hold a master's or doctoral degree, and bring academic theory and current professional experience to the learning environment. An assessment process is employed to determine not only the knowledge base of each selected faculty member, but also the faculty member's ability to facilitate the learning of all students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC ADVISING</head><p>A unique feature of Anderson College of Business is its emphasis on academic advising. Advisors are available to assist with course planning and degree development as needed. Advisors provide assistance and recommendations to students from the point of admission through graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit Approval</head><p>In order to ensure acceptance of transfer credit from other institutions once students are enrolled at Regis University, all transfer courses need prior approval of an undergraduate advisor, graduate faculty advisor, or designee.</p><p>Concurrent Enrollment Request forms may be obtained online through WebAdvisor. Undergraduate students are not permitted to take the last 30 semester hours of coursework at another institution without permission of the associate dean for the Anderson College of Business. A grade of "C-" or better must be earned for undergraduate coursework to be accepted in transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGISTRATION</head><p>The course schedules in the Anderson College of Business are originated by the respective programs. Students should register online via WebAdvisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Add/Drop</head><p>Students may drop a course through the end of the published add/drop period online through WebAdvisor. When students drop a course within the add/drop period, the course does not appear on the transcript and tuition charges are credited to the account. Students in the traditional program must have approval from their advisor to add/drop courses. Students are responsible for dropping courses they do not plan to attend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OTHER REGIS UNIVERSITY COLLEGES OR PROGRAMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate</head><p>Students may take courses in multiple programs within colleges to fulfill degree requirements for graduation. Students wishing to cross-register within the University are not required to complete an application. Students should consult with their academic advisor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate</head><p>Anderson College of Business policy provides students with the opportunity to transfer up to six credit hours of graduate course work completed within the past five years into a graduate degree plan. Generally, this policy is used to accept course work completed prior to admission into the graduate program. However, under special circumstances, students have the opportunity to complete work in other Regis graduate programs while enrolled in an Anderson College of Business graduate program and receive credit for the courses toward degree requirements.</p><p>To register for graduate courses in another college/program, a student must meet all requirements of the college/program whose course work is taken. Suitability of course work from other Regis graduate programs for Anderson College of Business degree requirements depends on several factors: relevance of the course to the student's needs and goals; compatibility of the course with Anderson College of Business graduate mission and goals; fit of the course into the requirements of the student's degree and/or specialization; and suitability of the course for credit in the area of Business Administration. Approval for transfers under this policy must be obtained from the student's academic advisor prior to registration.</p><p>Students enrolled in other Regis University graduate programs and in Good Standing may register for Anderson College of Business graduate courses that are either classroom-based or online. To do so the student must: have the approval from the student's academic advisor in the program in which the student is currently enrolled and obtain written approval from the appropriate Anderson College of Business graduate program chair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses eligible for cross registration include all Anderson</head><p>College of Business graduate courses for which there is no prerequisite requirement. If a student wishes to enroll in a course for which one or more prerequisite course exists, the student must satisfy all prerequisite requirements before he/she will be permitted to enroll. Permission to enroll in Anderson College of Business graduate courses does not guarantee that the courses can be used toward the student's degree requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE AVAILABILITY</head><p>Regis University does not guarantee that courses will be offered at the same campus location or on the same day as they were offered for a previous academic period. A course is subject to cancellation if the minimum student registration for that course is not met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS ATTENDANCE</head><p>Students are expected to make every effort to attend all class meetings. Attendance standards for individual courses are established on the Anderson College of Business policies webpage and/or in writing by the instructor at the first class session. Students are responsible for reading these policies in the course syllabus and/or on the Anderson College of Business policy webpage. Students unable to attend the first class must contact the instructor ahead of time.</p><p>Students in an eight week course who are absent from two classes or fail to participate in two weeks of online classes may receive a failing grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS/CLASS</head><p>Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student's control) must request in writing to the instructor a grade of incomplete (I). The "I" grade must be removed within a specified period of time or the alternate grade is assigned. More information can be found under the "Grading" heading in this section of the Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Traditional</head><p>The average class load is 15 to 18 semester hours. Ordinarily, only students with a 3.000 minimum cumulative grade point average and no grades of Incomplete are allowed to carry more than 18 semester hours. Permission to carry 19 or more semester hours (course overload) must be obtained from the associate dean for the Anderson College of Business. If, in the judgment of the associate dean, a student benefits by a reduced course load, the student is restricted to a course load of fewer than 15 semester hours.</p><p>Students in the traditional program will be allowed to register for no more than one post-traditional course each eight-week session, but only when the traditional schedule of courses during the corresponding semester does not exceed 12 semester hours. If the traditional schedule of courses is fewer than 12 semester hours, additional post-traditional courses may be allowed with the permission of the associate dean of the Anderson College of Business.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Post-Traditional</head><p>Students in the post-traditional undergraduate program who wish to register for more than two courses in any five-or eight-week term, or more than 18 semester hours in one semester must receive approval from the Anderson College of Business Undergraduate Advising department. Students must obtain and submit an Overload Request form 30 days prior to taking the overload credit to the Anderson College of Business Undergraduate Advising Department. The advisor will:</p><p>• Verify that students have a 3.000 grade point average or higher.</p><p>• Ensure that students have no incomplete grades pending.</p><p>• Contact students regarding approval or denial of the request.</p><p>No further overloads are approved if students receive any incomplete grades and/or fall below a 3.000 grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate</head><p>Students are considered to be enrolled full time if they are registered for six semester hours in one semester. Students who want to register for more than six semester hours in any semester should consult with their academic advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADING</head><p>For additional information on incomplete grades, change of recorded grade, and repeat for higher grade, students should refer to the University General Information section of this Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of Incomplete</head><p>If a grade of Incomplete is approved by the instructor for an Anderson College of Business course, the grade assigned is an "I" along with an alternate grade (i.e. I/D, I/F). The length of time for completion is determined by the instructor but may not exceed the end of the following term/semester. If the work is not completed by the deadline, the Incomplete will revert to the alternate grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of "In Progress"</head><p>"In Progress" grades are given to students in graduate capstone project courses, graduate thesis courses or practicum/internship courses where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the eight weeks or semester (if a semester-based course) provided for completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an "In Progress" grade can be granted for a period of up to one year (12 months) to complete the capstone project course or practicum/internship. The grade to be recorded in the student's record is IP/F or IP/NP depending on whether the approved grade in a letter grade or Pass/No Pass. If the student does not satisfactorily complete the course within the one year period, the grade reverts to the "F" or "NP" grade.</p><p>"In Progress" grades will only be given in the capstone/thesis courses or practicum/internship courses. "In Progress" is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases if the student is unable to complete the course work for an approved reason and the instructor approves, the appropriate grade is Incomplete with an alternate grade (i.e. I/D, I/F) and the student has no more than the eight weeks or equivalent term to complete the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Reports</head><p>All grades are reported at the end of each academic period, at which time they become official and are entered on the students' permanent record. Grade reports are no longer mailed to students; however, grades may be accessed online through the WebAdvisor link at www.regis.edu. Grades cannot be given over the phone or e-mailed to the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals of Disputed Grades</head><p>Students who wish to dispute a grade earned in a course should use the following procedures:</p><p>1. The student contacts the instructor of the course to request a review of the issue. 2. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student submits a written request for review of the grade to the department chair for the course. The written request must be initiated within 60 days after the last official day of the term in which the course in question was taken. The request must provide rationale indicating why the grade earned is not appropriate, and all relevant documentation must be included (course syllabus, copies of exams, quizzes, papers, presentation materials, etc.). The request must include the student's name, address, e-mail address, course number, instructor name, and the term in which the course was completed. 3. The department chair reviews all documentation submitted.</p><p>If needed, the degree chair contacts the student and the instructor to arrange a personal interview. The faculty chair approves or disapproves the appeal. If the department chair approves the appeal, a Change of Grade form is completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The department chair informs the student and the instructor in writing of the decision regarding the appeal. 4. If the grade dispute is not satisfactorily resolved, the student may appeal the decision to the Associate Dean of the Anderson College of Business. This written appeal must be submitted within two calendar weeks of receipt of the decision in step 3 above.</p><p>The Associate Dean will review the proceedings and any additional information provided by the student. The decision of the Associate Dean is final. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing</head><p>Anderson College of Business undergraduate students must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade of less than "C-" in an upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward completion of major or minor requirements. A grade of less than "C-" in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses may apply toward graduation.</p><p>To sustain good academic standing at the graduate level, a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 for 6000-level course work is required. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned in the 6000level courses, by the total number of semester hours attempted in those courses. No more than two courses with grades of "C" can count toward graduation requirements. A grade lower than a "C" (e.g. "C-") is not counted toward degree requirements, but is included in the cumulative grade point average.</p><p>Students with deficient grades and are no longer in Good Standing have the option of improving a grade earned in a course at Regis University by repeating the same course at Regis University. Information regarding the Repeat Grade Improvement Option can be found in the General Information section of this Catalog. Students should discuss this options with their advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Warning</head><p>An undergraduate student with a semester grade point average below 2.000 and a cumulative grade point average above 2.000 is placed on academic warning. Although academic warning indicates an academic deficiency, it is not as severe as academic probation and is not posted on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probation</head><p>Anderson College of Business undergraduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 at the end of any given semester is placed on academic probation. During the next semester (fall, spring, summer for post-traditional students or fall and spring for traditional students) of enrollment, the University expects the student to raise the student's cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. If the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.000, the student may be academically suspended at the end of the probationary semester. The student must work closely with the student's advisor to determine the number of semester hours to be taken during the probationary semester to maximize the possibility of earning the required cumulative 2.000 grade point average by the end of the semester. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean. Academic probation is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>Occasionally, a student's Regis University cumulative grade point average is so low that the student finds it mathematically impossible to attain a 2.000 cumulative grade point average during only one semester. In this case, the student may enter into an agreement with an advisor of the Anderson College of Business to earn a provisional grade point average for the semester. The agreed-upon grade point average is set within a range that is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student. If the provisional semester grade point average is earned for the semester, but the student's cumulative grade point average is still below 2.000, the student may be permitted to continue on probation rather than be suspended.</p><p>Undergraduate students accepted on probation by the Anderson College of Business may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 2.000 cumulative grade point average.</p><p>Graduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 for 6000-level course(s) at the end of any given semester are placed on academic probation. After one semester on probation, a student's performance will be reviewed by the appropriate department chair and Assistant Dean. Students who are not successful in raising their grade point average to 3.000 will be considered for suspension by the department chair and Assistant Dean. Students on probation are permitted to take only one course per term and are not permitted to have an Incomplete grade while on probation. In addition, graduate students who receive a grade of "C" or less in two courses are subject to academic review. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suspension</head><p>If an Anderson College of Business student has been placed on academic probation and does not achieve a 2.000 (undergraduate) or 3.000 (graduate) cumulative grade point average at the end of the next semester of enrollment, he/she is suspended. Academic suspension is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript). Students are formally notified of their suspension from Regis University in a letter from the Dean.</p><p>Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous semester and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.</p><p>After one calendar year, the student may apply for readmission by fulfilling the following written requirements:</p><p>1. Submit a letter requesting readmission and an explanation of the previous academic difficulties and how the problem(s) have been addressed.</p><p>2. Submit a written contract, signed by the student and the appropriate Assistant Dean, which states how the student will meet the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average within a defined period.</p><p>3. An official transcript showing at least 12 semester hours of acceptable academic course work completed at a regionally accredited college or university (undergraduate students only).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dismissal</head><p>Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis University by which the student is rendered ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, a student must have been suspended, applied for and been readmitted to Regis University on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is pre-determined by the student and the assistant dean. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure</head><p>Students who wish to appeal their suspension/dismissal must complete the following requirements within 30 days (or sooner if indicated in the letter) of the date on the letter of notification for Suspension/Dismissal.</p><p>The following information should be submitted in the form of a letter to the Academic Dean.</p><p>1. Provide a detailed account of the reasons surrounding the student's academic difficulties.</p><p>2.

CCIS recognizes that active learning best supports the needs of all learners and integrates significant experiential elements across all programs. Additionally, CCIS recognizes that lifelong learning is integral to growth and aims to instill a passion for lifelong learning in all graduates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SERVICE LEARNING</head><p>Service Learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning and development. Service Learning joins two complex concepts: community action, the "service" and efforts learned from that action and connect what is learned to existing knowledge, the "learning." Community service becomes service learning when it is connected to classroom curriculum and activities and contains opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences, thus allowing for consciousness raising and systemic change. This is particularly true for Jesuit education that has for centuries held a mission of forming men and women who seek to transform the world through service to others.</p><p>The Service Learning program seeks to assist faculty in integrating social justice and service learning concepts and activities across the curriculum in undergraduate and graduate programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</head><p>Admissions requirements for Regis University students are outlined in this General Information section of this Catalog under the 'Regis University Admissions' heading.</p><p>More specific requirements for College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences graduate degree admission can be found in this section of the Catalog under the heading 'Graduate Programs'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC INFORMATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOVERNING CATALOG Traditional Students</head><p>Traditional undergraduate students must adhere to the Core Studies requirements published in the Catalog in the year in which they entered their College. Graduating students must also meet the major(s) and minor(s) requirements as stated in the Catalog in effect when the major(s) and minor(s) were declared and approved. Undergraduate traditional students who leave the University and do not complete a Leave of Absence form--or if the form has expired (after two semesters) and they return--must meet the current Core and major/minor requirements. Requests for exceptions should be made in writing to the academic dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Traditional Undergraduate Students</head><p>Accelerated students program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Undergraduate students have seven years (84 months) from the date of acceptance to complete degree requirements. During the seven year period, students are permitted to benefit from any changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirement changes) that were implemented since the date of acceptance into the program. If the seven years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission and the program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of reapplication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Students</head><p>Student program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Graduate students must complete all degree requirements within six years (72 months) from the date of the student's acceptance into the program. During that six-year period, students are permitted to benefit from any policy changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirements changes) that were implemented since the student's program acceptance. If the six years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission and the program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of reapplication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES</head><p>Students are expected to have college-level writing skills when they enter a program. These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage and structure) along with analysis of issues, support of position, and clarity of thought. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the degree program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT</head><p>In the spirit of the Jesuit mission of Regis University, students and faculty share responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. This includes using information technology responsibly in online and other courses. In order for faculty members to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, online courses, and other learning areas, the College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences and the faculty expect students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner and not engage in disruptive behavior, disorderly conduct or intentionally interfere in the freedom of expression of others. "Disruptive Behavior" or "Disorderly Conduct" as applied in all academic settings and formats (i.e., classroom, online, independent study, etc.) means behavior that a reasonable faculty member or student would view as intentionally or recklessly interfering with normal academic functions, university events, or university sponsored activities.</p><p>Examples include, but are not limited to: persistently speaking or commenting without being recognized or interrupting other speakers; behavior that distracts the class from the subject matter or discussion; or, in extreme cases, physical threats, harassing behavior or personal insults; refusal to comply with faculty direction including refusal to work in a group, using a cell phone or pager during a classroom session, inappropriate mediated communication; or behavior that has a negative impact in any learning environment.</p><p>Disruptive behavior also includes any other behavior covered by the Regis University Student Handbook: Code of Conduct which can be found at www.regis.edu.</p><p>Students who fail to adhere to acceptable behavioral standards may be subject to discipline which may include reprimand, dismissal from the class and/or expulsion from the College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences. Students who wish to appeal a decision regarding the consequences of their behavior should follow the Appeal Process outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEARNING FORMATS</head><p>A variety of learning formats and locations offer students flexibility and options in completing graduate and undergraduate study. Among all degrees, close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice as well as opportunities to develop skills and abilities that prepare learners for changing demands of the workplace.</p><p>Students may complete Regis University academic course work through any combination of the following learning formats as availability of course format permits:</p><p>• classroom-based courses</p><p>• online courses</p><p>• blended courses (classroom-based and online combination)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classroom-Based</head><p>Classroom-based courses are offered in multiple academic periods and formats. Most accelerated format courses meet one or two days/evenings each week for a total of 20 to 32 contact hours. Course learning format, selection, and availability vary by campus location.</p><p>Most accelerated classes require a minimum of 19-25 hours of combined study and classroom time each week, depending on the course content, course length and the student's learning style. While this model allows for degree completion in a shorter period of time, there is an increased expectation for independent learning outside the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online</head><p>Online courses are generally offered in an accelerated eightweek format over the Internet. These courses are designed to provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through a variety of means including online discussions, e-mail, and synchronous communications. Educational technologies like synchronous and asynchronous web technologies and e-mail offer learners convenience and flexibility. Online courses have highly structured requirements and deadlines which fall within the academic terms.</p><p>Online students must have computer equipment and skills at a specified minimum level. Please check with the program for current requirements. Students should allocate a minimum of 20 hours each week for completing course assignments and participating in online discussions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CURRICULUM</head><p>Regardless of format, each course focuses on course objectives, required learning activities, and outcome evaluation. Close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice, as well as the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that prepare students for changing demands of the workplace.</p><p>Since effective written and oral communication skills are essential in both occupational and academic environments, all courses emphasize the development of these skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACULTY</head><p>Faculty members are frequently working professionals representing various corporations, businesses and organizations. All hold a master's or doctoral degree, and bring academic theory and current professional experience to the learning environment. An assessment process is employed to determine not only the knowledge base of each selected faculty member, but also his/her ability to facilitate the learning of adult students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC ADVISING</head><p>Academic advisors are available to assist with course planning and degree development as needed. Advisors provide assistance and recommendations to students from the point of admission through graduation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OTHER REGIS PROGRAMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD</head><p>Undergraduate students who wish to register for more than two courses in any five-or eight-week term, or more than 18 semester hours in one semester must receive approval from the Associate Dean. Students must obtain and submit an Overload Request form 30 days prior to taking the overload credit to his or her advisor. The advisor will:</p><p>• Verify that students have a 3.000 grade point average or higher.</p><p>• Ensure that students have no incomplete grades pending.</p><p>• Request approval from the Associate Dean</p><p>• Contact students regarding approval or denial of the request.</p><p>No further overloads are approved if students receive any incomplete grades and/or fall below a 3.000 grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADING</head><p>For information on incomplete grades, change of recorded grade, and repeat for higher grade, students should refer to the University General Information section of this Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of Incomplete</head><p>Grades of incomplete may be approved by the instructor for a student, if the student has completed at least 75% of the course work and experiences an unexpected event. If a grade of Incomplete is approved by the instructor for a course, the incomplete grade assigned is "I/F". The length of time for completion is determined by the instructor but may not exceed the end of the following term. If the work is not completed by the deadline, the Incomplete will revert to a grade of "F".</p><p>Students may have only one course in which there is an incomplete grade pending at any time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of "In Progress"</head><p>"In Progress" grades are given to students in graduate capstone project courses, graduate thesis courses or practicum/internship courses where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the eight weeks or semester (if a semester-based course) provided for completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an "In Progress" grade can be granted for a period of up to one year (12 months) to complete the capstone project course or practicum/internship. The grade to be recorded in the student's record is IP/N (In Progress/No Pass). If the student does not satisfactorily complete the course within the one-year period, the grade reverts to the "F" or "No Pass" grade.</p><p>"In Progress" grades will only be given in the capstone/thesis courses or practicum/internship courses. "In Progress" is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases if the student is unable to complete the course work for an approved reason and the instructor approves, the appropriate grade is Incomplete/F (I/F) and the student has no more than the eight weeks or equivalent term to complete the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals of Disputed Grades</head><p>Students who wish to dispute a grade earned in a course should use the following procedures:</p><p>1. The student contacts the instructor of the course to request a review of the issue. 2. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student submits a written request for review of the grade to the department chair. The written request must be initiated within 60 days after the last official day of the term in which the course in question was taken. The request must provide rationale indicating why the grade earned is not appropriate, and all relevant documentation must be included (course syllabus, copies of exams, quizzes, papers, presentation materials, etc.) The request must include the student's name, address, e-mail address, course number, instructor name and the term in which the course was completed. 3. The department chair reviews all documentation submitted. If needed, the department chair contacts the student and the instructor to arrange a personal interview. The department chair approves or disapproves the appeal. If the department chair approves the appeal, a Change of Grade form is completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The department chair informs the student and the instructor in writing of the decision regarding the appeal. 4. If the grade dispute is not satisfactorily resolved, the student may appeal the decision to the Associate Dean of the College. This written appeal must be submitted within two calendar weeks of receipt of the decision in step 3 above. The Associate Dean will review the proceedings and any additional information provided by the student. The decision of the Associate Dean is final.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progression</head><p>In order to assure academic progression in a CCIS program, a student may repeat a course two times to remove a failing grade or a withdrawal (W) from a course. Students who fail or withdraw from a class three times may be subject to being removed from the program.</p><p>Note: Students in the Health Information Management program must maintain a 2.500 GPA at all times and will follow the same probation and suspension procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEAN'S LIST</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Traditional Students</head><p>For fall and spring semesters, a Dean's List is created for the College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences traditional undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of 15 or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.700 is placed on the Dean's List. Students who request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of 15 letter-graded semester hours. Students who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean's List.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Traditional Students</head><p>For fall, spring and summer semesters, a Dean's List is created for College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences posttraditional undergraduate students. A degree-seeking student who carries a semester load of twelve or more graded semester hours and who earns a minimum semester grade point average of 3.800 is placed on the Dean's List. A student who is required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course--and who also carries nine or more graded hours with a 3.800 semester grade point average--is eligible for inclusion on the Dean's List. Students who are not required during the semester to take a Pass/No Pass course but request the Pass/No Pass grading option are eligible if they earn a grade of Pass in the course and earn a minimum of twelve letter-graded semester hours. Student who earn a No Pass grade or an Incomplete grade are ineligible for the Dean's List.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing</head><p>A College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences undergraduate student must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade of less than "C-" in an upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward completion of major or minor requirements. A grade of less than "C-" in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation. To sustain good academic standing at the graduate level, a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 for 600-level course work is required. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned in the 600-level courses, by the total number of semester hours attempted in those courses. No more than two courses with grades of "C" can count toward graduation requirements. A grade lower than a "C" (e.g. "C-") is not counted toward degree requirements, but is included in the cumulative grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probation</head><p>The College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 at the end of any given semester is placed on academic probation. During the next semester (fall, spring, summer) of enrollment, the University expects the student to raise his/her cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. If the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.000, the student may be academically suspended at the end of the probationary semester. The student must work closely with his/her advisor to determine the number of semester hours to be taken during the probationary semester to maximize the possibility of earning the required cumulative 2.000 grade point average by the end of the semester. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean's Office. Academic probation is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>Undergraduate students accepted on probation by the College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 2.000 cumulative grade point average.</p><p>Graduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 for 600-level course(s) at the end of any given semester are placed on academic probation. After one semester on probation, a student's performance will be reviewed by the appropriate program coordinator and the Associate Dean. Students who are not successful in raising their grade point average to 3.000 will be considered for suspension by the program coordinator and Associate Dean. Students on probation are permitted to take only one course per term and are not permitted to have an Incomplete grade while on probation. In addition, graduate students who receive a grade of "C" or less in two courses are subject to academic review. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the Dean's Office.</p><p>Graduate students accepted on probation by the College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 3.000 cumulative grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suspension</head><p>If a student has been placed on academic probation and does not achieve a 2.000 (undergraduate) or 3.000 (graduate) cumulative grade point average at the end of the next semester of enrollment, he/she is suspended. Academic suspension is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript). Students are formally notified of their suspension from Regis University in a letter from the Dean.</p><p>Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous semester and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.</p><p>After one calendar year, the student may apply for readmission by fulfilling the following written requirements:</p><p>• Submit a letter requesting readmission and an explanation of the previous academic difficulties and how the problem(s) have been addressed.</p><p>• Submit a written contract for approval by the Associate Dean, signed by the student and the student's advisor, which states how the student will meet the required minimum grade point average or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average within a defined period.</p><p>• An official transcript showing at least 12 semester hours of acceptable academic course work completed at a regionally accredited college or university (undergraduate students only).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dismissal</head><p>Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis University by which the student is rendered ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, a student must have been suspended, applied for and been readmitted to Regis University on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum grade point average or an agreedupon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is pre-determined by the student and their advisor, and approved by the Associate Dean. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure</head><p>Students who wish to appeal their suspension/dismissal must complete the following requirements within 30 days of the date on the letter of notification for Suspension/Dismissal. 1. Write a letter or send an email to the Dean, College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences explaining: a. Why the student should not be suspended from the program or dismissed from the University. b. What prevented the student from successful progress toward completion of academic goals. c. That the student is committed to and ready to proceed with serious academic study. d. Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control. e. The names of the student's advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student (undergraduate students only). 2. Contact the advisor, faculty member, doctors, etc. to discuss the case. Any supporting statements from them must be received by the same deadline. Decisions on Suspension/Dismissal appeals by the Dean are final; no further appeals are accepted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CC&amp;IS UNDERGRADUATE CORE STUDIES REQUIREMENTS</head><p>Regis University recognizes that in today's diverse and complex world, education cannot be limited to one field of study. Instead, it is the goal of the University to give each student a full range of academic exposure. Building upon a 450 year educational tradition, our core education is grounded in a Jesuit and Catholic vision of human development. Through its emphasis on active learning and integrated reflective thinking, the core education should broaden a student's capacity to make critical judgments in a wide range of areas. To this end, CCIS requires that each student completes a liberal arts core curriculum. All Core courses will challenge students to reflect on tradition, continuity, and change while celebrating the essential goodness of the world, the compatibility of faith and reason, and the joy of learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of the Core Curriculum:</head><p>Rooted in Catholic tradition and Ignatian spirituality, the core is directed towards the education of the whole person and is committed to academic excellence through the disciplined search for knowledge and the joy of discovery and understanding. It celebrates the essential goodness of the world, provides opportunities for students to understand the ethical dimension present within all of their studies and allows them to cultivate respect for faith and reason, human diversity, and a special concern for social justice. It promotes leadership in service to others and towards the common good. Grounded in the Liberal Arts, the core promotes literacy in the major academic disciplines. It also challenges students to integrate their knowledge both by demonstrating an understanding of the relevance of the disciplines, one to another and bringing together their learning with the practice of everyday life and the needs of their communities. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLLEGE OF CONTEMPORARY LIBERAL STUDIE S (CCLS)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MISSION</head><p>The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies offers innovative, accelerated higher education for adult learners to meet their academic, professional and personal goals, and to make a positive impact in a changing society. Inspired by the Regis University Mission which focuses on the common good, we motivate and challenge a diverse community of students, faculty and staff to acquire knowledge, abilities and commitments necessary for distinguished professional work and leadership in service to others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PURPOSE</head><p>The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies develops and administers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, certificates, credit courses, and non-credit courses for both traditional and post-traditional learners. These offerings tailor learning to the adult learner through classroom-based, guided independent study, or distance learning delivery. The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies is structured to serve two general groups: those who wish to complete a program leading to a degree and those who seek specialized training or knowledge to increase their competence in their current occupation or profession or to prepare themselves for a new occupation or profession.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Master's Degrees</head><p>The Regis University College of Contemporary Liberal Studies is nationally recognized as a leader in education providing adults with innovative, professional, collaborative educational programs. Graduate study has a substantive tradition in CCLS, dating from 1978, when the first graduate degree was offered at Regis. The graduate degrees vary in content, delivery system and focus; however, they hold in common a commitment to serving adult learners with quality, value-oriented, relevant graduate education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</head><p>The Regis University College of Contemporary Liberal Studies recognizes that lifelong learning is integral to professional growth.</p><p>No longer can the working professional survive on the assumption that the completion of a formal program in a prescribed number of years is adequate preparation for a lifetime of work. This concept must give way to a concept of lifelong education as an integral part of a career.</p><p>The teaching/learning theories and strategies of the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies are drawn from the field of andragogy--the art and science of helping adults learn. In particular, four assumptions drawn from the work of Malcolm Knowles are implemented in programs offered by the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies.</p><p>Changes in Self-Concept: As people grow and mature their selfconcept moves from one of dependency to one of increasing selfdirectedness. Adult learners are accustomed to making important decisions in their personal and professional lives. An educational program that seeks to meet adult learners on a psychologically sound and healthy basis must encourage increasing selfdirectedness.</p><p>Role of Experience: As individuals mature, they accumulate an expanding reservoir of experience that causes them to be increasingly rich resources for learning. At the same time, this reservoir of experience provides them with a broadening base from which to relate new learning. Studies of cognitive changes in the adult years give evidence that both programmed and unprogrammed experiences produce deep-seated changes in the way adults approach their thinking. Accordingly, for adult learners, effective education demands increasing emphasis on experiential techniques that tap this experience.</p><p>Readiness to Learn: As individuals mature, their readiness to learn is decreasingly the product of biological development and academic pressures and is increasingly the product of the developmental tasks required for the performance of their evolving social roles. Adults, then, develop as workers, spouses, parents, organizational members and leaders, leisure time users and the like. There is no assumption that one has to sit passively by and wait for readiness to develop naturally. There are ways to stimulate readiness to learn through exposure to better models of performance, higher levels of aspiration and self-diagnostic procedures.</p><p>Orientations to Learning: Adults tend to have a problem-centered orientation to learning. While much of a child's education is one of postponed application, adults come to education because they are experiencing some need to improve their capabilities and demonstrate their competencies with some immediacy. Adult students want to apply tomorrow what they learn today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SERVICE LEARNING</head><p>Service Learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning and development. Service Learning joins two complex concepts: community action, the "service" and efforts learned from that action and connect what is learned to existing knowledge, the "learning." Community service becomes service learning when it is connected to classroom curriculum and activities and contains opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences, thus allowing for consciousness raising and systemic change. This is particularly true for Jesuit education that has for centuries held a mission of forming men and women who seek to transform the world through service to others.</p><p>The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies Service Learning program seeks to assist CCLS faculty in integrating social justice and service learning concepts and activities across the curriculum in undergraduate and graduate programs. The Service Learning program in CCLS houses information regarding service learning opportunities for faculty, students and staff including a database of service opportunities and resources for curricular information.</p><p>The CCLS Office of Service Learning offers site referrals and consultation, faculty development, resource development, service learning newsletter, and evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</head><p>Admissions requirements for Regis University students are outlined in this General Information section of this Catalog under the 'Regis University Admissions' heading.</p><p>More specific requirements for the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies graduate degree programs can be found in this section of the Catalog under the specific graduate degree information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Writing</head><p>Since graduate writing skills are critical to the successful completion of a master's degree in CCLS, any student receiving an evaluation of 'Unsatisfactory' on either writing portion of the essays submitted with the application, will be required to complete MLS 500 and/or MLS 501, or EDFD 500, or its equivalent prior to entering any graduate level courses in the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC INFORMATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOVERNING CATALOG</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Traditional Undergraduate Students</head><p>Post-traditional students program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Undergraduate students have six years (72 months) from the date of acceptance to complete degree requirements. During the six-year period, students are permitted to benefit from any changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirement changes) that were implemented since the date of acceptance into the program. If the six years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission and the program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of reapplication. Further, post-traditional students who leave the University for three consecutive semesters or six consecutive eight-week terms must meet the Core and major/minor requirements of the current University Catalog at the time of return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Students</head><p>Graduate student program of study is determined by the University Catalog degree completion requirements in effect at the date of acceptance. Graduate students must complete all degree requirements within four years (48 months) from the date of acceptance, or move to the current catalog. During that four-year period, students are permitted to benefit from any policy changes (e.g., transfer credit policy changes; does not include degree requirements changes) that were implemented since the student's program acceptance. If the four years expire before the student has completed all degree requirements, the student must apply for readmission under the program of study as determined by the University Catalog requirements in effect at the date of reapplication. Further, graduate students who leave the University for three consecutive semesters or six consecutive eight-week terms must meet the requirements of the current University Catalog at the time of return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES</head><p>Students are expected to have college-level writing skills when they enter a program. These skills include writing mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation, word usage and structure) along with analysis of issues, support of position, and clarity of thought. Each student is responsible for meeting the writing standards designated by the degree program.</p><p>For master's students, a personal computer with a modem is an indispensable management tool. The benefits of having full-time access to a personal computer far exceeds those obtained through sharing the limited amount of equipment in Regis' computer laboratories. Students are encouraged to have access to their own personal computer, either through personal ownership, rental, or arrangements made with their employer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT ETHICS STATEMENT</head><p>An integral component of CCLS courses is student and facilitator/instructor self-disclosure and the use of personal experience for the purpose of facilitating course work. Each student is expected to honor confidentiality as it pertains to student disclosure. It shall be a violation of the ethical standards to use shared information, comments, or opinions expressed by another student or facilitator/instructor in the educational setting in a manner which is intended to humiliate, embarrass, harass, damage, or otherwise injure the student in his/her personal, public or business/professional life. In addition, confidentiality must be upheld by not disclosing any information which would identify a particular individual or organization.</p><p>An additional integral component of higher education is challenging one's own perceptions and beliefs regarding the course content and integrating information as well as understanding opposing perceptions and beliefs. Thus, students have the right to choose how much they will disclose and must also accept the responsibility of respecting disclosure of other students and facilitators/instructors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT</head><p>In the spirit of the Jesuit mission of Regis University, CCLS students and faculty share responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. This includes using information technology responsibly in online and other courses. In order for faculty members to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, online courses, and other learning areas, the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies and the faculty expect students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner and not engage in disruptive behavior, disorderly conduct or intentionally interfere in the freedom of expression of others. "Disruptive Behavior" or "Disorderly Conduct" as applied in all academic settings and formats (i.e., classroom, online, independent study, etc.) means behavior that a reasonable faculty member or student would view as intentionally or recklessly interfering with normal academic functions, university events, or university sponsored activities.</p><p>Examples include, but are not limited to: persistently speaking or commenting without being recognized or interrupting other speakers; behavior that distracts the class from the subject matter or discussion; or, in extreme cases, physical threats, harassing behavior or personal insults; refusal to comply with faculty direction including refusal to work in a group, using a cell phone or pager during a classroom session, inappropriate mediated communication; or behavior that has a negative impact in any learning environment.</p><p>Disruptive behavior also includes any other behavior covered by the Regis University Student Handbook: Code of Conduct which can be found at www.regis.edu.</p><p>Students who fail to adhere to acceptable behavioral standards may be subject to discipline which may include reprimand, dismissal from the class and/or expulsion from the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. Students who wish to appeal a decision regarding the consequences of their behavior should follow the Appeal Process outlined in the Regis University Student Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEARNING FORMATS</head><p>Students may complete Regis University academic course work through any combination of the following learning formats as availability of course format permits:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classroom-Based</head><p>Classroom-based courses are offered in five, eight, and 16-week academic periods, weekend intensive format or in summer intensive format. Most courses meet one or two days/evenings each week for a total of 20 to 32 contact hours. Course learning format, selection, and availability vary by campus location.</p><p>Students choosing this option usually study a single subject area for a concentrated period of time. This course format is based on a facilitative model of learning.</p><p>Most accelerated classes require a minimum of 19-25 hours of combined study and classroom time each week, depending on the course content, course length and the student's learning style. While this model allows for degree completion in a shorter period of time, there is an increased expectation for independent learning outside the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directed Study</head><p>For directed study, student's share the responsibility for course design with a faculty advisor at Regis University, as well as an outside expert who serves as a course consultant. Plans for course study are formalized in a Learning Contract. The Learning Contract is similar to a course syllabus, and includes clear statements of course objectives, required learning activities and method of evaluation.</p><p>In addition to completing courses in the classroom or online, students may choose to complete a variety of undergraduate courses through an independent study format. In most cases, students will complete the same assignments -with a few revisions -as students in a classroom-based course. Each course will be taken in an eight-week format. Instructors will be chosen from the affiliate faculty within the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies.</p><p>Students spend approximately 45 clock hours per credit on each course, including planning time, meetings with their instructor, and doing the course work. For a three-semester hour course completed during an eight-week academic period, this would constitute a minimum of 17 to 20 hours each week. Selected courses are offered on the semester calendar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online</head><p>Online courses are generally offered in an accelerated eight-week format over the Internet. These courses are designed to provide an interactive learning experience for students. Faculty and students communicate and collaborate through online discussions and e-mail. Course materials generally include textbook(s) and online workshops.</p><p>Lifestyle issues--including variable work schedules, family responsibilities, physical limitations or geographical inaccessibility-make this a viable option for adults pursuing higher educational goals. Regis Online courses primarily focus on the completion of a degree however many of the courses may be approved to apply toward other majors. Educational technologies like synchronous and asynchronous web technologies, CD and e-mail offer learners convenience and flexibility. Online courses have highly structured requirements and deadlines which fall within eight week academic terms.</p><p>Online students need to have computer equipment and skills at a specified minimum level. Please check with the undergraduate program for current requirements. Students should allocate a minimum of 20 hours each week for completing course assignments and participating in online discussions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CURRICULUM</head><p>Regardless of format, each course offered through the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies focuses on course objectives, required learning activities, and outcome evaluation. Close attention is given to the integration of theory and practice, as well as the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that prepare students for changing demands of the workplace.</p><p>Because effective written and oral communication skills are essential in both occupational and academic environments, the CCLS emphasizes the development of these skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACULTY</head><p>Facilitators, independent study course instructors, and presenters are frequently working professionals representing various corporations, businesses and organizations. All hold a master's or doctoral degree, and bring academic theory and current professional experience to the learning environment. An assessment process is employed to determine not only the knowledge base of each selected faculty member, but also his/her ability to facilitate the learning of adult students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC ADVISING</head><p>A unique feature of CCLS is its emphasis on academic advising. Advisors are available to assist with course planning and degree development as needed. Advisors provide assistance and recommendations to students from the point of admission through graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING</head><p>Many adult students have extensive work or life learning that can be documented and evaluated for undergraduate college credit. The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies offers two methods of assessing prior learning:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Learning Assessment (PLA)</head><p>Regis University, like more than 1,500 other American colleges and universities, awards credit for documented, college-level learning gained through experience, and/or on-the-job training programs. A portfolio of prior learning consists of one or more essays in which the student demonstrates the knowledge equivalent to that gained from a college course. PLA credit may be awarded for a wide range of areas of expertise. Students can petition to earn credit in any college-level subject area (e.g., business, computers, fine arts, creative writing, religious studies, and photography). Regis University uses learningcounts.org to assess prior learning by portfolio Undergraduate teacher licensure students may be able to utilize the PLA assessment process to evaluate prior learning at the undergraduate level. Students may petition for a maximum of 45 semester hours of PLA credit. Credits earned through the PLA process do not apply toward the Regis University residency requirements (30 semester hours). Students may obtain additional information from portfolio@regis.edu. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Add/Drop</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE AVAILABILITY</head><p>Regis University does not guarantee that courses will be offered at the same campus location or on the same evening as they were offered for a previous academic period. A course is subject to cancellation if the minimum student registration for that course is not met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASS ATTENDANCE</head><p>Students are expected to make every effort to attend all class meetings. Attendance standards for individual courses are established in writing by the instructor at the first class session. Students unable to attend the first class must contact the instructor ahead of time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS/CLASS</head><p>Final examinations may be given at the end of each academic period. Students who miss a final examination, or who fail to submit all required work without a justifiable excuse, are awarded a grade based on all course requirements. Students who are unable to take a final examination or complete final course requirements for a valid reason (i.e., circumstances beyond the student's control) must request in writing to the instructor a grade of incomplete (I). The "I" grade must be removed within a specified period of time or the alternate grade is assigned. More information can be found under the "Grading" heading in this section of the Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD</head><p>Undergraduate students who wish to register for more than two courses in any five-or eight-week term, or more than 18 semester hours in one semester must receive approval from the CCLS Undergraduate Advising department. Students must obtain and submit an Overload Request form 30 days prior to taking the overload credit to the Undergraduate Advising Department. The advisor will:</p><p>• Verify that students have a 3.000 grade point average or higher.</p><p>• Ensure that students have no incomplete grades pending.</p><p>• Contact students regarding approval or denial of the request. No further overloads are approved if students receive any incomplete grades and/or fall below a 3.000 grade point average.</p><p>Graduate students should refer to the program/college section of this Catalog for specific requirements regarding course load/overloads for each degree program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADING</head><p>For information on incomplete grades, change of recorded grade, and repeat for higher grade, students should refer to the General Information section of this Catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of Incomplete</head><p>The student must submit the Incomplete Grade Request form, this form document serves as a contract between the student and the instructor regarding the completion of an incomplete grade for a course within the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies. A grade of Incomplete or "I" denotes that the required work for the course is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances mean, for example, that an accident, an illness, a death, or a major life transition has occurred.</p><p>Incompletes are granted at the discretion of the faculty. The student must submit the Incomplete Grade Request Form to the instructor explaining the unforeseen circumstances which have occurred. The student also must have completed 75% of the course with a passing grade in order to be eligible for an incomplete. The length of time and the remaining requirements to complete the course are determined by the instructor; however, the maximum length of time for completion is the end of the following term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade of "In Progress"</head><p>"In Progress" grades are given to students in graduate capstone project courses, graduate thesis courses or practicum/internship courses where it may be appropriate for a student to take longer than the eight weeks or semester (if a semester-based course) provided for completion. If the course instructor agrees that the student should be given additional time, an "In Progress" grade can be granted for a period of up to one year (12 months) to complete the capstone project course or practicum/internship. The grade to be recorded in the student's record is IP/F or IP/NP depending on whether the approved grade in a letter grade or Pass/No Pass. If the student does not satisfactorily complete the course within the one year period, the grade reverts to the "F" or "NP" grade. "In Progress" grades will only be given in the capstone/thesis courses or practicum/internship courses. "In Progress" is not appropriate for other courses where there is a definitive end date. In those cases if the student is unable to complete the course work for an approved reason and the instructor approves, the appropriate grade is Incomplete/F (I/F) and the student has no more than the eight weeks or equivalent term to complete the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Reports</head><p>All grades are reported at the end of each academic period, at which time they become official and are entered on the students' permanent record. Grade reports are no longer mailed to students; however, grades may be accessed online through the WebAdvisor link at www.regis.edu. Grades cannot be given over the phone or e-mailed to the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals of Disputed Grades</head><p>Students who wish to dispute a grade earned in a course should use the following procedures:</p><p>1. The student contacts the instructor of the course to request a review of the issue.</p><p>2. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student submits a written request for review of the grade to the degree chair. The written request must be initiated within 60 days after the last official day of the term in which the course in question was taken. The request must provide rationale indicating why the grade earned is not appropriate, and all relevant documentation must be included (course syllabus, copies of exams, quizzes, papers, presentation materials, etc.) The request must include the student's name, address, e-mail address, course number, instructor name and the term in which the course was completed. 3. The faculty led reviews all documentation submitted. If needed, the degree chair contacts the student and the instructor to arrange a personal interview. The faculty lead approves or disapproves the appeal. If the faculty lead approves the appeal, a Change of Grade form is completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration. The faculty lead informs the student and the instructor in writing of the decision regarding the appeal. 4. If the grade dispute is not satisfactorily resolved, the student may appeal the decision to the Assistant Dean of the appropriate school. This written appeal must be submitted within two calendar weeks of receipt of the decision in step 3 above.</p><p>The Assistant Dean will review the proceedings and any additional information provided by the student. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing</head><p>A College of Contemporary Liberal Studies undergraduate student must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade of less than "C-" in an upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward completion of major or minor requirements. A grade of less than "C-" in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation.</p><p>To sustain good academic standing at the graduate level, a cumulative grade point average of 3.000 for 600-level course work is required. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned in the 600-level courses, by the total number of semester hours attempted in those courses. No more than two courses with grades of "C" can count toward graduation requirements. A grade lower than a "C" (e.g. "C-") is not counted toward degree requirements, but is included in the cumulative grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probation</head><p>The College of Contemporary Liberal Studies undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000 at the end of any given semester is placed on academic probation. During the next semester (fall, spring, summer) of enrollment, the University expects the student to raise his/her cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. If the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.000, the student may be academically suspended at the end of the probationary semester. The student must work closely with his/her advisor to determine the number of semester hours to be taken during the probationary semester to maximize the possibility of earning the required cumulative 2.000 grade point average by the end of the semester. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the School Dean. Academic probation is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>Occasionally, a student's Regis University cumulative grade point average is so low that the student finds it mathematically impossible to attain a 2.000 cumulative grade point average during only one semester. In this case, the student may enter into an agreement with an advisor of the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies to earn a provisional grade point average for the semester. The agreed-upon grade point average is set within a range that is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student. If the provisional semester grade point average is earned for the semester, but the student's cumulative grade point average is still below 2.000, the student may be permitted to continue on probation rather than be suspended.</p><p>Undergraduate students accepted on probation by the College of Contemporary Liberal Studies may be suspended at the completion of their first semester of course work if they have not achieved a 2.000 cumulative grade point average.</p><p>Graduate students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.000 for 600-level course(s) at the end of any given semester are placed on academic probation. After one semester on probation, a student's performance will be reviewed by the appropriate faculty lead and School Assistant Dean. Students who are not successful in raising their grade point average to 3.000 will be considered for suspension by the faculty lead and School Assistant Dean. Students on probation are permitted to take only one course per term and are not permitted to have an Incomplete grade while on Probation. In addition, graduate students who receive a grade of "C" or less in two courses are subject to academic review. Students are formally notified of their academic probation in a letter from the School Dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suspension</head><p>If a College of Contemporary Liberal Studies student has been placed on academic probation and does not achieve a 2.000 (undergraduate) or 3.000 (graduate) cumulative grade point average at the end of the next semester of enrollment, he/she is suspended.

The Diploma in Liberal Studies includes 45 credits of coursework over three years. The Diploma program has been developed within the framework of Ignatian pedagogy that seeks to develop the whole person, or cura personalis. Within each course and across the curriculum, student learning is structured around the concepts of experience, reflection and action.</p><p>Experience: Experience begins with the recollection of previous learning of facts, feelings and insights that may be of relevance to the discipline. To this experience, discipline-specific information, skills and knowledge are added through the learning process.</p><p>Reflection: As part of the learning process, students are invited to pause and consider questions of significance to themselves and their communities in the context of their discipline-specific coursework.</p><p>Action, Service, and Evaluation: At its culmination, participants are invited to consider how their new skills and knowledge can be put into action within their communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Hour</head><p>The definition of a credit hour is based on time spent in mentored learning activities that are directed toward student learning outcomes.

Instead, it is the goal of the University to give each student a full range of academic exposure. Building upon a 450 year educational tradition, our core education is grounded in a Jesuit and Catholic vision of human development. Through its emphasis on active learning and integrated reflective thinking, the core education should broaden a student's capacity to make critical judgments in a wide range of areas. To this end, Regis College requires that each student completes a liberal arts core curriculum. All Core courses will challenge students to reflect on tradition, continuity, and change while celebrating the essential goodness of the world, the compatibility of faith and reason, and the joy of learning. Through the Foundational Core, with its emphasis on rhetorical skills (writing, speaking, reading and listening), to the Distributive Core with its focus on key modes of scholarly inquiry and discovery, to the Integrative Core, which connects new learning with prior knowledge and personal experience across disciplines, the Core encourages students to become lifelong learners in the Jesuit tradition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SH</head><p>The spring term course will satisfy the distributive requirement in its discipline (for example, a spring term PL course will satisfy the core Philosophy requirement).</p><p>RCC 200--WRITING ANALYTICALLY: This course is a writingintensive seminar required for all students in the Fall of their first year at Regis. The course focuses on critical reading, thinking and writing, as well as introducing the student to their advisor and a core community of fellow students. Students will take a linked spring class with this same community of peers that will satisfy a core requirement.</p><p>RCC 200H--HONORS WRITING SEMINAR: The Idea of a University (for Honors Program Students): This course begins a five-semester honors sequence of historically recursive seminars that bring the traditions of Christianity and classical learning into fruitful engagement with new developments in thought and culture. It examines the timeless struggle between reason and emotion, mind and heart, situating the conversation within an ongoing dialog on the nature of education and a university's role in fostering it.</p><p>RCC 250--CONVERSATION MATTERS: Focuses on a complex and challenging topic worthy of sustained conversation and enhanced by multi-disciplinary and multi-modal approaches. Over the course of the semester, students learn how to engage in textbased group discussion and deliberative dialogue. They also learn how to conduct and to present their own independent research on the seminar topic as a way of contributing to subsequent discussion and deliberation.</p><p>RCC 400H--HONORS SEMINAR TRADITION AND INNOVATION (for Honors Program Students): As the second course in a series of five honors seminars, Tradition and Innovation is rooted in questions regarding the creative tension between our formative relationships to the past and the ways in which we seek to create novel futures, between tradition and innovation. It involves an integrative blend of literature, philosophy, history, science, religion, film, art, and music.</p><p>The Distributive Core (40 to 46 credits) represents a variety of offerings in disciplines that provide the underpinning of a solid liberal arts education. These specifically designed core courses within the following areas of study expose students to a wide range of academic disciplines, perennial questions, and methods of inquiry that broadens a student's ability to make informed, critical judgments. Transfer students will be placed in an RCC400D course their first semester, designed specifically for them. Transfer students with 60 or more hours of transfer credit cannot waive Integrative Core requirements, but may substitute up to two courses for the Integrative Core, as long as the substitute courses are upperdivision and thematically similar to RCC 410E, RCC 420J, or RCC 430M. </p></div>

In the event the defaulted balance is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection through legal proceedings or otherwise, defaulted students must pay late fees, attorney fees, court costs and fees, and all other applicable charges to Regis University. Disputed defaulted balances shall be governed by Colorado law, excluding its conflicts of law's provisions. Regis University and its respective agents reserve the right to report defaulted information to the credit bureaus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REFUND SCHEDULE FOR AUTHORIZED WITHDRAWAL FROM REGIS COLLEGE</head><p>The official date of withdrawal from the University or from a course is the date that the withdrawal request is submitted to the Office of Academic Records and Registration for processing. Notice of withdrawal from the University must be received by the Office of Academic Records and Registration by using the official University Withdrawal online form. The date the withdrawal request is processed and the date the student vacates the residence hall, if applicable, determines the amount of refund credited to the student. Refund policies are further described in the General Information Section of this Catalog under the 'Withdrawal and Refund of Tuition' heading.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOVERNING CATALOG</head><p>Traditional undergraduate students must adhere to the Core Studies requirements published in the Catalog in the year in which they entered their College. Graduating students must also meet the major(s) and minor(s) requirements as stated in the Catalog in effect when the major(s) and minor(s) were declared and approved. Undergraduate traditional students who leave the University and do not complete a Leave of Absence form--or if the form has expired (after two semesters) and they return--must meet the current Core and major/minor requirements. Requests for exceptions should be made in writing to the academic dean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE ACADEMIC YEAR</head><p>The academic year is divided into two semesters of 16 weeks each. The first semester begins with Orientation in late August and ends in mid-December. It is followed by a Christmas vacation of approximately three weeks. The second semester begins in early January and ends at approximately the close of the first week in May. The Summer Session extends from early May through the middle of August.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE ACADEMIC ADVISING PROGRAM</head><p>Academic advising is an integral part of the educational process in Regis College. It is the intent of this program to provide the student with a faculty advisor who assists the advisee to gain the maximum from his/her educational experience.</p><p>Each student at Regis is assigned an academic advisor who: 1) aids the student in planning an educational program consistent with his or her interests and capabilities; 2) provides information about the academic process and University resources; 3) counsels students who may be experiencing academic difficulties; and 4) refers students to any other areas of student services that can help the advisee with difficulties outside of the academic sphere.</p><p>The Advising Program is administered through the Office of the Academic Dean for Regis College. This office serves as a general source of information about campus resources and specialized programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAJOR DECLARATION</head><p>Before accumulating 60 credits, each student must select a major area around which most of his/her upper division coursework centers. In some majors, even earlier decisions are encouraged. The programs in Education, and the natural sciences require careful planning in order to meet all requirements during four years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE LOAD/OVERLOAD</head><p>The average class load is 15 to 18 semester hours. Ordinarily, only students with a 3.000 minimum cumulative grade point average and no grades of Incomplete are allowed to carry more than 18 semester hours. Permission to carry 19 or more semester hours (course overload) must be obtained from an associate dean for Regis College. If, in the judgment of the associate dean, a student benefits by a reduced course load, the student is restricted to a course load of fewer than 15 semester hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UPPER DIVISION COURSES</head><p>Freshmen and sophomores are allowed to take upper division courses only if they have completed the prerequisites or if they have obtained the permission of the instructor of the course. Juniors and seniors must also complete the prerequisites of an upper division course as listed in this Catalog before enrolling for the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGISTRATION</head><p>All students must consult with an academic advisor prior to registration. Students who have selected more than one major must consult with all assigned advisors, as appropriate. Registration materials are available online. Registration occurs online through WebAdvisor, but students must have their advisor approve their course planning worksheet before registering. It is the student's responsibility to study their degree requirements and make certain that course selections meet those requirements. Additionally, students are financially responsible for all registered courses. (see Payment of Student Accounts).</p><p>The University reserves the right to cancel a course when registration is not sufficient to warrant continuance, to divide a class if enrollment is too large for effective instruction and to change instructors.</p><p>Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis College class, may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCURRENT/CROSS-COLLEGE ENROLLMENT POLICY</head><p>Regis College students are eligible to register for 16 week semester courses offered in the other Regis University colleges. Regis College is committed to student success and the recognition that workload and time management are consistent obstacles to students' academic performance, Regis College restricts students' access to post-traditional format courses (e.g. 8-week and 5-week) while enrolled as a full-time student in the semester-based format. Students must receive approval from their academic advisor and the Regis College Dean's Office before enrolling in a post-traditional format course. The advisor and the dean will evaluate any potential post-traditional format course (heretofore referred to as "the Course") based on the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The course is a key component of the degree program (major or minor) in which the student intends to complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The course does not rely upon a foundational base of knowledge more suitable for working professionals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The course content addresses similar learning outcomes as the course requirement the student is intending to fulfill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The course is compatible with the student's course load to ensure a reasonable balance of academic demands and responsibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEAVE OF ABSENCE</head><p>Students who decide to leave Regis College for one or two semesters and then plan to return have the option of applying for a leave of absence. This status guarantees them the same Core Studies and major/minor requirements that applied to them before leaving Regis and also allows them to preregister during the semester prior to their return. The Leave of Absence Application forms is available online through WebAdvisor. If a student does not complete a Leave of Absence form or if the leave of absence has expired (after two semesters), and later returns to Regis College, he/she must be readmitted to the College. The student is held to the current Core Studies and major/minor requirements. Requests for exceptions should be made in writing to the academic dean for Regis College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT AT ANOTHER COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY</head><p>In order to insure acceptance of transfer credit once the student is enrolled at Regis University, students should submit the Concurrent Enrollment form available on WebAdvisor.</p><p>Undergraduate students are not permitted to take the last 30 semester hours of coursework at another institution without permission of an associate dean for Regis College. A grade of "C-" or better must be earned for undergraduate coursework to be accepted in transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGIS COLLEGE ATTENDANCE POLICY</head><p>Regis College's primary obligation is the total education of its students, and at the core of this commitment is an understanding that such an education occurs through the direct interaction between faculty and students in their classes. Therefore, for students to achieve success in their educational endeavors, they must conscientiously and regularly attend all of their of classes.</p><p>Freshmen in particular will be held accountable for maintaining regular attendance in their courses.</p><p>Faculty will, at the start of the semester, announce their specific procedures concerning class attendance, verification of excused absences, etc., in written form through the course syllabus. It is the student's responsibility to note these procedures and to follow them carefully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLLEGE-SPONSORED ACTIVITY ABSENCE POLICY</head><p>Many Regis College students participate in extracurricular activities that are sponsored by the College. These activities will occasionally be held in times that conflict with regularly scheduled classes or exams. This policy is designed to clarify the obligations and responsibilities of participating students, their coaches or sponsors, and professors. The policy will distinguish between activities that are sustained throughout the semester or year (e.g., athletics or debate) and those that are one-time events (e.g., presenting or participating in a conference).</p><p>When students participate in College-sponsored activities, those absences from classes are considered excused. However, students are required to give faculty notice of these absences as early as possible, and to make arrangements with the faculty for completing all assignments and mastering the material of the course. In addition, faculty have the right to inform students, as well as their activity sponsors, if in the professor's judgment the student will be compromising their chances of success in the course because of the absences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE AT FINAL EXAMINATIONS</head><p>Final examinations are assigned at the end of each semester. A student who is unable to take a final examination for a valid reason (i.e., emergency circumstances beyond the student's control) is eligible for a grade of Incomplete, which, if assigned, must be removed by the end of the next academic semester with the exception of spring semester. Incomplete grades assigned during spring semester must be finalized by the end of fall semester. A student must specifically request an Incomplete in writing from the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE REPORTS</head><p>All instructors in Regis College are required to submit midsemester grades. Only end-of-semester grades are official and entered on the student's permanent record. By federal legislation (The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended), grades can be released to parents or others only by specific request of the student, unless the parent claims the student as a dependent for federal income tax purposes and certifies this fact. Grade information cannot be released by telephone or by fax; however, grade information can be accessed through WebAdvisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPEALS OF DISPUTED GRADES</head><p>Grade appeals for Regis College undergraduate students must be initiated within the first month of the semester following receipt of the grade. The following procedure is to be followed if a student wishes to protest a grade he or she received in a course:</p><p>1. The student raises the matter with the instructor in question. If the grade remains in dispute, the student should follow step 2. 2. At the student's request, the department chair arranges for a committee of three faculty members to review the case. The student and the teacher may each appoint one of these three. The third is to be chosen by the other two. The committee reviews evidence in any manner the committee deems equitable. (Typically, a written statement from each party that the other party can review and respond to in writing is the first step.) Oral presentations to the committee are sometimes also useful. Care should be taken lest either of the parties be intimidated through oral procedure. The committee recommends a solution. 3. The committee's decision is final, unless one of two circumstances occur: new and relevant information is made available that the committee did not see, or the process was not followed. The dissatisfied party appeals to the academic dean. The dean reviews the proceedings up to this point, obtains any new information deemed appropriate, and makes the final determination. Further appeals are not permitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDENT CONDUCT</head><p>The community standards of conduct outlined in the Regis Student Handbook apply to students in academic classrooms, labs and off campus learning sites. Faculty members have the right to expect students to be respectful of their classmates and professors. If a student repeatedly engages in disruptive behavior in a classroom or lab that affects other students' ability to concentrate on the class, faculty members may instruct the student to leave the classroom.</p><p>Repeated disruption of classroom instruction will be referred to the student conduct process, and may result in the student being removed from the course.</p><p>If the conduct of a student threatens the safety of anyone in the room, the Office of Academic Dean, in conjunction with the Dean of Students, has the right to remove the student after a single occurrence.</p><p>A detailed summary of regulations and the student discipline process is available in the Regis University </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing</head><p>A Regis College undergraduate student must maintain at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. A grade lower than "C-" in any upper division course in the major or minor area is not counted toward the major or minor. A passing grade lower than "C-" in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, these courses apply toward graduation.</p><p>At the end of each semester, students who are academically deficient, with grade point averages below 2.000, are reviewed by the Committee on Probation and Suspension. The committee may recommend to the academic dean for Regis College that one of the following actions be taken: academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Warning</head><p>A student with a semester grade point average below 2.000 and a cumulative grade point average above 2.000 is placed on academic warning. Although academic warning indicates an academic deficiency, it is not as severe as academic probation and is not posted on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probation</head><p>A student with a cumulative grade point average below 2.000 is placed on academic probation. The committee sets forth certain conditions that the student must meet within a specified time period. Although a student's grade point average is the primary determinant in decisions regarding probation, other stated conditions must be met in order to remain in the College. Failure to meet any of the specified conditions may result in suspension.</p><p>A student is not permitted to re-enroll unless he/she has agreed in writing to all conditions set forth. Academic probation is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>Academic suspension is action taken by Regis College for any probationary student with an unacceptable cumulative grade point average. Academic suspension renders him/her ineligible to return to Regis University for a period of 12 months. During that time the student must satisfactorily complete (grade of "C" or better) at least 12 semester hours (or equivalent quarter credits) at another regionally accredited institution. The student must obtain prior approval from Regis University of transferability of this coursework. This action may be taken for any student whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below 2.000. In addition, academic suspension may be taken for any student whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below a provisional grade point average agreed upon between the student and the associate dean for Regis College. Academic suspension is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis College class, may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suspension Criteria</head><p>• Any student on academic probation whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below the minimum standard established for his/her class level is, under ordinary circumstances, suspended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class</head><p>Hours Attempted GPA • Any student on academic probation whose cumulative grade point average has fallen below 2.000, may be suspended (the table in item 1 notwithstanding). Any transfer student accepted by Regis College (undergraduate program) on probation for the first 12 to 15 semester hours may be suspended at the completion of the 12 to 15 hours if his/her Regis cumulative grade point average is below 2.000.</p><p>• Any student who has met an agreed-upon provisional grade point average for the semester may be given the status of Probation Continued. This is a student (usually a freshman) who has earned an extremely low cumulative grade point average and, consequently, finds it almost mathematically impossible to attain a sufficiently high grade point average to be restored to Good Standing or even to be placed above the minimum for his/her class level. Such students have entered into an agreement with the associate dean for Regis College who acts on behalf of the Committee on Probation and Suspension. The agreed-upon grade point average is set within a range of what is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student in question (frequently between 2.000 and 2.300). A student failing to make the agreed-upon grade point average for the semester is suspended.</p><p>• Three semesters are the maximum a student may be on probation during his/her academic career. Thereafter, failure to maintain a 2.000 cumulative grade point average results in automatic suspension.</p><p>• Students on probation will normally be expected to maintain and complete a full-time schedule (minimum 12 credit hours). Students on probation will only be allowed to reduce their schedules to 11 hours or fewer with the approval of both their academic advisor and the Probation Director. Unspecified students are held to the same standards as full-time students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>Academic dismissal is action taken by Regis College that renders the student ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, an undergraduate student must have been suspended, applied for and re-admitted to Regis College on academic probation, and failed to achieve either the required minimum 2.000 grade point average, the minimum standards for his/her class level, or an agreed-upon provisional grade point average. The provisional grade point average is predetermined by the student and the associate dean for Regis College. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appealing the Suspension or Dismissal Decision</head><p>Upon being notified of academic suspension or dismissal, a student who wishes to appeal should write a letter to the Chair of the Appeals Committee and follow the procedures listed below:</p><p>1. Why the suspension/dismissal decision should be reversed, including the student's honest assessment of how the academic troubles came about, and some indication that the student is ready to continue serious academic work.</p><p>2. Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control?</p><p>3. The names of the student's advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student.</p><p>4. Submit the letter by the deadline stated in the letter of suspension or dismissal.</p><p>5. Contact the advisor, faculty members, doctors, etc., to discuss the case. Any supporting statements from them must be received by the same deadline. The appeals committee is interested in any pertinent information that has genuine bearing on the matter. The committee focuses on why the student should be allowed to continue study at the University, and why the student failed to reach his or her academic goals. The Bachelor of Science in Biology is designed to provide a broad knowledge of science including a strong background in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. This degree is designed for those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, or certain graduate programs in the natural sciences, as well as for those interested in biotechnology or various other biology-based careers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROGRAM OF STUDY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANTHROPOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY and CRIMINAL JUSTICE</head><p>The Honors-in-Biology option is designed to add a rigorous independent research component to the Bachelor of Science degree in Biology to better prepare students for graduate and professional schools or for research-oriented laboratory work.</p><p>The Bachelor of Arts in Biology is designed to allow flexibility while ensuring a strong background in Biology. The importance of biology in the modern world has made the combination of a strong background in biology with other fields of study a valuable endeavor. This degree is designed for those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in law, business, certain health science fields, education, or graduate programs outside of the natural sciences, as well for those generally interested in combining an understanding of biology with a study of fields outside of the natural sciences such as education or business. This program is particularly amenable to combination with another major or minor. The Standard Chemistry and Biochemistry options are designed to meet the core academic needs of students who plan to pursue careers in secondary education, those who plan on attending medical or dental school, or any student who seeks a firm grounding in chemistry, but does not plan to pursue advanced studies or employment in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Science in Biology</head><p>The ACS-certified programs require more upper-division coursework than the standard programs and follow the curriculum guidelines recommended by the American Chemical Society Committee on Professional Training. These programs are designed for students planning to enter graduate school or those planning on careers in research and development in the chemical, pharmaceutical, or biotechnology industries.</p><p>All four degree programs require 8 semester hours of calculus and 8 semester hours of calculus-based physics. In addition, the Biochemistry programs require 8 semester hours of lowerdivision biology and 4 semester hours of upper-division coursework in biology.</p><p>The minimum passing grade for any course taken towards satisfying the major requirements for a Chemistry or Biochemistry degree is a C-. This standard applies to all lowerand upper-division courses and all other science and math courses required for the major. </p></div>

Graduating seniors leave our program well-equipped for family, social and professional life. Some advance to graduate programs while others begin rewarding careers in marketing, public relations, media production, audio production, social media management, education, business and nonprofit management, law, real estate, community service, sports, sales, health care, event planning and the arts-and other paths too numerous to mention.</p><p>Majors choose from among three tracks:</p><p>The Media and Society track educates and guides students so that they may be informed, ethical and creative practitioners, leaders, critics and consumers in the professions and industries of media and technology. Emphasizing practical application through community engagement and production, students have opportunities to create online content (i.e., podcasts, videos, websites, etc.); write for our school newspaper, The Highlander; produce a show for our radio station, KRCX; write critical-cultural reviews of popular culture texts to present at conferences, and much more.</p><p>The Public Relations industry is growing all across the globe, including in developing nations and emerging markets like India and Kenya. There are opportunities for skilled PR practitioners to work in a wide variety of industries and geographic regions. The Public Relations and Civic Engagement track at Regis focuses on ethical and transparent public relations that works for social good. While we approach PR primarily from an advocacy lens, students are equipped with the theoretical and practical skills needed to tell stories to a wide variety of people across a range of platforms.</p><p>Studying in the Human Communication and Conflict track means understanding human experiences as systemic, co-created, emergent, narrative and performed. Students look at which aspects of communication can be quantified and predicted; which can be understood as being about meaning and emotion, and which are best grasped in the contexts of power and justice. They explore consequences of a conflictobsessed society. Studying human communication develops knowledge and practices that (unique in their centrality to everything we do) can transform the quality of our lives. Students learn to think with greater insight, complexity and nuance about performed behavior, relationships and how people make meaning. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION</head><p>The English major is designed to offer a broad and balanced approach to the discipline. Course requirements are flexibly structured to emphasize genres, periods, and a diversity of literary traditions. Major requirements provide a substantive foundation upon which to base further reading and critical inquiry. Courses focus not only on primary texts, but on essential cultural, historical, and theoretical contexts as well. The English major takes a Diversity Across the Curriculum approach, so most courses discuss aspects of historical or current oppression and marginalization.</p><p>Each student in the major works closely with a departmental advisor to develop a plan of study compatible with the individual's goals for graduate or professional school and employment. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINE ARTS: VISUAL ARTS</head><p>Students planning to major in Visual Arts must submit a Major Declaration form. Acceptance into the major requires a portfolio review by the Department and approval of the department cochair/art program director. Students wishing to obtain more information regarding the portfolio requirement should contact the department co-chair/art program director.</p><p>The Visual Arts major is designed to give students a broad and flexible foundation in the visual arts while also giving them an opportunity to develop an emphasis in a particular medium. Students establish a firm basis in design, art history, and criticism while pursuing technical proficiency. This prepares students for the practice of art and grounds their knowledge in experience and first-hand problem solving. The Visual Arts major prepares students for jobs in a wide field of options, including publications, public relations, graphic design and others. The Bachelor of Arts in Visual Arts is also excellent preparation for graduate programs in Fine Arts.</p><p>Each student works with an advisor from the department who will guide her or him through completion of the requirements for the major and assure that the student's future plans are optimized by the art curriculum.</p><p>A Junior Portfolio Review of each fine arts major will be conducted in the second semester of the student's junior year. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine how the student has progressed in his/her chosen medium or media and discuss goals and objectives for the senior thesis show.</p><p>Transfer students who wish to major in Fine Arts must present a portfolio for review by the Department. Besides the requirement that at least half of the upper division courses must be taken at Regis, graduating art students must complete FAA 499--Senior Thesis, which culminates with a student exhibition in the Arts Center. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINE ARTS: CORE</head><p>All Regis College students are required to complete a Fine Arts Core course. The Core Studies requirement emphasizes that the basic human impulse to create is common across all of the arts. The requirement may be fulfilled by taking any courses with the FAC prefix. These courses introduce students to aesthetic vocabularies through a survey of specific art disciplines (Visual Arts, or Music, or Theatre). Core Studies students are also exposed to the fine and performing arts through attendance at exhibitions, performances, poetry readings, and lectures in the O'Sullivan Arts Gallery, a widely recognized cultural center, and Peter Claver Recital Hall.</p><p>These events serve students in the Fine and Performing Arts Department as well as the entire Regis University and Denver area community. </p></div>

Students who want to concentrate in more advanced studies in music may pursue a Bachelor of Arts or a structured music minor.</p><p>Students wishing to pursue the music major or minor should contact the department co-chair/music program director. Currently, the Department of Fine and Performing Arts offers three music major degrees: the Bachelor of Arts in Music; the Bachelor of Arts in Music Performance; and the Bachelor of Arts in Music History and Literature. The music major curriculum offers a comprehensive course of study in historical, cultural, theoretical, and performance perspectives. With a grounding in the traditional music styles of Western art music, music majors will also acquire an essential awareness and knowledge of contemporary musical directions, American music, interdisciplinary studies between music and art, and the musical traditions of other cultures. The Bachelor of Arts in Music prepares students to go onto graduate studies, education, or one that combines music with other disciplines such as music and liturgy, arts management and administration, communication, business or community-based professions.</p><p>Music majors with an emphasis in performance are expected to participate in applied lessons and ensembles every semester, once they have declared the major. Performance majors have added studies in Techniques and Performance and advanced ensembles. Performance majors prepare and present public recitals in both their junior and senior years. The Department currently offers the Performance Emphasis in the applied areas of voice, piano, guitar, oboe, clarinet, flute, bassoon, recorder, trumpet, trombone, percussion, violin, viola, cello, bass, mandolin, and harp. Auditions are required.</p><p>The Structured Music minor is offered to any Regis College student who demonstrates substantial skill and technique on an instrument or voice (audition required). The music minor at Regis College is designed to give students an excellent general foundation in music, music history, and the technical language of music. Music minors develop a serious mastery of an instrument or voice and gain experience working in advanced ensemble groups.</p><p>NOTE: All music majors must pass a keyboard proficiency exam. Geology is the study of the Earth, its materials, processes, and history. Geology courses are offered in support of the Environmental Studies, Core, and Education programs. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Dimensions</head><p>Six or nine semester hours selected from the following:</p><p>EC The Integrative Seminars: In the honors curriculum, there is a fivecourse sequence that replaces standard integrative Core courses. Each seminar is organized under a broad theme that invites interdisciplinary conversation and is team-taught by faculty members from different disciplines. Each seminar takes its charter from the University Mission Statement and Core Philosophy Statement, drawing course objectives and a potential reading list from the synergy between these grounding documents. Each of these courses is thematically oriented and historically recursive.</p><p>Dedicated Core Replacements: All departments have an opportunity to teach an honors section of their Distributive Core courses. Each of these honors offerings meets certain protocols-such as expectations for greater depth or student involvement-and is approved by the Honors Advisory Council. These sections are open primarily to honors students, however, instructors have the option to allow any student to take the course.</p><p>The most accomplished students accepted into Regis College are invited each spring to make an application to participate in this more rigorous and interdisciplinary curriculum. The Honors Program is competitive and normally limited to 30 students per year. Participation in Honors also promotes integration of a student's intellectual life with personal, community, and world experiences. All Honors students prepare a Senior Thesis so the program is especially well suited for anyone planning on graduate study or a professional program, such as law or medicine.</p><p>To be distinguished as an honors graduate, a student must maintain a 3.500 cumulative grade point average, complete at least 27 semester hours of dedicated honors courses, and complete an Honors Thesis . Students interested in the Honors Program should contact the director to apply no later than April 1st of the year they intend to matriculate at Regis University. Honors scholarship consideration will be given to all honor applications received by February 5th.</p><p>The honors program is open to students from every major in Regis College. However, the Honors Program is not compatible with programs in Pharmacy or Exercise Science in Rueckert-Hartman College of Health Professions. Since these careerfocused programs have their own unique core requirements tailored to meet their professional needs, students are unable to complete the Regis College honors curriculum. The nursing program poses similar challenges; however, their unique core requirements offer a bit more flexibility and occasionally nursing students will pursue the Regis College Honors Program for their first two years. Often these students go on to complete the disciplinary "honors in nursing" program through RHCHP. It is important to note that nursing students are unable to complete the final courses and honors thesis required of Regis College Honors Program students. Therefore they are not eligible for honors scholarships.</p><p>All Honors students take a special Honors section of the following Core courses: </p></div>

The major is designed to provide a strong foundation in neuroscience while giving students the flexibility to select courses that prepare them for a wide variety of career options. These include, but are not limited to, graduate study in neuroscience, physiological psychology, neuropsychology, and healthcare areas such as physical therapy, neuro-rehabilitation and medicine. Neuroscience is also a major for students who are simply interested in understanding the nature of brain-behavior relationships and want to pursue the field as part of a liberal arts education. Students will find that this major is compatible with a wide range of minors or double majors such as (but not limited to) biology, chemistry, health and exercise science, philosophy, or psychology.</p><p>The Honors-in-Neuroscience major adds an independent research component to the neuroscience major that further helps prepare students for graduate and professional schools or for research-oriented laboratory work.</p><p>Both neuroscience majors are administered by the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES</head><p>Health-science graduate programs such as medical, dental, and physical therapy schools select students after considering evidence of intellectual ability, motivation, an understanding of the nature of health professions, and past academic and personal achievement. Students should be prepared to answer the question "Why do you want to become a health care professional?" Toward that end, students are encouraged to gain experience in health-related service areas, including volunteer or internship opportunities. One aspect of achievement is the success of a student's curriculum, which should include a substantial amount of modern science. There are no official pre-health majors such as premedical, pre-dental, or pre-physical therapy majors; rather any major can be suitable, provided students satisfy the minimum course requirements for post-graduate work. Many applicants major in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Health and Exercise Science, or Neuroscience.</p><p>Standardized aptitude/achievement tests (MCAT, DAT, GRE) are given substantial weight by health-science graduate programs in the admissions process. A general background in the fundamentals of modern science is required for good performance on most of these tests. Therefore, any curriculum undertaken by a pre-health science student should include appropriate science courses. Because health science professions involve far more than basic science, students should demonstrate evidence of personal development, maturity, and experience. For further information and suggestions students should consult the pre-health sciences advisor and the pre-medical/health web page on the Regis University website. Students may wish to participate in activities of Alpha Epsilon Delta, the National Health Pre-professional Honor Society.</p><p>Pre-health science students typically take Biology (BL 258/259; BL 260/261) and Chemistry courses (CH 210/211; CH 230/231) during their first year, often with mathematics. The prerequisite requirements for programs vary both among disciplines and among schools within disciplines. The course prerequisites listed below are approximate and designed for students planning to apply to multiple schools. There are many health science professions in addition to those listed. Students should consult individual graduate programs for specific prerequisite requirements and additional recommended courses, and meet with their academic advisor and with the pre-health advisor. The curriculum of the psychology major is designed to provide a working knowledge of factual and current theoretical information in the field. Content is balanced with the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an appreciation of cultural diversity. The application of psychological principles is strongly encouraged through service learning, internship, and research opportunities.</p><p>The department offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. The degree requirements are designed with the latitude to prepare students interested in:</p><p>• Pursuing graduate work in psychology.</p><p>• Embarking on a career in psychology or related area where a combination of analytic and human skills is applicable.</p><p>• A liberal arts education in which psychology is a related and relevant major.</p><p>Students should work closely with their major advisor to plan a program of study commensurate with their educational and vocational goals.</p></div>

Education students are actively involved in urban and diverse field experiences beginning with their introductory education courses.</p><p>Regis College Undergraduate Education Programs Department offers professional licensure in elementary, secondary, and K-12 art, music, and foreign language. A unique feature of our teaching program requires all students to complete an additional endorsement in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education in conjunction with their secondary, elementary or K-12 license. Students also have the option to complete coursework for an endorsement in Special Education Generalist.</p><p>Students also have an option of completing minors or concentrations of study with the education department. These minors can be earned in addition to teaching licensure or independent from a teaching license. The minors include Special Education and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education. (For details on these minors, see sections after the licensure sequences listed below.)</p><p>All students enrolled in the Traditional Undergraduate Teacher Licensure Program at Regis College must have co-academic advisors, one in the major field and one in the Education Department.</p><p>The programs leading to recommendation for licensure, either at the elementary level or in a particular subject area at the secondary level, contain their own specific requirements. These requirements are listed on the advising sheet pertinent to that subject area. The advising sheets are available from an advisor in the Education Department. It is the student's responsibility to meet the requirements listed on that advising sheet. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEACHER LICENSURE SEQUENCE</head><p>As a professional state licensure program, students may have requirements beyond those in Regis College. Performance and licensure standards can be found in the student handbook and on the Colorado Department of Education website. In addition students will adhere to the Dispositions of Teaching located in the student handbook.</p><p>The professional sequence of education courses are designed to lead to licensure at either the K-6, 7-12, or K-12 grade levels in Colorado. Regis College undergraduate students enrolled in this sequence begin developing teacher performance, dispositions, and knowledge during their first courses and initial field experiences. This developmental process is monitored by the Regis Division of Education faculty, and students are evaluated each semester on their progress in this process. Evaluations are based on their work at Regis and in their fieldwork in the actual K-6, 7-12, or K-12 classroom. Regis students who begin this sequence may be counseled to pursue a profession other than teaching if their progress in one or all aspects of the sequence is considered unsatisfactory or if they do not manifest sufficient mastery of the skills necessary for successful entry into the teaching profession. A deficiency in one or more of these behaviors may be denied admission by the COTER, or removal, or probation from the program at any point. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOCTOR OF PHARMACY</head><p>The professional doctoral program (Pharm.D.) is four years (nine semesters), with a new class starting each August. The curriculum is designed for students to become pharmacists who provide care to patients in a variety of settings, including community and institutional pharmacies. The curriculum consists of classroom instruction using mostly team based learning and integration, and experiential instruction at multiple practice sites. Upon successful completion of the Doctor of Pharmacy program, graduates will receive a doctoral degree and be able to sit for the required licensure examinations. The School of Physical Therapy offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Health and Exercise Science. This program is designed to prepare students for careers that promote health and wellbeing of individuals, communities and populations. It builds on courses of study in the natural and behavioral sciences and explores the principles of movement organization, control and regulation. The HES program combines principles of behavioral health, biomechanics, exercise physiology, motor behavior, and nutrition to optimize physical, mental and social wellbeing. Unique to this degree is the translation of the sciences into individual, community and societal applications of health promotion across the lifespan. Students apply knowledge to optimize health and physical performance in leisure, work and rehabilitative environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL THERAPY</head><p>Flexible career opportunities include employment as an exercise specialist, health and wellness coach, personal trainer, sport performance coach or occupational and community health specialist. In addition, this program prepares graduates for application to professional graduate programs in the professions of physical therapy, athletic training, nutrition and other health related disciplines, as well as academic graduate programs in areas such an health and behavioral science, public health, exercise physiology and kinesiology.</p><p>The HES major provides a strong foundation in the natural and behavioral sciences and encourages students to tailor their course of study specific to their career goals. Upper division elective courses allow the student to focus on one of two tracks: Community Health Coaching and Exercise or Natural and Behavioral Science. Students will participate in an internship, which provides experience in the application of concepts developed during their studies. Independent study electives are also available.</p><p>In addition, the School offers an undergraduate minor in Health and Exercise Science.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VISION/MISSION/VALUES</head><p>Within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition of Regis University, the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions embraces the following vision, mission, and values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vision</head><p>Our vision is to be recognized for educating exceptional health care leaders who serve the greater good.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission</head><p>Our mission is to provide innovative education grounded in academic excellence, scholarship and social justice to cultivate visionary health care professionals committed to advancing the health of our global community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Values</head><p>We commit ourselves to:</p><p>• Consider the care and education of the whole person</p><p>• Foster a culture that uses evidence as the basis for education and practice The following procedure is to be followed if students wish to protest a grade received in a course when progression is not affected.</p><p>1. All grade appeals must be initiated within four weeks after the official term end date following receipt of the grade that is being challenged.</p><p>2. The student first contacts the instructor and reviews the issues. If the grade remains in dispute the student should follow step 3.</p><p>3. The student contacts the appropriate department/ program director/chair and, in writing, protests the disputed grade. The department director/chair then follows the following procedures:</p><p>• Both the student and the instructor submit written statements explaining the issue to the appropriate department director/chair. The department/program director/chair reviews all the documentation submitted to determine the validity of the challenge. The department/ program director/chair contacts the student and instructor to schedule an appointment, if necessary. The department/ program director/chair may choose to seek additional information from other sources, if indicated by the circumstances. The department/ program director/chair makes a decision about the disputed grade and conveys that decision in writing to the student and instructor. If either party wishes to contest the department director's/chair's decision, the dissatisfied party may appeal the decision within two weeks of receipt of the decision or solution.</p><p>NOTE: If the instructor of record is the department director/chair, a designee will be appointed.</p><p>• If the student's academic program is offered through the School of Nursing, Pharmacy, or Physical Therapy, the appeal is made to the appropriate school dean. If the academic program is offered through Counseling and Family Therapy or Health Services Education, the appeal is made to the division director. All other appeals are made to the Academic Dean of RHCHP. The appropriate dean or division director reviews the proceedings to date, obtains any new information deemed necessary, and makes the final determination. The appropriate dean or division director notifies all parties in writing of the final decision. The decision of the school dean or division director is final.</p><p>The following procedure is to be followed if students wish to protest a grade received in a course when that grade prevents the student from progressing in the program.</p><p>1. The student must contact the instructor regarding posting of a grade that affects progression within seven business days of the official term end date to review the issues. If the grade remains in dispute the student should follow step 2.</p><p>2. Within two business days of talking with the instructor, the student must initiate the formal appeal of the disputed grade by contacting the appropriate department director/chair and, in writing, protesting the disputed grade. The department director/chair then follows the following procedure:</p><p>• The department director/chair arranges for a committee of three faculty members to review the case. The student and the instructor each appoint one of the three committee members. The third committee member is chosen by the other two committee members. The department director/chair participates as an ex officio member of the committee. The committee reviews evidence in any manner the committee deems equitable. (Usually a written statement from each party that the other party can review and respond to in writing is submitted.) Oral presentations to the committee are sometimes useful. Care should be taken lest either of the parties be intimidated through oral procedure. Note: The size of the committee may vary slightly based on an individual school's approach to the process. In all cases, the student will have the opportunity to select a committee member to participate.</p><p>• If the student's academic program is offered through a school, the committee, with the concurrence of the department director/chair, recommends a solution to the school dean, who notifies the student and the instructor of the decision in writing. Examples of unprofessional conduct or unsafe behavior include but are not limited to:</p><p>• A pattern of unsafe clinical performance.</p><p>• Inadequate development of professional behaviors.</p><p>• Any action of omission or commission that results in serious injury or harm to another.</p><p>• Disrespectful, abusive or dishonest interaction with patients, families, staff, faculty or peers.</p><p>• Violation of a client's right to confidentiality.</p><p>• Performance of a criminal act.</p><p>• Abuse of drugs or illegal use or possession of controlled substances.</p><p>• Failure of a for-cause or random drug screen and/or failure to comply with a request for a for-cause or random drug screen.</p><p>• Failure to follow the policies and procedures of the clinical agency.</p><p>• Manipulation, alteration, removal or destruction of other student/faculty/University/clinical faculty/staff materials and/or equipment.</p><p>• Unauthorized use of Regis University or clinical agency equipment inclusive of computer accounts, records, and files.</p><p>• Violations of the professional standards of conduct and ethics of the profession the student is preparing to enter.</p><p>• Other prohibited conduct as defined by Regis University, the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions and the school, department, or program.</p><p>• Other conduct or behavior that is unprofessional or unsafe as determined by the discretion of the School or Department.</p><p>The faculty member and/or responsible supervisor making the initial judgment that a situation of unsafe behavior or unprofessional conduct in a clinical or academic setting exists shall inform the student of the charges against him/her and notify the appropriate school dean <ref type="bibr">(Nursing, Pharmacy, or Physical Therapy)</ref> or division director (Counseling and Family Therapy or Health Services Education) or designee. If in the judgment of the faculty member and/or responsible supervisor the nature of the conduct or behavior warrants, the student may be suspended from the classroom or clinical area until the review process has been completed.</p><p>Following a preliminary review of the evidence available in a case, the appropriate school dean/division director or designee shall schedule a hearing with the student to review the charges. If the student fails to appear at the hearing and the failure of appearance is not excused by the school dean/division director, the charges shall be deemed to be unchallenged and the student shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. In such cases the school dean/division director may proceed to apply such sanctions as the school dean/division director deems appropriate.</p><p>At the hearing, the school dean/division director or designee shall:</p><p>1. Provide the student with copies of all written reports regarding the circumstances and facts of the case. The student shall have an opportunity to give his/her reactions to the reports and to offer any additional information relevant to resolving the case.</p><p>2. Interview involved parties, including the student, about the facts of the case. The student shall have the right to hear any testimony related to the case that may adversely affect him/her and to question persons giving such testimony.</p><p>3. Allow the student to present witnesses on his/her own behalf and to be accompanied by one advisor who is not a party to the case. Such advisors must be members of the Regis University faculty or full-time staff.</p><p>Following the hearing and consultations deemed necessary with program faculty or committees, the school dean/division director or designee shall make a determination of the facts of the case and sanctions if appropriate. Sanction options include, but are not limited to, expulsion or suspension from the program, probation, warnings, or failure of a course.</p><p>Notification of the results of the review by the school dean/division director or designee shall be provided in writing by regular mail to the student's last known address as identified in the records of the University and to the academic dean of the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions.</p><p>The student shall have three working days from receipt of the letter to appeal the decision of the school dean/division director to the academic dean. Notification of the results of the review by the academic dean shall be provided in writing by mail to the student with a copy to the school dean, division director or designee. The decision of the academic dean is final.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC STANDING AND PENALTIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEFINITIONS</head><p>Academic probation is an official sanction that is applied when a student fails below the minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average for the program. Academic probation may also be applied for violations of the academic integrity policy. Academic suspension is an official sanction that is applied when a student on academic probation fails to achieve the required minimum acceptable cumulative grade point average or other conditions established under their probation. Academic suspension may also be applied for violations of the Academic Integrity Policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing</head><p>Students at Regis University must maintain at least a 2.000 ("C") cumulative grade point average to be in good academic standing. The cumulative grade point average is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted. A grade of "C-" or higher is required for upper division courses in the major or minor area to be counted as work toward the major or minor. A grade of "C-" or higher is required by some schools or departments for lower division major courses to be counted as work toward the major or minor.</p><p>NOTE: Undergraduate programs in the Loretto Heights School of Nursing require a grade of "C" (2.000) or higher in all nursing courses. The Health Services Education undergraduate programs require a grade of at least a "C" in all HIM and HCA courses and a cumulative GPA for progression at a 2.500.</p><p>A grade of "D" in other courses indicates an academic deficiency; however, those course hours may apply toward graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Warning</head><p>Undergraduate students in the Traditional Nursing Program whose semester grade point average falls below a 2.000 but whose cumulative grade point average remains above a 2.000 are placed on academic warning. Although academic warning indicates an academic deficiency, it is not as severe as academic probation and is not indicated on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>Students with a cumulative grade point average below a 2.00 are placed on academic probation. During the next semester of enrollment, the College expects students to raise their cumulative grade point average to a minimum of 2.000. In some instances, the academic advisor, in consultation with the department director or chair, establishes additional conditions that students must meet within a specified period of time. Failure to raise the cumulative grade point average or meet any of the specified conditions may result in suspension. Academic probation is recorded on the student's permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>Occasionally a student's Regis University cumulative grade point average is so low that it is almost mathematically impossible for the student to raise it to a 2.000 in one semester. In that situation, the department director or chair may enter into an agreement with the student to permit the student to earn a provisional grade point average for the semester. This agreed upon grade point average is set within a range that is a fair and reasonable expectation for the student in question. If the provisional grade point average is earned for the semester, but the student's cumulative grade point average remains below a 2.000, the student may be awarded the status of Probation Continued. If the agreed upon grade point average is not achieved, the student may be suspended.</p><p>In the case of academic probation due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school or department student handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>Undergraduate students in the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions who have been placed on academic probation and do not achieve cumulative grade point average of 2.000 (2.5 for some programs in RHCHP) or meet those conditions established during their probation are, under ordinary circumstances, suspended. This renders students ineligible to return to Regis University for a period of 12 months.</p><p>Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Any additional registrations will be dropped.</p><p>After one year, students may reapply for admission by submitting to the appropriate program: 1) a letter requesting readmission, explaining the causes of the earlier academic difficulties and describing how the student has overcome those difficulties; and 2) an official transcript showing at least 12 semester hours (or equivalent quarter hours) of acceptable academic coursework completed at another regionally accredited college or university.</p><p>In the case of academic suspension due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school or department student handbook.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>Students must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.000 to graduate. If a student's grade point average falls below 3.000 in the program, the student is placed on academic probation. Students placed on academic probation have one semester to raise their grade point average to a 3.000. In the case of academic probation due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school or department student handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension and Dismissal: Master's Students</head><p>Students who fail to raise the cumulative grade point average to 3.000 are suspended. In addition, students who receive a grade of "C" in two courses at the 600 level are subject to academic review and may be suspended from the program. Suspension may be appealed to the department director or school dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Masters students earning a letter grade of C-or below (course failure) are eligible to repeat the course for a minimum letter grade of "C" to maintain eligibility to progress in the graduate program pending program director approval.</p><p>Master's students in Leadership who receive two course failures (C-or lower) as initial grades in any course will be dismissed from the program.</p><p>Nurse practitioner students (NNP and FNP) who receive two course failures (C-or lower) as initial grades in any course will be dismissed from the program.</p><p>See the Division of Counseling and Family Therapy for minimum grade requirements for that Division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension and Dismissal: Doctor of Nursing Practice Students</head><p>Students who fail to raise the cumulative grade point average to 3.000 are suspended. In addition, students who receive a grade of "B-or below" in two courses at the 700 level are subject to academic review and may be suspended or dismissed from the program. Suspension may be appealed to the department director or school dean. Students who are notified of academic suspension for the previous term and who are currently in attendance in a Regis University class may complete that class. Students earning a letter grade of B-or below are eligible to repeat the course for a minimum letter grade of "B" to maintain eligibility to progress in the graduate program pending program director approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY</head><p>Students are notified of a change in academic status in writing from the program director or school dean, but failure to provide or receive the notice does not invalidate the action taken.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>When the cumulative grade point average of a student in the Doctor of Physical Therapy program falls below 3.00, the student is placed on academic probation. A student is allowed a maximum of two probation semesters during the length of the program. The School of Physical Therapy's expectation is that the student will make every effort to raise his/her cumulative GPA to 3.00 in the first probationary semester in order to return to good academic standing. If it is not possible for a student on probation to raise their cumulative GPA to a 3.00 within two semesters, the student will be suspended from the program (see section on Academic Suspension). A student on academic probation is not allowed to participate in clinical education experiences. Academic Probation is noted on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>In the case of academic probation due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school student handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>A student is suspended from the Doctor of Physical Therapy program if he/she fails to complete necessary remediation to a satisfactory level in the subsequent semester of receiving a "C" or "C-." A student who receives a grade lower than a "C-" in a course is suspended from the program. In addition, if a student's cumulative grade point average is less than 3.000 for more than two semesters, he/she is suspended from the program. A student who fails a clinical experience will be reviewed for suspension from the program. Academic suspension renders the student ineligible to participate in the School's academic activities including academic coursework, clinical coursework, and project coursework for the remaining sequence of course offerings with the student's respective class. The student may apply for consideration of readmission to the program for the following academic year. Academic Suspension is noted on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p><p>In the case of academic suspension due to violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, refer to the school student handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>Academic dismissal is action taken by the program that renders a student ineligible to return to Regis University for any program of study. For this action to be taken, a student must have been suspended for academic reasons, been readmitted to the DPT program on academic probation, and subsequently failed to achieve the required cumulative GPA of 3.000. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>Academic dismissal is action taken by the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions that renders a student ineligible to return to the College for any program of study. Academic dismissal may be imposed for serious violations of academic integrity or failure to meet the conditions of a prior academic suspension. In the case of a serious violation of academic integrity, a student may be dismissed following a first offense. In the case of academic suspension for grade point average, a student must have been suspended for low cumulative grade point average, been readmitted to the program on academic probation, and subsequently failed to achieve the required cumulative grade point average. Academic dismissal is recorded on the permanent academic record (transcript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension/Dismissal Appeal Procedure</head><p>Upon being notified in writing of suspension or dismissal due to a low grade point average, students who wish to appeal the decision should do the following:</p><p>1. Write a letter of appeal to the school dean/division director of the appropriate school/division within deadline stated on the letter of notification. This letter of appeal should include:</p><p>a. The student's honest and straight-forward assessment of how the academic problems came about.</p><p>b. Why the student failed to achieve the required grade point average. Were there, for example, any extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control?</p><p>c. Why the student should not be suspended from the program or dismissed from the University.</p><p>d. Some indication that the student is ready to continue serious academic work.</p><p>e. The names of the student's advisor or faculty members from whom supporting statements may be solicited by the student.</p><p>2. Collect supporting statements from advisor, faculty members, or external medical provider as appropriate who are willing to support the appeal and submit these statements with letter of appeal by the designated deadline.</p><p>The school dean/division director is interested in any pertinent information that has genuine bearing on the matter. The focus is on why the student failed to reach his/her academic goals and why the student should be allowed to continue studies at Regis University.</p><p>The school dean/division director reviews all materials submitted by the student and, if appropriate, forwards them to the designated faculty committee within the program. The school dean/ division director notifies the student in writing of the final decision regarding the student's appeal.</p><p>In the case of academic suspension or academic dismissal due to violations of academic integrity, appeals are handled by the Academic Integrity Board for the Rueckert-Hartman College of Health Professions. The specific policy and procedure for appeals of sanctions related to academic integrity are delineated in the school/ departmental handbooks within the Academic Integrity Policy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</head><p>The entry-level DPT program is 110 semester hours of full-time study, offered in eight semesters over three calendar years. This degree prepares students to be autonomous and Interprofessional general practitioners equipped with the necessary tools to practice physical therapy as leaders in health systems in the 21 st century.</p><p>The physical therapy curriculum explores motor control and movement system as foundational principles of PT education. Students study how the components of multiple body systems (cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, integumentary, nervous and musculoskeletal) interact to produce movement and relate this knowledge to physical therapy management across the lifespan. Extensive study of the foundation sciences is incorporated into the curriculum. Within an evidenced-based practice perspective, graduates apply the most current published literature to daily clinical decisions. This model enables students to successfully link theory and application to clinical practice. Numerous faculty-facilitated, small group activities are also included in the curriculum. For example, in-depth clinical problems and issues are explored in small group tutorials offered in the Professional Issues/Case Management series of the curriculum. These tutorials serve to extend and integrate content from other courses and foster students' ability to access and apply information. We encourage all members of the Regis community to learn proficiently, think logically and critically, identify and choose personal standards of values, and be socially responsible. We further encourage the development of skills and leadership abilities necessary for distinguished professional work and contributions to the improvement and transformation of the physical therapy profession.</p><p>During clinical experiences, students have the opportunity to integrate knowledge gained from courses and to refine their skills in examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, outcomes, and communication with diverse populations. Participation in clinical experiences within the program necessitates travel to various sites outside the Denver area and across the country. All expenses incurred during the clinical experiences are the responsibility of the student. Students are required to participate in a minimum of one rural experience and one out-of-state experience to facilitate an understanding of diverse practice settings. Currently, the School of Physical Therapy is affiliated with more than 400 clinical sites throughout the country, as well as select international experiences.</p><p>Graduation requirements include completion of course requirements, a scholarly project and a capstone portfolio. Upon successful completion of the program, graduates are awarded a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree, making them eligible to take the physical therapy licensure examination in any U.S. jurisdiction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS</head><p>The intent of the entry-level physical therapy program is to educate competent physical therapists who can examine, evaluate, diagnose, and establish interventions for the general population of acute, rehabilitation and chronic patients/clients in health care settings. The observational, cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills deemed essential to complete this program and to perform as a competent practitioner of physical therapy are located in the School of Physical Therapy Student Handbook.</p><p>If a student cannot meet these essential skills and abilities, it is the responsibility of the student to request an appropriate accommodation.

Similarly, students who have not completed their bachelor's degree must successfully graduate with a B.A. or B.S. degree prior to matriculation. Students must submit official transcripts demonstrating that the conditional requirements have been met prior to the first day of regular classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisites</head><p>Prerequisite course work must be completed prior to matriculation into the School of Physical Therapy. The biological and physical science courses must be those designated for science majors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Literacy</head><p>Students are required to be computer literate prior to entering the program. Necessary skills include proficiency in several computer applications such as Microsoft Office or similar Google apps. Students are also expected to be comfortable navigating web pages using common Internet browsers, attaching documents to emails, and participating in online discussion forums as required by specific courses within the program. Prior knowledge in SPSS statistical software is highly recommended.</p><p>All DPT students must have ready a laptop or tablet compliant with RHCHP systems requirements and configuration for the online learning management system that is used to augment classroom-based courses. See Student Handbook and University website for specific details.</p><p>NOTE: High speed broadband (cable or DSL) or wireless Internet access at home and while on clinical rotations is required so that students can access multimedia files through the University systems throughout the entire program. All students/faculty/staff electronic communication is accomplished through an issued RegisNET email account. Class notes, routine school communication, and class scheduling are examples of critical information that students will access daily through the RegisNET account. The University has several computer labs on campus that students may use, however, access from home and clinical rotation housing is essential. Consult the school website for further information on system requirements and configurations at www.regis.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVISING</head><p>An academic faculty advisor is assigned to all entering DPTadvisor students. Advisors counsel students on meeting requirements for the graduate program and provide guidance and support for progression throughout the program as necessary. Students are required to meet with their advisors a minimum of one time per semester to facilitate ongoing dialogue and development of professional behaviors, complete portfolio requirements, and graduation criteria throughout their studies. Each DPT student is also assigned a clinical education advisor for guidance in selecting and completing clinical education experiences, and a research advisor for completion of a scholarly project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROGRAM PROGRESSION</head><p>A student needs a minimum grade of "C+" or better in each course in order to progress in the Physical Therapy program. If a grade of "C" or "C-" is received in any of the course requirements, the student must remediate the course within the following semester in order to progress (for specifics, see Remediation). Students may participate in clinical education rotations during semester IV while remediating a grade of "C" or "C-". DPT students may not participate in any subsequent clinical education experience until remediation of a grade of "C" or "C-" in a previous semester course is completed. It should be noted that failure to participate in a clinical education experience may limit a student's ability to continue participation in the program with their original cohort. As DPT courses are offered once a year, a student may be required to delay progression for a full academic year to complete a required course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADD/DROP</head><p>Students follow the add/drop policy dates published in the General Information section of this Catalog. Requests to drop a course require the signature of the program director. Students who drop a course must understand that this jeopardizes their ability to continue in the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REMEDIATION</head><p>A grade of "C" or "C-" for a course must be remediated. The initial grade will be changed to a "C+" following successful remediation of the "C" or "C-" grade. Grades of "D" or "F" for a course cannot be remediated. Refer to the RHCHP Graduate Academic Suspension section in this Catalog for consequences. The process of remediation begins the first week of the semester following receipt of a grade of "C" or "C-". During this week, a remediation contract with input from the student and instructor is developed that outlines format, content and evaluation method for the remediation. This contract is finalized and signed by the student, instructor, and program director.</p><p>The agreed upon remediation must be successfully completed by the end of the semester following the semester in which the unsatisfactory grade was received. Failure to successfully complete the remediation process by this time cancels the student's ability to participate in a clinical education experience. An exception to this policy is available during semester IV. Students may participate in DPT 750--Clinical Education I while remediating a "C" or "C-" grade. Students may not participate in any subsequent clinical education rotations until remediation for a "C" or "C-" in a previous semester course is completed.</p><p>Students should be aware that completion of a remediation must occur at least nine business days prior to the start of the clinical education rotation. It should again be noted that failure to participate in a clinical education experience may limit a student's ability to progress through the remainder of the curriculum. Students should refer to Program Progression for specific consequences for not completing a remediation successfully or on time. If the initial remediation is not successful, one more remediation is allowed as long as time still allows within the designated remediation contract date. If remediation attempts continue beyond the contract date (in cases of subsequent clinical rotations) or end of semester, this may also necessitate stopping out until the next academic year. If this remediation is not successful, the student is considered to have an unremediated "C" or "C-" and is suspended from the program. </p></div>

Courses must be chosen carefully to ensure completion of all requirements for entrance into the professional schools and to make adequate preparation for the Medical College Aptitude Test or the Dental Aptitude Test, examinations that are usually taken at the end of the junior year. Students are encouraged to gain experience in health-related service areas, including volunteer or internship activities. Students also may participate in educational and service activities sponsored by Alpha Epsilon Delta, the National Health Pre-Professional Honor Society. Students interested in preparation for graduate health careers should contact the Pre-Med/Pre-Health advisor located in the Biology Department. Doctoral Degree in Physical Therapy may complete any undergraduate major. Many students on this track choose to major in Health and Exercise Science offered through RHCHP. Other options in the natural sciences such as Biology, Chemistry, and Neuroscience and the social sciences, such as Psychology, are also useful in preparing for a career in Physical Therapy. While the School of Physical Therapy does not guarantee admission to Regis graduates, individuals who have earned a baccalaureate degree at Regis University and who have completed the prerequisite courses are given preference for admission. Undergraduate students considering a Doctoral Degree in Physical Therapy should contact the School of Physical Therapy for specific information on prerequisite coursework.RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS (ROTC)Enrollment in Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) provides undergraduates and selected graduate students an opportunity to combine academic study with a military officer's professional education program. The Air Force and Army conduct courses in their respective areas leading to a regular reserve commission upon graduation. All programs are open to both men and women. ROTC programs are offered in a cross-town agreement with program classes and labs at the University of Colorado-Boulder, although courses are often also available at Colorado School of Mines or Auraria Campus. This program is in three parts: the General Military Course for lower division students (normally freshman and sophomores), the Professional Officer Course for upper division students (normally juniors and seniors), and Leadership Laboratory attended by all cadets. Completion of the General Military Course is a prerequisite for entry into the Professional Officer Course. Completion of a four-week summer training course is required prior to commissioning.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Standard Four-Year Program</cell></row><row><cell>PRE-PHARMACY PROGRAM</cell></row><row><cell>Undergraduate students interested in pursuing a Doctoral Degree</cell></row><row><cell>in Pharmacy (Pharm.

This sequence of education courses at Regis is designed to lead to licensure at the elementary, secondary, or K-12 grade levels in Colorado. In addition, as a required component of our programs, all graduates complete the qualifications for an Endorsement in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education. Students also have the option to pursue licensure in special education. A Special Education Generalist Endorsement is available in conjunction with and elementary or secondary teaching licensure.The licensure programs are mission oriented and focus on serving the needs of all students. Students complete teaching internships in a variety of high needs schools in the Denver metropolitan area, including public and Catholic schools with diverse populations. Regis students enrolled in this sequence begin developing teacher performance, dispositions, and knowledge during the first courses and initial field experiences. Students may also choose to major in Elementary Education: Teaching for Social Justice. Students interested in teaching middle school or high school can pursue licensure with a content major(ex,  mathematics, sciences, English, Spanish, history).The Committee on Teacher Education at Regis (COTER) develops the College policies on admission, retention, and recommendation for licensure. To qualify for admission, retention, and recommendation for licensure through the Regis University Teacher Education Program, students must satisfy the requirements detailed in the Education Department section of this Catalog.</figDesc><table><row><cell>For students with a bachelor's degree seeking teacher licensure,</cell></row><row><cell>Regis College offers the Master of Arts in Education Graduate</cell></row><row><cell>Teacher Licensure Program.

Master's students in the Leadership in Health Care Systems specialization are prepared for leadership roles.</figDesc><table><row><cell>training in health LORETTO HEIGHTS SCHOOL OF Division of Health Services Education houses an undergraduate degree program in Health Care Administration, a graduate degree programs in Health Services Administration, and academic certificate programs in Health Care Quality and Patient Safety and Health Care Business Management. Coursework is offered in an accelerated format with curricula designed to reflect principles of adult learning. Most courses are offered online. Designated courses are available as electives to students in other majors. Within the Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions all degree programs include a requirement for a course in health care ethics. The Division of Health Services Education offers courses in Health Care Ethics to address that expectation. At the undergraduate level, the division offers a general course in ethics and health that is open to students from many majors and required for Health and Exercise Science students, as well as focused courses for programs in Nursing and Health Care Administration. Graduate level courses are designed to meet the needs of specific programs in Health Services Education, Nursing, Pharmacy and Physical Therapy. Currently, the division does not offer a Health Care Ethics major or a minor. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION (HCA) The Bachelor of Science in Health Care Administration degree was approved in September 1993. The first classes for this degree began in spring of 1994. The program prepares students for a variety of technical, managerial and consultative roles in the health care industry. Settings may include hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory facilities, clinics, government agencies, computer firms, service agencies and educational institutions. The curriculum combines online and classroom learning with an administrative internship that features on-the-job supervised experience in an approved health care facility. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HSA) The Master of Science degree in Health Services Administration was approved in January of 1999 and the first class was admitted in October 1999. The innovative advanced practice model recognizes prior learning based on an undergraduate foundation in health care management and/or prior health care management experience. With minimal introductory content, the curriculum contains a challenging master's core with advanced practice courses in finance and accounting, operations, quality, and technology management. This allows for a shorter but more in-depth preparation of students. Courses make extensive use of case studies and applied projects. Special topic courses allow individual students to custom design learning experiences in specific areas of interest and expertise preparing students for a wide range of administrative positions. The curriculum promotes the further development of leadership abilities along with a deeper appreciation of the social and ethical obligations and NURSING The baccalaureate degree in nursing, master's degree in nursing, and Doctor of Nursing Practice at Regis University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, One Dupont Circle, NW, Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 887-6791. Regis University adopted and integrated the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree when Loretto Heights College closed in May 1988. The Colorado State Board of Nursing first approved the program at Loretto Heights in 1948, the year it was established at that college. In 1952, the National League for Nursing (NLN) accredited the College's program. That accreditation was transferred to Regis University when the program moved. In 1991, a graduate program in Nursing was established. In 1993, the National League for Nursing (NLN) renewed the undergraduate program accreditation and granted full five-year initial accreditation to the Master of Science in Nursing Program. In 1999, both the National League for Nursing Accreditation Commission (NLNAC) and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) visited the School of Nursing and granted full, continuing accreditation to the undergraduate and graduate nursing programs. In 2002, the Loretto Heights School of Nursing decided to maintain a single accreditation--with AACN-CCNE --and discontinued accreditation with NLNAC. In 2017, the Loretto Heights School of Nursing received full ten-year accreditation for its Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse and The Doctor of Nursing Practice programs from CCNE. with a special emphasis on developing critical thinking, ethical decision making, and a commitment to social justice. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING (BSN) The Loretto Heights School of Nursing offers the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) in different scheduling formats in order to meet the needs of a variety of student populations seeking their BSN. The Traditional Nursing Program offers the undergraduate curriculum according to a traditional academic fall through spring schedule. The Accelerated Nursing Program is available to serve the adult with a previous non-nursing baccalaureate degree who desires a degree in nursing. The Connecting Healthcare Occupations with Innovative Curriculum and Experience (CHOICE) Nursing Program offers the BSN with flexible schedules accommodating individuals who work in health care. Programs are also offered for registered nurses (RNs) wishing to earn BSN. The RN-BSN Program is delivered in a blended format or an online format. The RN to MS Nursing Program offers RNs both the BSN degree and the Master of Science degree (Leadership in Health Care Systems specialization) in a single program. conflicts inherent within the industry. CERTIFICATE IN HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY Patient outcomes have been measured in various ways since the late 1800s, but it was not until the 1970s that health care organizations began employing quality assurance nurses. Health care organizations have responded throughout the years by establishing quality and patient safety departments within their organizations. In the past, direction for quality programs was based on requirements of accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report focusing on the safety of patients in the U.S. health care system. This report triggered a number of actions including the 100K Lives Campaign, public reporting of health outcomes, pay for performance initiatives, and the National Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, which encourages voluntary reporting of adverse events. Reporting of health outcomes by health care agencies and other organizations has created an environment of transparency for health care organizations. The public can now access and compare hospitals on mortality rates, infection rates, how many complaints a hospital or nursing home has had, and much more. The core of this certificate is comprised of four courses. Students who do not have at least two years of health care experience in a hospital or appropriate setting or basic knowledge or experience using quality improvement tools may also be required to take Health Care Delivery Systems (HSA 610). The certificate is offered in an online format. MANAGEMENT (HCBM) The HCBM certificate was developed for professionals requiring specific graduate-level, health care management skill sets, though may not have the time or desire to complete a full graduate curriculum. The HCBM certificate provides a broad array of options for professionals to customize a certificate by completing four of nine courses offered. Students, along with their advisors, determine which courses will best enhance professional aspirations. Students electing to complete a full graduate curriculum at a later date may apply all of their certificate courses to the MS in Health Services Administration graduate curriculum. This effectively opens horizons for students to complete one-third (four of twelve required courses) of a graduate degree by completing the certificate. The HCBM certificate is appropriate for anyone who has already earned an undergraduate degree from an accredited university. Professionals from any of the health care related disciplines are welcome to apply for the certificate program. This includes health care supervisors and managers, pharmacists, physical therapists, behavioral health professionals, nurses, those individuals with a technical background who need additional This specialization is offered in a synchronous, one evening per week (classroom or Zoom) or online. The Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) specialization is offered in a one full day per week format. The School also offers a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner (NNP) and a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) specialization in a one full day per week format. A Master of Science degree completion option for certified nurse practitioners is also offered. POST GRADUATE ACADEMIC NURSING CERTIFICATES The School also offers a Graduate Academic Certificate in Health Care Education, Post-Master's Certificates for FNPs, NNPs, PMHNPs, and Adult-Gerontology Acute-Care for FNPs. DOCTOR OF NURSING PRACTICE (DNP) Students can enter the program through the post-master of science in nursing to DNP or post-bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) to DNP. The post-master of science in nursing to Doctor of Nursing Practice program builds upon the current MS in nursing curricula, while the post-bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) to DNP builds upon both the BSN and MS in nursing curricula. This terminal nursing degree is designed to prepare advanced practice nurses, advanced and executive health care leaders. Students gain expertise in social responsibility, healthcare policy, fiscal issues, program development, and evidence-based practice outcomes. The DNP is offered online over six semesters or in a flex option of nine semesters and contains clinical and All nursing curricula are designed to educate students in the art practicum experiences focusing on meeting the health care needs CERTIFICATE IN HEALTH CARE BUSINESS and science of nursing.
