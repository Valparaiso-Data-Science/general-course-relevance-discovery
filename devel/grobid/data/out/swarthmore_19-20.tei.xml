<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction to Swarthmore College</head><p>Swarthmore College, founded in 1864 by members of the Religious Society of Friends as a coeducational institution, occupies a campus of 425 acres of rolling wooded land in and adjacent to the Borough of Swarthmore in Delaware County, Pa. It is a small college by deliberate policy, with an enrollment of approximately 1,600 students. The Borough of Swarthmore is a residential suburb within half an hour's commuting distance of Philadelphia. College students are able to enjoy both the advantages of nearby rural settings and the opportunities offered by Philadelphia. The College's location also makes cooperation possible with three nearby institutions, Bryn Mawr and Haverford colleges and the University of Pennsylvania.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Objectives and Purposes</head><p>Swarthmore students are expected to prepare themselves for full, balanced lives as individuals and as responsible citizens through exacting intellectual study supplemented by a varied program of sports and other extracurricular activities. The purpose of Swarthmore College is to make its students more valuable human beings and more useful members of society. Although it shares this purpose with other educational institutions, each school, college, and university seeks to realize that purpose in its own way. Swarthmore seeks to help its students realize their full intellectual and personal potential combined with a deep sense of ethical and social concern.</p><p>1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Varieties of Educational Experience</head><p>Education is largely an individual matter, for no two students are exactly alike. The Swarthmore College curriculum is designed to give recognition to this fact and seeks to evoke the maximum effort and development from each student. The Swarthmore College Honors Program offers additional enriching and exciting intellectual experiences to students who choose to prepare for evaluation by examiners from other colleges and universities. Throughout the curriculum, options for independent study and interdisciplinary work offer opportunities for exploration and development over a wide range of individual goals. These opportunities typically include considerable flexibility of program choices from semester to semester, so that academic planning may be responsive to the emerging needs of students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">The Religious Tradition</head><p>Swarthmore College was founded by members of the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers). Although it has been nonsectarian in control since 1908 and Friends now compose a small minority of the student body, the faculty, and the administration, the College still values highly many of the principles of that society. Foremost among these principles is the individual's responsibility for seeking and applying truth and for testing whatever truth one believes one has found. As a way of life, Quakerism emphasizes hard work, simple living, and generous giving as well as personal integrity, social justice, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The College does not seek to impose on its students this Quaker view of life or any other specific set of convictions about the nature of things and the duties of human beings. It does, however, encourage ethical and religious concern about such matters and continuing examination of any view that may be held regarding them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Tradition and Change</head><p>A college draws strength from tradition and energy from the necessity of change. Its purposes and policies must respond to new conditions and new demands. By being open to change, Swarthmore tries to provide for its students, by means appropriate to the times, the standard of excellence it has sought to maintain from its founding. p. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Educational Resources</head><p>The primary educational resources of any college are the quality of its faculty and the spirit of the institution. Financial as well as physical resources play an important supportive role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Endowment</head><p>The educational resources at Swarthmore College have been provided by gifts and bequests from many alumni, foundations, corporations, parents, and friends. In addition to unrestricted gifts for the operating budget, these donors have contributed funds for buildings, equipment, collections of art and literature, and permanently endowed professorships, scholarships, awards, book funds, and lectureships. Their gifts to Swarthmore have not only provided the physical plant but also have created an endowment fund of $1.956 billion at market value on June 30, 2017. Swarthmore is ranked among the highest in the country in endowment per student. Income from the endowment during the academic year 2016-2017 contributed approximately $46,360 to meet the total expense of educating each student and provided about 50 percent of the College's operating revenues. The College's ability to continue to offer a high quality of education depends on continuing voluntary support. Swarthmore seeks additional gifts and bequests for its current operations, its permanent endowment, and its capital development programs to maintain and strengthen its resources. The vice president in charge of development will be pleased to provide information about various forms of gifts: bequests, outright gifts of cash or securities, real estate or other property, and deferred gifts through charitable remainder trusts and life-income contracts in which the donor reserves the right to the annual income during his or her lifetime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Libraries</head><p>The Libraries support the core mission of the College through active participation in the instructional and research program and the curation of collections in a variety of formats. Subject specialist librarians foster the development of student critical research skills by supporting student research projects and partnering with faculty to deliver course-specific instructionmeeting with 75 individual courses over the 2017/18 academic year. Library research instruction focuses on helping students learn to navigate the contemporary information environment critically and thoughtfully. Through formal and informal learning experiences students begin to understand their role in the broader scholarly conversation. Students who seek opportunities to develop deeper research and information technology skills can participate in library programs including the seminar-based Library Internship and our Lib/Lab Fellows in digital scholarship. ITS and the Libraries partner to offer the summer SPEED program in which students work with faculty, library, and IT staff on digital projects ranging from visualizations of early English novels to a Navaho verb generator. This program parallels the Libraries work consulting with faculty on a wide array of emerging tools and technologies for teaching and research. Swarthmore, as part of the Tri-College Library Consortium along with Haverford and Bryn Mawr colleges, takes advantage of a long history of cooperation and a unified, online catalog, Tripod, in building a research-quality collection. Through the consortium and a network of cooperative arrangements with other academic institutions, the Libraries provide students and faculty access to cultural and scholarly resources from libraries across the globe. The Libraries are a leader in advancing the conversation on and progress towards a more just and inclusive campus. Library staff work with the Dean's Office and other campus partners to enable all students to fully to participate in the academic life of the College. The Libraries support firstgeneration and low-income students through provisioning of texts and textbooks, laptops and other critical resources for learning. Library staff support students with disabilities by ensuring that library resources are as accessible as possible and playing a central role in campus accessibility efforts. Responsive to the emerging needs and issues on campus, the Libraries are committed to pursuing an array of initiatives in collaboration with campus partners to foster sustainability, equity and justice. The Libraries' ever-evolving spaces meet community needs for exhibitions and public gatherings, individual and group study, teaching and learning, printing, production and access to technology. Swarthmore College library holdings include over 600,000 print monographs and serials with thousands of new volumes added annually. In addition to the print collection, the libraries provide access to extensive holdings of e-books, ejournals and databases. The College participates in the Federal and Pennsylvania Depository Library Program and selects those government documents most appropriate to the needs of the curriculum and the public and catalogs them in Tripod. The majority of these government document titles are now available online. The libraries also provide access to multidisciplinary collections of video and music, in both physical and streaming formats. The video collection includes classic U.S. and foreign films as well as educational, documentary, and experimental films. Materials associated with the research and scholarship of the College and collections of digitized archives or items of historical importance such as student theses, faculty publications, art images, the yearbook and p. 2 student newspaper, and streamed videos of College performances can be found in locallycreated digital repositories. The collections are housed in three libraries. The Thomas B. and Jeannette L. McCabe Library is the center of the College library system and is home to the major portion of the collections in the humanities and social sciences. It has extensive public computing resources, a wide variety of reading and study areas, and several video viewing rooms. In 2018, the Color Room (the Frank and Vera Brown Study Room) opened. Dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of color and to Swarthmore couples past, present and future it contains a selection of books on color, pigment samples, and cards, and objects to facilitate exploration of color. Located within the Science Center, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering is the most popular study space on campus.

The Underhill Music and Dance Library in the Lang Music Building facilitates research in the performing arts through a highly curated collection including books, journals, sound recordings and videos. Staff offer expert research advice. Underhill provides a wide variety of listening and viewing facilities and has some of the loveliest views of the Crum Woods. The Libraries also help curate and increase the visibility of a variety of specialized collections across campus in the Black Cultural Center, the Beit Midrash (located in the Bond Lodge 5), the Women's Resource Center, the Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, and the Language Resource Center. These collections are all findable through the Tripod library catalog.</p></div>

This fund will be administered by the Athletics Department and supports activities and expenses associated with the field hockey program at Swarthmore College including training trips and trips by field hockey coaching staff to high school field hockey games and tournaments. The List Gallery Exhibit Fund, established through the generosity of Mrs. Albert List, supports exhibits in the List Gallery of the Eugene M. and Theresa Lang Performing Arts Center. The Lorax Fund for Environmental Sustainability was established in 2007 by a grant from the Schwab Charitable Fund as recommended by Naomi Zikmund-Fisher '91. The fund is used to p. 10 backgrounds in their pursuit of a Swarthmore College education. This fund is administered by the Dean's Office. The Swarthmore Summer <ref type="bibr">Scholars Program Endowment Fund was established in 2016 by Mark M. '74 and Amanda Orr '73</ref> Harmeling. This fund supports the Swarthmore Summer Scholars Program (S 3 P). The recipients will be chosen by program staff, in collaboration with the Provost's Office. The Swarthmore Chapter of Sigma Xi Lecture Series brings eminent scientists to the campus under its auspices throughout the year. Local members present colloquia on their own research. The Thatcher Fund provides individualized assistance to students with disabilities. The purpose of the fund is to enable such students to take full advantage of the academic and extracurricular life of the College and to make Swarthmore a desirable choice for prospective students with disabilities. The fund was established in 1997. The Phoebe Anna Thorne Memorial Endowment was created by a Thorne family member in 1911. The endowment supports the faculty of Swarthmore College. The Pat Trinder Endowment was established by alumni and friends of Patricia E. Trinder, a member of the career planning and placement office staff, to honor her many years of dedication and support to students. The endowment supports programs to advance career planning and placement at Swarthmore College. It specifically supports alumni participation in the recruiting, placement, and mentoring efforts for students. The P. Linwood Urban Jr. Partners in Ministry Endowment was created in recognition of the importance of a distinctive ecumenical program of spiritual nurture serving the entire Swarthmore College community. Income from the Urban endowment is distributed to Partners in Ministry to help provide for the compensation of the religious adviser and supporting staff of the Swarthmore Protestant community. The Waksman Fund for Summer Scholars was established in 2016 by the Board of Trustees of the Waksman Foundation for Microbiology. This fund supports one scholar annually, to be named the Waksman Scholar, taking part in the Swarthmore Summer Scholars <ref type="bibr">Program (S3P)</ref>. This fund, which supports the Swarthmore Summer Scholars Program budget, is administered by the Provost's Office. The Benjamin West Lecture, made possible by gifts from members of the Class of 1905 and other friends of the College, is given annually on some phase of art. It is the outgrowth of the Benjamin West Society, which built up a collection of paintings, drawings, and prints, which are exhibited, as space permits, in the buildings on campus. The lecture was named for the American artist who was born in a house that stands on the campus and became president of the Royal Academy. The Dan and Sidney West House Endowment was established in 2006 by Giles and Barbara Kemp to honor Vice President Dan C. West and his wife, Sidney Childs West.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 13</head><p>Inquiries concerning admission and applications should be addressed to the Vice President and Dean of Admissions, Swarthmore College, 500 College Avenue, Swarthmore PA 19081-1390 or admissions@swarthmore.edu. Office telephone: 610-328-8300 or 800-667-3110.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">General Statement</head><p>In the selection of students, the College seeks those qualities of character, social responsibility, and intellectual capacity that it is primarily concerned to develop. It seeks them not in isolation but as essential elements of the whole personality of candidates for admission. Selection is important and difficult. No simple formula will be effective. The task is to choose those who give promise of distinction in the quality of their personal lives, in service to the community, or in leadership in their chosen fields. Swarthmore College must choose its students on the basis of their academic achievement and commitment to intellectual inquiry as well as their individual future worth to society and of their collective contribution to the College. It is the College's policy to have the student body represent not only different parts of the United States but also many foreign countries; public, independent, and religiously affiliated schools; and various economic, social, religious, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. The College is also concerned to include in each class the sons and daughters of alumni and members of the Society of Friends. Admission to the first-year class is normally based on the satisfactory completion of a 4-year secondary school program. Under some circumstances, students who have virtually completed the normal 4-year program in 3 years will be considered for admission, provided they meet the competition of other candidates in general maturity as well as readiness for a rigorous academic program. Home-schooled students should make every effort to complete the application with information that is appropriate to their experience. It is useful to note that Swarthmore is looking for the same information about a candidate as is required from a student with more traditional secondary schooling. Students who have already completed a college degree, or higher, are not eligible for admission to Swarthmore College. All applicants are selected on the following evidence: Record in secondary school. Recommendations from the school principal, headmaster, or guidance counselor, and from two academic teachers. Standardized testing results for either the SAT or the ACT. SAT Subject Tests are not required for admission, but will be considered if submitted.</p><p>Applicants considering a major in engineering are encouraged to take the SAT Math level 2 Subject Test. A brief statement about why the student is applying to Swarthmore. Co-curricular and extracurricular activities. Applicants must have satisfactory standing in school and standardized tests as well as strong intellectual interests. The College is also interested in strength of character, promise of growth, initiative, seriousness of purpose, distinction in personal and extracurricular interests, and a sense of social responsibility. The College values the diversity that varied interests and backgrounds can bring to the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Preparation</head><p>Swarthmore does not require a set plan of secondary school courses as preparation for its program. The election of specific subjects is left to the student and school advisers. In general, preparation should include the following: • Accurate and effective use of the English language in reading, writing, and speaking. • Comprehension and application of the principles of mathematics. •</p><p>The strongest possible command of one or two foreign languages. The College encourages students to study at least one language for 4 years, if possible. • Substantial coursework in history and social studies; literature, art, and music; and mathematics and the sciences. Variations of choice and emphasis are acceptable, although some work in each of the three groups is recommended. Those planning to major in engineering should present work in chemistry, physics, and 4 years of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Application Process</head><p>Application to the College may be submitted through either the Regular Decision or one of the Early Decision plans. Applicants follow the same procedures, submit the same supporting materials, and are evaluated by the same criteria under each plan. The Regular Decision plan is designed for those candidates who wish to keep open several different options for their undergraduate education throughout the admissions process. Applications under this plan will be accepted at any time up to the Jan. 1 deadline, but the application should be submitted as early as possible to create a file for the candidate to which supporting material will be added up to the deadline. The Early Decision plans are designed for candidates who have thoroughly and thoughtfully p. 14 3 Admissions investigated Swarthmore and other colleges and found Swarthmore to be an unequivocal first choice. On applying to Swarthmore College, Early Decision candidates may not file an early decision application at other colleges, but they may file early action/regular applications at other colleges with the understanding that these applications will be withdrawn upon admission to Swarthmore. Any Early Decision candidate not admitted will receive one of two determinations: a deferral of decision, which secures reconsideration for the candidate among the Regular Decision candidates, or a denial of admission, which withdraws the application from further consideration. If one of these determinations is made, the applicant is free to apply to other institutions. Application under any plan must be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $60 or fee waiver (which must be approved by the secondary school counselor). Timetables for the plans are the following: Fall Early Decision Application deadline Nov. 15 Notification of candidate by <ref type="bibr">Dec. 15</ref> Winter Early Decision Application deadline Jan. 1 Notification of candidate by Feb. 15 Regular Decision Application deadline Jan. 1 Notification of candidate by April 1 Candidate reply date May 1 Under certain circumstances, admitted students may apply in writing to defer their admission for one year. These requests must be received by May 1 and approved in writing by the dean of admissions, and students must confirm their plans for the year by June 1. The dean of admissions may choose to review other requests on a case-bycase basis. Students granted deferment may neither apply to nor enroll at another degree-granting college/university program. Swarthmore College places strong emphasis on academic achievement and personal character. An offer of admission to Swarthmore College is dependent on a student maintaining his or her standard of academic achievement before enrolling at the College. An offer of admission is also dependent on a student's continued demonstration of character and high standards for personal conduct. Lapses in either category may be grounds for rescinding an offer of admission. For U.S. citizens, permanent residents, undocumented, or DACA-eligible students applying as first-year or transfer students, admission to Swarthmore is determined without regard to financial need. See information concerning financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Interview</head><p>An admissions interview with a representative of the College is an optional part of the first-year application process. Prospective first-year applicants should take the initiative in arranging for this interview. On-campus interviews are available to rising seniors from June through early December. Students are encouraged to complete the interview before submitting an application to the College. Those who can reach Swarthmore with no more than a half-day's trip are urged to make an appointment to visit the College for this purpose. Other students may contact the Admissions Office in the fall of their senior year to request a meeting with an alumni representative in their own area. The deadline to request an alumni interview is in late November each year. Applicants for transfer may interview with an alumni representative. Transfer interviews are optional, may be requested in the winter, and must be completed by the transfer application deadline of April 1. Arrangements for on-campus interview appointments for prospective first-year applicants, off-campus alumni interviews, or for transfer interviews can be made through the admissions website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Advanced Placement</head><p>Enrolled first-year students with special credentials may be eligible during the first semester for advanced placement (placement into courses with prerequisites) and/or credit toward graduation from Swarthmore (32 credits are required), however, credit is normally only available for high-scoring work in certain Advanced Placement (AP) examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board, certain higher-level examinations of the International Baccalaureate, or certain other foreign certifications (such as British A-Levels or the German Abitur). Sometimes placement or possibly credit might be awarded for courses taken at another college. Every effort is made to place students at the appropriate level, but no department is required to give placement or credit for special credentials. All placement or credit decisions are made on a subject-by-subject basis by the individual Swarthmore departments. Credit for examination credentials is available only for examinations taken before matriculation at Swarthmore. Credit is denied or revoked if a student chooses to take a course at Swarthmore that the Swarthmore department says essentially repeats the work covered by the credit. Departmental AP-credit policies are posted on the registrar's website under "Policies." Departments may set additional requirements. For instance, matriculated students may be required to take a Swarthmore placement examination to validate their previous work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 15</head><p>Swarthmore normally does not grant degree credit for college work done prior to starting school at Swarthmore (including the summer before Swarthmore) but advanced placement into courses with prerequisites may be possible. Students who wish to have courses taken at another college considered for either advanced placement or credit must be prepared to provide as needed an official transcript from the institution attended as well as written work (papers, examinations); syllabi; and reading lists for the coursework to be evaluated by the department concerned. Transcripts are evaluated by the registrar; grades must be straight C or better for credit, but departments make the placement or credit decisions. Any such requests for placement or credit must be made within the first year at Swarthmore. In some cases, students may qualify for advanced standing and may become juniors in their second year. To qualify for advanced standing, a student must do satisfactory work in the first semester, obtain 14 credits by the end of the first year, intend to complete the degree requirements in 3 years, and signify this intention when she or he applies for a major during the spring of the first year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">International Admissions</head><p>The College is deeply committed to a strong international presence on campus. The application process is the same as for U.S. citizens and permanent residents of the United States with the following exceptions:</p><p>• While financial aid awards are loan free, admission is not need-blind. Students must submit additional financial documentation. Applying for financial aid places the student in the most selective subgroup of the total application pool regardless of the parental contribution. • Demonstrated proficiency in English is required of those for whom English is not their first language. This may be in the form of a standardized test for non-native speakers of English, such as TOEFL or IELTS, or superior academic achievement in a school where English is the language of instruction.</p><p>Although not required, an interview on campus, via an online platform, or with a College admissions representative overseas is considered to be very helpful. • Required standardized tests (SAT or ACT) are waived for those who live in countries where such testing is unavailable. In countries where testing is available, applicants are strongly advised to make test arrangements early and to have scores reported directly to Swarthmore College by the appropriate application deadline. • It is the applicant's responsibility to guarantee the authenticity of all submitted credentials. This includes notarized translations of official documents and certified school transcripts signed by the appropriate school staff member.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The College does not accept transfer applications from foreign nationals who require financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Applications for Transfer</head><p>The College welcomes well-qualified transfer applicants. Applicants for transfer must have had an outstanding academic record in the institution attended and must present transcripts for both college and secondary school work, including an official statement indicating that the student is leaving the institution attended in good standing. Students who have completed the equivalent of two or more semesters of university-level work must apply for transfer admission. Admission status for students who have completed less than the equivalent of two semesters of university-level work will be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Results of the SAT and ACT are optional for transfer applicants.</p><p>Four semesters of study at Swarthmore College constitute the minimum requirement for a degree, two of which must be those of the senior year. Applications for transfer must be filed by April 1 of the year in which entrance is desired. Swarthmore does not have a midyear transfer application process. Need-based financial assistance is available for transfer students who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, undocumented, or DACA-eligible students in the United States. Transfer applications are not accepted from foreign national students who require financial aid.</p><p>Transfer applicants are notified of decisions by mid to late May. Students who have already completed a bachelor's degree, or higher, are not eligible for transfer admission to Swarthmore College. These are the annual charges billed by the College. Students and their parents, however, should plan for expenditures associated with books, travel, parking, and other personal items. In addition, the College will bill for unpaid library fines, Worth Health Center fees, and other fees and fines not collected at the source. Students engaged in independent projects away from the College for which regular academic credit is anticipated are expected to register in advance in the usual way and pay normal tuition. If the student is away from the College for a full semester, no charge for room and board will be made. However, if a student is away for only a part of a semester, the preceding charges may be made on a pro rata basis. Students who have not satisfied their financial obligations (except for any obligation covered as a result of veterans benefits beneficiaries using Ch. 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill or Ch 31 VR&amp;E benefits) will not be permitted to return to campus, attend any classes, live in campus housing, have a meal plan, register via add/drop (or any other method) for any classes, enroll for the following semester, participate in the room lottery, obtain a transcript, or be permitted to be graduated. Late fees of 1.5 percent per month will accrue on all past-due balances.</p><p>The regular College tuition covers the normal program of four course credits per term as well as variations of as many as five course credits or as few as three course credits. Students who elect to carry more than five course credits incur a unit charge for the additional course credit <ref type="bibr">($6,782)</ref> or half-course credit <ref type="bibr">($3,391)</ref>, although they may within the regular tuition vary their programs to average as many as five course credits in the two semesters of any academic year. College policy does not permit programs of fewer than three course credits for degree candidates in their first eight semesters of enrollment. After the first eight semesters of enrollment, students are eligible to pay the unit charge for each course credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Approved Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students who wish to receive Swarthmore credit for study abroad and approve domestic Off-Campus Study programs must, for the semester or year of participation, pay the full Swarthmore charges (excluding the student activities fee). Financial aid is normally applicable, with the approval of the Off-Campus Study Office. Students should begin working with the Off-Campus Study Office well in advance for academic and administrative planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Payment Policy</head><p>Semester bills are sent in July and December. Payment for the first semester is due by July 22, 2019 and for the second semester by January 2, 2020. A 1.5 percent late fee will be assessed monthly on payments received after the due date. Many parents have indicated a preference to pay College charges on a monthly basis rather than in two installments. For this reason, Swarthmore offers a monthly payment plan, which provides for payment in installments without interest charges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Withdrawal Policy</head><p>Charges for tuition and fees will be reduced for students who withdraw for reasons approved by the dean before or during a semester. Reductions in charges will be made in the following ways: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 18</head><p>Swarthmore's commitment to financial aid and access is at the core of our educational mission. We understand that students are admitted from a variety of economic backgrounds. The College strives to make it possible for all admitted students to attend Swarthmore, regardless of their ability to pay and meets 100% of determined need for all admitted students. Decisions about financial aid eligibility and admission to the College are made separately for students who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or undocumented/DACA students graduating from a U.S. high school.</p><p>Nearly 56 percent of our student body received need-based aid from an overall financial aid budget of more than $45 million during the 2018-19 academic year. The average aid award for 2018-19 was $52,213, with awards ranging from $1,000 -$71,662. Although admission and financial aid decisions are made separately, they are made concurrently. A prospective student should apply for Swarthmore's financial aid and outside assistance when applying for admission to Swarthmore. Instructions for completing a financial aid application can be found at www.swarthmore.edu/financial-aid. Our financial aid application process is thorough and requires submission of family information as well as income documentation so that the College can base the financial aid decision on a holistic picture of a family's economic situation. Once a student submits a financial aid application, our Financial Aid Committee carefully considers all of the family's detailed information, which is used to determine the family's ability to contribute to the costs of a Swarthmore education. For 2019-2020, the College's billed charges, which include tuition, room, board, and a student activity fee, will be $70,744. The activity fee covers admission to all social, cultural, and athletic events on campus, as well as printing and laundry. The Financial Aid Office uses the larger figure of $73,524 as an estimated total cost of attendance for the purposes of determining aid; this figure includes $1,380 for personal expenses and $1,400 for books and supplies. An allowance to cover the cost of travel for domestic students who live more than 100 miles from the College varies. Although Swarthmore financial aid awards are loan-free, families might choose to borrow loans to pay a portion of the educational expenses (see section 5.2). The College reviews each student's family financial situation annually, in keeping with our policy of basing financial aid on determined need. Students who would like to be considered for a financial aid award for the next academic year must submit a new financial aid application each year. Financial Aid eligibility may change from year-to-year. Assistance is available only during a normal-length undergraduate program (eight semesters) and only if a student enrolls full-time each semester, earns four credits each semester, and makes satisfactory academic progress. These factors also apply in our consideration of a sibling's undergraduate educational expenses. Students who choose to live off-campus will not receive Swarthmore Scholarship or Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants in excess of their college bills. However, the cost of living off campus will be recognized in the calculation of a student's financial need, and other outside sources of aid may be used to help meet off-campus living expenses once the college bill is satisfied. Although eligibility for federal aid funds is limited to students who are able to complete and to submit the Statement of Registration Compliance, additional funds have been made available for those who are unable to accept need-based federal aid because they have not registered with the U.S. Selective Service. U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have not previously received financial aid may become eligible and may apply to receive aid if their financial situations have changed. A student who marries may continue to apply for aid, though parents are still expected to contribute to the student's education. Financial support for international students is limited and must be requested during the admission application process. New financial aid applications from international students cannot be considered after admission. Answers to most financial aid questions are available at www.swarthmore.edu/financialaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Scholarships</head><p>For the academic year 2018-2019, the College will have awarded more than $45 million in Swarthmore Scholarship funds. About one-half of that sum was provided through the generosity of alumni and friends by special gifts and the scholarships listed in section 5.4. Students do not apply for a specific College scholarship. Rather, the College decides who is to receive restricted endowed scholarships or support from general scholarship funds. Although the qualifying criteria for awarding most endowed scholarships remain general, some donors have established explicit guidelines that closely mirror the interests of the individual for whom the scholarship is named. However, financial need is a requirement for all College scholarships except the McCabe Scholarship. Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants are also available to eligible students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Loan Funds</head><p>Some families use loans to pay for part of their college costs. First-year students may borrow up to $5,500; sophomores may borrow $6,500, and juniors and seniors may borrow up to $7,500. The Federal Direct Stafford Loan is a long-term, lowinterest educational loan. Eligibility for a Federal Direct Stafford Loan is determined by the College, p. 19 5 Financial Aid using federal guidelines. Parents who wish to borrow might consider the Federal Direct PLUS Loan. Parents may borrow up to the full cost of annual attendance minus any financial aid accepted by their student. Repayment of the PLUS loan may be made over a 10-year period. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the Direct Stafford or Direct PLUS loans. For more information about these loan programs or other financing options, go to our website at www.swarthmore.edu/financialaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Student Employment</head><p>Student employment on the Swarthmore campus is coordinated by the Student Employment Office (SEO). Campus jobs are available in such areas as our libraries, Information Technology Services, the student-run coffeehouse, Sharples Dining Hall, Scott Arboretum, most academic and administrative offices, and many other places on campus. Most students apply for campus positions when they arrive in the fall, but some new job openings are posted for the spring semester. Oncampus hourly rates of pay, are updated annually and can be found on the College's Student Payroll website. Most students who receive financial aid are offered the opportunity to earn up to just over $2,100 during the academic year, and are given hiring priority; in addition, there are jobs available for non-aided students who wish to work on campus. Students are encouraged to keep a moderate work schedule (no more than about seven or eight hours per week) so that their academic performance remains a top priority. About 1,200 of our 1,620 students choose to work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Scholarship Funds</head><p>All students who demonstrate financial need are offered scholarship aid, some of which is drawn from the following named funds. However, students should not worry if they do not fit the specific restrictions listed because their scholarships will instead be drawn from other sources not listed here. By completing the aid application process, a student will be considered for the following funds. No separate application is needed.</p><p>(Financial need is a requirement for all scholarships except the McCabe Scholarships. No separate application is required to apply for the following:) The Catherine G. <ref type="bibr">'72 and Ernest B. '72 Abbott Scholarship, established in 1999</ref> by Catherine and Ernest Abbott, is awarded to a first-year student who shows great promise. This renewable scholarship is for a man or woman who demonstrates financial need and academic excellence. The Karim Abdel-Motaal '90 Egypt Scholarship was established in 2012. The scholarship shall be awarded to students on the basis of academic merit and financial need and is renewable. Preference will be given first to students from Egypt, secondarily to Arab or Arab American students and thence to international students or students from the United States.

Swarthmore's housing philosophy is based on the belief that residence-hall living enhances education by contributing to an individual's academic, social, and personal development. If residential communities are to provide an environment for personal growth, residents must accept responsibility for their own actions and demonstrate respect for the rights and concerns of others and for the property of the College.</p></div>

The deans are available to all students for advice on any academic or personal matter. A dean is assigned to each student. Students, however, may approach any dean for advising, support, or to learn about College resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7.2">Academic Advising</head><p>Each first-year student is assigned to a faculty member or administrator who serves as the student's academic adviser. Once students are accepted by an academic department for their major, normally at the end of the sophomore year, the advising responsibility shifts to the chair, or the chair's designate, of that department. Requests for a change of adviser in the first two years will be freely granted subject only to availability and equity in the number of advisees assigned to individual advisers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7.3">Academic Support</head><p>Academic support can be accessed through the Office of Academic Success, including Student Disability Services, through academic departments (peer mentors, clinics, and review sessions), through the Writing Center (Writing Associates), and in residence halls (Student Academic Mentors). Tutors can be arranged through departments or through the Office of Academic Success. No fees are required for any of these services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Programming</head><p>Throughout each year, the Office of Academic Success coordinates programming designed to support all students' academic success. Examples of this programming include workshops on time management, procrastination, effective class participation, and study strategies across various academic disciplines. Student Academic Mentors (SAMs) are students specially selected and trained to work with students on the development of skills necessary for academic success including time management, organization, study strategies, and reading techniques. All residence halls with first-year students are assigned a SAM to serve as a resource for its residents. SAMs also hold weekly office hours at the McCabe, Underhill, and Cornell Libraries, and at the Black Cultural Center. They sponsor "Drop-In Hours" at locations throughout campus during advising and registration periods. Writing Associates (WAs) are students who have been specially trained to assist their peers with all stages of the writing process. WAs are assigned on a regular basis to selected courses, and they are located in the Writing Center in Trotter Hall. All students have access to the Writing Center as needed and can receive help on a drop-in or appointment basis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.8">Student Conduct System</head><p>Swarthmore places great value on freedom of expression, but it also recognizes the responsibility to protect the values and structures of an academic community. It is important, therefore, that students assume responsibility for helping to sustain an educational and social community where the rights of all are respected. This includes conforming their behavior to standards of conduct that are designed to protect the health, safety, dignity, and rights of all. Community members also have a responsibility to protect the possessions, property, and integrity of the institution as well as of individuals. The aim of the College's Student Code of Conduct is to balance all these rights, responsibilities, and community values fairly. The student conduct system is overseen by the associate dean of students and all questions should be directed to this office. The Student Conduct process is an administrative educational process informed by legal and compliance requirements that guide academic institutions together with the holistic mission of the College to help students realize their full potential. Students share responsibility for upholding community standards and are expected to participate in good faith with investigation and adjudication processes meant to resolve a code allegation. Decisions about whether a student or group is responsible for a conduct violation are p. 51 6 College Life based on a fair preponderance of the evidence standard meaning, the allegation is supported by evidence that sufficiently demonstrates that it is more likely than not that a violation occurred. Without sufficient evidence, a student or group will be found not responsible. The student conduct process strives to be both thorough and efficient and suggested process timelines may be shortened or extended if warranted by extenuating circumstances. The formal student conduct system at Swarthmore College has three main components: (1) Minor Misconduct: Allegation(s) in which possible sanctions do not include suspension or expulsion from the College if the student were found responsible and are typically conducted through the office of student engagement by the residence community coordinators; (2) Major Misconduct: Allegation(s) subject to College policy in which possible sanctions could result in suspension or expulsion from the College if the student were found responsible, and are typically addressed by the College Judiciary Committee (CJC) or an Administrative Adjudication meeting with the associate dean of students, including all allegations of academic misconduct. The CJC is composed of faculty, students, and administrators who have undergone training for their role; and (3) Sexual Assault and Harassment: All allegations of sexual and gender-based harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, stalking, and intimate-partner violence are addressed through the College's Sexual Assault and Harassment Policy. Violation of the laws of any jurisdiction, whether local, state, federal, or (when studying abroad) foreign, may subject a student to College disciplinary action. A pending appeal of a conviction shall not affect the application of this rule. p. 52 7 Educational Program</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">General Statement</head><p>Swarthmore College offers the degree of bachelor of arts and the degree of bachelor of science. The latter is given only to students who major in engineering. Four years of study are normally required for a bachelor's degree (see section 9.1), but variation in this term, particularly as a result of Advanced Placement (AP) credit, is possible (see section 3.5). The selection of a program will depend on the student's interests and vocational plans. The primary purpose of a liberal arts education, however, is not merely to provide the best foundation for one's future vocation. The purpose of a liberal arts education is to help students fulfill their responsibilities as citizens and grow into cultivated and versatile individuals. A liberal education is concerned with the development of moral, spiritual, and aesthetic values as well as analytical abilities. Furthermore, just as a liberal education is concerned with the cultural inheritance of the past, so, too, it is intended to develop citizens who will guide societies on a sustainable course where future culture will not be compromised in the development of the present. Intellectually, it aims to enhance resourcefulness, serious curiosity, open-mindedness, perspective, logical coherence, and insight. During the first half of their college program, all students are expected to satisfy most, if not all, of the distribution requirements, to choose their major and minor subjects, and to prepare for advanced work in these subjects by taking certain prerequisites. The normal program consists of four courses or their equivalent each semester, chosen by the student in consultation with his or her faculty adviser. All students must fulfill the requirements for the major. Before the end of the senior year, students are required to pass a comprehensive examination or its equivalent, given by the major department. The program for engineering students follows a similar basic plan, with certain variations explained in the section on engineering. Courses outside the technical fields are distributed over all 4 years. For honors candidates, courses and seminars taken as preparation for external evaluation occupy approximately one-half of the student's work during the last 2 years. In addition to work taken as a part of the Honors Program, the students take other courses that provide opportunities for further exploration. During the senior year, many departments offer a specially designed senior honors study for honors majors and minors to encourage enhancement and integration of the honors preparations. At the close of the senior year, candidates for honors will be evaluated by visiting examiners.</p><p>The course advisers of first-year and sophomore students normally are members of the faculty appointed by the dean. For juniors and seniors, the advisers are the chairs of their major departments or their representatives. Although faculty advisers assist students in preparing their academic programs, students are individually responsible for planning and adhering to programs and for the completion of graduation requirements. Faculty advisers, department chairs, other faculty members, the deans, and the registrar are available for information and advice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Program for the First and Second Years</head><p>The major goals of the first 2 years of a Swarthmore education are to introduce students to a broad range of intellectual pursuits, to equip them with the analytic and expressive skills required to engage in those pursuits, and to foster a critical stance toward learning and knowing. All students must fulfill the requirements normally intended for the first 2 years of study, although engineering majors may spread some requirements over 4 years. Students entering Swarthmore as transfer students normally fulfill these requirements by a combination of work done before matriculation at Swarthmore and work done here, according to the rules detailed below. To meet the distribution requirements, a student must earn degree-applicable credit in the following areas:</p><p>• Complete at least three courses in each of the three divisions of the College (listed). In each division, the three courses must be at least 1 credit each and may include up to 1 AP credit or credit awarded for work done elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Complete at least two courses in each division on the campus at Swarthmore; these courses must be at least 1 credit each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Complete at least two courses in each division in different departmental subjects; these courses must be at least 1 credit each and may include AP credit or credit awarded for work done elsewhere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Complete at least three Swarthmore Writing courses or Writing seminars, and those three must include work in at least two divisions; students are advised to complete two Writing courses in the first 2 years. • Complete a natural sciences and engineering practicum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>Courses that have been excluded from counting toward the degree do not count toward the distribution requirements. • Take courses in a variety of departments, keeping in mind that before graduation, 20 credits outside of one major subject must be completed. Writing courses: In addition to addressing fieldspecific substance, writing courses will focus on the development of the students' expository prose to ensure they can discover, reflect upon, organize, and communicate their knowledge effectively in written form. Approved Writing courses are only offered on the campus at Swarthmore. NSEP science laboratory requirement: Natural sciences and engineering practicums (NSEPs) have at least 18 hours per semester of scheduled meeting time for laboratory, separate from the scheduled lecture hours. How the laboratory hours are scheduled varies with the nature of the course and the types of laboratories involved. Such meetings may entail weekly or biweekly 3-hour sessions in a laboratory, several all-day field trips, or several observation trips. Cross-listed courses: Courses that are cross-listed between two departments in different divisions may, with the permission of the instructors, departments, and divisions involved, fulfill the divisional distribution requirement in one of the following ways: (1) in only one of the divisions so identified but not in the other; (2) in either division (but not both), depending on the departmental listing of the course on the academic record; (3) in neither of the divisions. In certain cases, the course may fulfill the distribution requirement according to the nature of the work done in the course by the individual student (e.g., a long paper in one of the departmental disciplines). The division of such courses is normally indicated in the catalog description for each course. When counting credits to determine a student's fulfillment of the 20course-credit rule, cross-listed courses count (only) in the subject in which they are listed on the student record. Changing the subject listing of a cross-listed course on the student record can be arranged, depending on permissions, during or sometimes after the course; there is a form for the purpose in the Registrar's Office.</p><p>First-year seminars: All students are encouraged to take a first-year seminar during the fall or spring of their first year. First-year seminars are offered across the curriculum and are designed to introduce students to a field of study and to engage them in learning skills that will support them throughout their college experience. Each firstyear seminar is limited to 12 first-year students. Many (but not all) first-year seminars count as the prerequisite to further work in the department in which they are offered. Foreign language: It is most desirable that students include in their programs some work in a foreign language, beyond the basic language requirement (see section 9.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics:</head><p>A student who intends to major in one of the natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering should take an appropriate mathematics course in the first year. Students intending to major in one of the social sciences should be aware of the increasing importance of mathematical background for these subjects.</p><p>Physical education: Students are encouraged to enjoy the instructional and recreational opportunities offered by the department throughout their college careers. As a requirement for graduation, all students not excused for medical reasons are required to complete 4 units of physical education. It is expected that students will satisfy this obligation by the end of their sophomore year. In addition, all students must pass a survival swimming test or complete a unit of swimming instruction. Most physical education courses are offered for a half a semester and earn 1 unit toward the 4 units required for graduation. A complete list of physical education opportunities including how many units each earns is available from the Physical Education and Athletics Office. More information can be found in the Physical Education and Athletics section. Transfer students: Students who enter Swarthmore as transfer students must fulfill Swarthmore's requirements for the first 2 years, including the natural sciences and engineering practicum. Transfer courses can be applied toward these requirements if specifically approved by the registrar. Transfer students who enter Swarthmore with 8 credits of college work are exempted from one of the three required writing courses and the requirement that writing courses include work in two divisions, and have the credits-at-Swarthmore requirement reduced from 2 in each division to 1 in each division. Transfer students who enter Swarthmore with, at most, four semesters remaining to complete their degree are exempted from two of the three required writing courses and are exempted from the requirement that in each division 2 credits be taken at Swarthmore. Transfer students can either apply transfer PE units p. 54 toward the 4-unit physical education requirement or opt for a reduction in the PE requirement based on the student's transfer status, but transfer students cannot both transfer PE units and receive a reduction in the requirement. The optional reduction in PE units depends on the transfer class of the student. Transfer students who enter Swarthmore as sophomores can opt to complete 3 units of physical education and pass a survival swim test (a reduction of 1 PE unit). Transfer students who enter Swarthmore as juniors can opt to complete 2 units of physical education and pass a survival swim test (a reduction of 2 PE units).</p><p>Transfer students may exercise the option to take up to four courses credit/no credit. Major application-the Sophomore Plan: Early in the sophomore year, each student should identify one or two subjects as possible majors, paying particular attention to departmental requirements and recommendations. In the spring of the sophomore year, each student will, with the guidance of his or her adviser, prepare a reasoned plan of study for the last 2 years. Sophomores who wish to link their interest in social service/social action to their plan of study are also encouraged to take advantage of the advising offered by the staff at the Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility. The Sophomore Plan of study will be submitted to the chair of the student's proposed major department as a part of the application for a major. Acceptance will be based on the student's record and an estimate of his or her capacities in the designated major. Students who fail to secure approval of a major may be required to withdraw from the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Programs for Juniors and Seniors</head><p>The major goals of the last two years of a Swarthmore education are to engage students with a chosen field of inquiry and to assist them in assuming an independent role in creating and synthesizing knowledge within it. The breadth of exposure, acquisition of skills, and development of a critical stance during the first two years prepare students to pursue these goals. With the choice of a major and, perhaps, candidacy for honors, the focus shifts from scope to depth. Students become involved for the second two years with a discrete field of inquiry and demonstrate their command of that field through the completion of courses within the major and courses taken outside the major that expand and deepen the student's perspective on the major. Before graduation, students are required to complete at least 20 credits outside of one major subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Majors and Minors</head><p>All students are required to include sufficient work in a single department or program designated as a major. To complete a departmental major, a student must be accepted as a major; must complete eight courses (or more, depending on the department); must pass the department's comprehensive requirement; and must fulfill other specific departmental requirements. Detailed requirements for acceptance to departmental majors and for completion of them are specified in this catalog under the respective departmental listings and are designed to ensure a comprehensive acquaintance with the field. A student must accumulate 20 course credits outside one major, but there is no other limit on the number of courses that a student may take in his or her major. Completing a second major or one or two minors is optional, as is choosing to do an Honors Program. Students are limited in the number of majors and/or minors they may earn. If they have only one major, they may have as many as two minors. Students who choose an honors major plus honors minor may have an additional course minor outside the Honors Program. If students have two majors, they may not have a minor, except in one circumstance: A student who elects honors, designating an honors major and minor, may have a second major outside of honors if that second major includes the same subject as the honors minor. The completion of two majors must be approved by both departments. Triple majoring is not allowed. Most departments and programs offer course minors. Those departments or programs that do not offer a course minor are art, comparative literature, economics, political science, and sociology and anthropology. (These departments or programs do offer honors minors.) Minors will include at least 5 credits. Double counting in majors and minors: If a student has two majors and one is interdisciplinary, no more than 2 credits may be double counted with the student's other major. However, the doublecounting limit is not applicable to courses that students are required by their departmental major to take in other departments. Of the 5 credits required for a minor, 4 may not be double counted with the student's major or other minor. The double-counting prohibition applies to any comparison of two given programs of study (not three taken together, even if the student has three programs). This means that a student who has a major in medieval studies, for example, and minors in both English literature and gender and sexuality studies would need four courses in English literature that are not part of the medieval studies major and four courses in gender and sexuality studies that are not part of the medieval studies major. In addition, each minor must have four courses that are not part of the other minor. Special minors are not permitted.</p><p>p. 55</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Educational Program</head><p>Exceptions to the double-counting prohibition:</p><p>• The double-counting prohibition is not applicable to courses that students are required by their majors or minors to take in other departments. For example, mathematics courses required for an engineering major are not automatically excluded from counting toward a minor defined by the Mathematics and Statistics Department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>For an honors major who is also a double major, the double-counting prohibition does not apply to the relationship between the honors minor and the second major because these will always be or include the same field. Advising in the major: During the junior and senior years, students are advised by the chair of the major department (or a member of the department designated by the chair) whose approval must be secured for the choice of courses each semester. The deadline for seniors to propose any changes to their plan for major(s) or minor(s) is the third week of the spring semester of the senior year. Proposed changes are subject to departmental approval. Majors or minors may not be applied for or approved after graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1">Special majors</head><p>Individualized and regularized special majors are available. With permission of the departments and/or programs concerned, it is possible for a student to plan an individualized special major that includes closely related work in one or more departments. In some areas, such as biochemistry and neuroscience, in which regularized special majors are done frequently, the departments and programs involved provide recommended programs. These regularized special majors are described in the relevant department sections of the catalog or in material available from department chairs. A special major is expected to be integrated in the sense that it specifies a field of learning (not necessarily conventional) or topic or problems for sustained inquiry that crosses departmental boundaries, or it may be treated as a subfield within the normal departmental major. Special majors consist of at least 10 credits and normally of no more than 12 credits. Students with special majors normally complete a minimum of six courses in the primary department or program, omitting some of the breadth requirements of the major field. However, course requirements central to systematic understanding of the major field may not be waived. Students with special majors must complete the major comprehensive requirement, which may consist of a thesis or other written research projects designed to integrate the work across departmental boundaries, or a comprehensive examination. By extension, special majors may be formulated as joint majors between two departments, normally with at least 5 credits in each department and 11 in both departments. The departments involved collaborate in advising and in the comprehensive examination. The Registrar's Office website has the required application form and more information for special majors. Students are not allowed to pursue more than one individualized special major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Honors Program</head><p>The Honors Program, initiated in 1922 by President Frank Aydelotte, is a distinctive part of Swarthmore's educational life. The Honors Program has as its main ingredients student independence and responsibility in shaping the educational experience; collegial relationships between students and faculty; peer learning; opportunity for reflection on, and integration of, specific preparations; and evaluation by external examiners. Honors work may be carried out in the full range of curricular options, including studio and performing arts, study abroad, and community-based learning. Students and their professors work in collegial fashion as honors candidates prepare for evaluation by external examiners from other academic institutions and the professional world. Although Swarthmore faculty members grade most of the specific preparations, the awarding of honorifics on a student's diploma is based solely on the evaluation of the external examiners. Preparations for honors are defined by each department or program and include seminars, theses, independent projects in research as well as in studio and performing arts and specially designated pairs of courses. In addition, many departments offer their own format for senior honors study, designed to enhance and, where appropriate, integrate the preparations in both major and minor. Each honors candidate's program will include three preparations for external examination in a major and one in a minor or four preparations in a special or interdisciplinary major. By doing honors, students offering three preparations in a major or four preparations in a special or interdisciplinary major normally fulfill the comprehensive graduation requirement for majors in those fields. Honors students who wish to complete a second major must pursue that field of study through the Course Program, and it must relate to the student's honors minor field of study. Normally, the student must complete the requirements for the Honors minor, as well as the course major in the department. If an Honors student pursues an honors special major, any second major must be taken in the Course Program, and must be either a regular major or regularized special major. In such cases, the student's academic program is subject to the overlap constraints for majoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 56</head><p>Honors Program preparations for both majors and minors will be defined by each department, program, and interdisciplinary major that sponsors a major. In addition, minors may be defined by any department or program. Honors special majors who design their own programs, not those in College-sponsored programs such as biochemistry, will be required to include four related preparations in the major from at least two departments or academic programs. Honors special major programs do not include a separate minor. Honors special majors must either (1) write a thesis drawing on their crossdisciplinary work-the thesis will be examined by examiners in different fields or (2) have a panel oral examination that presents the opportunity for cross-disciplinary discussion. Honors special majors will follow the Senior Honors Study (SHS) activity and portfolio procedures of the various departments whose offerings they use as preparations in their programs. Individualized honors special major programs require the approval of all departments involved in the program and of the honors coordinator. All preparations will be graded by Swarthmore instructors with the exception of theses and other original work. Grades for theses and other similar projects will be given by external examiners. Except in the case of theses or other original work, modes of assessment by the external examiners will include written examinations and/or other written assignments completed in the spring of the senior year. In addition, during honors week at the end of the senior year, every honors candidate will meet on campus with external evaluators for an oral examination of each preparation. Specific formats for preparations and for SHS are available in each department office. Students will normally include their intention to prepare for honors in their "Plan of Study for the Last 2 Years," written in the spring of their sophomore year. They must also submit a formal application for a specific program of honors preparation to the Registrar's Office. The registrar provides a form for this purpose. Departments, programs, and concentrations will make decisions about acceptance of honors programs at the end of the sophomore year. Students will be accepted into honors with the proviso that their work continue to be of honors quality. Students may also apply to enter honors during their junior year. Any proposed changes to the Honors Program must be submitted for approval on a form for this purpose available from the registrar. The decision of the departments or interdisciplinary programs will depend on the proposed program of study and the quality of the student's previous work as indicated by grades received and on the student's apparent capacity for assuming the responsibility of honors candidacy. The major department or interdisciplinary program is responsible for the original plan of work and for keeping in touch with the candidate's progress from semester to semester. Normally, honors programs may not be changed after Dec. 1 of a student's senior year, depending on departmental policies. Students may not withdraw from honors after Dec. 1 of the senior year except under extraordinary circumstances and with the permission of the major and minor departments and the Curriculum Committee. Further information about honors policies may be found in the Honors Handbook, which is available in the Registrar's Office. At the end of the senior year, the decision of whether to award the degree with a level of honors is made by the visiting examiners. Upon their recommendation, successful candidates are awarded the bachelor's degree with honors, with high honors, or with highest honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6">Exceptions to the 4-Year Program</head><p>Although the normal period of uninterrupted work toward the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees is 4 years, graduation in 3 years is freely permitted when a student can take advantage of Advanced Placement credits, perhaps combining them with extra work by special permission. In such cases, students may qualify for advanced standing-they may become juniors in their second year. To qualify for advanced standing, a student must (1) do satisfactory work in the first semester;</p><p>(2) obtain 14 credits by the end of the first year;</p><p>(3) intend to complete the degree requirements in 3 years; and (4) signify this intention when she or he applies for a major by completing a Sophomore Plan during the spring of the first year. When circumstances warrant, a student may lengthen the continuous route to graduation to 5 years by carrying fewer courses than the norm of four, although College policy does not permit programs of fewer than 3 credits for degree candidates in their first eight semesters of enrollment. A course load lower than the norm may be appropriate for students who enter Swarthmore lacking some elements of the usual preparation for college, who have disabilities, or who wish to free time for activities relating to their curricular work that are not done for academic credit. Such 5-year programs are possible in music and art for students who are taking instruction off campus or who wish to pursue studio or instrumental work without full credit but with instruction and critical supervision. However, such programs are possible only on application to, and selection by, the department concerned, which will look for exceptional accomplishment or promise. In all cases where it is proposed to reduce academic credit and lengthen the period before graduation, the College looks particularly to personal circumstances and to careful advising and necessarily charges the regular annual tuition (see the provisions for overloads section 4.1). Full-time leaves of absence for a semester or a year or more p. 57 are freely permitted and in some cases encouraged, subject also to careful planning and academic advising. Information about work and internship opportunities for those taking a leave is available through the Career Services Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.1">Senior year rule</head><p>Normally the senior year rule is met by the last two semesters being done on the campus at Swarthmore, with the approved exception that seniors during the first semester of their senior year, who have obtained the approval of the chair(s) of their major department(s), may participate in the Swarthmore Semester/Year Abroad Program. Senior year rule compliance is calculated retrospectively with the last two fulltime semesters of degree work, regardless if the semesters are separated in time. If students have studied elsewhere in the time between their two senior semesters, no more than 2.0 Swarthmore credits for work done elsewhere (regardless of how many courses were taken during the intervening time) may be applied to the Swarthmore degree without being out of compliance with the senior year rule. There are two circumstances where a senior can use credit for work done elsewhere to complete the Swarthmore degree without re-enrolling at Swarthmore: (a) after the eighth semester if the major department confirms that the major is done or approves that the major can be completed remotely, or (b) after earning at least 30.0 credits toward the degree if the major department confirms that the major is done or approves that the major can be completed remotely. In either case, the senior year rule is fulfilled by the last two semesters done on the campus at Swarthmore (or with the first semester by approved study abroad), regardless of the number of subsequent credits to be earned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7">Academic Progress Standards and Requirements</head><p>The academic year at Swarthmore is 32 weeks long, during which time students are expected to complete 6 to 8 semester course credits of work. Normal progress toward the degree of bachelor of arts or bachelor of science is made by eight semesters' work of four course credits or the equivalent each semester. Four course credits per semester is the normal load. Students may and frequently do vary this by programs of three or five semester course credits, with special permission. College policy normally does not permit programs of fewer than 3 course credits within the normal eight-semester enrollment. Programs of more than 5 credits or fewer than 4 credits require special permission (see section 4.1 on tuition and section 8.3 on registration). Course credit earned by examination does not count in registration load. Satisfactory progress towards the 32 credit graduation requirement includes earning passing grades, an overall grade point average of at least 2.0 by graduation, and completing at least one major and the non-major degree requirements listed in chapter 9 of the catalog. The definitions of upper-class levels are as follows: Students become sophomores when they have earned 6 to 8 semester course credits toward their degree. Students become juniors when they have earned 14 to 16 credits. Students become seniors when they have earned 22 to 24 credits. Some offices on campus, such as student housing, may have additional requirements in their definitions of the student classes. The Committee on Academic Requirements (CAR) is a standing committee of the faculty charged with regular review of students' academic programs and the administration of faculty regulations concerning academic standards and requirements. The committee is also empowered to recommend to the faculty waivers of certain requirements (e.g. the senior-year residency requirement). Requests for waivers are carefully evaluated by the committee and forwarded to the faculty only when a general educational advantage is perceived. With the Dean of Students and the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs as co-chairs, the committee regularly meets approximately three weeks after the end of each semester to review the academic records of all students who earn two or more grades less than C in the preceding semester, or who have two or more Incomplete grades, or who are not making satisfactory progress in completing distribution or other degree requirements including cumulative GPA, or who are under advisement from previous CAR mandates. This committee may also review student records at other times should information arise about academic difficulties that were not available at the time of the regular committee meetings. The committee normally follows the guidelines outlined below, but the committee also retains the right to consider extenuating circumstances of a student's case, such as health issues, family crises or other special circumstances, which may result in the committee varying from the guidelines. Additionally, the Dean of Students may vary from these guidelines within the appeals process, to take into consideration new information and/or extenuating circumstances about a student. The committee may take one of several actions including, but not limited to:</p><p>1. Warnings: Students meet with the dean's staff member as needed. 2. Probation: Students may be placed on academic probation, continued on probation, or removed from probation, however, students may not be continued on probation for more than two consecutive semesters. Rising seniors and current p. 58 seniors may receive a specific probation senior letter, which may include probationary status, if the Committee is concerned about a student's progress to graduation. Usually, the start date of any probation is the first day of classes of the next semester. The duration of the probation is typically one semester and lasts until the committee removes the probationary status at the following committee meeting. Notification of probation is considered a change in good standing status and will normally be sent to parent(s) or guardian(s) and the student meets regularly with a dean's staff member. 3. Required to withdraw: Students who fail to meet the terms of their probation are normally Required to Withdraw, which requires the student to take a leave of absence for the upcoming semester. Students whose academic performance is particularly poor may be Required to Withdraw without having been placed on probation earlier. Students Required to Withdraw must take a leave of absence for a semester or longer and engage in meaningful activity (i.e. academic classes at another institution, work, and/or volunteer activities). In order to return from a required leave, the student must write a detailed letter to the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs requesting permission to return, explaining what happened, what was done while the student was away, and outline a plan for how the student will address upon return the issues that resulted in the required leave. In some cases, the student will be required to bring back credits, pre-approved by departments, to catch up with the student's class standing. The end date of the leave is normally the first day of classes of the semester of return. Appeals may be made to the Dean of Students at the time of notification of the change of status. The student's parent(s) or guardian(s) are notified, because this is considered a change of status and is considered as a change in good standing. Students who are granted permission to return will be placed on academic probation for the return semester. The academic probation starts the first day of classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8">Formats of Instruction</head><p>Although classes and seminars are the normal curricular formats at Swarthmore, faculty regulations encourage other modes as well. These include various forms of individual study, studentrun courses, and a limited amount of "practical" or off-campus work. The principal forms of individual work are attachments to courses, directed reading, and tutorials. The faculty regulation on attachments provides that a student may attach to an existing course, with the permission of the instructor, a project of additional reading, research, and writing. In this way, attachments typically extend the subject matter of a course. If this attachment is taken concurrently with the course, it is normally done for 0.5 credit. If it is taken in a later semester (preferably the semester immediately following), it may be done for either half or full credit. This kind of work can be done on either a small-group or individual basis. It is not possible in all courses, but it is in most, including some introductory courses. For first-year students and sophomores, it is a way of developing capacities for independent work. For honors candidates, it is an alternative to a seminar as a preparation for an honors examination. Students who decide before the middle of the semester to do a 0.5-credit attachment may, with permission, withdraw from a regular course and carry 3.5 credits in that term to be balanced by 4.5 credits in another term. Students may do as many as two attachments each year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8.1">Directed Reading and Independent Study</head><p>Directed reading and independent study are similar, but the faculty role in the former is more bibliographical than pedagogical, and, because they require somewhat less faculty time, opportunities for directed reading are more frequent in most departments than are opportunities for independent study. With the directed reading format, faculty often provide students with a syllabus for a course not currently offered and allow the student to do the work independently. The independent study format typically requires faculty supervision of a student on a topic that has not yet been taught. In many cases, this requires the faculty member to develop a syllabus and to allow the student to do the work independently. In both cases, substantial written work and/or written examinations are considered appropriate, and it is generally desirable that the work be more specialized or more sharply focused than is usually the case in courses or seminars. The work may range from a course of reading to a specific research project. Such work is available primarily to juniors and seniors in accordance with their curricular interests and as faculty time permits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.8.2">Student-Run Courses</head><p>The faculty regulation on student-run courses permits a group of students to propose a topic to an instructor for 0.5 or 1 credit and to run their own course with a reading list approved by the instructor and a final examination or equivalent administered by the instructor but normally with no further involvement of faculty. In organizing such a course, students must obtain from a faculty member approval and agreement to serve as course supervisor, and approval of a department chair or p. 59 program coordinator to provide a course subject and number of record, and finally approval of the provost. The full approval process must be complete prior to the beginning of the course; after that time, the course cannot receive degree credit. Students must provide an initial memorandum emphasizing the principal subject matter to be studied, the questions to be asked about it, the methods of investigation, and provision of a preliminary bibliography. The course supervisor reviews the course outline, bibliography, qualifications and general eligibility of students proposing to participate in the course. The course supervisor consults his or her department and, in the case of an interdepartmental course, any other department concerned, whose representatives together with the provost will decide whether to approve the course. After a student-run course has been found acceptable by the appropriate department (or departments) and the provost, the revised reading list is given to the librarian, and the course subject, number, title and class list are filed with the registrar. At the end of the course, the supervisor evaluates and grades the students' work in the usual way or arranges for an outside examiner to do so. Student-run courses may vary in format and content. In particular, they may be provisionally proposed for 0.5 credit to run in the first half of the semester, and at midterm, may be either concluded or, if the participants and course supervisor find the work profitable, continued for the balance of the term for full credit. Alternatively, student-run courses may be started after the beginning of the semester (up to midsemester) for 0.5 credit and then be continued, on the same basis, into the following term. Or they may be taken for 0.5 credit over a full term. The role of the course supervisor may go beyond planning and evaluation and extend to occasional or regular participation. The only essentials, and the purpose of the procedures, are sufficient planning and organization of the course to facilitate focus and penetration. The course planning and organization, both analytical and bibliographical, are also regarded as important ends in themselves, to be emphasized in the review of proposals before approval. Up to 4 of the 32 credits required for graduation may be taken in student-run courses. Student-run courses are only offered on the credit/no-credit basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.9">Interdisciplinary Work</head><p>The requirements of the major typically leave room for significant flexibility in students' programs, both within and outside the major. This may be used to pursue a variety of interests and to emphasize intellectual diversity. It may also be used for the practical integration of individual programs around interests or principles supplementing the major. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.10">Guidelines on Scheduling Conflicts between Academics and Athletics</head><p>The following guidelines (adopted by the faculty in May 2002) are affirmed to recognize both the primacy of the academic mission at Swarthmore and the importance of the intercollegiate Athletics Program for our students. The guidelines are meant to offer direction with an appropriate degree of flexibility. Where conflicts occur, students, the faculty, and coaches are encouraged to work out mutually acceptable solutions. Faculty members and coaches are also encouraged to communicate with one another about such conflicts. Note that the guidelines make a firm distinction between athletics practices and competitive contests. Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Students who are participating in intercollegiate athletics should not miss a class, seminar, or lab for a practice. Students who have a conflict between an athletics contest and a required academic activity, such as a class meeting or a lecture, should discuss it and try to reach an understanding with their coach and their professor as soon as possible, preferably during the first week of the semester and certainly in advance of the conflict. When a mutually agreeable understanding is not reached, students should be mindful of the primacy of academics at Swarthmore. Students should understand that acceptable arrangements may not be feasible for all classes, particularly seminars and laboratories. Students should take their schedule of athletics contests into account as they plan their class schedules and may want to discuss this with their academic advisers. Students should also provide p. 60</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Educational Program</head><p>coaches with a copy of their academic schedules and promptly inform them of any changes. Coaches should make every effort to schedule practices and contests to avoid conflict with classes and should collect their students' academic schedules in an effort to coordinate team activities and minimize conflict. Coaches should instruct students not to miss class for practice and should encourage students to work out possible conflicts between classes and contests as early as possible. Faculty members should provide as complete a description of scheduling requirements as possible to their classes early each semester, preferably before registration or during the first week of classes. Both faculty members and coaches should work with students to resolve contest-related conflicts.</p><p>Both coaches and faculty should avoid last-minute scheduling changes, and faculty should normally avoid scheduling extraordinary class meetings. Where such meetings seem desirable, students should be consulted and, as the Handbook for Instructional Staff stipulates, the arrangement cleared with the department chair and registrar.</p><p>Where possible, extraordinary sessions should be voluntary or offered with a choice of sections to attend. When a schedule is changed after students have arranged their commitments, it is important for the faculty member or coach to be flexible. Classes will normally end each day by 4 p.m. and at 5 p.m. on Fridays. Seminars will often extend beyond 4 p.m. Afternoon laboratories are usually scheduled until 4:15 p.m. or 4:30 p.m., and students who encounter difficulties completing a lab may need to stay later than the scheduled time. In all cases, students are expected to keep to their academic commitments and then attend practices as soon as possible. Faculty members should recognize that students usually set aside the time from 4:15 to 7 p.m. for extracurricular activities and dinner. Late afternoon has also traditionally been used for certain courses in the performing arts. Some use of this time for other academic purposes (such as department colloquia, lectures, etc.) is appropriate, but departments are encouraged to exercise restraint in such use, particularly with respect to activities they judge important for the full academic participation of students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.11">Health Sciences Advisory Program</head><p>The function of the Health Sciences Advisory Program is twofold: to advise students interested in a career in the health professions and to prepare letters of recommendation for professional schools to which students apply. The letters are based on faculty evaluations requested by the student, the student's academic record, and nonacademic activities.</p><p>Students intending to enter a career in the health professions, especially those applying to medical, dental, or veterinary schools, should plan their academic programs carefully to meet the professional schools' requirements as well as the general College requirements. </p></div>

The College emphasizes the importance of study abroad and encourages all students to explore possibilities for doing so as integral parts of their degree programs. The Off-Campus Study Office is the on-campus clearinghouse for information on study abroad, and normally is the starting place for exploration and planning. The Off-Campus Study Office will help all interested students at every stage of the process: planning, study abroad, and return. Proper planning begins with attendance at a general information meeting, and then a study abroad advising appointment, as early as possible in one's college career. To participate students must be in good standing concerning both their academic program and conduct. The Off-Campus Study Office and the Dean's Office meet to review student standing and to determine eligibility. Students must also meet the eligibility requirements of the programs to which they apply. Eligible students must have completed on average four credits per semester. Students will jeopardize their ability to participate with incompletes as part of their academic record. The deadline for completion of incompletes will reflect the need to meet deadlines relating to acceptance to programs and/or to the submission of forms, deposits, the purchase of airfares, etc. Normally students will have been accepted into a major, or in the case of sophomores, have a plan for applying to a major. Students must also have a zero balance on their student accounts. Participating students must comply with the Off-Campus Study payment plan. Students continue to pay Swarthmore's comprehensive fee for Swarthmore tuition, room, and board. The College then pays for the tuition fees, room and board costs, health and travel insurance, and the roundtrip travel of participating students. The amount of airfare is capped at the amount of a round-trip from Philadelphia to the abroad site. Normally, financial aid is automatically applied to study abroad. There are more than three hundred approved offcampus study programs listed on the Off-Campus Study website. The Off-Campus Study Office maintains direct enrollment agreements with many universities around the world.</p><p>In addition to these programs, Swarthmore students attend a number of excellent approved study abroad programs throughout provided by other institutions. The Off-Campus Study Office, along with the academic departments and programs of the College, will advise students on these opportunities. Swarthmore-administered Programs:</p><p>p. 62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.16">CPT/CXPL 001/002</head><p>Swarthmore permits approved Curricular Practical Training (CPT). CPT is a form of work authorization available for eligible F-1 students before their program end date for experiential learning opportunities. Eligible students must have declared a major, be in good standing, be in F1 status for two academic terms, and be registered for Swarthmore's Curricular Experiential Learning (CXPL) course 001 or 002, or a course that requires work experience before CPT can be authorized. Approved CPT must be an integral part of the student's academic program at Swarthmore College. Any international student with an F-1 Visa employed by any company in the form of an internship or other types of off-campus employment must obtain approval for CPT and enroll in the CXPL course, or a course that requires a work component. The work experience must be in the student's field of study and contain a curricular component. The CPT experience must be complimentary training to the student's curriculum and should contribute substantially to the student's learning experience. Eligible students must have an offer of employment from a company or organization prior to registering for CXPL 001/002. The CPT must be approved by the Department Head or Academic adviser, and the Director of the International Student Center.</p><p>Students are required to measure the learning outcome(s) after CPT. The CXPL course, once completed and assessed, will be graded with the CR (credit) grade notation.</p></div>

This urban experience facilitates engagement with the complexity, diversity, innovation, and systems of the city. Students enroll in urban-focused courses from a variety of academic disciplines taught by Tri-Co faculty in Philadelphia. The urban setting provides a sense of place to enhance the classroom experience, helping students learn first-hand how the material in the courses is informed by the environment around them. Speakers and representatives from organizations may be invited guests in the classes, and students may explore the city through neighborhood tours and also through trips to museums, community-based organizations, archives, and arts and cultural organizations. The program also includes participation in monthly Philadelphia-based cohort activities to further engage with the city -some academic in nature, some connected to issues of social justice, and some simply fun. Additionally, the program includes a pre-program orientation, a mid-semester gathering and a closing dinner. In fall 2019, students will take the core course, </p></div>

Faculty members will report to the dean the name of any student whose repeated absence is in their opinion impairing the student's work. The number of absences allowed in a given course is not specified, a fact that places a heavy responsibility on all students to make sure that their work is not suffering as a result of absences. First-year students should exercise particular care in this respect. When illness necessitates absence from classes, the student should report at once to the Health Center.</p><p>A student may obtain credit for a course without attending class meetings by reading the material prescribed by a syllabus and taking a final examination, under the following conditions:</p><p>• The student must signify intent to do so at the time of registration, having obtained the instructor's approval in advance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>If, after such registration, the student wishes to resume normal class attendance, the instructor's approval must be obtained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Grades</head><p>During the year, instructors periodically report on the students' coursework to the Dean's and Registrar's offices. Informal reports during the semester take the form of comments on unsatisfactory work. At the end of each semester, formal grades are given in each course either under the credit/no credit (CR/NC) system, or under the letter system, by which A means excellent work; B, good work; C, satisfactory work; D, passing but below the average required for graduation; and NC (no credit), uncompleted or unsatisfactory work. Letter grades may be qualified by pluses and minuses. S signifies a requirement satisfactorily fulfilled. W signifies that the student has been permitted to withdraw from the course. X designates a condition that means a student has done unsatisfactory work in the first half of a yearlong course but by creditable work during the second half may earn a passing grade for the full course and thereby remove the condition. R is used to designate an auditor or to indicate cases in which the work of a foreign student cannot be evaluated because of deficiencies in English.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2">Incompletes</head><p>Inc. means that a student's work is incomplete with respect to specific assignments or examinations. The faculty has voted that a student's final grade in a course should incorporate a zero for any part of the course not completed by the date of the final examination or the end of the examination period. However, if circumstances beyond the student's control (e.g., illness, family emergency) preclude the completion of the work by this date, a grade of Inc. may be assigned with the permission of the faculty instructor and the registrar. Note that "having too much work to do" is not, in fairness to other students, considered a circumstance beyond the student's control. A form for the purpose of requesting an incomplete is available from the Registrar's Office and must be filled out by the student and signed by the faculty instructor and the registrar and returned to the registrar no later than the last day of final examinations. In such cases, incomplete work must normally be made up and graded, and the final grade recorded within 5 weeks after the start of the following term. Except by special permission of the registrar and the faculty instructor, all grades of Inc. still outstanding after that date will be replaced on the student's permanent record by NC (no credit). Waiver of this provision by special permission shall in no case extend beyond 1 year from the time the Inc. grade was incurred. Instructors are asked to provide the student and the faculty adviser with an evaluation of the student's CR work including a letter grade equivalent. The written evaluations are not a part of the student's official grade record. Students should save their copies of these evaluations for their records. If available, letter-grade equivalents for firstsemester first-year students may be provided to other institutions only if requested by the student and absolutely required by the other institution.</p></div>

For other courses, the following rules apply: (1) Permission to repeat a course must be obtained from the Swarthmore instructor teaching the repeated class.</p><p>(2) These repeated courses may not be taken CR/NC. (3) To take a course at another school that will repeat a course previously taken at Swarthmore, the student must obtain permission from the chair of the Swarthmore department in which the original course was taken, both as a part of the preapproval process to repeat it elsewhere and, in writing, as part of the credit validation after the course is taken elsewhere.</p><p>For repeated courses in which the student withdraws with the grade notation W, the grade and credit for the previous attempt will stand. For other repeated courses, the registration and grade for the previous attempt will be preserved on the permanent record but marked as excluded, and any credit for the previous attempt will be permanently lost. The final grade and any credit earned in the repeated course are the grade and credit that will be applied to the student's Swarthmore degree.</p></div>

Fines are imposed for late or incomplete registration or enrollment. A regular student is expected to take the prescribed number of courses in each semester to progress toward the degree in the normal eightsemester enrollment. If more than 5 or fewer than 4 credits seem desirable, the faculty adviser should be consulted and a petition filed with the registrar (programs of fewer than 3 credits are not allowed in the normal eight-semester enrollment). Students are expected to select classes that do not pose scheduling conflicts. Course registration adds and drops must be finalized within the first 2 weeks of the semester.</p><p>To add a course, the instructor's permission is required. Withdrawal from a course after the first two weeks of the semester is indicated with the permanent grade notation W. To withdraw from a course, students must file an application to withdraw, and it must be received by the Registrar no later than the end of the 9th week of classes or the 5th week of the course if it meets for only half the semester.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.1">Final Examinations</head><p>The final examination schedule specified in official announcements directs the place and time of all finals unless the instructor has made other special arrangements. However, College policy holds that students with three final examinations within 24 hours are allowed to reschedule one of these examinations in consultation with the instructor, as long as the consultation occurs in a timely manner. By College policy, a student who is not in the Honors Program but who is taking an honors written examination as a course final and has an examination conflict should take the course final examination and postpone the honors written examination until the student's next free examination period. Conversely, a student in the Honors Program who has a conflict with a course final examination should take the honors examination and postpone the course examination in consultation with the professor. In no case may a student take an honors examination before the honors written examination period for that examination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5">Student Leaves of Absence, Withdrawal, and Readmission</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.1">Leaves of Absence</head><p>Student leaves of absence are freely permitted provided the request for leave is received by the date of enrollment and the student is in good standing. Students planning a leave of absence or planning to return following a leave of absence should consult with a dean and complete the necessary form before the deadline published each semester (usually Nov. 15 and April 1). The form asks students to specify the date of expected return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.2">Withdrawal</head><p>Withdrawal from the College may occur for academic, disciplinary, health, or personal reasons and may be voluntary or required by the College. For health-related withdrawals, in no case will a student's mental or physical condition itself be a basis for a required withdrawal. However, when health problems of a physical or psychological nature result in behavior that substantially interferes with a student's academic performance or the educational endeavors of other students or poses a significant threat to the safety of others, the College may require the student to withdraw. The Evaluation Committee-comprising two deans-makes the decision to require withdrawal for health-related reasons. The Evaluation Committee will review the problematic behavior and may consult with the director of Worth Health Center, the director of Counseling and Psychological Services, or any other appropriate college official when making its decision.</p><p>Decisions of the Evaluation Committee may be appealed to the dean of students. Students withdrawing from the College before the end of the semester normally receive the grade notation "W" (withdrawal) on their permanent record for all in-progress courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.3">Readmission</head><p>A student who has withdrawn from the College for any reason, voluntarily or involuntarily, may apply for readmission by writing to the assistant dean for academic affairs. Normally, the College will not accept applications for readmission until a full semester, in addition to the semester in which the student has withdrawn, has passed. A student applying to the College for readmission after withdrawal is required to provide appropriate documentation of increased ability to function academically and in a residential environment and/or of a decreased hazard to health and safety of others. In the case of withdrawal for medical reasons, this documentation must include an evaluation from the student's personal health care provider. In addition, the student will generally be required to show evidence of successful social, occupational, and/or academic functioning during the time away from the College. This evidence must include the completion of any outstanding incompletes on record.</p><p>After such evidence has been provided, the materials will be forwarded to the Evaluation Committee. In the case of health-related withdrawals, the materials will be reviewed by the director of Worth Health Center and/or the director of Counseling and Psychological Services, and the student will be required to be evaluated in person p. 67</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Faculty Regulations</head><p>by the appropriate health care professional at the College. At the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, such evaluations may be required for other types of withdrawals as appropriate. These evaluations will provide adjunctive information to the committee's decision-making process. The Evaluation Committee will normally meet with the student and will make a determination regarding the student's readiness to resume study at Swarthmore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.4">Short-Term Health-Related Absences</head><p>Students who are hospitalized during the semester are subject to the readmission procedures described above before they may return to campus to resume their studies. In these situations, the Evaluation Committee may also counsel and advise the student about options for how best to approach the remaining academic work in the semester. In all cases, a student returning to campus from the hospital must report to the Worth Health Center and get clearance from the appropriate health care professional before returning to the dormitory to ensure the student's readiness to resume college life and so that followup care can be discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.6">Summer School Work and Other Work Done Elsewhere</head><p>Students who wish to receive Swarthmore College credit for work at another school must obtain preliminary approval and after-the-fact validation by the Swarthmore department or program concerned, or for participants in the Semester/Year Abroad program, the Swarthmore Off-Campus Study Office. Preliminary approval depends on adequate information about the content and instruction of the work to be undertaken and ensures the likelihood of the work's applicability toward the Swarthmore degree as well as clarifies the amount of Swarthmore credit likely. Preliminary approval is tentative except when automatic credit is approved as part of the Semester/Year Off-Campus Study Program. Final validation of the work for credit will depend on evaluation of the materials of the course, such as syllabus, transcript, written work, examinations, indication of class hours, and so forth unless the course has been pre-estimated to receive automatic credit as part of the Semester/Year Off-Campus Study Program. In all cases, transfer of credit is subject to successful completion of the course, i.e., receipt of a straight US equivalent grade of "C" or higher. Work in other programs, especially summer school programs, may sometimes be given less credit than work at Swarthmore, but this will depend on the nature of the program and the work involved. Validation may include an examination, written or oral, administered at Swarthmore. All decisions are made on a case-bycase basis. Credit for AP and similar work is discussed in section 3.5. To receive Swarthmore credit for study abroad during the academic year, students must participate in the College's Semester/Year Abroad Program and comply with its payment plan (study abroad is discussed in section 7.14). An official transcript from the other school must be received by the Registrar's Office before validated work can be recorded for credit. By College policy, in order for work done elsewhere to be granted Swarthmore College credit, the grade for that work must be the equivalent of a straight C or better, but a better than C grade does not in itself qualify for Swarthmore credit.</p><p>Students who wish to receive natural sciences and engineering practicum (NSEP) credit for courses taken elsewhere must obtain preliminary approval for the course from the department involved as well as final validation as with other credit. The department can approve NSEP credit if the course is comparable with a Swarthmore NSEP course. Generally, courses taken elsewhere that are not comparable with a Swarthmore NSEP will not receive NSEP credit; however, in exceptional cases, if NSEP criteria are satisfied elsewhere, the department chair may recommend NSEP credit award to the Division of Natural Sciences and Engineering for its final decision. Requests for credit must be made within the semester following the term in which the work was done. Credit is lost if a student takes a course at Swarthmore that essentially repeats the work covered by the credit. The normal deadline for seniors to submit official documentation originating from off-campus sources for credit toward their degree is the end of classes in the spring of the senior year. The absolute deadline for the registrar to receive such documentation is six (6) days before graduation; after that, no new documents from off-campus sources will be applied to graduation in that year. Students needing such documents to graduate will have to defer graduation to the following year.</p></div>

The candidate's record and a detailed program setting forth the aim of the work to be pursued shall be submitted, with a recommendation from the department or departments concerned, to the Curriculum Committee. If accepted by the committee, the candidate's name shall be reported to the faculty at or before the first faculty meeting of the year in which the candidate is to begin work. The requirements for the master's degree shall include the equivalent of a full year's work of graduate character. This work may be done in courses, seminars, reading courses, regular conferences with members of the faculty, or research. The work may be done in one department or in two related departments. A candidate for the master's degree shall be required to pass an examination conducted by the department or departments in which the work was done. The candidate shall be examined by outside examiners, provided that where this procedure is not practicable, exceptions may be made by the Curriculum Committee. The department or departments concerned, on the basis of the reports of the outside examiners, together with the reports of the student's resident instructors, shall make recommendations to the faculty for the award of the degree. At the option of the department or departments concerned, a thesis may be required as part of the work for the degree. A candidate for the master's degree will be expected to show before admission to candidacy a competence in those languages deemed by his or her department or departments most essential for the field of research. Detailed language requirements will be indicated in the announcements of departments that admit candidates for the degree. The tuition fee for graduate students who are candidates for the master's degree is the same as for undergraduates (see section 4.1). The Eleanor Kay Hess Award is given in honor of "Pete" Hess, whose 33 years of service to Swarthmore College and Swarthmore students were exemplified by her love of athletics, leadership, hard work, fairness, and objectivity.

The stipend will be available to a Swarthmore student from any class for a project in any country other than that of his or her own citizenship. To combat homophobia and related discrimination, the fund sponsors events that focus on concerns of the lesbian, bisexual, and gay communities and promotes curricular innovation in the field of lesbian and gay studies. The fund also sponsors an annual three-day symposium. The fund is administered by a committee of women and men from the student body, alumni, staff, faculty, and administration. In 2004, Richard Sager created an "internship" to provide funding for students in internships with nonprofit organizations whose primary missions address gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender issues.  , who was a distinguished member of the Swarthmore faculty for more than 60 years.

For introductory language yearlong courses, credit is not given for the first semester's work only, nor is credit given for the first semester if the student fails the second semester. In cases where credit is not earned for the second half of a yearlong course, the first semester is excluded from counting toward degree credit, although the registration and grade for the first semester remain on the permanent record.</p><p>Course listings in this catalog are intended to facilitate planning, but are subject to change.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Policy</head><p>Academic Period: Swarthmore College uses the semester course credit system, and lists semester course credits on the official Swarthmore College transcript. Excluding holidays, Swarthmore College has two semesters of fourteen or fifteen weeks, thirteen or fourteen instructional weeks including a mid-semester break, and one week of final examinations. Recommended instructional time: Our official normal student work load is four course credits per semester. One unit of Swarthmore College credit normally represents three to four hours of class or seminar time, with conference sessions and laboratory periods in addition. Conference sections, professor-lead additional study sessions, and laboratories are usually three hours or more in length, and are not reflected on the transcript, but occur in many courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommended out of class time requirements:</head><p>We advise students to plan to spend two to three hours of work for every hour of class attended. Our research shows that Swarthmore College students typically work at least two hours outside of class preparing for every hour of class attended. The typical student attends class or seminar for 12 or more hours per week, and prepares for class or seminar at least 24 hours per week.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Course Recommendations</head><p>The Art Major: ARTT 001. Foundation Drawing This (1) credit course is designed as an introduction to drawing as the basis for visual thinking and perception. The class will focus on concepts and practices surrounding the use of drawing as a visual language rather than as a preliminary or planning process. Whether students are interested in photography, painting, pottery, sculpture, installation or performance, the ability to design and compose visually is fundamental to their development. The course follows a sequence of studies that introduces students to basic drawing media and compositional elements while they also learn to see inventively. This course is a prerequisite for all other courses in studio art. ARTT 002 First-Year Seminar This (1) credit studio art experience is designed for first-year students who have demonstrated through a portfolio presentation their knowledge of the elements of design, composition, and visual thinking. This course is similar in content to the foundation drawing class ARTT 001. However, it will be more in depth, with more emphasis on individually designed studio and research projects. Portfolios of actual or photographed work must be submitted for evaluation during orientation week. This portfolio should include, in addition to whatever medium you choose to present, several drawing examples demonstrating proficiency in drawing. Contact the department for details. This course is a prerequisite for all other courses in studio art.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Art History Major:</head><p>Most Art History courses do not have prerequisites, except for 2-credit seminars that are intended for juniors and seniors. While students may elect mid-level topics that interest them, we recommend that for a 1 st course students take either a First Year Seminar or an introductory survey. These courses are valuable even for students who may arrive with AP credit.</p><p>A First Year Seminar introduces students to the discipline of art history -questions, methods of inquiry -through an in-depth focus on a topic such as "Architecture of Philadelphia," "Animation in East Asia" or "Michelangelo." There is no presumption of prior study of art history or engagement with studio arts; the course is ideal for art history and studio students, but equally for those who may not think they will take other art history courses (though they may, completing a major or minor). Limited to 12 students, these courses foreground discussion and individual and group presentations, as well as writing. Introductory surveys focus on broader coverage of major topics in art history: Western Tradition (ARTH 002), Asian Art (ARTH 003), Modern Art in Europe and the US (ARTH 005), Global History of Architecture: 1800-Present (ARTH 073). With slightly larger enrollments, these courses may be more lecture-driven, but also entail writing and often discussion.</p></div>

All Majors in Art, whether Course or Honors, must do 3 credits of art history work. Studio faculty may recommend particular art history courses as most relevant to a student's studio interests. 4. Honors candidates in Art must fulfill the Course Major Requirements. The prerequisite for all studio work, unless waived, is ARTT 001. The distribution requirements for 2-D and 3-D for the Honors Major in Art are the same as those in course. 5. Honors study in Art is comprised of a culminating exhibition of the student's studio work, with an accompanying artist essay of 3750 to 5000 words. Some of this work may figure in the selections of work presented for one or both of the course pairs described above, but the rationale for inclusion in the exhibition will differ. The artist essay will be sent to both examiners of studio preparations. A revision of a paper written previously for the art history preparation will be sent to the art history examiner. The senior honors study essay will differ from the artist essay written by course students in that it will integrate the preparations in studio and art history. 1. The SHS essay will differ from the artist essay written by course students in that it will integrate the preparations in studio and art history. 2. For Honors Majors, ARTT 040 will count outside the Major for purposes of calculating the 20-course rule, since it serves as Senior Honors Study. It will be listed on the transcript not as ARTT 040 but as Senior Honors Study. 3. If a student drops out of Honors after the drop/add period in the last semester, the SHS credit will receive a grade of NC. Senior Workshop II (ARTT 040), assuming it had been successfully completed in the Spring, will then be listed on the transcript with the appropriate grade. 4. WARNING: if a student drops out of Honors, Senior Workshop II no longer counts as outside the major, but as within. A student who has taken 12 other credits within the department, and who is graduating with the minimum of 32 credits will then have 13 in the major and only 19 outside. Honors Art Majors should be especially careful to take enough credits outside the department if they contemplate withdrawing from Honors.</p></div>

This means that one can take no more than 12 courses in the major, unless one graduates with more than 32 credits, in which case the surplus can also be in the major. For Art History Majors, the one required credit of studio art course work counts as within the Major, but additional credits of studio art count as outside. Thus, an Art History Major graduating with 32 credits could take no more than 3 additional art history credits beyond the 8 art history credits that are required for the Major. But an Art History Major could take as many more studio credits as desired.</p><p>For Art Majors, the required 3 credits in art history count within the major, but additional credits in art history count outside the major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>The Art Department strongly encourages those with an interest in art and its history to consider incorporating study abroad--either during a summer or a regular academic term--into their Swarthmore program. Important examples of art and architecture are scattered throughout the world, and the encounter with works still imbedded in their original context is vital to an understanding of their historical and contemporary significance. Past experience has shown, however, that art courses in most foreign study programs fall considerably below the academic standards of comparable courses at Swarthmore. Students who are interested in bettering their chances of gaining a full Swarthmore credit for a course taken in a foreign program are advised to meet with the Art Coordinator and/or the Art History Coordinator before leaving the campus. PLEASE NOTE: to receive transfer credits in art history, you must have taken at least one art history course at Swarthmore (normally before going abroad).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Art History Courses ARTH 001C. First-Year Seminar: Making Art History</head><p>Are works of art direct extensions, pure reflections, or unique expressions of an individual artist's genius, fragile by implication and susceptible to destruction from over analysis? Or are works of art (as well as the definition just offered) cultural artifacts produced under specific material and social conditions, and fully meaningful only under extended analysis? Must we choose? And are these questions themselves, and the talk they generate or suppress, yet another manifestation of the Western European and American commodification of art, its production, and its consumption? Such questions will underlie this introduction to the goals, methods, and history of art history. Focusing on works drawn from a variety of cultures and epochs, as well as on the art historical and critical attention those works have attracted, students will learn to describe, analyze, and interpret both images and their interpretations and to convey their own assessments in lucid writing and speaking. Humanities. Writing course. 1 credit. Leonardo da Vinci was a great anatomist, engineer, architect and inventor whose drawings circulated around the courts of Europe. In this discussion-based course we will study the inventions, writings, paintings, drawings and biographies of this important Renaissance artist. We will consider the ways in which the works, biographies, and myths of Leonardo have been analyzed (and created) over the centuries. In doing so, we will develop a critical understanding of the methods and terminology of the discipline of art history itself. Humanities. Writing course. 1 credit. Fall 2020. Staff.</p></div>

The Western Tradition</head><p>This course provides an introduction to Mediterranean and European art from prehistoric cave painting to the 18th century. We will consider a variety of media-from painting, sculpture, and architecture to ceramics, mosaic, metalwork, prints, and earthworks. The goal of this course is to provide a chronology of the major works in the Western tradition and to provide the vocabulary and methodologies necessary to analyze these works of art closely in light of the material, historical, religious, social, and cultural circumstances in which they were produced and received. We will give attention to the use and status of materials; the representation of social relations, gender, religion, and politics; the context in which works of art were used and displayed; and the critical response these works elicited. </p></div>

This course explores diverse modes and technologies of reproduction, bringing into focus the function and cultural value of the copy in the history of Chinese art and visual culture. Through case studies of replications of painting, calligraphy, sculpture, film, architecture, ritual and religious art, we will consider a range of motivations for making copies that often became something more than just mindless imitation, serving as integral components of an artist's training, as acts of piety, as forms of preservation and documentation, as agents of dissemination, and as homage to artists and calligraphers of the past. As we study multiples made from the Bronze Age to contemporary China, we will pay close attention to the different processes of reproduction, examining how technique and material shape not only the duplicate produced but also the varied perception of the practice of copying.</p><p>Humanities. 1 credit.

Questions about the impact of art in the social fabric are constitutive of the idea of avant-garde art. This course will introduce students to these debates as they took shape in the American continent since 1960. With an emphasis on forms of art practice that outspokenly seek to provoke positive social change, this class provides a parallel narrative of contemporary art, in which art exits the museum space to ingrain itself in broader social processes. During the semester students will learn about different theories of socially engaged art articulated by artists and art historians alike. We will consider art as activism in the Civil Rights era, forms of artistic resistance to Latin American military dictatorships, second wave feminist art, contemporary community-based art, and forms of engaged art practice concerned with planet-wide environmental crisis. We will debate the tactics and ideals guiding these practices, and we will evaluate the potential risks that come with relying on art for social transformation. This course alternates short lecture periods with in-class discussion of primary and secondary sources. It is structured around six thematic blocs, at the end of which students will produce a short written assignment.</p><p>Humanities. 1 credit. Fall 2019. Checa-Gismero.</p></div>

What ways of seeing do we engage in and what kinds of questions do we ask when analyzing paintings, buildings, sculptures, ceramics, photographs, or prints? How do we crack the visual codes specific to images, objects, and structures of a given time and place? This colloquium will explore various approaches to the interpretation of the visual arts through the critical reading of important texts of the discipline and writings that propose or challenge a variety of analytic strategies. Students will directly engage in the interpretive process by researching, writing, and presenting on a work of art or architecture in the Philadelphia area, an exercise that will assist the exploration of questions central to their own interest in the study of visual culture.

Senior Thesis Workshop II</head><p>This course is designed to further strengthen critical, theoretical, and practical skills on a more advanced level. During the spring semester of the senior art major, students will write their senior artist statement and mount an exhibition in the List Gallery of the Eugene M. and Theresa Lang Performing Arts Center. The artist statement is a discussion of the development of the work to be exhibited. The exhibition represents the comprehensive examination for the studio art major. Gallery exhibitions are reserved for studio art majors who have passed the senior workshop and fulfilled all requirements, including the writing of the senior art major statement. Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary program that introduces students to the critical and methodological approaches that have informed the study of Asia. As one of the largest interdisciplinary programs at Swarthmore, Asian Studies trains students in the study of diverse texts, images, performances, bodies of knowledge and cultural practices across geographic and temporal boundaries. Students are encouraged to engage in a rigorous examination of the political, economic, social, environmental, and religious formations of the myriad societies that have constituted Asia. Asian Studies aims to provide students with a depth of knowledge and multiple critical perspectives with which to understand how these diverse locales have been and continue to be interwoven with the global.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>The Asian Studies Program offers a major and a minor in course and honors. Students who declare a major in Asian studies construct individualized programs of study, with a focus on a comparative theme or on a particular country or region. Some examples of comparative themes are classical traditions in Asian literature and art, Buddhist studies, Asian nationalisms and the emergence of nation-states, and the political economy of Asian development. In all cases, the core of the major involves exposure to multiple regions and multiple disciplines.</p><p>Students interested in Asian studies are urged to consult the Asian studies website for up-to-date information on courses and campus events. Students should meet with the program chair in advance of preparing a Sophomore Plan. Advance planning is especially important for students contemplating the Honors Program and those planning to study abroad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Goals</head><p>1. Interdisciplinary breadth. The student must have mastered more than one academic discipline, to be able to speak to issues/ themes of their research on topics rooted in Asian traditions/regions from more than one disciplinary perspective; 2. Comparative Scope. The student must know in some depth more than one region in Asia; though they may focus, for instance, primarily on studies in Chinese traditions, pre-modern or modern, the student must also be able to think comparatively, and engage with more than one Asian tradition in regard to the topics/ themes that are central to their main region-specific research; 3. Depth of Knowledge in One Tradition. If the student's research project is fundamentally transnational or trans-regional, they should know at least one Asian tradition with depth and detail, including knowledge of language (see below); p. 142</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asian Studies</head><p>4. The Past, the Present, and the Future. The student should be aware of modern/contemporary or pre-modern formations (depending upon the student's scholarly focus) within the Asian traditions they study, with the idea that one cannot never really understand the present without more than cursory knowledge of the past, and also that one cannot study the past without a scholarly awareness of the present forms of political, economic, social, environmental, or religious formations at the center of a student's project in Asian Studies; 5. Languages and Language Study. The student majoring in Asian Studies should demonstrate advanced knowledge of at least one Asian language central to the region/tradition that is the focus of their academic work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>Asian studies invites students to make connections among courses that differ widely in content and method. When considering applicants to the major, the Asian Studies Committee looks for evidence of intellectual flexibility and independence. Students must have completed at least two Asia-related courses in different departments with grades of B or better to be accepted into the major. The major in Asian studies consists of a minimum of ten (10) credits, with requirements and distribution as follows: 1. Geographic breadth. Coursework must include more than one of the following regions of Asia: (East, South, Central, Northeast, Southeast, and study of Asian diasporas). This requirement can be fulfilled by taking at least two courses that are pan-Asian or comparative in scope or by taking at least one course on a country or region that is not the principal focus of a student's program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Disciplinary breadth.</head><p>Courses must be taken in at least three different departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Temporal breadth.</head><p>At least one course focusing on the Premodern or Early Modern (before 1900) Eras, and at least one course on the Modern (after 1900) Era must be completed. This requirement can be fulfilled by taking at least two courses that examine substantial material on both the Premodern/Early Modern and Modern Eras. 4. Intermediate and advanced work. A minimum of 5 credits must be completed at the intermediate or advanced level in at least two departments. 5. Asian language study. At least one year of college-level study of an Asian language or its equivalent in intensive summer coursework is required of all majors. Up to four credits of Asian language study may be applied to the major. Advanced topical courses taught in the original language are not subject to the four credit limit. Students wishing to study an Asian language not offered at Swarthmore are encouraged to fulfill this requirement through study abroad, intensive summer study, approved coursework at neighboring institutions (tri-co, University of Pennsylvania), etc. The language requirement may be waived at the discretion of the Asian Studies coordinator in cases of advanced oral and written proficiency in an Asian language relevant to a student's area of geographic focus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis / Culminating Exercise</head><p>Thesis / Culminating Exercise. Students in the Asian studies course major have a choice of culminating exercises. Thesis option. A 1-or 2-credit thesis, followed by an oral examination. A thesis must be supervised by a member of the Asian studies faculty. Students normally enroll for thesis, ASIA 096, in the fall semester of the senior year. Qualifying papers option. Students revise and expand two papers they have written for Asian studies courses in consultation with Asian studies faculty members. Honors seminar option. Students take a 2-credit honors seminar in an Asian studies topic in either their junior or senior year. (Note: A two-course combination or a course plus attachment will not satisfy this requirement.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Students will be admitted to the minor after having completed at least two Asian studies courses in different departments with grades of B or better. The Asian studies minor in course consists of five courses, distributed as follows: 1. Geographic breadth. Coursework must cover more than one region of Asia. This can be accomplished by taking at least two courses that are pan-Asian or comparative in scope or by taking at least one full course on a country that is not the principal focus of a student's program. 2. Disciplinary breadth. Asia-related courses must be taken in at least two departments outside of the disciplinary major. Only one course may overlap the Asian studies minor and the disciplinary major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Temporal breadth.</head><p>At least one course focusing on the Premodern or Early Modern (before 1900) Eras, and at least one course on the Modern (after 1900) Era must be completed. This requirement can be fulfilled by taking at least two courses that examine substantial material on both the Premodern/Early Modern and Modern Eras. 4. Intermediate or advanced work. At least 2 credits of work must be completed at the intermediate or advanced level. 5. Asian language study. Asian-language study is not required but is strongly recommended. Up to two credits in Asian language study may be applied toward the course minor. For languages offered at Swarthmore (Chinese and Japanese), courses above the first-year level may count p. 143</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>To be admitted to the honors major, students should have completed at least two Asian studies courses in different departments with grades of B+ or better. The honors major in Asian studies consists of a minimum of ten (10) credits (including four honors preparations). The four preparations in an Honors Program must be drawn from at least two different disciplines. 1. Geographic, disciplinary, and temporal breadth requirements. These are the same as those for the course major (see above) 2. Asian language study. This requirement is the same as for the course major (see above).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Asian studies as an interdisciplinary major.</head><p>All four fields for external examination must be Asian studies subjects. One of the fields may also count toward an honors minor in a department. The four preparations must be drawn from at least two different disciplines. 4. Grade-point average requirement. A student must earn at least a B+ in all courses applied to the honors major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>To be admitted to the honors minor, students should have completed at least two Asian studies courses in different departments with a grade of B+ or above. An honors minor in Asian studies consists of a minimum of 5 credits, distributed as follows: 1. Geographic breadth. There are two tracks within the minor: a. Comparative Asian cultures: The selection of courses and the honors preparation should offer a comparative perspective on the traditional or modern cultures of Asia. Individual programs should be worked out in close consultation with the Asian studies coordinator. (Language study does not count toward this track.) b. Focus on a single country or region: All courses in the program should focus on the same region or country. One or 2 credits of language study may be included. 2. Disciplinary breadth. Asia-related courses must be taken in at least two departments outside of the disciplinary honors major. Only one course may overlap the honors minor and the disciplinary honors major 3. Temporal breadth. At least one course focusing on the Premodern or Early Modern (before 1900) Eras, and at least one course on the Modern (after 1900) Era must be completed. This requirement can be fulfilled by taking at least two courses that examine substantial material on both the Premodern/Early Modern and Modern Eras. 4. Asian language study. Asian language study is not required, but courses in Asian languages may count toward the honors minor. Up to 2 credits of Asian language study may be applied to the honors minor. For languages offered at Swarthmore (Chinese and Japanese), courses above the secondyear level count toward the minor. For Asian languages not offered at Swarthmore, courses at the entry level may be counted if the equivalent of 1.5 credits is earned in an approved program. 5. Honors preparation. One preparation, normally a two-credit seminar, will be submitted for external examination. 6. Senior Honors Seminar for minors. The student will fulfill the requirements set for honors minors by the department offering the honors preparation. 7. Grade-point average requirement. A student must earn at least a B+ in all courses applied to the honors major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fellowship and Grant Opportunities for Students</head><p>The Alice L. Crossley Prize in Asian Studies is awarded annually to the student or students who submit the best essay(s) on any topic in Asian or Asian American Studies. The Genevieve Ching-wen Lee '96 Memorial Fund supports a lecture each year in Asian American studies. This fund also supports an annual competition for summer research support for projects related to Asian studies or Asian American studies. The Penelope Mason '57 Memorial Fund for Asian Studies is available to support Asian studies related projects proposed by students, faculty members, or both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students with majors in Asian studies are strongly encouraged to undertake a period of study in Asia. The Asian studies faculty can recommend academically rigorous programs in several Asian countries. Study abroad is the ideal arena for intensive language study. Courses taken abroad may be applied toward the major, subject to the approval of the Asian studies coordinator. However, at least half of the credits in a student's Asian studies major or minor should be earned at Swarthmore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life After Swarthmore</head><p>Students with a background in Asian studies have pursued a number of paths after graduation. Some have gone abroad to continue their studies, do research, or work in humanitarian or social service organizations. Others have gone directly to graduate school. Many eventually become teachers p. 144 Asian Studies or professors. Others work in the arts, journalism, international law, business, finance, in the diplomatic corps, or in non-governmental organizations. Other Asian studies graduates pursue careers not directly related to Asia, in medicine or law, for example. All consider Asian studies to have been an important part of their liberal arts education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asian Studies Courses</head><p>Courses in the Asian Studies Program are listed below. Courses of independent study, special attachments on subjects relevant to Asian Studies, and courses offered by visiting faculty that are not regularly listed in the catalog may also qualify for credit in the program, subject to the approval of the Asian Studies Committee. Students who wish to pursue these possibilities should consult with the Asian Studies chair. ASIA 015. Introduction to East Asian Humanities (Cross-listed as CHIN 015, LITR 015CH) This course is a survey of East Asian literatures and cultural histories from antiquity to around 1800. The primary purpose is to provide students with a basic literacy in East Asian cultures and literatures with substantive emphasis on topics common across East Asia, such as the classical traditions and cosmology, the Chinese script, Buddhism, the civil service examination, folklore, theater, literature, and medicine. This course is a colloquium designed to meet the needs of students just beginning their study of China, Japan and Korea, who would like to explore the region broadly; and those who have already done substantial study of China or Japan and welcome the chance to situate it within the larger context of traditional East Asia. This course will provide students with information and approaches to analyze primary sources in translation through assigned postings and short writing assignments. At all levels of the biology curriculum, students are engaged in learning about the functions and evolution of diverse biological systems as well as the methods by which biologists study nature. There is much flexibility in the curriculum, allowing students to craft a path through the biology major that best suits their own interests. While fulfilling the requirements for the major, students are able to build a broad biological background by taking courses focused on different levels of biological organization, while also being able to concentrate on specialized areas of particular passion if they choose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our goals for biology majors:</head><p>A basic tenet of the department is that the best way to learn about biology is to do biology. Therefore, almost every course has weekly laboratories or field trips, where students learn to become biologists by making original observations, asking questions about life processes, solving problems and designing and testing hypotheses by performing experiments. Communication skills are emphasized in all biology courses, as students read and evaluate research articles in scientific journals, write laboratory reports according to the standards of professional scientific writing, participate in frequent opportunities for oral presentations and critical discussion, and work in research teams. The curriculum prepares students to pursue careers in research or to apply their biology interests and knowledge to careers as diverse as medicine, governmental policy planning, science education, public health, and writing children's books. A number of departmental alumni have also chosen careers outside of science, such as law and finance, where they report that the organizational, critical thinking, and communication skills that they learned as a biology major have been crucial for their success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>In addition to first-year seminars, the department offers four different types of courses. Students are introduced to the study of biology at Swarthmore by taking BIOL 001, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and BIOL 002, Organismal and Population Biology. Either course may be taken first. Courses numbered 003-009 do not have associated laboratories; usually BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 are prerequisites. Diverse intermediatelevel courses, some offered in alternate years, allow students to choose coursework in areas of particular interest. These courses are numbered 010-039 and generally have BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 (or AP credit) as prerequisites. Some of these courses also require prior coursework in the Chemistry Department. Finally, two-credit seminars (with three-digit course numbers) have an intermediate-level course as a prerequisite and are usually taken by students in their junior or senior years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Majors and minors</head><p>The Biology Department offers a course major, course minor, honors major and honors minor. In addition, special majors in biochemistry and neuroscience are regularly offered in cooperation with the Chemistry and Biochemistry and Psychology departments, respectively. A student may choose an interdisciplinary minor in environmental studies, which includes courses in the Biology Department. In addition, the department has also supported special majors as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 148</head><p>Biology Sample paths through the discipline As pointed out in the introduction, there are many paths to a biology major. Following are some ideas to keep in mind as you plan your schedule. Getting started as a biology major: Many majors take BIOL 001 and/or BIOL 002 during their first year. These two courses may be taken in either order and it is not uncommon for prospective majors to take BIOL 002 during the spring semester of their first year, and BIOL 001 during the fall semester of their second year. Students who realize their interest in biology later have also taken both courses during their sophomore year and successfully completed the major in eight semesters. We generally encourage all students to take at least one of the introductory courses, even if they have AP credit. BIOL 001 is always offered in the fall semester, and BIOL 002 always in the spring semester. We encourage majors to fulfill the mathematics and chemistry requirements for the major during their first two years. In particular, some intermediate level courses require CHEM 010 and CHEM 022. Completion of those chemistry courses gives more flexibility in biology course choice. However, we are willing to work with students to craft the best path for each individual. Continuing as a biology major: Because most intermediate level courses require both BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 (or AP credit), taking both courses before continuing on in the field usually serves students best. For planning purposes, most Group III intermediate-level courses are taught in the fall semester, and most Group I intermediate-level courses are taught in the spring semester. Some Group II courses are taught in spring and others in fall. The two-credit seminar course(s) you are most interested in taking may influence your other course choices. In addition to your own interests, prerequisites for seminars (which may consist of a specific intermediate-level course), faculty leave schedules, and study abroad considerations may constrain your course choice and schedule. Some faculty strongly encourage students interested in doing research with them to take at least one course with them before working on a research project. It is important to talk to specific faculty members you are interested in working with to understand their specific requirements for work in their laboratory. Completion of the biology major: Course majors must pass the comprehensive exam (BIOL 097 Themes in Biology) during the fall semester of the senior year. Honors majors are required to enroll in at least one credit of BIOL 180 (often but not always in fall semester of the senior year), and in Senior Honors Study <ref type="bibr">(BIOL 199)</ref>, which is taken in the spring semester of the senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>Acceptance criteria Three courses (or advanced placement credit and two courses) in biology. If the student does not have AP or transfer credit, both BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 are required. CHEM 010, or placement approved by the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department. Swarthmore College credit for two courses in mathematics or statistics (not STAT 001 or MATH 003). Alternatively, students may complete calculus II (MATH 025). The Biology Department strongly recommends a course in statistics for majors. Completion of an additional course in the specified list of quantitative courses in NSE. Applicants must have an average grade of C (2.00) or better in BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 (or if AP credit is given, in the first two biology courses taken at Swarthmore). In addition, the applicant must have an average grade of C (2.00) or better in all courses taken in the Biology Department, and an overall average grade of C (2.00) or better in the Division of Natural Sciences and Engineering at Swarthmore College (biology, physics and astronomy, chemistry and biochemistry, mathematics and statistics, engineering, and computer science). Unpublished grades in biology for the first semester of the first year will be considered in the C average requirement; passing grades of CR in other courses in the Division of Natural Sciences and Engineering are acceptable. Students who have not completed the requirements for acceptance to the major will be deferred until the end of the fifth semester. Students who have not completed all requirements for acceptance to the major by the end of the fifth semester will no longer have priority in lotteries based on their sophomore plan, and will need to re-apply for the major before the last day of classes in their junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for graduation</head><p>Credit requirements: Students majoring in biology must complete a minimum of eight biology credits by the end of their senior year, two of which come from a seminar (numbered 110-139). Students may take a course or seminar in biology as CR/NC but are not encouraged to do so. Distribution requirements: Students majoring in biology must pass at least one course in each of the following three groups: I. Cellular and Molecular Biology, II. Organismal Biology and III. Population Biology. The digit in the tens place of the course number signifies the group of the course (i.e., BIOL 020 is a Group II course and BIOL 114 is a Group I course). Students majoring in biology may count only one course numbered 003-009 toward the eight required credits. Courses numbered 003-009 do not meet the Group distribution requirement. BIOL 093 (Directed Reading) and BIOL 094 p. 149 Biology (Independent Research) count as credits toward the biology major but cannot be used as distribution requirements. No more than two credits in BIOL 093, BIOL 094 or BIOL 093 and BIOL 094 in combination may be used to satisfy the eight-credit requirement for the biology major. CHEM 038 (Biochemistry) may be counted as a Group I course. In this case, the CHEM 038 grade will be counted towards the biology GPA. Seminar requirement: All biology majors are required to take at least one two-credit seminar (with a number greater than 100) in their courses in the major. A seminar in biology is defined as an advanced offering that uses primary rather than secondary source materials and encourages active student participation in presentation and discussion of materials. Note that all two-credit seminars have at least one intermediate level course (numbered 10-39) as a prerequisite; the particular prerequisites for seminars vary and should be considered during selection of intermediate level courses. All seminars must be taken at Swarthmore College. A student may, with permission of the faculty instructor, take a seminar without the laboratory component. A seminar without the laboratory component becomes a BIOL 093 and does not meet the seminar requirement. Students majoring in Biology must complete two courses from the list of quantitative NSE courses (below). Comprehensive examination: All biology course majors must satisfy the general College requirement of passing a comprehensive examination given by the major department. In biology, this comprehensive examination is the lecture series BIOL 097, Themes in Biology. BIOL 097 is offered only in the fall semester and is usually taken by students during the fall of their senior year. This course features a series of visiting speakers who give presentations connected by an overarching theme that can be addressed from all areas of biology. It enables faculty and students to interact on an intellectually challenging project, allows students to think about a topic from a variety of levels of biological organization and gives students the opportunity to meet and interact with a variety of distinguished biologists. Biology majors are required to take BIOL 097. BIOL 097 is a C/NC course. BIOL 097 counts as one of the eight credits required for a major in biology. Evaluation of a student's performance for this comprehensive examination will be Pass/No Pass and will be based on the questions prepared by each individual and team for each lecture, participation in discussions, hosting a guest speaker and the final presentation. For students enrolled in BIOL 097 for credit, Pass/No Pass on the comprehensive exam will be translated into Credit/No Credit for purposes of earning credit. Students who fail BIOL 097 fail the comprehensive exam and thus may not graduate. The department will evaluate all such failures and decide on the appropriate action. Students will be notified of failure by the first day of classes in the spring semester of their senior year. If a student is given permission by the College to be away from campus during the fall semester of the senior year, the Biology Department faculty may give permission to the student to write a senior paper and enroll in BIOL 095, a Senior Project, to satisfy the College requirement of a comprehensive examination. Alternatively, the student may be given permission by the Biology faculty to enroll in Themes in Biology during the junior year if the student has planned in advance to be away during the fall semester of the senior year. Quantitative non-Biology courses which can be used for the Biology major: ASTRO 016, CHEM 015 or above, COMP SCI 021 or above, ENGR 005 or above (with the exception of ENGR 010), MATH 26 or above, PHYS 003 or above (with the exception of PHYS 029), STAT 11 or above, ECON 031 or 035. Courses used to meet the Math/Stat criterion for acceptance to the major may not be counted towrd the quantitative course requirement. Courses used to meet any other Biology major requirement may not be counted toward this requirement. While a student may test or place out of the Math criterion by AP, IB, or math placement test for acceptance to the Biology major, both quantitative courses necessary for the completion of the major must be taken after matriculation into Swarthmore. If a student is using CHEM 038 to satisfy their Group I requirement, it may not be used to satisfy this requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Students who wish to minor in biology must complete six credits, at least four of which are to be taken at Swarthmore College. The GPA requirement to enter the minor is the same as for biology course majors 2.00 in BIOL 001 and BIOL 002, 2.00 in courses taken in the Biology Department, and 2.00 in all courses taken in the Division of Natural Sciences and Engineering. Both BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 are required (although one or both of these may be replaced by credit from an advanced placement examination after another biology course is completed; note that the department strongly encourages all students with AP credit to take at least one of the introductory courses). There are no requirements for courses outside the department. There is no distribution requirement within the department for the minor. Only one course numbered 003-009 is allowed. Only one credit in BIOL 093 or BIOL 094 is allowed. CHEM 038 (Biochemistry) may be counted as one of the six biology credits. BIOL 097 may NOT be used as a Biology credit for Biology minors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology Honors Major</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance criteria</head><p>The course requirements for an honors major in biology are the same as those for a course major in biology (see above). Admission to the Honors Program in biology is based on academic record. Applicants to the Honors Program in biology must have a grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 in all courses taken in the Natural Sciences and Engineering Division at Swarthmore College and must obtain a grade of B or better in all lecture courses and seminars used for the Honors Program. Applicants must also have a GPA of 3.00 in all biology courses. Unpublished grades in biology for the first semester of the first year will be considered in these requirements; passing grades of CR in other courses in the Division of Natural Sciences and Engineering are acceptable. Students should list the anticipated fields of study, including two 2-credit seminar courses, in their Sophomore Plan. Students who are accepted into the program must select a research project and mentor by the middle of the junior year. Final approval of the student's Honors Program will occur during the fall semester of the senior year when the Final Honors Program Form is signed by the chairs of the participating departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for graduation</head><p>Credit requirements for honors: In addition to fulfilling the requirements to be accepted as biology honors major, the student majoring in biology must complete a minimum of eight biology credits. Students may take a course or seminar in biology as CR/NC but are not encouraged to do so. Students must earn a grade of B or better for all courses and seminars used for honors preparations. Honors students may not take Bio 097, Themes in Biology, for credit but are welcome and encouraged to attend the seminars. Distribution requirements for honors: Students graduating with an honors major in biology must pass at least one course in each of the following three groups: I. Cellular and Molecular Biology, II. Organismal Biology, and III. Population Biology. The digit in the tens place of the course number signifies the group of the course (i.e., BIOL 020 is a Group II course and BIOL 114 is a Group I course). The Biology Department faculty strongly encourage honors students to fulfill their group distribution requirements with intermediate-or seminar-level courses. Our experience has been that students with coursework at these levels have a more complete and deeper understanding of biology. In addition, students who alter their plans and withdraw from the Honors Program have much more flexibility in scheduling if they have already planned to fulfill the department distribution requirement with intermediate-or seminar-level courses. To mitigate the scheduling constraints imposed by the Honors Program, however, the following rules also apply to honors students: An honors major who has taken both BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 at Swarthmore may use this pair of courses to satisfy any one of the distribution requirements (Group I, Group II, or Group III). An honors major who has AP or IB credit and has taken BIOL 001 but not BIOL 002 can use BIOL 001 to satisfy the Group I distribution requirement. An honors major who has AP or IB credit and has taken BIOL 002 but not BIOL 001 can use BIOL 002 to satisfy the Group III distribution requirement. AP credit may not be used to satisfy the Biology distribution requirement. Seminar requirement for honors: All honors biology majors are required to complete at least two 2-credit seminars (those with a number greater than 100) for honors preparations. A seminar in biology is defined as an advanced offering that uses primary rather than secondary source materials and encourages active student participation in presentation and discussion of materials. Note that all two-credit seminars have a prerequisite course from the intermediate level (numbered 010-039); the particular prerequisites for each seminar should be considered during selection of intermediate level courses. The two seminars used for honors preparations must be taken from different faculty members and must be taken at Swarthmore College. Research (Thesis) requirement for honors: At least one, but not more than two, credits of thesis research (BIOL 180) are required. Thesis research will be graded by an External Examiner. Thesis research will be a substantial project carried out over 2 semesters, 2 summers, or 1 summer + 1 semester. The primary mentor for thesis need not be a Swarthmore faculty member, but a Swarthmore faculty member must agree to be an on-campus mentor. Students should plan on completing their research by the end of the fall semester of their senior year. The honors thesis has a page limit of 20 pages, not counting references, figures, figure legends or tables. <ref type="bibr">(BIOL 199)</ref> is required for all honors majors in the spring semester of their senior year. This integrative/interactive program prepares each student to finalize and present his or her thesis work formally, in both oral and written forms. During the first few meetings of the semester, faculty members are available for consultation about data analysis. At mid-semester, students present posters of their projects to the faculty and other honors students for review. Comments from faculty and students on these posters will guide students in revising and polishing their written theses. SHS BIOL 199 is Credit/No Credit and the evaluation is done by the biology faculty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 151</head><p>Biology Review of work for honors: The Biology Department will review the academic work of all candidates for the external examination at the end of the junior year and in November of their senior year. Progress on thesis research is assessed at the beginning of the fall semester of the senior year. At these times, the department may ask a candidate not to discontinue participation in the Honors Program. Withdrawal from the Honors Program must occur by December 1 of the student's senior year. At that time, the student is responsible for consulting with the department about satisfying the comprehensive requirement for the major. Honors examinations: Students will take two written examinations, one based on each of their seminar preparations. The biology written examinations will be closed-book, 3-hour exams. The oral exams are normally one-on-one, but there are special circumstances under which a student may be examined by a panel of examiners. Oral examinations for seminar preparations are normally 45 minutes in length. The oral exams for thesis research are 60 minutes in length. Quantitative course requirement: Biology Honors majors must complete two courses from the following list of quantitative courses outside the Biology Department: ASTR 016, CHEM 015 or above, CPSC 021 or above, ENGR 005 or above, MATH 026 or above, PHYS 003 or above (with the exception of PHYS 029), STAT 011 or above, ECON 031 or 035. Courses used to meet the Math/Stat criterion for acceptance to the major may not also be counted toward the quantitative course requirement. Courses used to meet any other major requirement may not also be counted toward this requirement. While a student may test of place out of the Math criterion for acceptance to the major, both quantitative courses must be taken after matriculation at Swarthmore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>Biology minors in the Honors Program do not need to satisfy the distribution requirements of the major or take chemistry or mathematics unless required to do so for a specific preparation. Honors minors do not participate in Senior Honors Study. Applicants to the Honors Program in biology must have a GPA of 3.00 in all courses taken in the Divisions of Natural Sciences and Engineering, a GPA of 3.00 in all biology courses taken at Swarthmore College, and a grade of B or better in all lecture courses and seminars used for the Honors Program. The program in biology for an honors minor requires at least four credits and usually consists BIOL 001 and BIOL 002, an intermediate level course (course number between 10 and 39) and a two-credit seminar (course number greater than 100).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Process Notes for the Major or the Minor</head><p>In addition to the process described by the Dean's Office and the Registrar's Office for how to apply for a major, we also ask that you attend the departmental information meeting for sophomores. A copy of the Biology Student Handbook, which contains detailed information about courses and other aspects of the major, minor, and regularized special majors, is available online via a link from the departmental homepage at www.swarthmore.edu/biology. Applicants from the sophomore or junior classes who have completed all the requirements with the appropriate grades are accepted as a course major in biology. Applicants from the sophomore class who are in the process of completing these requirements with the required GPA are accepted contingent upon successful completion of the missing courses. Others who will not complete these requirements by the end of the current semester are deferred until the requirements are met. All students who have applied for the major in biology and who have been accepted or deferred are assigned an advisor in the Biology Department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Majors and Minors Biochemistry</head><p>The Biology Department, in collaboration with the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department, offers a course major and an honors major in biochemistry. This major gives students the opportunity to gain a strong background in chemistry with special emphasis on the application of chemistry to biological problems. Approval and advising for this special major are obtained through the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department and details about the course and honors major can be found in the Chemistry and Biochemistry section of this catalog. The Biology Department encourages biochemistry majors to take both BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 as a number of intermediate level courses in biology require both courses as a prerequisite. Honors biochemistry majors are expected to participate in Senior Honors Study <ref type="bibr">(BIOL 199)</ref> only if thesis research is done in the Biology Department. Honors biochemistry majors must conduct thesis research with a Swarthmore faculty member.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuroscience</head><p>The Psychology and Biology departments offer a special major in Neuroscience for course and honors majors that combines work in the two departments in a way that allows students flexibility in choosing the focus of their Neuroscience major. Approval for this special major is done through both departments. Each Neuroscience major is assigned a faculty advisor from whichever of the two departments best p. 152</p><p>Biology reflects the focus of that student's plan of study. Details about the Neuroscience special major can be found on the Biology website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioeducation</head><p>The special major in bioeducation requires six credits in biology. Most students take BIOL 001 and BIOL 002; a score of 5 on the Biology AP exam or equivalent can substitute for BIOL 001 and/or BIOL 002 and count for 1 credit. Students must take Evolution (BIOL 034) and at least one Group I and one Group II course. Completion of Chem 010, Math 015 and STAT 011 or placement out of these courses is required. In addition, the NSE elective requirement can be fulfilled by one of the following: ASTR 016, CHEM 015 or CHEM 022, CPSC 021 or above, PHYS 003/003L or above (not including PHYS 29 or 95), ENGR 005 or above, Math 025 or above. The special major in Bioeducation will include at least five credits in Educational Studies. Students should consult with the chair of the Educational Studies Department about specific requirements. Approval and advising for this special major are through the Biology and Educational Studies Departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Studies</head><p>A minor in environmental studies consists of an integrated program of five courses plus a capstone seminar (ENVS 091), which a student takes in addition to a regular major. The details of the minor and courses offered may be found at www.swarthmore.edu/envs.xml. The five courses must include at least one course in environmental science/technology; at least one course in environmental social science/humanities; and at least one more course from either of these two groups for a minimum of three courses from these two lists. Up to two of the five required courses may be chosen from the list designated adjunct and interdisciplinary courses. The capstone seminar is offered in the spring of the student's senior year. Advising for this program is by the chair of the Environmental Studies Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other special majors</head><p>Individualized special majors may be constructed after consultation with the chairs and approval of the participating departments. The special major is expected to specify a field of learning that crosses departmental boundaries and can be treated as a sub-field within the normal departmental major. Individualized special majors consist of at least 10 credits, but usually not more than 12. A more detailed explanation of the individualized special major is found in Chapter 7 "Educational Program." Previously approved special majors include cognitive science, neuroscience, environmental science, biostatistics and biophysics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Credit</head><p>Both BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 are required for the biology major and minor. However, one or both of these courses may be replaced by credit from one of the advanced placement examinations listed below, which will be granted after one biology course with laboratory is completed in the department. One biology credit is awarded for a score of 5 on the advanced placement examination; a score of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate; or A on the Higher Level of Biology, Advanced Level Examination, German Arbitur, Austrian Matura or French Baccalaureate exam. Note that the department strongly encourages all students with advanced placement credit to take at least one of the introductory courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>Credit for courses taken at an institution at which the student was previously matriculated may be counted toward the biology major. Courses will be evaluated on an individual basis to determine which departmental distribution requirements they meet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>The Biology Department faculty enthusiastically support study abroad for their majors. Majors may study abroad and earn credits that count toward the requirements for a biology major or, alternatively, participate in programs without earning biology credit, while still completing the major in eight semesters. By college regulation, we cannot guarantee a specific amount of credit in advance toward the Swarthmore degree for successful completion of academic work completed at other institutions, with the exception of regular semester coursework at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and the University of Pennsylvania completed under the four-college arrangement. Notwithstanding this restriction, our experience has shown that, with proper advance planning, study abroad is nearly always compatible with completion of the degree in eight semesters (including the semester(s) spent abroad). Planning is the key to success, and students contemplating study abroad are urged to see the Off-Campus Study Advisor early in the planning process. Prior to studying abroad, students should obtain preapproval and credit estimation from the faculty member with teaching and research interests most closely related to the proposed course. At this time, the faculty member will describe what course characteristics are important for obtaining Swarthmore College credit, how credit will be calculated upon completion of the program, and which departmental distribution requirements, if any, the courses are likely to fulfill.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 153</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology</head><p>Upon return, the student should present a transcript, syllabus of the course (including the number of hours in lecture and laboratory), class notes, laboratory directions, examinations, laboratory reports and any papers or other written work (but not the textbooks) to the Biology Department's Academic Coordinator, who will then determine which faculty member will be asked to award credit for the course. Courses without a laboratory will be awarded no more than one-half credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research and Service-Learning Opportunities Academic year opportunities Research</head><p>Students may receive academic credit for research carried out either on-or off-campus (BIOL 094). Students interested in doing research on campus should contact individual faculty members directly. For off-campus research credit in BIOL 094, the student must submit a one-page proposal to the department indicating 1) prior course work in the area of research, 2) previous technical experience in a laboratory, 3) the name and address of the director of the laboratory and the name of the person under whom the student will work directly, and 4) a short description of the proposed project and the methods to be used in the investigation. This proposal must be presented to the chair of the Biology Department, no later than one week before registration for the semester in which credit will be received. There are also opportunities for students to be paid for research during the academic year. Individual faculty members should be contacted about the potential for positions in their laboratory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Assistants</head><p>Each year approximately 10 students are selected to assist in the BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 laboratories. These students are selected for their academic excellence, laboratory expertise, and ability to communicate with students. Each selected student assists in one laboratory per week and attends a weekly staff meeting for the course. BIOL 002 hires two or three additional students to staff evening computer clinics. Contact the laboratory coordinator for BIOL 001 or BIOL 002 for more information. Approximately eight students are selected as Science Associates (SAs) for excellence in comprehension, communication and compassion. SAs attend all BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, meet weekly with the SA program coordinator and faculty lecturers throughout the semester, and facilitate small group problem-based learning in evening study sessions. Contact the department for more information. Dean's tutors in biology are hired on a rolling basis, to support student learning in BIOL 001 and BIOL 002. This is a flexible student position in which tutors meet one-on-one with students at mutually convenient times, typically for one hour per week. Contact the department for more information. Experienced students are hired as laboratory assistants, van drivers and/or study guides in several intermediate level courses, including Genetics, Marine Biology, and Neurobiology. Students are also hired to help with the care of organisms associated with various courses and research laboratories. The departmental administrative assistant, animal facility manager and greenhouse manager, as well as individual faculty members, may be contacted about these positions. The department collaborates with the Chester Children's Chorus (www.chesterchildrenschorus.org/) to support Science for Kids, a summer and academic year program focused on engaging children from the nearby Chester-Upland school district with experimental science. The academic year program meets on Saturdays while classes are in session and the College has funds from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to pay Swarthmore students involved in the program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Committee for faculty searches</head><p>Each year the Biology Department conducts several searches for replacement faculty to teach courses when regular members of the department are on leave. In some years there is a search for a permanent or tenure-track position. Students are invited to serve on a Student Search Committee to interview and help select a candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer opportunities Research</head><p>Paid fellowships for summer research are offered by the Biology Department as well as other institutions. Funds are available for field and laboratory research projects conducted on-and off-campus. Information regarding the awards, application deadlines and downloadable applications are available on the Biology Department website. An information session is usually offered at the end of the fall semester to describe opportunities in more detail.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Certification</head><p>Students may complete the requirements for teacher certification through a program approved by the state of Pennsylvania. Options to pursue a biology major along with teacher certification or to pursue a special major in biology and educational studies are available. For further information about the relevant set of requirements, please refer to the Educational Studies section of the Bulletin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life After Swarthmore</head><p>Graduate school Many of our majors have gone on to graduate school in biology after completion of their degree. While some students attend graduate school immediately after graduation from Swarthmore, others work for at least a year or two before applying to graduate programs. This time between finishing at Swarthmore and graduate school can be used to gain more experience in biology, or to try out a new field. These experiences both strengthen your graduate school applications and help you to know what you are most interested in studying. One-or two-year jobs are available at a variety of research institutes, field stations, universities, museums, government laboratories and companies. The Biology Student Handbook contains specific suggestions for applying to graduate programs and Biology Department faculty are happy to talk with students about programs and projects. Note that graduate schools in biology pay Ph.D. students a stipend for research and/or teaching. In addition, a few prestigious fellowships (e.g., National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship) are awarded to the student (not to the program), giving the recipient more flexibility and autonomy in their graduate program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career options/opportunities</head><p>In addition to graduate school and professional school (medical, law, veterinary, business) there are many other job possibilities. The American Institute of Biological Sciences web page (www.aibs.org/careers/), which describes jobs open to people with a degree in biology, is a helpful resource. A degree in biology can lead to positions in the following areas: Research: This could include laboratory work, fieldwork, or some combination of the two. Major employers include universities, research institutes, non-government organizations and companies (e.g., pharmaceutical, agricultural, biotechnology, food science). Healthcare: Many doctors, dentists, nurses, veterinarians, laboratory technicians and other health care providers have backgrounds in the biological sciences. Other biologists utilize their background in disease prevention and control.</p><p>Environmental management: Park rangers, conservation biologists, zoo biologists, and land management specialists use their background in biology to develop and evaluate management plans to conserve natural resources. Education: In addition to serving as university and college professors, some of our graduates teach in elementary and secondary schools, at museums and zoos, and at aquaria and nature centers. Biology majors also author newspaper and magazine articles, and may contribute to textbooks as writers, editors or illustrators. Other ideas: Our graduates have obtained jobs in politics and policy, in areas such as economic and biological impacts of land use practices, science advising on biomedical procedures, effects of climate change, and educating members of Congress about scientific issues. Other biology majors have found positions in forensics, bioinformatics and computational biology. Finally, some majors have had careers in investment banking, consulting and law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biology Courses</head><p>Biology course numbers reflect study at different levels of organization-General Studies (001-009, 061-069), intermediate courses in Cellular and Molecular Biology (010-019), Organismal Biology (020-029), Population Biology (030-039), Seminars in Cellular and Molecular Biology (110-119), Seminars in Organismal Biology (120-129), and Seminars in Population Biology (130-139). Suggested first courses: BIOL 001 and BIOL 002 are usually the first courses for students with an interest in biology.

The purpose of Black Studies is to introduce students to the history, culture, art, social relationships, and political, religious, and economic experiences of Black people in Africa, the Americas, and elsewhere in the world and to explore new approaches -in perspectives, analyses and interdisciplinary techniques -appropriate to the study of the Black experience. Black Studies has often stood in critical relation to the traditional disciplines. Its scholars have used traditional and nontraditional methodological tools to pursue knowledge that assumes the peoples and cultures of Africa and the African diaspora are central to understanding the world accurately. The courses in the Black Studies Program at Swarthmore enhance the liberal arts tradition of the College, acknowledging positivist, comparative, progressive, modernist and postmodern, postcolonial, and Afrocentric approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Sequence Recommendations</head><p>Students planning a major in chemistry or biochemistry should complete Chemistry 010/010 HN and 022 during their first year at Swarthmore. During the sophomore year students can take 032 and 038 or 044 and 055 if the physics and mathematics requirements for physical chemistry have been completed. In addition, students planning a major in Biochemistry should complete Biology 001 in their first two years at Swarthmore. In the last two years, chemistry and biochemistry majors have some flexibility about the sequencing of the remaining requirements for the major. However, students should note that completion of Chemistry 010/010 HN, 022 and one semester of a 40-level or 50-level course constitute a minimum set of prerequisites for enrollment in any Chemistry and Biochemistry Department 100level seminar. In addition, individual seminars carry additional prerequisites so students should plan ahead accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major in Chemistry</head><p>The course major in chemistry consists of the courses listed below as well as their mathematics and physics prerequisites.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major in Chemistry Requirements</head><p>An Honors preparation in Chemistry consists of three seminars -two in Chemistry (see item 1, below) and one in a minor -and a research thesis (see item 2, below). If, after following the procedures for applying for research in the department, an on-campus research mentor cannot be found, an Honors candidate should consult with the department's class advisor to explore alternate means of meeting the requirement. 1. Honors chemistry majors must take at least two seminars (instead of only one required for the course major). These seminars (and their associated prerequisites) will serve as two of the honors preparations in the major. 2. Honors chemistry majors are expected to write a senior research thesis under the supervision of an on-campus research mentor. Thesis represents the third honors preparation. Preparation for a Research Thesis within an Honors Program consists of enrollment in two credits of Chemistry 180 during the senior year. Except under extraordinary circumstances, students presenting a thesis for external examination will also spend the summer between their junior and senior years on campus initiating their research project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Exams for Majors and Preparations</head><p>The fields offered by the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department for examination by external examiners as part of the Honors Program are the topics of the 100-level seminars. The department will offer at least two of these preparations (seminars) during each academic year.</p><p>All fields in chemistry (except the Research Thesis) will be examined in three hour written examinations prepared by External Examiners. The Honors Research Thesis will be examined orally by the External Examiner chosen in that field. Honors oral exams for other preparations will be conducted by individual Examiners as well.</p></div>

Laboratory work at the advanced level in either chemistry or physics is required; math courses in linear algebra and multivariable calculus are prerequisites for this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>In preparation for a major in chemical physics, students must complete by the end of the sophomore year: (1) CHEM 010/010 HN and 022;</p><p>(2) PHYS 005, 007, 008 (PHYS 003, 004 can substitute, but the 005, 007, 008 sequence is strongly recommended); (3) further work appropriate to the major in either CHEM (044, 055, 056, and/or 065 or 066) or PHYS (013/015 and 017/018); (4) MATH 034. A chemical physics major will ordinarily include both semesters of physical chemistry (CHEM 044 and 055). A student may satisfy the requirement for laboratory work at the advanced level by completing a research thesis (CHEM 096 or 180), but in the absence of a research thesis, the major must include CHEM 065 or 066 or PHYS 082 in order to satisfy the requirement. Example of a special major in chemical physics: CHEM 022, 044, 055, 056, 065 or 066, 105; PHYS 007, 008, 013/015, 017/018 050, 111, 113.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria and Requirements for Honors Major in Chemical Physics</head><p>Acceptance criteria for the honors major in chemical physics are the same as for the honors major in chemistry, except that the faculty of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department and Physics and Astronomy are both actively involved in the decision. The honors chemical physics major has the same p. 169 set of requirements as the course chemical physics major, plus the requirement of four Honors Preparations in at least two departments must also be met, as follows: 1. One preparation (seminar) chosen from the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department. 2. One preparation (seminar) chosen from the Physics and Astronomy Department. 3. A two-credit Research Thesis carried out under the supervision of faculty from the Chemistry and/or Physics Departments. If, after following the procedures for applying for research in the department, an on-campus research mentor cannot be found, an Honors candidate should consult with the department's class advisor to explore alternate means of meeting the requirement. 4. One additional preparation chosen from the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department or from the Physics and Astronomy Department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comprehensive Requirements Chemistry</head><p>The senior comprehensive requirement consists of two components. The first component revolves around the department's Colloquium Series. During the academic year, speakers from other institutions visit our campus and present colloquia about their research. Each speaker recommends a small amount of published background material, which students and faculty read in preparation for the visit. These materials also serve as the basis for a "preview session," during which a small group of students presents background and context for the speaker's research. All senior majors are required to (1) attend the preview sessions, (2) review the suggested readings, (3) participate as a presenter in at least one preview session during the year, and (4) attend the actual colloquium presentations. The department offers two routes for satisfying the second component of the comprehensive requirement: a. Completion of a two-credit research thesis. Thesis must be based on research carried out during the senior year and, in most cases, the preceding summer as well. Honors majors must choose this option. b. Senior majors who do not write a research thesis must take a series of short exams administered throughout the academic year. These exams are based on the presentations made by speakers in the department's Colloquium Series and the literature readings that the speakers suggest. The following regulations will govern the exams:</p><p>1. The department will administer a minimum of 7 exams during each academic year. 2. An exam will generally be administered during the week following a speaker's presentation.</p><p>3. The exams will be designed such that prepared students should be able to answer the question(s) in 60 minutes or less. 4. Satisfactory performance on any 4 of the exams constitutes completion of this component of the comprehensive requirement. Finally, all students must attend at least one safety training session before the beginning of the senior year. These are offered one time per semester during the academic year and one time during the summer research session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biochemistry</head><p>The comprehensive requirement for biochemistry majors is the same as for chemistry majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemical Physics</head><p>The comprehensive requirement for chemical physics majors is the same as for chemistry majors. Occasionally, however, and on a case-bycase basis, the department is willing to negotiate a "hybrid" colloquium series for students completing a chemical physics special major. In consultation with both departments (chemistry and biochemistry and physics and astronomy), the student may draw up a list of colloquia pertinent to the special major and taken partly from the colloquium series of each department, and then participate in only these colloquia. However, in no event will the total number of talks for the year amount to fewer than the number of colloquia scheduled for the Chemistry and Biochemistry series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Credit</head><p>Students with a score of 5 on the Chemistry AP exam (taken their junior year in high school or later) or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Chemistry IB exam are eligible to take the Honors Placement exam. Satisfactory performance on the exam will qualify the student to take Foundations of Chemical Principles -Honors (Chemistry 010 HN). In the absence of an AP/IB score students should take the Chemistry Readiness Exam for access to the Honors Placement exam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>It is sometimes possible to receive Swarthmore credit for chemistry courses taken at other colleges and universities, provided that they were taken after the student matriculated at Swarthmore. If you wish to take a chemistry course on another campus and to receive Swarthmore credit for doing so, it is essential that you follow the proper procedure and that you plan in advance. It is also important to realize that not all courses will be eligible for credit. See the department website for details.</p></div>

However, substantial advance planning is required and interested students are encouraged to plan their Sophomore Plan carefully and consult with their academic advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research</head><p>The Chemistry and Biochemistry Department offers opportunities for students to engage in collaborative research with faculty members. Each fall semester, the department hosts a series of short presentations by faculty members, outlining the research projects available. This meeting, normally held in November, serves as the starting point for student participation in research during the following summer and/or academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Year Opportunities</head><p>The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three ways for students to engage in supervised research for academic credit, during the academic year: a. CHEM 094 (research project). Students may enroll in this course for either a half credit or a full credit. A half credit implies a time commitment of 5-7 hours per week, while a full credit implies a time commitment of 10-15 hours per week. b. CHEM 096 (research thesis). A full year (two credits) of CHEM 096 corresponds to a research thesis for course majors. c. CHEM 180 (honors research thesis). A full year (two credits) of CHEM 180 corresponds to a research thesis for honors majors. All students who enroll for at least one full credit of research during an academic year are required to participate in the department's Colloquium Series and present a poster sometime during the academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Conducted in Other Departments</head><p>Students writing a research thesis as part of their plan to satisfy the comprehensive requirement in a chemistry, biochemistry, or chemical physics major (see above) sometimes elect to carry out their research with a faculty member in an allied department, such as biology, physics and astronomy, or engineering. In general, such students have two options for how to register for courses corresponding to thesis: Option 1: Use the appropriate chemistry courses (two credits of CHEM 096 for a course thesis, or two credits of CHEM 180 for an honors thesis). Option 2: Use the course designations appropriate to the department in which the research is conducted. For research conducted with a biology faculty member, for instance, a student might enroll in one credit of BIOL 180 and one credit of BIOL 199 over the course of the senior year. Thesis must ultimately consist of at least two full credits.</p></div>

The curriculum includes training in the Greek and Latin languages at the Elementary, Intermediate, and Seminar levels. In addition, the department offers courses in Classical Hebrew and Sanskrit, and a range of courses on the history, literature, philosophy, religion, and cultural life of antiquity, including classes that explore the reception of the Classical past in later periods up to the present day. The rigorous training in Greek and Latin that is the hallmark of Swarthmore's Classics program has meant that the department enjoys remarkable success in producing students who go on to become leaders in the field. But because it is a truly interdisciplinary field, Classics also appeals to students with a wide variety of interests and career goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>Greek, Latin, Ancient History, and Classical Studies may be a student's major or minor subject in either the Course or the Honors Program. Three of these tracks (Greek, Latin, and ancient history) require advanced work in one of the original languages, while a major or minor in Classical Studies does not require but may include language study. Acceptance into one of the majors is dependent on promising work in relevant courses (normally indicated by A's and B's). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First course recommendations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>Greek: 8.5 credits required, including.5-credit senior course study (see below). Two credits must come from an honors seminar in Greek. Latin: 8.5 credits required, including.5-credit senior course study (see below). Two credits must come from an honors seminar in Latin. Classical Studies: 8.5 credits in Greek, Latin, Classical Studies or Ancient History including.5credit senior course study (see below). Two credits must come from a double-credit Classical Studies Capstone Seminar. Other disciplines on campus offer courses focused on aspects of classical antiquity (e.g. Art History, Philosophy, Political Science), and usually these will count toward completion of the major; students are advised to consult the chair for an accurate list of such courses. Ancient History: A major in Ancient History consists of four Ancient History courses (ANCH 031, 032, 042, 044, 056, or 066), four credits in Greek or Latin, two of which must be from an honors seminar, and.5-credit senior course study. A second seminar in Latin or Greek may be substituted for two Ancient History courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Greek: 5 credits in Greek. Latin: 5 credits in Latin. Classical Studies: 5 credits in Greek, Latin, Classical Studies or Ancient History. Ancient History: A course minor in Ancient History will consist of four courses in Ancient History, and an attachment to one of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culminating Exercise/Senior Course Study</head><p>The culminating experience for course majors in Greek, Latin, Classical Studies, and Ancient History is a.5-credit senior course study (GREK 098, LATN 098, CLST 098, ANCH 098). This independent study will be taken in the senior year to prepare for a graded oral exam taken in the spring with the Classics faculty. The oral exam will be based on a 2-credit seminar the student has completed. The students will submit their final exams and a paper from the seminars, which may be revised. The oral exams focus on the seminar as a whole as well as on the papers and written exams submitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Program in Classics</head><p>Greek and Latin: For a major in Greek or Latin, preparation for honors exams will normally consist of three seminars. A student minoring in Greek or Latin will take one external examination based on one seminar. Minors are, however, strongly encouraged to take more than one seminar, in order to be adequately prepared for the examination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 176</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classics</head><p>Classical Studies: Honors majors will complete 8 credits in Greek, Latin, Classical Studies, or Ancient History. They must complete three 2credit units of study, of which at least one must a double-credit Classical Studies Capstone Seminar. Minors will complete 5 credits in Greek, Latin, Classical Studies, or Ancient History including a double-credit Classical Studies Capstone Seminar. Ancient History: For a major in Ancient History, one preparation will be a seminar in either Latin or Greek. The other two preparations can be another seminar in the same language and a course-plusattachment, or two courses-plus-attachments. Students minoring in Ancient History will take three courses in Ancient History and add an attachment to one of them. That course-plusattachment will be the preparation for the external exam. No ancient language is required for this minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Honors Study</head><p>All honors majors and minors will select one paper from each seminar to be sent to the external examiner for that seminar. The student is free to submit the paper with minor or major revisions or no revisions at all. 4,000 words is the senior honors limit set by the college. Majors will, therefore, submit three such papers, and minors will submit one. Senior Honors Study is not required for students whose Honors preparation is a course with an attachment. The portfolio sent to external examiners will contain the seminar papers, together with syllabi and related materials, if any, from the instructors. A combination of (three-hour) written and (one-hour) oral exams will be the mode of external assessment for seminars. For course-plus-attachment, examiners will receive the course syllabus and the written product of the attachment. The exam will be just an oral assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Credit</head><p>The department will grant one credit (only) for one or more grades of 5 on the Latin AP, or the IB equivalent. This credit may be counted toward the major or minor in Latin or CLST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>A semester of off-campus study is usually possible for majors in classics. The department is a member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, and encourages interested students to participate, preferably in the fall semester of their junior year. The ICCS program offers traditional courses in Greek, Latin, Italian, Renaissance and Baroque art history, and a required two-credit course based on first-hand exposure to the archaeological and artistic monuments of the ancient world to be found in Rome, the Bay of Naples, and Sicily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research and Summer Study</head><p>Students may apply to the department for summer funding to support intensive summer courses in Latin and Greek, participation in archaeological field work abroad, internships connected with classics, or research projects undertaken with a member of the department. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life After Swarthmore</head><p>Many of our majors, and some minors, go on to pursue careers as professional classicists, at both the college and secondary levels. Swarthmore students well prepared in both Latin and Greek are competitive candidates for excellent graduate programs in classics, and in related fields such as medieval studies, English, history, and archaeology. In recent years Classics majors have been admitted to graduate programs at UNC-Chapel Hill, Penn, CUNY Graduate Center, Yale, Harvard, Duke, Princeton, University of Chicago, and Stanford. Others have successfully obtained teaching positions in secondary schools, both public and private; it is worth mentioning that there is a significant demand for teachers of Latin, particularly at the secondary level, and some states, including Pennsylvania, make it possible to teach Latin in public schools before obtaining professional certification. Most majors and minors have successfully pursued careers only tangentially related to classics, often after attending professional school. There are Swarthmore classicists in law, medicine, business, art, and music, and many other walks of life. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 017. Latin Poetry and the Modernists</head><p>This course explores Latin poems influential in the creation of the modernist verse of, in particular, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. The Latin texts are read in the original, for their own sake and in their own context. But we also explore the readings given them by the modernists, in an attempt to assess the uses and importance of their common literary tradition. Prerequisite: LATN 011 or its equivalent. Humanities. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 019. Roman Imperial Literature</head><p>This is an intermediate Latin course that will focus on reading a few key texts in order to give us insight into everyday life and social history in imperial Rome. The primary aim of the class is to improve students' skills of reading Latin. A secondary goal is to examine the lives of various social groups in imperial Rome, including slaves, recently freed men and women, and freeborn citizens. We will consider their attitudes on a number of issues still relevant today, including gender, grief, slavery, education, administration, love, justice and morality. The principal Latin texts will be Petronius' Satyrica, the letters of Pliny the Younger, and seleted documents such as inscriptions and papyri. Students with no previous Latin courses at the college level should consult the instructor before enrolling. Humanities. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 021. Republican Literature</head><p>In this course, we will be reading Book 1 of the Ab Urbe Condita by Livy as an example of Roman historiography in the Late Republic and Early Empire.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classics LATN 024. Latin Poetry and the Roman Revolution</head><p>The transformation of the Roman Republic into the monarchy of Augustus and the emperors was accompanied by a similar transformation in Roman poetry. In place of the staunch independence of Lucretius and the outrageous irreverence of Catullus, the new poets Propertius, Horace, and Vergil wrote poetry that responded directly or indirectly to the new political world. This course will explore one or more of these poets in depth, both within their political context and within the broader literary tradition. Students will read modern scholarly criticism, and develop their own critical approaches to writing about Latin poetry. They will also review basic Latin morphology and syntax, and build a stronger Latin vocabulary. The course is suitable for those with 3-4 years of High School Latin, or 1-2 years of Latin in college. Humanities. Writing course. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 025. Latin Poetry and the English Renaissance</head><p>Ben Jonson said that Shakespeare had "small Latin and less Greek," but all products of the Elizabethan grammar schools were steeped in Latin literature. This course will explore some of their seminal Latin texts, including Ovid's Amores; Horace's Odes, and Vergil's Eclogues. We will also read some of the English poems most directly influenced by these Latin works, by poets such as Donne, Spenser, Marvell, Lovelace, Herrick, Rochester, and Milton. Humanities. Writing course. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 027. Gender and Sexuality in Rome</head><p>This course will focus on Latin texts that reflect the sexual attitudes and behaviors of the ancient Romans and the gender roles that both shaped and were shaped by those attitudes. Among other topics, we will explore the roman institutions of marriage and the family. Conceptions of femininity and masculinity, and attitudes toward homosexuality. We will also engage with recent scholarship on gender and sexuality in antiquity from a wide range of critical perspectives. Our Latin texts will be drawn from several different genres, including graffiti, comedy, satire, love poetry, epic, letters, history and inscriptions. Humanities. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 028. Apuleius</head><p>Ready to be shocked, perplexed, and surprised at every turn? Try Apuleius' Metamorphoses (or Asinus Aureus), one of the earliest novels in Western literature. We will read the whole of this unconventional and mysterious work in English and books I and III in Latin, paying close attention to grammar, style, narratology, issues of genre and cultural context. Assignments will include articles dealing with literary criticism and background of the work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 029. Caligula and Claudius</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 033. Horace, Lyric and Literary Criticism</head><p>In this course we will read selected Odes and Epodes of Horace, as well as his Ars Poetica, a long hexameter poem that is one of seminal works in Western literary criticism. We will translate each poem and learn how to read it aloud, in the appropriate meter. For most poems we will also read Greek and Latin predecessors (in English), and for many poems we will also read English poems (and in one case a short story) influenced by Horace. For each poem of Horace we will also read at least three scholarly treatments, to stimulate our own critical responses. In reading Odes and Epodes the central issue will be what makes Horatian lyric so successful, along with questions of allegory and historical context. With the Ars Poetica the main question is the extent to which the poem is to be read as serious literary criticism or a parody. The course is intended for students at the advanced intermediate level in Latin, e.g. students who have received a 5 on the Latin AP or the equivalent, or who have taken at least intermediate Latin course at the college level. For questions about placement contact the instructor. Humanities. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LATN 034. Apuleius, Augustine, and the African Tradition</head><p>This course will explore the two most important Latin authors from the Roman province of Africa (roughly modern Tunisia). We will read selections in Latin from the Metamorphoses of Apuleius (also known as The Golden Ass) and from the Confessions of St. Augustine; we will read the complete books in English, as well as Peter Brown's famous biography, Augustine of Hippo. General topics will include: the peculiar qualities of "African Latin"; the place of Apuleius within the tradition of Greek and Roman novels; Platonism, the cult of Isis, and allegory in Apuleius; Augustine's purposes as a writer of "autobiography"; the place of Latin literature, Platonism, Manichaeism, and orthodox Christianity in Augustine's life and thought.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANCH 010. First-Year Seminar: Slavery in Ancient Greece and Rome</head><p>According to the ancient historian M. I. Finley, there have been only five genuine slave societies, and two of them were ancient: those of classical Greece and Rome (the other three are the United States, the Caribbean and Brazil). Slavery was deeply woven into the fabric of everyday life in both societies, since it functioned as the key principle of social organization and the dominant mode of production. This course will explore slavery as a social, political, legal, economic and cultural institution in both the Greek and Roman worlds. In order to consider the impact of slavery on state and society in ancient Greece and Rome we will reflect on a number of topics, including the origins of slavery; the sources, number, legal status and treatment of slaves; ancient attitudes towards slaves and slavery; the family life of slaves; the many forms of slave labor; slave revolts and resistance; and manumission and freedom. We will also consider slavery in the American south to help us situate ancient slavery in a broader historical context. Social sciences. Writing course. 1 credit.</p></div>

First-Year Seminar: Augustus and Rome</head><p>The great-nephew and adopted son of Julius Caesar rose to sole power in Rome after a series of civil wars culminating in the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra. He, along with his wife Livia, transformed Rome by creating a monarchical system that hid the real power behind the traditional institutions of the Roman republic. The process was supported and explained by a unique program of literary, artistic, and architectural revival. Ancient authors to be read (in English) may include Augustus himself, Livy, Vergil, Horace, Propertius and Ovid; we will also study the artistic and architectural projects that helped to communicate the ideologies of the new regime.

Vesuvius in 79 CE, Pompeii continues to captivate the Western imagination as the prototypic image of apocalyptic disaster. In this course we will use Pompeii to explore how we think about the past. We will study the physical remains of the ancient town in order to better understand social, political and commercial life in the Roman world. We will also consider the site's role in the development of archaeology as a discipline, from its origins in the eighteenth century as a scientific form of treasurehunting, up to the present day, when scholars are questioning the ethics of excavating at all. Finally, we will consider how the last days of Pompeii have been imagined and even romanticized in various forms of mass media, such as novels, films and television programs. Social sciences.

Alexander and the Hellenistic World</head><p>The conquests of Alexander the Great (332-323 BCE) as far as Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush mark one of the great turning points of ancient history. In his wake, what it meant to be Greek was radically changed, and a new world and culture emerged. In this course, we start with the life and campaigns of the Macedonian King, before turning to the Hellenistic world of his successors, following events down to the rise of Rome. Along with the political narrative, the course will consider Hellenistic poetry and historiography, archaeology and architecture, and the documentary evidence for daily life.

Democracy and Its Challenges: Athens in the Fifth Century</head><p>Using diverse primary sources (Thucydides' Histories, tragedy, comedy, and others), this course explores several aspects of classical Athenian culture: democratic institutions and ideology, social structure, religion, intellectual trends, and the major historical events that affected all of these and shaped the Greek world in the fifth and early fourth centuries B. . The course will involve an historical overview of this period, with a view to understanding the social, political and military aspects of the empire, as well as the religious and cultural conflicts that emerged between pagans and Christians and within the Church itself. We will draw on a wide range of p. 183 evidence to explore these themes, focusing on the close reading of works of ancient literature. Principal texts include the accounts of Christian martyrs, Eusebius, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Augustine. In order to enhance and complicate these accounts, we will also examine the archaeological remains of the empire, focusing on those recovered from the city of Rome, the important provincial centers of North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, and the frontiers of the empire. The class takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of history, and as such its main goals are to learn the history of the late Roman Empire and to interpret material and visual culture within its historical context.

The Talmud (Cross-listed as RELG 006B) This course introduces students to the academic study of the Babylonian Talmud (Bavli) -and through it, the academic study of Judaism. Through close, critical, and engaged readings of both brief selections and more lengthy pasages, the course not only explores the vast seas of the Bavli but also considers the Bavli's foundational place within Judaism and its importance to Jewish tradition. We begin by reading selections of the Talmud that both seek to situate the material in its immediate historical-literary contexts and to explore current points of relevance. We proceed to a close reading of one sugya (passage) and then spread out to examine some specific topics, focusing on rabbinic constructions of gender and rabbinic theology. The close readings of texts are supplemented by contemporary scholarship on the Talmud and the rabbis of antiquity. Finally, we read two contemporary mediations on Judaism that use the Talmud as their "anchor," their point of reference. Humanities. 1 credit. Eligible for RELG</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLST 011. First-Year Seminar: Talking Animals</head><p>Talking animals appear in diverse storytelling traditions in virtually all periods of recorded history. Often dismissed as nothing more than a playful device of children's literature, the granting of speech to voiceless animals is in fact a complex and potentially transgressive modification of the human-animal binary. What is it about talking animals that has proven so appealing to storytellers in such different cultural and historical contexts? Does the overt anthropomorphism of such p. 184 Classics representations preclude the possibility of serious ethical concern for real animals? This first-year seminar surveys the history and meanings of talking animals in ancient and modern storytelling traditions, from Aesop's fables to Disney films, from the Panchatantra to the graphic novels of Art Spiegelman.

In addition to plays by Aristophanes, Plautus, and Terence, and satirical poetry by Archilochus, Hipponax, Horace, and Juvenal, we will also explore the very idea of the "origins of comedy" from diverse perspectives. Questions about what motivates satirists to attack the behavior of their contemporaries and speculation about the quasi-religious roots of mockery have been fertile and contested areas of inquiry for centuries. We will read numerous thinkers (ancient and modern) who have proposed theories of the origins of comedy, including Aristotle, Freud, Bakhtin, Bergson, and Francis Cornford. And we will also encounter more recent comedians' reflections on their own birth and origins, including performers such as Richard Pryor, Howard Stern, Tina Fey, Louis CK, Sarah Silverman, Jon Stewart, and Lenny Bruce.

Roman Society and Identity: Food and War (Cross-listed as ANCH 021) This class will examine the interconnected roles of food and war in ancient Roman society. The first part of the semester will focus on the practicalities of the Roman diet. Building on this knowledge, we will explore how food and war together shaped the Roman sense of identity. Finally, we will study how food drove Roman military and political policy. The last seven weeks of the term will involve detailed case studies considering how issues directly related to food shaped the decisions and actions that enabled Rome to expand from the Italian peninsula to a Mediterranean empire in only 100 years, and then later tear itself apart in civil wars, only to emerge as a stable empire.

Greek Myth in Opera and Ballet</head><p>Greek myths have provided the subject matter for some of the most important and pivotal works in the history of opera and ballet. Just as Greek myth informs these arts, so too, opera and ballet transform these myths and the way they are viewed by modern audiences. New and daring productions of classical operas continue to transform both Greek mythology and its operatic incarnations. George Balanchine's Neoclassicism modernized ballet radically in the 20th century by drawing largely on Greek myth and classical aesthetic structures. In this course, we will study the relevant primary classical sources for operas and ballets such as Handel's Xerxes, Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, Berlioz's Les Troyens, Strauss's Electra, Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex, Balanchine's Apollo, Agon, and Orpheus. At the same time, we will study the operas and ballets themselves in their cultural context, and in the course of their performance history, paying special attention to recent productions.

What sets myth apart from history? In this survey of the mythology of Greco-Roman antiquity, we will investigate the diverse meanings of 'myth', its social functions, its origins, its history, and its contemporary relevance. Students will get a broad overview of Classical mythology through direct and close readings of primary sources (all in English translation), including such texts as Homer's Odyssey, plays by all three of the major Greek tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides), and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Our readings of ancient texts will be supplemented by study of ancient art and frequent investigations of modern responses to and theorizing of myth in diverse fields and media, including sociological, psychological, and philosophical treatises; modern poetry; visual arts; and film.

We will spend some time comparing films set in Rome to ancient and modern representations of the eternal city in literary and other visual media. But our primary focus will be on the ways in which cinematic visions of Rome reflect evolving cultural, political, and social conditions on both sides of the Atlantic. Specific topics to be explored include the popularity of classical themes in early silent films; Rome on screen during the rise and fall of fascism; neorealism and the shifting landscape of the city; the politics of Hollywood epics; and the dialectic between conceptions of antiquity and modernity as reflected in cinema.

The Cognitive Science Program has been developed to guide students who are interested in the interdisciplinary study of the mind, brain, and language, with emphases on formal structure, biological information processing, and computation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Course Recommendations</head><p>COGS 001. Introduction to Cognitive Science provides a multidisciplinary introduction to the field of cognitive science. It does this not only by exposing students to fundamental ideas and findings, but also by incorporating a substantial guest-scholar component: Typically, as many as ten different Swarthmore professors each conduct lecture/discussions during the semester. In this way, students get exposed to professors from many different departments involved in cognitive science. Note that this course is only offered in the fall semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>We conceive of cognitive science as a loose federation of six specific disciplines. The disciplines included are: artificial intelligence (including robotics), cognitive psychology, linguistics, mathematics and statistics, neuroscience, and philosophy. To demonstrate breadth, students majoring or minoring in cognitive science are required to complete credits in at least three of these six disciplines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Six credits are required for the minor. One of these is a required introductory course, COGS 001. The remaining 5 credits are to be distributed across three different disciplines of cognitive science. That is, 2 credits of listed courses, from 3 of the 6 disciplines, must be completed with the exception that in one-and only one-of the three disciplines, a single "focus course" may be used to meet the breadth requirement. Students who wish to use 2 credits in mathematics and statistics as one of their disciplines for a cognitive science minor must choose 2 credits from a single sub-area of mathematics and indicate its relevance to at least one of the two other disciplines chosen for the minor.</p><p>The list of courses currently approved as cognitive science courses is rather selective because it is intended to focus students on the most essential cores of cognitive science within each discipline. Many more courses, taught on campus, are closely relevant to cognitive science. This list is subject to periodic re-evaluation. In addition to fulfilling the breadth requirements, students must indicate one cognitive science field in which they have substantial depth of preparation. Such depth can be documented by completion of at least 4 courses from within a cognitive science discipline (even if some of those courses are not directly related to cognitive science). Alternative curricular and extracurricular ways of fulfilling the depth requirement may be discussed with the coordinator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>To complete an honors minor in cognitive science, students must complete all requirements listed above. The honors preparation for the minor will normally be a 2-credit unit approved by the relevant department from courses listed for the minor. The minor preparation must be within a discipline that is not the student's honors major.</p><p>Students are encouraged to develop an appropriate preparation in consultation with the coordinator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Major</head><p>Typically, the program for a special major in cognitive science involves fulfilling all requirements for the minor and then adding 4 or more cognitive science related courses including a thesis, bringing the total number of credits up to p. 191</p></div>

Note that these additional credits may include courses not listed as eligible for the minor or major, subject to the approval of the program coordinator. Students who special major in cognitive science are normally required to do a 1credit senior thesis (COGS 090). though other formats for completing thesis requirement exist, and students may elect to complete a 2-credit thesis with the approval of a thesis advisor and the program coordinator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Special Major</head><p>An honors special major in cognitive science is possible. While fulfilling the requirements of the minor, students must take four 2-credit honors preparations. One of these preparations is a Senior Honors Thesis (COGS 180). The other three preparations must be distributed across two or more disciplines within cognitive science. The nature of these honors preparations will be determined by the standard practices of the relevant departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis / Culminating Exercise</head><p>Minors who wish to get formal research experience may choose to complete a 1-credit thesis or a 2-credit honors thesis in cognitive science during their senior year. Non-honors theses in cognitive science will normally be examined by Cognitive Science Committee members from within at least two different departments. The major in comparative literature is designed for those students who have a love for literature and a strong desire to write, and who are interested in literary critical research. This major is not for everyone: it assumes a fair degree of discipline, independence, and self-motivation on the part of the student, especially in the development and writing of thesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major in Course</head><p>Ten credits in two or more literatures in the original languages, including a substantial concentration of work---normally four or five courses---in each of the literatures of specialization. The Senior thesis (described in the section on "Thesis/Culminating Exercise" section, below) does not count toward these 10 credits. Students working in French, German, or Spanish may propose one course in translation (or LITR course) from that language. Because of the special demands of Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and (to a lesser extent) Russian, students working in any of these languages may propose a program based on attachments (in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese or Russian) to literature courses taught in translation.</p><p>A 1-or 2-credit thesis of 35 to 40 pages for one credit, 50-60 pages for two credits, covering work in at least two languages (see "Thesis/Culminating Exercise," below). An oral comprehensive examination, of 1 hour, during the final exam period of the senior year, based on thesis and courses and seminars that the major comprises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>Four 2-credit preparations---3 seminars and a 2credit thesis of 50 to 60 pages---in at least two literatures in the original language. One of the preparations may be used as an independent minor (in Russian or Theater, for instance) if the minor's departmental requirements have been met. Minors requiring unrelated preparations such as biology or psychology are not allowed. All four honors preparations are necessary components of the comparative literature honors major.</p><p>A 3-hour written examination for each preparation, prepared by the external examiner, and a 30-minute oral based on the contents of the written examination, as well as an oral thesis examination with two Honors examiners</p></div>

At this time, the student will submit a general thesis outline, and will propose two faculty advisors from appropriate departments. In some cases, the committee may ask that thesis be written in whole or in part in the language of a literature studied other than English.</p><p>The final draft of thesis will be submitted no later than April 30 of the senior year, and it may be due earlier for Honors Majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Process for the Major and the Minor</head><p>Successful completion of an advanced literature course in each of the literatures of the student's program of study is a prerequisite for admission into the Honors Program. A minimum grade of B is required. Students applying for the (Honors) major will submit to the comparative literature coordinator a proposal of integrated study that sets forth the courses and/or seminars to be taken and the principle of coherence on which the program of study is based. The student will also submit a 6-to 10-page writing sample from a previously completed course. The committee will then review the proposal and the essay to advise the student.</p><p>In lieu of a traditional course, the Comparative Literature Committee will consider proposals for one or more research papers written as course attachments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample: Comparative Literature Course Major</head><p>The courses and seminars that compose the comparative literature major's formal field of study will naturally differ with each major. To give some sense of the range of possibilities available, a series of sample programs is offered. Computer science is the study of algorithms and their implementation. This includes the study of computer systems; methods to specify algorithms (for people and computer systems); and the formulation of theories and models to aid in the understanding and analysis of the properties of algorithms, computing systems, and their interrelationship.</p><p>The computer science curriculum is designed to provide students with a flexible set of computing choices that can be tailored to satisfy various interests and depths of study. All courses emphasize the fundamental concepts of computer science, treating today's languages and systems as current examples of the underlying concepts. The computer science laboratory provides up-to-date software and hardware facilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>The Computer Science Department offers course majors and minors and honors majors and minors. Students interested in any of these options are encouraged to meet with the chair of the Computer Science Department as early as possible in their college career. Students who are interested in a computer science major or minor are encouraged to take CPSC 021, CPSC 031 and CPSC 035 sometime in their first four semesters at Swarthmore. The minor in computer science is designed for students who desire a coherent introduction to the core topics in the field. Students completing the minor will possess intellectual skills that are useful in many disciplines. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>The following are the requirements for a major in computer science: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>The minor in computer science provides students with a well-rounded background in computer science sufficient to develop significant, creative applications and to keep up with the rapid changes in the field. The following are the requirements for a minor in computer science: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>The requirements for acceptance into the minor are the same as for acceptance into the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>An honors major in computer science must complete the regular course major requirements. The honors major includes three honors preparations: an honors thesis and two separate 2credit honors preparations. The following will be submitted to external examiners for evaluation: 2. An honors thesis to be read by an external examiner and examined in an oral examination. Thesis will report on a research experience involving the student under the supervision of a faculty member (at Swarthmore or elsewhere). It is expected that most of the research or scholarly groundwork will be completed before the fall semester of the senior year, either by one credit of work in the spring semester of the junior year or full-time summer work. Students will register for at least one credit of thesis work (CPSC 180) to complete the research and write thesis in the fall of their senior year. It is recommended that thesis be completed by the end of the fall semester. Credits earned in CPSC 180 do not count towards completion of the course major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>To be eligible for an Honors major in Computer Science, a student must meet the course major acceptance requirements. In addition, students must earn a B average in all courses used to complete the course major, including cross-listed electives and required courses in Mathematics and Statistics. A student previously accepted into the Honors Program but not maintaining this GPA in CPSC courses might be, by department decision, asked to withdraw from the Honors Program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>An honors minor in computer science will consist of completion of the course minor and one 2-credit preparation.</p><p>The following will be submitted to external examiners for evaluation: One 2-credit preparation to be selected from the combinations of courses listed under Approved Preparations. This 2-credit preparation will be examined by a 3-hour written examination and an oral examination. The exams will focus on a single course in each preparation (the focus course), with the second course (the breadth course) providing additional background in the general area of the focus course. In certain circumstances, the Computer Science Department may be willing to consider other groupings of courses, seminars, or the inclusion of a specific Special Topics course (CS91). These are approved on a case-by-case basis by the chair. Students are required to petition for approval by September 15 of their senior year. If the required courses and preparations would not satisfy a course minor, additional computer science courses must be taken to meet course minor requirements. In all cases, the Computer Science Department must approve the student's plan of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>To be eligible for an Honors minor in Computer Science, a student must meet the course minor acceptance requirements. In addition, students must earn a B average in all courses used to complete the course minor, including cross-listed electives and required courses in Mathematics and Statistics. A student previously accepted into the Honors Program but not maintaining this GPA in CPSC courses might be, by department decision, asked to withdraw from the Honors Program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approved Preparations for the Honors Major and Minor</head><p>Honors majors must complete two 2-credit honors preparations and honors minors must complete one 2-credit honors preparation. Each preparation will contain one Focus course and one Breadth course selected the same set. For example, CPSC 043 and CPSC 044 is a valid course preparation pairing since both courses are in Set 2, but CPSC 041 and CPSC 044 is not a valid pairing. The Focus course for each preparation must be different, and the two preparations must be comprised of at least three distinct courses. Honors majors may choose both of their 2-credit preparations from the same set, or may choose one 2-credit preparation from one set and the other from a different set.</p><p>The following are the approved sets of course groupings. All courses may not be available to all students and will depend on the schedule of course offerings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Process and Acceptance Criteria for Majors/Minors</head><p>In addition to the process described by the Dean's Office and the Registrar's Office for how to apply for a major, students should complete a departmental form, found on the departmental website, outlining how they intend to fulfill the requirements for their intended major, minor, honors major or honors minor. Successful completion of at least two Computer Science courses, including CPSC 031 or CPSC 035, is ordinarily required to be admitted as a Computer Science major or minor. Students who are deferred from the major or minor will be re-evaluated upon completion of additional Computer Science courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>Students who receive a 4 or 5 on the Computer Science Advanced Placement exam will be awarded one (1) credit upon successful completion of a Computer Science course taken at Swarthmore. Upon completion of a CS course at Swarthmore, students must notify the department in order to receive AP credit. Students who are placed out of CPSC 021 with AP credit need to take only seven <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(7)</ref> additional courses in computer science to complete the major, and five <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(5)</ref> additional courses in computer science to complete the minor. Students should consult with any Computer Science faculty member about placement out of courses in the introductory sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Science Placement</head><p>The computer science placement exam is required for all students who think that they may place out of the introductory computer science course (CPSC 021). Students who want to start with CPSC 021 do not need to take the placement exam. Students who think they may place out of both CPSC 021 and CPSC 035 should take the placement exam and also contact the department placement coordinator about their placement.</p><p>Incoming first year students should take the placement exam during fall orientation week.</p><p>Students who do not take it during orientation can contact the CS departmental office to schedule a time to take the exam. Students who do not take CPSC 021 must take the placement exam before registering for CPSC 031 or CPSC 035. For more information see: https://www.swarthmore.edu/computerscience/computer-science-placement-exam</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students planning to major or minor in computer science may opt to study abroad for one semester or a whole year. Because some advanced courses in computer science are offered in only alternate years, some selections will be unavailable to some students. The Computer Science Department should preapprove all courses of study abroad in advance of the student's departure. The department will credit appropriate courses based on sufficient evidence of work completed presented by the student upon returning to Swarthmore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life After Swarthmore</head><p>Graduate School Students interested in graduate study in computer science will be well prepared with a computer science major. Some graduate programs will also accept students who have majored in mathematics or engineering and completed a sufficient number and selection of computer science courses. The choice of the appropriate major and computing courses will depend on the student's interests and should be made in consultation with the chair of the Computer Science Department. Other majors are also reasonable for students with special interests. For example, a major in linguistics or psychology might be appropriate for a student interested in artificial intelligence or cognitive science. In such cases, students should consult with the chair of the department as early as possible to ensure that they take the necessary mathematics and computing courses for graduate work in computer science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computer Science Courses</head><p>A grade of C or better is required in order to fulfill any CPSC prerequisite listed below. In mathematics and theoretical computer science, we often consider classes of objects (say graphs, circuits or matrices) and we'd like to know if there are objects that have certain nice properties. One way to show these nice objects exist is to look at a random object, and show it has the nice property with nonzero probability. If this is true, there must be some object with this nice property. This is the Probabilistic Method in a nutshell. It has become an essential tool for understanding structure of lots and lots of things in theoretical computer science and combinatorics, even in problems and applications which involve no randomness at all. This class will start from the ground up, first introducing discrete probability theory, then covering the probabilistic method in detail: how it works, extensions, and most of all lots of applications. We'll also spend a few weeks discussing NP-Completeness and randomized algorithms. Group 1 course. Prerequisite: CPSC 035 and MATH 029, or permission of the instructor. Natural sciences and engineering. Lab work required 1 credit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CPSC 056. Computer Animation</head><p>The goal of this course is to give students a foundation for programming animated and interactive graphics. In particular, we will "look under the hood" at the algorithms used by game engines and modeling tools to create authorable, interactive characters and special effects. Labs will give students hands on experience implementing algorithms in C++ as well as opportunities to derive their own unique animations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CPSC 093. Directed Reading and/or Research Project</head><p>A qualified student may undertake a program of extra reading and/or a project in an area of computer science with the permission of a staff member who is willing to supervise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CPSC 099. Senior Comprehensive</head><p>For the culminating senior capstone experience, students will create a poster based on a project from either a course taken in the Computer Science Department at Swarthmore or from a summer research project with a Swarthmore CS faculty member. Seniors will present their work at a poster session to be held late in the Fall semester of their senior year. The Chair will send out information at the start of the Fall semester detailing the scheduling of the poster session and other relevant dates. This course must be satisfactorily completed in order to complete the major. 0 credit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>The economics curriculum is structured so that students achieve the following goals: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>To graduate as a course major, a student must: 1. Have at least eight credits in economics. 2. Meet theory and statistics requirements. Note: Course students should take these courses before the second semester of their senior year to be prepared for the comprehensive examination. Note also that some seminars and courses have ECON 011, 021, and/or 031 as prerequisites.</p><p>3. In the senior year, pass the comprehensive examination given early in the spring semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comprehensive Examination</head><p>Course majors must pass the Comprehensive Examination which is given in January or February of each year and covers theory and statistics requirements. The exam is given only once a year and students must take it at Swarthmore College. All students will take the examination in their senior year. The only exception is for students who are graduating early; those students can take the comprehensive exam in the spring semester prior to their final semester at Swarthmore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria: The Course Program</head><p>Except for students who have been granted advanced standing, applicants should have: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>Typically, a student who wants to major in the Honors Program first applies for the program through the Sophomore Plan. In the Sophomore Plan, the student should indicate the intention to apply for the Honors Program and should list all preparations that the student plans to take as part of that program. The student would usually take at least one preparation in the junior year. Approval of a student's Honors Program must be granted by the department. Changes of major and/or honors status can be made at any time by picking up forms and instructions in the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Honors Exam for Majors and Preparations</head><p>Honors majors in economics must complete 3 preparations. All preparations in economics consist of 2 credits. Most preparations involve taking a 2 credit seminar, but some preparations may combine a course and a 1 credit seminar. A complete list of preparations, with their prerequisites, appears below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culminating Exercise</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Process Notes for the Major</head><p>Normally, any student planning to major in economics, whether in the Course or Honors Program, applies for the major by submitting a Sophomore Plan in the spring of the Sophomore year. (Except for students who have been granted advanced standing, applicants should have completed at least two economics courses at Swarthmore.) A student who will be away that semester should submit the paper before leaving at the end of the fall semester. In the Sophomore Plan, students should state their reasons for wanting to major in economics along with any associated considerations, and they should indicate the courses and seminars essential to their plan of study. Through the paper, students are preregistered for seminars offered over the following two years; thus, students are strongly urged to select their seminars carefully. Moreover, if a student decides to change seminars, the department's program coordinator should be informed as soon as possible, since entry into oversubscribed seminars is first-come, first-served, with seniors in the Honors Program having absolute priority. Economics course materials as well as a completed copy of the Economics Department Credit Transfer form when seeking credit for business courses completed away from Swarthmore. Students can only apply one course in Accounting toward their 8 credit requirement in Economics. Business courses taken at the University of Pennsylvania or other universities beyond this cannot be counted toward the eight credits required for an Economics major. They can be included as part of the 32 credits required for graduation but students can receive no more than two credits in total for such courses. The only exception to this rule is for students who take the equivalent of ECON 033 (Financial Accounting) at another school; the course is not counted against the two allowed business credits, and can be counted as part of the 8 credits needed for the Economics major. No credit is given for night school classes at Wharton. Swarthmore students can get business credit (subject to the above restrictions), but not economics credit, for finance courses taken outside of the tri-College system. If, however, a student has taken Financial Economics at Swarthmore (ECON 022 or 122), or a similar course elsewhere, no credit will be granted for additional, substantially overlapping, finance courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Certification</head><p>For economics majors, the College offers teacher certification in social studies or citizenship through a program approved by the state of Pennsylvania.

First-Year Seminar: Greed</head><p>In 1776, Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations: "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest..Every individual.. neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much is is promoting it..he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 214</head><p>The Educational Studies Department at Swarthmore engages students in the investigation of educational theory, policy, research, and practice from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. We prepare students to work in educational research or policy, to enter the teaching profession, and/or to pursue graduate study in educational studies or a related field. The department encourages undergraduates to think critically and creatively about the processes of teaching and learning and about the place of education in society. The department is also committed to preparing students to address education-related needs in an era of rapidly increasing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity and technological change and to develop students' abilities to participate fully in civic, cultural, and economic arenas. Both introductory and upper level courses in the department draw on theory and research in anthropology, economics, history, political science, psychology, and sociology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>Students interested in Educational Studies at Swarthmore may design an honors or course major in Educational Studies; a special major in Educational Studies and another discipline; or an honors or course minor in Educational Studies. Students also have the option to pursue teacher certification.</p><p>First course recommendation EDUC 014F: First-year seminar: Pedagogy and Power: An Introduction to Education -Schools are complex institutions, central to any society. Schools are sites of teaching and learning, places where inequalities are maintained or challenged, and institutions within which children and their teachers live out the daily realities of national political agendas. This course explores major questions in educational policy, theory, and practice. Students read original source materials from multiple disciplines, write, discuss, and complete fieldwork in area schools as an introduction to the interdisciplinary and expansive field of educational studies. EDUC14 or the first-</p><p>year seminar EDUC 014F, is required for students pursuing teacher certification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>An Educational Studies major includes at least 8 credits in Educational Studies. In their sophomore plan, we recommend that prospective majors clarify a focus within the department. Foci might include policy, social and cultural foundations of education, or the study of learning. All majors must include a methods course in their program as preparation for their senior thesis. Methods courses can include any of the following three courses:</p><p>• EDUC 65 Qualitative Methods for Educational Change • SOCI 16B Research Methods in Social Science • EDUC 21 Educational Psychology The culminating exercise for the major is normally a 1-2 credit senior thesis, completed in the senior year. Prerequisites for entry into the major include EDUC 014, Pedagogy and Power: Introduction to Education and one additional course in the department. EDUC 092: Practice Teaching and EDUC 093: Curriculum and Methods Seminar are not counted as part of the major. All majors must take a methods course. The culminating exercise for a major is normally a 1-2 credit thesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Special Major</head><p>In special majors involving Educational Studies, the student combines work in Educational Studies with work in another academic department or interdisciplinary program. Pre-established programs have been created with the following disciplines: biology, chemistry, computer science, English literature, French, German, history, Latin American and Latino studies, linguistics, mathematics/statistics, music, peace and conflict studies, physics, political science, psychology, Russian, sociology/anthropology, and Spanish. Special majors with other disciplines can be p. 215</p></div>

In the case of all special majors involving Educational Studies, both departments collaborate in advising the student. The special major usually requires 10 to 12 credits, at least 5 of which must be in Educational Studies. All special majors are required to complete a thesis or a comprehensive examination integrating work in their two fields of study. Special majors are encouraged to take EDUC 065 Educational Research for Social Change in the spring of their sophomore or junior year. This course, which can be taken for 0.5 or 1 credit, prepares students to write a special major thesis in their senior year. Each partnering department or program provides specific course requirements for the completion of a special major and for thesis/comprehensive exam, details of which may be found on the departmental website. If special majors pursue teaching certification, EDUC 092: Curriculum and Methods Seminar and EDUC 093: Practice Teaching are not counted as part of the special major requirements. The prerequisite for acceptance to the special major program is successful completion of EDUC 014: Pedagogy and Power: Introduction to Education and one other course in the department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>The Educational Studies minor provides students with the opportunity to choose from a variety of Educational Studies courses and prompts students to reflect on the overarching theme of their experience in the department. The Educational Studies minor requires at least 5 credits in Educational Studies. Students identify a focus when they apply for the minor and then explain how their coursework supports this focus. Possible foci include but are not limited to Teaching and Practice, Educational Policy, Educational Psychology, School and Society, Special Education, Urban Education, Environmental Education, and Literacy. The prerequisite for acceptance to the Educational Studies minor program is EDUC 014. Minors may also pursue teacher certification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Program</head><p>The department supports the Honors Program for majors, special majors, and minors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>Students may complete an Honors major in Educational Studies. The Honors major requires at least 9 credits in the department, including 3 honors preparations and one methods class from the courses listed in the course major. One preparation must be a 2-credit honors thesis, normally completed over both semesters of the senior year. The other two preparations will normally consist of 2-credit seminars, although a course and attachment may be possible as an alternative. Prerequisites for admissions to the Honors major include EDUC 014, Pedagogy and Power: Introduction to Education, one additional course in the department, and an average of B+ in their courses in the department. EDUC 092: Practice Teaching and EDUC 093: Curriculum and Methods Seminar are not counted as part of the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Special Majors</head><p>Students may opt to pursue an Honors Special major in Educational Studies and another department or interdisciplinary program. Preestablished special majors have been created with the following disciplines: English, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology/anthropology. Honors special majors with other disciplines can be pursued with the approval of both Educational Studies and the partnering department or program. The Honors special major, like the Course special major, requires a total of 10 to 12 credits, at least 5 of which must be in Educational Studies. However, Honors special majors must also include 4 Honors preparations in their program. These must be distributed as follows:</p><p>• 3 (2-credit) Honors preparations, at least 1 or 2 of which must be in Educational Studies and 1 or 2 in the other discipline. Most honors preparations in Educational Studies consist of a 2-credit honors seminar. It is possible to complete a 1-credit Educational Studies course with a 1-credit attachment as an honors preparation. Availability of this option is limited and designed with a supervising faculty member from the Educational Studies Department.</p><p>• 1 Honors preparation through the completion of a double-credit thesis. This thesis normally serves to integrate the fields of the special major and is supervised by faculty members in both departments of the special major. Honors special majors are encouraged to take EDUC 065 Qualitative Research Methods: Educational Research for Social Change in the spring of their sophomore or junior year. This course, which can be taken for 0.5 or 1 credit, prepares students to write the special major thesis in their senior year. Each partnering department or program also provides specific requirements for the completion of an Honors special major, which may be found on the departmental website. Students are expected to have a B+ average in their Educational Studies courses to complete an Honors special major. Additionally, students must complete external examinations upon completion of the program. The prerequisite for acceptance to the Honors Educational Studies Major Program is EDUC 014, p. 216</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Studies</head><p>2 additional Educational Studies courses of the student's choice, and an average grade of B+ in all Educational Studies courses at the time of application. Honors majors may also pursue teacher certification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minors</head><p>Students may opt to pursue an Honors minor in educational studies. The Honors minor requires five credits in educational studies, including EDUC 014 (1 credit), one Honors seminar (2 credits), and two additional credits of the student's choice. Students are expected to have a B+ average in their educational studies courses and to complete the external Honors examination. The prerequisite for acceptance to the Honors educational studies minor program is EDUC 014. Honors minors may also pursue teacher certification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Honors Program Details External Examinations</head><p>As part of the Honors Program, students complete an examination for each completed preparation. Thesis preparation for Honors major and special major students involves a 45-60-minute individual oral exam on their work with an outside examiner. Examination for Honors preparations other than thesis includes a written and an oral component. An external examiner sets the written portion of the exam. Exam questions are based on the seminar syllabus. The exam may include a problem set, a case, and/or additional readings relevant to the work students have undertaken in that preparation. These materials may be sent to the student in advance of the written exam. All Educational Studies Honors exams are written in the Educational Materials Center. A maximum of 5 hours is allowed for completion of each exam. Intellectual Autobiography All Honors students (majors, special majors, and minors) in Educational Studies write a short intellectual autobiography that is sent to the Honors examiner. Students may also choose to send to the examiner a paper from an Honors seminar. The autobiography and the paper are not formally evaluated by the examiner; they are intended to familiarize the examiner with the student's experience and background in Educational Studies, since each student in each seminar brings different disciplinary content to his/her understanding of the material. The autobiography is written in the spring of the senior year under the supervision of the department chair in Educational Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Opportunities and Experiences</head><p>Engaging in research is integral to students' work in Educational Studies. Participation in research supports students to understand the importance of research to theory, policy-making, and practice.</p><p>In each course and seminar in the department, students are introduced to qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research, which they use to work directly with questions addressed in coursework. Students not only read original research, but they also collect and analyze data using appropriate methods in each course. Students are strongly encouraged to take EDUC 065: Qualitative Research Methods: Educational Research for Social Change in the spring of their sophomore or junior year. This course, which can be taken for 0.5 or 1 credit, prepares students to write a thesis in their senior year. It can be used as the required methods course for special majors with Sociology and Anthropology, and as the required methods course for Educational Studies majors. As a culminating activity in the department, all majors and most special majors write a thesis. Students select the focus of their thesis work; theses typically build on students' course work and methods training in Educational Studies and the other department comprising their special major. Some students conduct independent research or serve as research assistants on faculty members' projects. Students may begin working as research assistants as early as the summer following their first year. Many such collaborations have led to student-faculty co-authored conference presentations, articles, and chapters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieldwork and Service-Learning Opportunities</head><p>Bridging research and practice is a goal for courses and seminars in the department. Many courses and seminars have a distinctive fieldwork component. Course descriptions indicate if a course involves a field placement. Depending on transportation options, students can request fieldwork placements in urban, suburban, or rural communities and choose from public, charter, or private school settings. Students are encouraged to use the field placements as an opportunity to explore a range of school and population types. A list of school sites may be found on the department's website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>Students requesting credit in Educational Studies for course or fieldwork done abroad (or at another institution in the U.S.) must take EDUC 014: Pedagogy and Power: Introduction to Education. This course may be taken before or after the study abroad credit is completed, but the credit will only be accepted after EDUC 014 has been completed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDUC 023A. Special Education: Adolescents with Special Needs</head><p>In this half credit attachment to EDUC 023, Adolescence, students will focus on meeting the needs of diverse adolescent learners. In particular, students will examine the unique psycho-social interactions between adolescents receiving special education services, their parents and the educators who work with them. Students will also explore strategies for addressing specific cognitive and academic needs of these adolescents in literacy, content area learning, and transitions out of school. This course will examine urban schools and classrooms in the United States from a sociological perspective. Students are introduced to theory and method of the sociological study of education, and the core issues taken up in the field, such as social stratification and mobility, and educational equity and opportunity. Emphasis will be placed on the influence of local, state, and federal policies on the social organization of schools, relationships among social actors within these institutions, and patterns of inequality in what students learn. Variation among these issues will be primarily explored through race and ethnicity, citizenship status and native language, gender and sexual orientation, and disability/ability. The course will conclude with applying knowledge in the field to policy and practice at the PreK-12 and postsecondary level. Social sciences. Writing course. 1 credit. Fall 2019. Nelson.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDUC 064. Comparative Education</head><p>This course examines key issues and themes in education as they play out in local and global contexts around the world. We use case studies to explore the roles of local, national, and international actors and organizations in the construction of educational policy and practice. Topics will include immigration and schooling, equity, curriculum goals and constructs, and education in areas of conflict </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDUC 067. Fight for #PhlEd: Urban Educational and Environmental Justice</head><p>This course examines urbanism and environmental justice as seen through the lens of urban education politics. Course readings, discussions and related field experiences will focus on key issues and debates confronting urban education as it relates to urban development and environmental sustainability and justice. We will draw on theories and approaches from critical geography and critical theories of race and political economy to examine research, policy, pedagogy and social movements as vehicles for addressing the challenges that shape the conditions of teaching, learning and community development. We will focus on -and try to build alongside -the city of Philadelphia, its racially and ethnically diverse communities, and its public schools. Drawing on anthropology, sociology, history, urban studies, and cultural studies, this course challenges popular notions of "urban education" rooted in deficit thinking. We consider "urban" as a lens for conducting a spatial analysis of inequalities, and "education" as an expansive concept that indexes the formal institution of schools, as well as informal youth culture. We also consider education's dual role in exacerbating inequalities, and its potential as sites of resistance, refusal, and liberation. Course topics include: market-based school reform, pedagogies of resistance, youth culture and the semiotics of language and fashion, school to prison pipeline, and segregation and integration. This course focuses on Philadelphia as a case study, and includes fieldwork, films, guest speakers, and field trips to enhance the learning process. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Studies EDUC 152. Immigration and Education</head><p>In this research seminar, students will study intersections between immigration and education policy and practice in the United States. Through readings on historical and contemporary immigration and schooling, students will consider the shifting goals and approaches to educating immigrant youth in the U.S. and the ways in which immigration policies impact the everyday experiences and future prospects of immigrant youth at different ages and educational stages. Students will conduct a literature review on an immigrant population of their choice and will develop qualitative research skills through a group research project on current immigration and education policy. Students' research will culminate in a short film, piece of public scholarship, or journal article, depending on students' interests and strengths. Drawing on a racial-economic analytic framework we will study the geo-political formation of U.S. cities (Philadelphia serves as our primary case study), policy and social movement. We will also look at urban education policy and pedagogical practices. With this literature as a foundation, students will receive training in theories and methods of critical, participatory action research (CPAR). Over the course of the semester students work in small groups with a Philadelphia school or an educationfocused based organization (CBO). In consultation with their partnering organization, student groups will develop and implement a CPAR project. Prerequisite: EDUC 014 and an additional course in the 060s Recommended: EDUC 068 and EDUC 041 2 credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDUC 167. Education, Race, and the Law</head><p>This course explores the struggle for racial equality in education through examining federal and state lawsuits. We will look at changing ideologies about race and inequality, moving from the notion of "separate but equal" in Plessy v. Ferguson, to "separate as inherently unequal" in Brown v. Board of Education, to today's school funding lawsuits which strategically sidestep the use of race as a legal argument. Students will develop theoretical frameworks, drawn from the fields of legal anthropology and critical race theory. Since this is a community-based learning (CBL) course, fieldwork and research is a major component of the course. In addition to readings, assignments, and class time, students will conduct interviews with lawyers and judges from past school funding lawsuits. Students will also partner with local groups that are active in the campaign for school funding to learn about and contribute to advancing racial equality in education. The professional practice of engineering requires creativity and confidence in applying scientific knowledge and mathematical methods to solve technical problems of ever-growing complexity. The pervasiveness of advanced technology within our economic and social infrastructures demands that engineers more fully recognize and take into account the potential economic and social consequences that may occur when significant and analytically well-defined technical issues are resolved. A responsibly educated engineer must not only be in confident command of current analytic and design techniques but also have a thorough understanding of social and economic influences and an abiding appreciation for cultural and humanistic traditions. Our program supports these needs by offering each engineering student the opportunity to acquire a broad yet individualized technical and liberal education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>As stated in the introduction of this catalog, Swarthmore seeks to help its students realize their full intellectual and personal potential, combined with a deep sense of ethical and social concern. Within this context, the Engineering Department seeks to graduate students with a broad, rigorous education, emphasizing strong analysis and synthesis skills. Our graduates will be well rounded and understand the broader impacts of engineering. They will have the skills to adapt to new technical challenges, communicate effectively, and collaborate well with others. The Engineering Department and its students provide to the College community a unique perspective that integrates technical and nontechnical factors in the design of solutions to multifaceted problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>Graduates of our program will be able to demonstrate the ability to:</p><p>• Be flexible and resourceful, able to learn and apply new knowledge, and to adapt successfully to novel circumstances and challenges.</p><p>• Communicate and work effectively with people with a broad variety of backgrounds at both a technical and nontechnical level.</p><p>• Apply engineering principles and methodology to the design and analysis of systems and to the solution of a wide variety of problems.</p><p>• Consider scientific, technologic, ethical, societal, economic, political and/or environmental issues in a local or global context, as appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>Engineering majors must complete requirements from two categories: (1) 12 engineering credits and (2) 8 credits in math and science, at least 3 in math and 3 in science. No courses taken at Swarthmore and intended to satisfy these departmental requirements may be taken credit/no credit, except those taken fall semester in the first year. The requirements are detailed below, with math and science discussed separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Math and Science Requirement</head><p>To fulfill the math and science requirement for the engineering major, students must receive at least eight credits in math and science (for this purpose science is defined as biological, chemical, and physical sciences). All of the courses used to fulfill the requirement must be acceptable for the minimal major in the offering department. The science courses must include two credits of college level physics, and one credit of either biology or chemistry. All but one of the science courses must include a substantial laboratory component. In their first semester students typically will take 1.0 credit of engineering, choosing between ENGR 011 and ENGR 015 in accordance with their interests and high school preparation. A student with a very full schedule in the first semester can also opt to take no engineering courses until the spring without falling behind in degree requirements. Mechanics (ENGR 006) is usually taken in the spring of the first year. In the fall of the sophomore year students typically will finish the ENGR 011 and ENGR 015 sequence. Linear Physical Systems Analysis (ENGR 012) and Experimentation for Engineering Design (ENGR 014) are usually taken in the spring of the sophomore year. Numerical Methods for Engineering Applications (ENGR 019) can be taken in the spring of the sophomore, junior or senior year. Thermofluid Mechanics (ENGR 041) can be taken in the fall of the junior or senior year. Engineering Design (ENGR 090) is the culminating experience for engineering majors and must be taken by all majors in spring of senior year. Submission and oral presentation of the final project report in Engineering Design constitutes the comprehensive examination for engineering majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elective Program for Course Majors</head><p>Each student devises a program of advanced work in the department in consultation with his or her advisor. The choice of electives is submitted for departmental approval as part of the formal application for a major in engineering during the spring semester of the sophomore year. A student's elective program may or may not conform to some traditional or conventional area of engineering specialization (e.g., computer, electrical, mechanical, or civil). The department therefore requires each plan of advanced work to have a coherent, well-justified program that meets the student's stated educational objectives.</p><p>At most one Swarthmore course taught by a faculty member outside the Engineering Department can count as one of the 12 engineering credits required for the major. Normally a maximum of 2.5 transfer credits that are preapproved by the Engineering Department will be accepted as partial fulfillment of the 12 engineering credits required for the major. Exceptions to this rule include students who transfer to Swarthmore and others with special circumstances; the amount of credit accepted in their cases will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the department chair.</p><p>Students should be aware that most lecture courses at other institutions carry only 0.75 Swarthmore credits, unless they include a full lab sequence.</p><p>Students who wish to receive credit for courses taken at other institutions, including those taken abroad, as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the major should consult their academic advisors and the chair of the Engineering Department as early as possible to ensure that all requirements are met. The courses available for traditional elective programs include the following:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>A minimum of 5 credits in engineering is required, of which at least 2 but not more than 3 must be core courses (ENGR 006, ENGR 011, ENGR 012, ENGR 014, ENGR 015, ENGR 019 or ENGR 041, but not ENGR 090). The remainder will be selected from elective course offerings within the department. Only those electives that count toward an engineering major can be counted toward a minor. No courses taken at Swarthmore and intended to satisfy these departmental requirements, except those taken fall semester in the first year, may be taken credit/no credit. At most one Swarthmore course taught by a faculty member outside the Engineering Department can count as one of the 5 engineering credits required for the minor. Supporting work in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science is necessary only when designated as a prerequisite to an individual engineering course.</p><p>No directed readings may be used as one of the 5 credits for the minor. A maximum of 1 transfer credit that is preapproved by the Engineering Department will be accepted as partial fulfillment of the minor requirements. Transfer credits will not count for any of the three courses used to fulfill the core course requirement of the minor. No culminating experience will be required. Only students pursuing the major in engineering may enroll in ENGR 090.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Areas of Study</head><p>Although packaged selections of courses will be suggested as options for those interested in an engineering minor, students may tailor their programs to meet individual needs and interests in consultation with their advisers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>Students with a B+ average among courses in the Division of Natural Sciences and Engineering may apply for an honors major in engineering. This B+ average must be maintained through the end of the junior year to remain in the Honors Program. A listing of preparations supported by existing engineering courses is appended. Credits from approved attachments or special topics courses may substitute for not more than 1 credit within any preparation. Honors majors must complete the same requirements as course majors in engineering. The honors major in engineering is a fourexamination program that includes three preparations in engineering (the major) and one minor preparation. Each area comprises 2 credits of work. The preparations may include ENGR 090 and/or one other core course.</p><p>The minor preparation must comprise at least 2 credits of work approved by any department or program outside engineering. Each major candidate must accumulate 12 credits in engineering, including ENGR 090, and the same number of science and math credits as required of course majors. If one of the major preparations includes ENGR 090, it must be paired with an appropriately related upper-level engineering elective or a 1-credit honors thesis to be completed in the fall semester of senior year. Honors thesis credit may not substitute for any of the 12 engineering credits required for the bachelor of science. Candidates who choose an honors thesis will complete at least 13 credits in engineering and 33 across the College. The two additional major preparations must each comprise two related, upper-level engineering electives. A précis of not more than 12 pages (including tables and figures) of each candidate's ENGR 090 project must be submitted by the end of the 10th week of the spring semester for mailing to the relevant honors examiner. The final ENGR 090 report will not be mailed to any examiner but may be brought to the oral examinations. Senior honors study by engineering majors is not required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>Senior honors study is required for all engineering honors minors, except those who are also engineering course majors. For those not majoring in engineering, the senior honors study is the culminating experience. Course majors will not take senior honors study because ENGR 090 serves as the culminating experience. Every engineering honors minor preparation must include two related upper-level engineering electives for which all prerequisites must be satisfied. If the student is not also an engineering course major, then senior honors study is also required. Credits from official attachments or special topics courses in engineering may substitute for not more than one of the two upperlevel courses within an engineering minor preparation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Engineering majors or minors considering offcampus study should consult their academic advisors as early as possible to ensure that all requirements are met.</p><p>Students should obtain advance approval from the department before taking any course off-campus (including courses at the University of Pennsylvania) intended to count towards the major or minor. The faculty member in the department whose teaching/research area overlaps most closely with the course will review the course syllabus and other available information in consultation with the department chair.</p><p>Most Engineering courses at other institutions carry only 0.75 Swarthmore credits unless they include a full lab sequence. </p></div>

Engineering and Scientific Applications of Calculus</head><p>This half-credit course will focus on mathematical applications of single variable calculus, mainly from engineering and physics; it may also include some examples from other sciences if there is student interest. In addition, ENGR 009 will include a review of relevant pre-calculus topics. It is designed to give capable and hard-working students the best chance to excel in calculus, and is recommended for students who are interested in real-world contexts where calculus is used, including (but not limited to) potential science and engineering majors. The course will meet twice weekly for a total of 2.5 hours, and have little outside work associated with it. Most of the time in class will be spent solving problems and doing group work. ENGR 009 may not be used to fulfill the requirements for the engineering major or minor, and is available only to students taking MATH 015 concurrently. 0.5 credit.</p></div>

Directed Reading or Project</head><p>Qualified students may do special work with theoretical, experimental, or design emphasis in an area not covered by regular courses with the permission of a willing faculty supervisor in the department.</p><p>The student and faculty member will agree on a plan and scope of work at the beginning of the term. The student will typically meet weekly with the advisor and will produce written documentation of their work. Directed readings that count for the major are normally expected to include a lab, substantial project, or the equivalent. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGR 096. Honors Thesis</head><p>In addition to ENGR 090, an honors major may undertake an honors thesis in the fall semester of the senior year with approval of the department and a faculty advisor. A prospectus of thesis problem must be submitted and approved not later than the end of junior year. Offered only with departmental approval and faculty supervision. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGR 199. Senior Honors Study</head><p>Senior honors study is available only for engineering minors and must include at least 0.5 credit as an attachment to one of the courses in the engineering preparation. Offered only with departmental approval and faculty supervision. This course may be taken only in the spring of the senior year. 0.5 or 1 credit. *Courses numbered ENGR 004A-004Z These courses serve all students interested in environmental science, technology, and policy. Some may meet requirements for a major or minor in environmental studies and special majors, and all carry NSE distribution credit (though not necessarily NSEP). Similar courses are available through the College's off-campus study programs in Central Europe and Cape Town, South Africa. These courses may not be used to satisfy requirements for the major or minor in engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation for Honors Examinations</head><p>The department will arrange honors examinations in the following areas to be prepared for by the combinations of courses indicated. Other preparations are possible by mutual agreement. In the Department of English Literature, we study how literature shapes experience. Students learn how to read closely, think inventively, and write creatively and analytically. We offer classes on a wide range of topics, from novels to new media, from critical theory to popular culture, from poetry to digital humanities. In these classes, students explore how the form of a text illuminates its meaning; how literature both reflects and challenges structures of race, gender, sexuality, and class; how historical circumstances enable imaginative expression and how imaginative expression changes history. Our curriculum emphasizes writing in English from the US, the UK, South Asia, the Caribbean, Ireland, and South Africa, and educates students in methods including critical race and ethnic studies, feminist studies, environmental studies, and queer studies. We teach students how to analyze a world of texts and to use their voices in it. Students are eligible for paid internships during the summer to produce original creative writing projects and pursue guided research in literary study. In collaboration with faculty, students also work on a variety of digital humanities projects based at Swarthmore and at archives and universities nationwide. Along with a vibrant public culture of lectures and events featuring prominent novelists, poets, and cultural theorists, the department creates opportunities for students to present their research to peers and faculty on campus, as well as at regional and national academic conferences. Majors and minors in English Literature succeed in careers as diverse as law, education, medicine, finance, journalism, publishing, academia, and community organizing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communications and Electromagnetic Fields</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First course recommendations</head><p>We recommend that students begin their study of English Literature at Swarthmore by taking a First-Year Seminar or a course labeled "Gateway". Unless noted, other courses in our department assume some familiarity with the discipline without requiring a formal prerequisite. Courses at the 100 level and some creative writing courses require departmental permission for enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for the Major or the Minor</head><p>The minimum requirement for consideration for the major or minor is the completion of at least two graded courses in English Literature at Swarthmore, other than Composition, Journalism, or Creative Writing credits. Decisions regarding applications will be deferred until two graded literature courses are completed. Applications are considered in the spring of the sophomore year. Each student will, under the guidance of a faculty advisor, present a reasoned plan of study for the last two years. This plan will be submitted to the department and will be the basis of the departmental discussion of the student's application. The plan will include a list of proposed courses and seminars that will satisfy the requirements for either the Course or Honors Program and a rationale for the program of study. Applications for the major or minor are normally considered at a meeting of all department members. Each student is discussed individually. The department has never established a minimum grade point average, nor are certain courses weighted in this discussion more heavily than others. A record of less than satisfactory work in p. 240</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Literature</head><p>English would certainly give us pause, however, unless it were attributable to circumstances other than academic ability. Students who want to include the English major as part of a double major must have a record of strong work in both majors as well as in other courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>All English Literature majors must complete a minimum of 9 credits in the department, including • at least one credit in each of the following historical periods: As a culmination of the course major, all seniors take English 099, which offers a structured and supportive environment for students writing their senior essays. The course features a mix of literature, criticism, theory, and methodology, plus guest visits and opportunities for students to discuss central issues in the field of literary and cultural history in preparation for their research and writing. Successful completion of ENGL 096 or ENGL 080 is a prerequisite to this course. Under special circumstances, a course major may elect to write a longer research thesis. For more information, see the description for ENGL 098.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula><p>Based on their own interests and goals, all course majors are expected to identify a concentration of at least three English literature credits within the major. Students define this concentration, but are encouraged to discuss their course choices with a faculty member in the department. Sample concentration topics: one of the three historical periods; American, African-American, or Asian-American literature; theory; digital humanities; creative writing; or a particular genre, such as fiction or poetry. Students define their potential concentration within the major as part of their sophomore plan, but may modify their plan as needed during junior or senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>All English Literature minors must complete a minimum of 5 credits in the department, including at least one credit in two of the following historical periods:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>English Literature majors who seek a degree with Honors will, in the spring of their sophomore year, propose for external examination a program consisting of four preparations: three in English and one in a minor. Honors majors must complete all general requirements for the English course major, a total of 9 credits in English Literature, with the exception of ENGL 099, the Senior Course Majors' Colloquium. Students interested in pursuing honors within a faculty-approved interdisciplinary major, program, or concentration that draws on advanced English courses or seminars should consult with the department chair for early help in planning their program.</p><p>The three Honors preparations in the English Literature major (constituting six credit units) must include preparations from at least two of the following historical periods: The three preparations will normally be done through seminars, though if approved by the Department, one preparation may be a thesis or creative writing project. Students who wish either to write a thesis or pursue a creative writing project under faculty supervision as part of the Honors Program must submit proposals to the department; the number of these ventures the department can sponsor each year is limited. Students who propose creative writing projects will normally be expected to have completed at least one writing workshop as part of, or as a prelude to, the project; the Honors preparation presented for examination will thus normally consist of a 1-credit workshop plus a 1-credit directed creative writing project. For further information, consult with the department chair or the Director of the Program in Creative Writing, Professor Nathalie Anderson. As for course majors, Honors majors are expected to identify a concentration of at least three English literature credits within the major based on their own interests and goals. Students define this concentration, but are encouraged to discuss their course choices with a member of the department. Sample concentration topics: one of the three historical periods; American, African-American, or Asian-American literature; theory; digital humanities; creative writing; or a particular genre, such as fiction or poetry. Students define their potential concentration within the major as part of their sophomore plan, but may modify their plan as needed during junior or senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>Students seeking an English Literature Honors minor must do a single, two-credit preparation in the department, normally by means of a seminar p. 241</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Literature</head><p>(or under special circumstances, a creative writing project); thesis option is available only to majors.</p><p>Honors minors must complete all general requirements for the English course minor, a total of 5 credits in English Literature. Important things to know regarding credits toward an English Literature major or minor • First Year Seminars (English 008 and 009A -009Z) and Creative Writing courses count toward the major or minor but do not fulfill historical requirements.</p><p>• Creative Writing workshops are graded CR/NC; many students take a number of creative writing workshops toward the major.</p><p>• Academic Writing courses (ENGL 1F, G, etc. or C, Writing Pedagogy) and Journalism classes do not count toward the major or minor.</p><p>• If awarded, AP/IB credit can be used toward the major or minor, but it does not satisfy a historical requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Examinations and Senior Honors Study (SHS)</head><p>English Honors preparations consisting of seminars or course combinations will be assessed by a 3-hour written examination set by an external examiner. Written examinations will be followed by oral examinations of 30-45 minutes. Honors preparations fulfilled through seminars or courses also require an SHS submission to be reviewed by the Honors examiner. A 2-credit thesis or a creative writing portfolio will be examined in a 45-60 minute oral examination. A thesis or creative writing project does not require an additional SHS submission or a written exam. For the SHS requirement, Honors Majors and Minors will revise one paper per seminar for their portfolio and submit that portfolio to their external examiners. In the case of course combinations used as Honors preparations, students can either present two shorter revised essays (one from each class) or synthesize materials from earlier essays to create a new essay bridging the two classes. In either case, SHS submissions can be a maximum of 4,000 words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Majors</head><p>Students may, with the department's permission, pursue a double major either as part of the Course or Honors Program. Double majors must fulfill all the major requirements in both departments. For a double major in honors, one of the majors is used as the honors major and the other is often used as the honors minor. See the department chair for further details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Major</head><p>Designed by the student in consultation with faculty advisors. If English is the central department, students must fulfill most of the regular requirements and have a minimum of 5 English Department credits as part of the special major. Students must take at least one course each in two of the three historical periods listed above. Students must consult with the various departments or programs involved in the special major and have all approve the plan of study. Only one integrative comprehensive exercise is required. Students may also do a special honors major with four related preparations in different departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major with a Creative Writing Emphasis</head><p>With the range of writing courses open to them, it is possible for students at Swarthmore to pursue a Major in English Literature with an Emphasis in Creative Writing, by completing three units of creative writing in addition to the usual departmental requirements. One workshop taken outside our English Department may be counted towards the Emphasis. Student writers may also pursue a Directed Creative Writing Project (070K), completing a portfolio of independent work under the guidance of a faculty member. Some students have used the Directed Creative Writing Project as an opportunity to extend and polish a project begun in workshops -a novel, a linked collection of short stories, a sequence of poems responding to photographs, for example -while others have worked intensively and rigorously to master the sonnet form, or explored through their own work the implications of a theoretical premise -the blurred distinction between dramatic monologue and poetic confession, for example. Because our writing faculty is small, the Department sponsors only a limited number of writing projects each year. Students interested in pursuing independent work in creative writing normally declare their intention in the sophomore plan, and submit a prospectus to the Department in the semester before they hope to begin their project, after consulting with the chair of the Department and with members of the writing faculty. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study and Transfer Credit</head><p>Students who plan to study away from Swarthmore should consult with the department far enough in advance of such study to effect proper planning of a major or minor. Honors majors in particular should discuss the impact of study abroad on their honors program with the chair and departmental honors advisor.</p><p>In determining which courses of study will meet department criteria for requirements or credit toward a major or minor, the department will rely both on its experience in evaluating the work of students returning from these programs and on careful examination of course descriptions, syllabi, and schedules. In general, to earn one Swarthmore College credit, we expect a course elsewhere to provide 30 contact hours and to require roughly 20 pages of writing, as well as a reading list roughly comparable to a Swarthmore English course's reading list.</p><p>Course credits for literature in English should be approved before you leave, but no course credits are finally awarded until you present your completed work upon your return to Swarthmore. Beginning with the Fall 2019 semester, you will need to take one English course at Swarthmore to gain credit for an English course taken during study abroad. Students planning study abroad from Swarthmore should contact the Off-Campus Study Office for additional information and resources, including important information about the credit preestimation and approval processes. Students seeking credit for domestic (USA) offcampus study will need to work with the registrar, the English course credit consultant, and possibly the deans. To find out who the current course credit consultant is for English Literature, contact the department chair or administrative assistant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life After Swarthmore</head><p>After graduation, our majors find jobs in the everexpanding range of industries that prize reading, writing, interpretive skills, teamwork, and creative thinking. We count among our English alums poets and novelists, social workers and scholars, news writers, teachers, broadcast journalists, filmmakers, entrepreneurs, financial analysts, grant writers, publishers and editors, natural or social science writers, doctors, and lawyers. About a third of our graduates head to premiere graduate schools, including Harvard, Oxford, Berkeley, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and NYU. Swarthmore English literature majors are represented in any field in which analysis, communication, and empathy are integral. Grounded in the mission of Swarthmore, our students leave as well-rounded citizens of the world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Literature Courses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-Year Seminars and Writing Courses</head><p>First-Year Seminars are limited to 12 first-year students only. No student may take more than one within the department. This course is an introduction to the writings of Latino/as in the U.S. with emphasis on the distinctions and similarities that have shaped the experiences and the cultural imagination among different Latino/a communities. We will focus particularly in works produced by the three major groups of U.S. Latino/as (Mexican Americans or Chicanos, Puerto Ricans or Nuyoricans, and Cuban Americans). By analyzing works from a range of genres including poetry, fiction, film, and performance, along with literary and cultural theory, the course will explore some of the major themes in the cultural production of these groups. Topics to be discussed include identity formation in terms of language, race, gender, sexuality, and class; diaspora and emigration; the marketing of the Latino/a identity; and activism through art. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGL 009O. First-Year Seminar: American Archipelagos</head><p>This course will untether the term "America" from its all-too-easy connotation with the continental United States and set it adrift among the island formations comprising the western hemisphere and beyond. By accounting for the ocean as a crucial shaping force of human culture and survival, much in the same way that land has been understood, we will craft an archipelagic approach to our study of the Americas and, indeed, the globe. We will examine how colonial discourses and expansionist policies have attempted to construct islands as spaces to be governed, instrumentalized, and appropriated while at the same time immersing ourselves in literature and other forms of cultural production that imagine islands as portals towards more liberatory ways of belonging in this globe. By thinking with a variety of American Archipelagoes, students will come out of this course with a more nuanced grasp of the multiracial, multi-lingual, and trans-imperial American oceanscape, as well as how the United States has drawn from it to take on its various, shifting forms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGL 071B. The Lyric Poem in English</head><p>English 071B is a survey of the lyric poetry in English from the Middle Ages up to the present, along with a few works read in translation. Students will learn the basics in understanding and enjoying the music of poetry, including scansion and prosody (beats and sounds). They will also learn to appreciate the basic forms of lyric poetry, including ballads and sonnets and many other forms, as well as "free" verse; they will also receive instruction on how to appreciate metaphors, irony, and the many other figures of speech and rhetorical techniques poems employ. They will also gain appreciation of poetic history and the many ways in which poets and their work have historically interacted with their eras, while also creating work that can powerfully speak to us in our present moment. We'll use </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGL 036. Jane Austen</head><p>Mingling stylistic precision with an uncanny eye for social foibles, Austen's novels off a useful entry point into the study of literature and the ways literature reflects and refracts social conditions. We'll read Austen's major novels along with the 18th-century fiction, politics, and philosophy to which she was responding; we'll also consider recent critical views on Austen and the ways films of the1990s through the present engaged Austen's style and social critique. At the same time, students will engage the genre of the academic essay by writing and revising several kinds of literary essays: close readings; analysis of a novel's use of source material or a film's use of addressing one or more of the novels in a broader historical or stylistic context. In order to answer these questions and to generate more along the way, we will consider a range of legal, literary, and cultural texts. These may include The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(1848)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGL 050R. 19th Century Radicalisms</head><p>What can the radical thinking and practice of the past teach us about the political possibilities of today? This course explores the explosion of antislavery, anti-racist, socialist, free love, anarchist, and anti-imperialist writing in and around the nineteenth-century US. It looks to these past radicalisms not only as forerunners of present ones, but also for models of revolutionary worldmaking that may appear strange, irrational, or incomprehensible from the point of view of the present. We will read primary texts across a range of genres, placing a particular emphasis on the early Black radical tradition, as well as a selection of secondary texts to help us theorize and historicize this work.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(1851)</ref> is a genre-defying work that pulls epic, romantic, dramatic, scientific, and historiographic forms into its literary vortex. The cosmic scope and metaphysical complexity of this text have enthralled, and sometimes left stranded, many an intrepid reader. Members of this course will embark on a semester-long study of a text that has become a key touchstone for writers, artists, philosophers, and political thinkers alike. Guided by their own close-readings of Moby-Dick and selected contemporaneous texts drawn from their own archival research, students will engage with the historical and cultural contexts in which the novel was written, including the proliferation of new forms of print media, the rise of industrial capitalism, continuing processes of enslavement and indigenous dispossession, and U.S. expansionist efforts across the hemisphere and the globe. At once a rigorous and irreverent meditation on literary form and knowledgeproduction, Moby-Dick will serve as a crucial point of departure for students' own critical explorations in and beyond the major. This team-taught course will offer a wide-ranging overview of the short story in the Americas from a comparative perspective, emphasizing continuities and also identifying areas of innovation and transformation.</p><p>The course will begin in the early 19th century with masters whose daring work in this "minor" form gave the short story new prominence in literary history: Poe, Hawthorne, and Chesnutt. Later, the class will focus on Quiroga and Borges whose innovations redefined the genre, and moved Latin American fiction into the forefront of world literature. By focusing on close reading and class discussions, we will seek to discover the distinctive characteristics of the short story, and outline its development and transformation across the continents. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENGL 050D. Literature and Art on the US-Mexico Border</head><p>This course will examine the shifting expressions of the U.S.-Mexico Border in the US-American literary and cultural imagination from 1848 to the present. We will begin by considering Chicanx theorist Mary Pat Brady's suggestion that "the border might be understood more fully as a statesponsored aesthetic project" (Extinct Lands, Temporal Geographies 52). If the border is to be understood as an aesthetic project, what are its formal elements, and how have they shifted over time? Which narratives of belonging has this national project made hyper-visible and which has it occluded? How have treaties, maps, novels, pamphlets, poems, and films figured into the production of the border as a dividing line and a contact zone, a site of violence and of solidarity, a material place and a metaphor?</p><p>In order to answer these questions and to generate more along the way, we will consider a range of legal, literary, and cultural texts. These may include The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(1848)</ref> We'll explore the novels' formal inventiveness as well as their engagement with history, race, gender, and a variety of other social issues, including multiracial single and family identities (and, by implication, how this may help the U.S. national narrative evolve away from white suprematism). Three of the readings will use the genre of "historical fiction" to reinterpret U.S. history, but all the texts rewrite the possibilities of personal, family, and national/transnational narratives. A special feature of the course will be the celebration of Swarthmore alum Patricia Park, who will visit Swarthmore to read from and discuss her first novel. Entitled Re Jane, its heroine Jane Re is a mixed-race orphan on a quest to learn more about her family history. The novel is set in Queens, Brooklyn, and Korea, and is both a fun romantic comedy and a clever reimagining of the Jane Eyre plot. GATEWAY English Literature.</p><p>Humanities. 1 credit.</p></div>

Twenty-First Century Narrative</head><p>In this class, we will examine some of the major texts, media, and themes of U.S. literature of the twenty-first century. What can we say about the history we are ourselves living through? What fears and anxieties distinguish our moment? What perspective (or lack thereof) do we have on our own time? In order to organize these disparate and difficult questions, we will organize our readings around an industry that quietly shapes where and how we live.

Modern American Poetry</head><p>An introductory survey of the full range of 20thcentury American poetry, but we will commence with Whitman and Dickinson, two key predecessors and enablers. The emphasis will be on particular poets and poems, but a recurrent theme will be poetry's role in a democracy: is poetry really an esoteric art for the "educated" few, as some imply, or has poetry in the 20th century played a crucial role in shaping both democratic citizens and a sense of democratic culture? 20th/21st c.

Contemporary Black Autobiography</head><p>Since 1965, African American autobiography has been characterized by both formal innovation and a thematic concern with the meaning of blackness after the Civil Rights Movement; this course examines these developments. This team-taught course will offer a wide-ranging overview of the short story in the Americas from a comparative perspective, emphasizing continuities and also identifying areas of innovation and transformation. The course will begin in the early 19th century with masters whose daring work in this "minor" form gave the short story new prominence in literary history: Poe, Hawthorne, and Chesnutt. Later, the class will focus on Quiroga and Borges whose innovations redefined the genre, and moved Latin American fiction into the forefront of world literature. By focusing on close reading and class discussions, we will seek to discover the distinctive characteristics of the short story, and outline its development and transformation across the continents. </p></div>

Global Modernisms</head><p>In this course, we will survey global fiction from the twentieth-and twenty-first centuries, tracing an arc of modernist literary practices that extends beyond the largely American and European coterie of high modernists. We will put pressure on the geopolitics of literary modernism(s), exploring The first section of this class will be devoted to studying the ways human rights advocacy and practice has traditionally depended upon narrative structures (testimony, witnessing, reportage) and the sympathetic imagination in order to raise awareness of atrocity. The second half of the class will explore how such attempts to narrate the human face new obstacles in the twenty-first century. Course readings will include a wide array of narrative forms, from novels, memoirs, photography and film to ad campaigns, NGO reports, and Freedom Information Act requests. Primary texts will be supplemented by secondary readings (Jacques Derrida, Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, Joseph Slaughter, Deborati Sanyal, and Eyal Wiezman) and by research labs that will introduce students to local and regional human rights work. Pollutants. Fossil Fuels. Atomic Bombs. In many ways, pesticides, oil, and plutonium structure our lives; they impact our health, our politics, and may even threaten the existence of life itself. Ironically, because these materials permeate nearly every aspect of our existence, the human mind can struggle to comprehend them. In this course, we will read literature that engages with our environment to help us bring humans' relationship to these materials into focus. Scientific, historical, and economic studies of these materials tend to focus on their scale and widespread impact. Reading poetry, plays, short stories, and novels will allow us to imagine these materials more intimately-through individual, cultural, and aesthetic perspectives. In this course, students will ask: How can literature help us to understand-and perhaps change-our material, economic, and social environments? How has our relationship to materials changed over time? How do environmental and material realities impact cultural production and imagination? Texts under discussion will likely include: Rachel Carson's Silent Spring <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(</ref> Sometimes a short story can be drafted in a great surge of inspiration, but a novel is a different kind of literary beast. How do we prepare ourselves to keep a story going over several hundred pages? What do we need to know in advance, and what might we hope to discover along the way? This workshop is for students who want to write expansively and are interested in the discipline of exploring, deepening, and shaping one fictional idea over a long period of time. Exercises will be assigned and a variety of models will be examined, but reading and commenting on each other's work will form the core of our work together. Attendance at readings is required.

Why now?</head><p>Profound anthropogenic changes are occurring in the land, water, and air around us, with the result that human societies face greater changes and environmental challenges than we have ever known. Global population is expected to exceed nine billion by 2040; global energy consumption is rising sharply while even present-day carbon emissions intensify global warming. Along with global warming, trends such as deforestation, mass extinctions, and eutrophication threaten the finelybalanced marine and terrestrial ecosystems on which we rely for food, water, shelter, and more. Sea-water rise along with increasing heat and drought will create climate refugees and resource conflicts on unprecedented scales. Responding to these crises requires all the creativity and rigor and compassion we can gather-including the cultivation of intellectual skills that until recently were housed in discrete and disparate disciplines. Environmental studies brings together the natural sciences and engineering, the humanities, and the social sciences to tackle environmental issues of great complexity and socio-political importance. In relation to climate change, for instance, natural scientists provide data to understand the scope of the problem and the processes that result in global warming, social scientists help to understand and craft policies around human behaviors that cause climate change, and humanists provide the moral and historical framework to understand our obligation to action and the tools to communicate environmental values. Only an integrated, interdisciplinary approach can address the extremity and complexity of the challenges we face: students must learn to think across and through disciplines in order to become the kinds of problem-solvers our societies so urgently need. </p></div>

This is a team-taught, interdisciplinary introduction to the field of Environmental Studies. Faculty instructors are drawn from the natural sciences and engineering on the one hand and from social sciences and humanities on the other in order to ensure cross-disciplinary perspectives and connections. Students interested in majoring or minoring in Environmental Studies should take this course as early as possible; we anticipate that most students declaring a major or minor will have taken it by the sophomore year. b) Two Environmental Social Science courses. We expect our students to grasp the fundamentals of economic policies, environmental histories, and socio-cultural formations; we also want them to be able to design, conduct, and analyze empirical research. c) Two Environmental Arts and Humanities courses. We want our students to be able to analyze rhetorical strategies of individual texts and broader discourse communities (e.g. climate justice movements as well as climate denial). We want them to question the assumptions underlying existing cultural structures and explore alternatives. When possible, we want them to develop creative skills to help them inspire and motivate others. d) Two Environmental Science and Technology courses, including at least one lab course. We expect our students to be able to conduct inquiry-based science, working with raw data as well as understanding data produced by others. e) A four-course topical or disciplinary focus, including elements of methodological development and practical engagement (praxis). This focus offers our students the opportunity to develop their own areas of expertise while also developing greater depth and breadth in interdisciplinary problem-solving.

Yet in many ways this system is broken. This course will address the current state of our agricultural food system from a scientific perspective, focusing on the U.S. Each student will grow and maintain a micro-garden plot as part of the class, as well as develop educational signage for the public that conveys information about agriculture or their crop. This course explores how ideologies and structures of race, gender, sexuality, and class are embedded in and help shape our perceptions of and actions in the "environment." Drawing on key social and cultural theories of environmental studies from anthropology, sociology, feminist analysis, and science and technology studies, we will examine some of the ways that differences in culture, power, and knowledge construct the conceptual frameworks and social policies undertaken in relation to the environment. The course draws on contemporary scholarship and social movement activism (including memoir and autobiography) from diverse national and international contexts. Topics addressed include, for example, ideas/theories of "nature," toxic exposure and public health, environmental perception and social difference, poverty and natural resource depletion, justice and sustainability, Indigenous environmentalisms, eco-imperialism, and disparate impacts of global climate change. The course offers students opportunities for community-based learning working in partnership with local organizations. 1 credit. Eligible for BLST, ENVS, GSST Spring 2020. Di Chiro.</p></div>

Transmedia Worldbuilding and Storytelling</head><p>The invention and exploration of elaborate fictional worlds span millennia of human cultural practice, from the islands of Homer's Odyssey to the Middle Earth of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and the blockbuster universes of Star Wars, Marvel and DC. This class explores the mechanical and aesthetic principles of crafting detailed imaginary worlds and using them to tell stories that interconnect across diverse media, ranging from film, television, theater, and comics to digital and tabletop gaming, LARPs, virtual reality, and other emerging platforms. In a workshop environment devoted to developing our own world concepts, we will engage forms of paratextual production such as costume and set design; model building and prop fabrication; the drafting of maps, blueprints, encyclopedias, and other reference materials; and the coining of conlangs (constructed languages). Through our creative work we will explore the history of and critical theory surrounding subcreation, transmedia storytelling, and convergence culture, touching on key works in literary and adaptation theory, global/locative studies, fandom studies, production culture, genre theory, narratology, performance, gaming, animation, and spectacle/special effects.

Introduction to Gender and Sexuality Studies</head><p>This interdisciplinary core course provides an introduction to key concepts, questions, and analytical tools developed by scholars of gender and sexuality studies. Through this course, you will become familiar with key contemporary debates in the field, as well as the historical formation of these debates. Substantial attention will be paid to the development and application of queer theory within the history of the field, including discussion of social construction of gender identities and expressions, as well as LGBTQ identities, texts, theories, and issues. Course materials will include "classic" and contemporary gender and sexuality studies scholarship from a variety of disciplines.

Against the Norm: (Im)Perfect Bodies and (Dis)Ability Studies</head><p>This course draws attention to shifting constructions of body normativity and disability from an interdisciplinary perspective and is informed by fields such as philosophy, ethnology, psychology, anthropology, political science, and literature. Students will explore ways in which the field of disability studies both draws from, as well as informs and expands, the fields of gender and sexuality studies and queer studies. Theoretical framework of the course focuses on the mechanisms that allow definitions, social constructions, and stigmas associated with disability to contribute to a larger system of power that oppresses individuals who fall short of the norm. We will orient ourselves by asking the following questions: How is disability socially constructed? How does disability intersect with other identities? How do various definitions of disability shape and affect advocacy agendas? What are some institutional and social challenges faced by those with non-conforming bodies? Texts include disability studies theory, critical and theoretical essays, articles by disability rights scholars and activists, first-person accounts, films, art, and newspaper articles.

Seminar in Gender and Sexuality Studies: Explorations in Theory and Method</head><p>This course is a history of four ideas -biopower, jouissance, post-transexual, and intersectionality. We will explore these ideas from multiple perspectives: the conditions (both historical and intellectual) under which they were articulated, the self-questioning which they inspired, the forms of critique which they enabled, and the urgency which surrounds them still. Throughout the course, we will question the distinction between theory and practice, scholarly work and real-life problems. How much work can one idea do? And what appears when we compare the life-work of these four ideas through and beyond the pages of scholarly journals? Required for GSST Special Major. Prerequisite: GSST 001.

Global Studies, with its emphasis, on the one hand, on processes and phenomena common across borders and, on the other, with a particular attention to differences in the global-local connection, offers students an opportunity to more strongly command an understanding of their place in the world and an awareness and appreciation of differences through cross-cultural competence as well as a greater ability to mediate these differences. The Global Studies program complements and strengthens Swarthmore's efforts to shape engaged citizens not just with a local or a national conscience, but also with a global one. The minor in Global Studies requires a total of 5 credits plus Foreign Language study to create a cohesive pathway to an interdisciplinary understanding of the global. One of these 5 credits has to come from the Introduction to Global Studies course. The remaining four credits need to come from the list of eligible courses, which include core courses and paired courses. While core courses offer a global view of a particular subject, paired courses predominantly study one part of the world or an issue area, topic, or theme through a part of the world. In this respect, paired courses provide a global view through comparative analysis. One GLBL-eligible paired course needs to be combined with another GLBLeligible paired course for the student to receive credit for each paired course. The rationale for the pairing should be outlined in the student's Sophomore Pathway. Further, Graduating seniors complete a Senior Reflection Exercise. Those interested in a special major in Global Studies can work with the program coordinators to develop a plan. A special major will include the requirements of the minor plus additional credits.</p></div>

New Language: Students choosing a new language will be required to complete the first three semesters of a new language offered at Swarthmore (Trico or UPenn for languages not housed at Swarthmore) or reach the equivalent of intermediate level in a study abroad language option upon approval of program coordinators. 2. Continuing Language: Students choosing to continue a language begun elsewhere and taught at Swarthmore will adhere to the following guidelines:</p><p>• Students placed at the 1st -3rd semesterlevel must complete through the 3rd semester of that language. • Students placed at the 4th semester-level must complete that level. • Students placed above the 4th semesterlevel must complete one advanced course in that language. • Students who wish to declare English as their foreign language must meet with the program coordinators. In essence, some students may continue a language they studied in high school, while others may prefer to begin a new language. We would strongly advise the student to see the language choice as integral to their choice of elective courses. For languages not housed at Swarthmore, Global Studies will encourage students to explore two options: (1) local language study in the Trico or at UPenn or (2) study abroad opportunities that offer intensive language programs on their own or as part of a study abroad program. In such cases where students want to study languages elsewhere, Global Studies' students will work in consultation with the program coordinators to develop a language study program. NB. Some of the courses that would satisfy the Global Studies core and paired courses requirement are language courses, so they would meet both the course requirements as well as the language requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sophomore Pathway</head><p>Equivalent to the sophomore plan, in the Sophomore Pathway the students will outline their rationale of their chosen GLBL courses and language study, including how they think these courses will help them pursue their area of interest or permit the exploration of a theme from different vantage points. A minimum "B" average within the GLBL minor is required for all minors by their junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Studies Courses</head><p>Currently offered courses relevant to the program include the following: Note: The student is responsible for knowing and meeting any of the prerequisites associated with the following courses. In all cases, the student's acceptance into these courses is up to the Instructor and not the Global Studies Program coordinators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GLBL 015. Introduction to Global Studies</head><p>This course provides an interdisciplinary approach to globally shared issues, processes, interactions and systems that affect people, communities, regions, nations, and our planet. Some topics the course examines are: the effects of a globalized world economy, global inequality and poverty, migration and refugees, identity in a global age, world cities, media in the global age, colonization and decolonization, global ethics, global social movements. The course takes seriously the interaction between the local and the global. It offers students an opportunity to more strongly command an understanding of their place in the world and an awareness and appreciation of differences through cross-cultural competence as well as a greater ability to mediate these differences. The interdisciplinary nature of the course demands multiple points of entry to communicate and analyze these issues beyond reading and writing, such as films, podcasts, lectures. Each fall Global Studies faculty selects several topics for an in-depth look at the past, present, and future global landscape. Note: GLBL 015 is required for Minors, but open to all and will be offered every fall. Eligible for GLBL Fall 2019. Yervasi. Swarthmore's History Department gives students the intellectual and analytical skills to think critically about the past and the contemporary world. It is part of a journey of self-discovery and crucial to the kind of liberal arts education offered at Swarthmore, because it asks students to question critically the assumptions, values, and principles that guide them in their daily lives. History encourages us to have respect for other cultures and peoples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is History?</head><p>The study of history is not limited to learning events, dates, and names. History is a method of analysis that focuses on the contexts in which people have lived, worked, and died. Historians seek to go beyond their descriptive abilities and to wrestle with the essential questions of "how" and "why" change occurs over time. They interpret the past and are in constant dialogue with what other historians have written about it. For example, although there may be agreement that Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, historians have and will continue to debate the origins of Nazism, the rise of Hitler to power, and the causes of World War II and the Holocaust. Historical scholarship enables us to not only know what occurred in the past but also to understand the thoughts and actions of people living in other times and places, allowing us to uncover the continuities and disruptions of patterns that characterized life before our time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Curriculum</head><p>Swarthmore's history curriculum introduces students to historical methods and the fundamentals of historical thinking, research, and writing. Faculty members expose students to the contested nature of the discipline, cultivating the skills historians employ to understand and interpret the past. Students learn to assess critically the evidence of the past through first-hand exposure to primary sources. They also develop the ability to evaluate the respective arguments of historians. In all courses and seminars, the department strives to involve students in the process of historical discovery and interpretation, emphasizing that all historians are engaged in the constant sifting of old and new evidence. Each faculty member in the History Department has a regional focus as well as expertise in a particular kind of historical inquiry. Some study social, cultural, and political movements; others examine the impact of religion or explore the history of ideas, sexuality, and gender. They all share a commitment to a global and comparative approach to the study of history and a common pedagogical concern for promoting a critical understanding of the past. Students are encouraged to hone their skills as historians by using the rich collections of the Swarthmore College Peace Collection and Friends Historical Library, both located in McCabe Library. The Peace Collection is unparalleled as a depository of antiwar and disarmament materials, housing the papers of many leading social activists. The Friends Library possesses one of the richest collections of manuscripts and printed source material on Quaker history. The holdings of other institutions in the greater Philadelphia area, such as the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Hagley Museum and Library (Wilmington, Del.), the Library Company of Philadelphia, and the American Philosophical Society, are also accessible to the student-researcher. Students are also encouraged to broaden their cultural and intellectual horizons through foreign study. Students are eligible to apply for grants that will enable them to spend a summer conducting research on a historical topic of their choosing. In the past, students have used these grants to immerse themselves in materials found in libraries and archives around the United States, Europe, and Latin America, collecting materials that formed the basis of their senior research papers. Topics of recent senior theses include he culture and politics of anti-tobacco campaigns in 21st Century Argentina; cross-dressing in early 20th Century San Francisco; the deep cultural history of the 20th Century civil rights movement in the United States; the interplay of baseball, masculinity, and American popular culture during the Reagan In addition, we encourage students who wish to obtain teacher certification to major in history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-Year Seminars</head><p>First-year seminars (HIST 001A-001Z; 1 credit) explore specific historical issues or periods in depth in a seminar setting; they are open to only first-year students and are limited to 12 students. Students who are not admitted to first-year seminars in the fall will receive priority for seminars in the spring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Courses</head><p>Survey courses provide broad chronological coverage of a particular field of history. Survey courses (002-010; 1 credit) are open to all students without prerequisites and are designed to offer a general education in the field as well as provide preparation for a range of upper-level courses. Although these entry-level courses vary somewhat in approach, they normally focus on major issues of interpretation, the analysis of primary sources, and historical methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upper-Division Courses</head><p>Upper-division courses (HIST 011-099; 1 credit) are specifically thematic and topical in nature and do not attempt to provide the broad coverage that surveys do. They are generally open to students who have fulfilled one of the following: (1) successfully completed one of the courses numbered 001-010; (2) received an Advanced Placement score of 4 or 5 (or a 6 or 7 IB score) in any area of history; (3) successfully completed an Ancient History course; or (4) received the permission of the instructor. Exceptions are courses designated "not open to first-year students" or where specific prerequisites are stated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double-Credit Seminars</head><p>Double-credit seminars are small classes in which students are expected to take substantial responsibility for the development of the discussion and learning. These seminars focus on the literature of a given field. Critical thinking about secondary sources and historiographical writing constitute their principle objectives. Seminars are limited to 10 students. Admission to these seminars is selective and based on the department's evaluation of the student's potential to do independent work and to contribute to seminar discussions. A minimum grade of B+ in at least two history courses taken at Swarthmore and a record of active and informed participation in class discussions are normally required of all students entering seminars. In addition, recommendations from department faculty members who have taught the student are solicited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Attachment</head><p>Certain designated courses offer the option of a foreign language attachment, normally for 0.5 credit. Arrangements for this option should be made with the instructor at the time of registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major Requirements</head><p>All majors in history must take at least 9 credits in history that fulfill the following requirements:</p><p>1. They complete at least 6 of their 9 credits at Swarthmore. Only one credit from AP/IB will count toward the 9 credits required for the major. 2. They take at least one course or seminar at Swarthmore from each of the following categories: (a) before 1800 (including Ancient History courses) and (b) outside Europe and the United States, specifically Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Near East. This distribution requirement encourages students to explore various fields of history and engage in comparative historical analysis. Students must use different courses or seminars to fulfill this requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Research Seminar</head><p>All majors must complete the Senior Research Seminar (HIST 091) in which students write a research paper based on primary sources. This course (which counts as one of the required nine credits) satisfies the College's requirement that all majors have a culminating exercise and is only offered during the fall semester. The department encourages students to consult faculty members about their topics by the end of their junior year and select their topic prior to taking the Senior Research Seminar. Juniors are also strongly encouraged to apply for summer research fellowships through the Division of Social Sciences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>Admission to the department as a course major normally requires a B average in at least two history courses taken at Swarthmore and a satisfactory standard of work in all courses. Courses in Ancient History offered by the Classics Department count toward the two history courses p. 291</p><p>History prerequisite. The department reserves the right to withhold evaluation of applications submitted after the deadline. If after applying a student is deferred, the department will review their application at the end of each semester until the student is either accepted into the major or withdraws their application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major Requirements</head><p>Honors history majors must complete the same credit and distribution requirements as described above. Seminars are the normal mode of preparation for students studying history in the Honors Program. Honors majors will complete three double-credit seminars. Students may substitute an Honors Thesis (HIST 180) for one of their seminars. Students wishing to write an Honors Thesis (HIST 180) should declare their intention to the Department and secure an advisor by May 1 of their junior year. They will develop their proposal in the summer with the help of their advisor and submit it upon returning to school in September. Honors majors will also be required to complete the Senior Research Seminar (HIST 091). Honors students may, if their Honors Program requires it, receive approval from the department chair to complete the Senior Research Seminar in the fall of their junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seminars</head><p>Seminars are a collective, collaborative, and cooperative venture among students and faculty members designed to promote self-directed learning. Because the seminar depends on the active participation of all its members, the department expects students to live up to the standards of honors. These standards include attendance at every seminar session, submission of seminar papers according to the deadline set by the instructor, reading of seminar papers before coming to the seminar, completion of all reading assignments before the seminar, respect of the needs of other students who share the reserve readings, and eagerness to engage in a scholarly discussion of the issues raised by the readings and seminar papers. Students earn double-credit for seminars and should be prepared to work at least twice as hard as they do for single-credit courses.</p><p>The department reminds students that the responsibility for earning honors rests squarely on the students' shoulders and will review on a regular basis their performance in the program. Failure to live up to the standards outlined previously may disqualify students from continuing in the Honors Program. Students in seminars take a 3-hour written examination at the end of each seminar and receive a grade from the seminar instructor based on the quality of seminar papers and comments during seminar discussions, in addition to the written examination. Seminar instructors will not normally assign grades during the course of the seminar, but they will meet periodically with students on an individual basis during the course of the semester to discuss their progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External Examiner Evaluations</head><p>Honors students will revise one paper per seminar for their portfolio submitted to external examiners. Revised papers will not be graded but will be included in the portfolio to provide examiners a context for the evaluation of the written examination taken in the spring of the senior year. Thesis and revised seminar papers are due by the end of classes or April 30 in the spring semester of the students' senior year, whichever comes first.</p><p>Revised seminar papers are written in two stages. During the first stage, students confer with their seminar instructor about what paper to prepare for honors and what revisions to plan for these papers. Seminar instructors will offer advice on how to improve the papers with additional readings, structural changes and further development of arguments. The second stage occurs when the student revises the papers independently. Faculty members are not expected to read the revised papers at any stage of the revision process. Each revised paper must be from 2,500 to 4,000 words and include a brief bibliography. Students will submit them to the department office by the end of classes in the spring semester of the students' senior year. Students who fail to submit their revised papers by the deadline might adversely affect their honorific. Examiners will be notified about late papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Groups</head><p>The department encourages students to form their own study groups to prepare for the external examinations. Although faculty members may, at their convenience, attend an occasional study session, students are generally expected to form and lead the study groups, in keeping with the department's belief that honors is a collaborative, self-learning exercise that relies on the commitment of students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>Admission to honors is selective and based on an evaluation of the student's potential to do independent work and to contribute to seminar discussions. A minimum grade of B+ in at least two history courses taken at Swarthmore and a record of active and informed participation in class discussions are required of all students entering seminars. In addition, recommendations from department faculty members who have taught the student are solicited. Sophomores hoping to take history seminars in their junior and senior years should give special thought to the seminars that they list in their Sophomore Plans. Seminar enrollments are normally limited to 10. If you are placed in a seminar at the end of your sophomore year, you will be one of 10 students guaranteed a space and p. 292</p><p>History you are, in effect, taking the space of another student who might also like to be in the seminar. Consequently, you should not list any seminar in your Sophomore Plan without being quite certain that you intend to take it if you are admitted. Honors students are expected to maintain a B+ average to continue attending honors seminars and being an honors student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and Course Minor Requirements</head><p>To graduate with a minor in history, a student must complete five history credits at Swarthmore College (AP, transfer credit, and foreign study courses do not count). Two of the five credits must be from courses above the introductory level (course numbers 011 and higher; honors minors will meet this requirement with their honors seminar), and one credit may be in a history course offered by the Classics Department (ANCH 016, 023, 030, 031, 032, 034, 035, 042, 044, 056, or 066). Honors minors will complete one doublecredit seminar as part of their academic program. Admission to honors is selective and based on an evaluation of the student's potential to do independent work and to contribute to seminar discussions. A minimum grade of B+ in at least two history courses taken at Swarthmore and a record of active and informed participation in class discussions are required of all students entering seminars. In addition, recommendations from department faculty members who have taught the student are solicited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Major in History and Educational Studies</head><p>Requirements Students designing a special major in history and educational studies must take six courses in history, including one course in a field other than the United States or Europe. To graduate with a major in History and Educational Studies, a student must also complete our culminating exercise, HIST 091: Senior Research Seminar. With permission, students can complete a twosemester, two-credit thesis (but one credit of this thesis must be HIST 091). Special majors in history and educational studies will work with both an educational studies faculty member and the HIST 091 instructor(s) to complete their onecredit senior research paper or two-credit thesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>Admission to the department as a special major follows similar requirements as course majors. Advisors in each department should be consulted when designing a plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External Credit</head><p>Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate The History Department will automatically grant one credit to students who have achieved a score of 4 or 5 in the U.S., European, or World History Advanced Placement examinations (or a score of 6 or 7 in the International Baccalaureate examinations) once they have completed any history course number HIST 001 to HIST 010 and earned a grade of C or higher. Students who want credit for a second Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate examination (in a different area of history) must take a second history course at Swarthmore (any course number, including ANCH 016, 023, 030, 031, 032, 034, 035, 042, 044, 056, or 066) and earn a grade of C or higher. The History Department will grant up to two credits for Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate work. Only one credit from AP/IB will count toward the 9 credits required for the history major. A score of 4 or 5 for Advanced Placement (or a score of 6 or 7 for International Baccalaureate) allows students to take some upper-division courses in the History Department. Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate credit may be counted toward the number of courses required for graduation and may be used to help fulfill the College's distribution requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>The History Department encourages students to pursue the study of history abroad and grants credit for such study as appropriate. We believe that history majors should master a foreign language as well as immerse themselves in a foreign culture and society. To receive Swarthmore credit for history courses taken during off-campus study, a student must have departmental preapproval and have taken at least one history course at Swarthmore (normally before going abroad). Students who want to receive credit for a second course taken abroad must take a second history course at Swarthmore. Students must receive a grade of C or higher to receive history credit at Swarthmore. We will only grant an exception for domestic off-campus study experiences validated by our Off-Campus Study or Registrar's Offices and at our discretion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>The History Department does not grant credit for any history courses taken at other U.S. colleges and universities except courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and the University of Pennsylvania while a registered Swarthmore student.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate School</head><p>Students who intend to continue the study of history after graduation should bear in mind that a reading knowledge of one or two foreign languages is generally assumed for admission to graduate school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career Opportunities</head><p>With strong analytical, writing, and research skills, history majors are prepared for a wide range of occupations and professions. Swarthmore College history majors can be found pursuing a broad range of career paths, ranging from government service to the world of medicine, from elementary and high schools to trade unions and public interest foundations, from journalism and publishing to consulting, and from the private to the public sector. Many find that studying history is excellent preparation for law school and business. And others have gone onto graduate school in history and now teach at universities and colleges in the United States and overseas.</p></div>

Women and Gender in Chinese History</head><p>This seminar explores theoretical frameworks and multiple methodologies that have been applied to the study and interpretation of women and gender in late imperial and modern <ref type="bibr">China (1700</ref>. Our primary aim is to understand the relationship between the construction of gender (in particular, the formation of "woman" and "man" as fixed and normative subjects) and the writing of Chinese history. The Interpretation Theory Program provides students and faculty with an interdisciplinary forum for exploring the nature, ethics, and politics of representation. Reaching widely across the disciplines, work done in the minor reflects a longstanding drive to cultivate self-consciousness in the use of a significant range of interpretive methods. Students use this course of study to develop a flexible, comparative, critical, historicized grasp of theories of the production of meaning in and through cultural life. They also sharpen their skills in critical reading and intellectual analysis. Students who minor take a total of six courses that build on a combination of classic and current hermeneutic methods. Each year, graduating seniors enroll in a capstone seminar that proposes a structured investigation into an inherently interdisciplinary problem. Faculty team-teach the course as a way of drawing out multi-disciplinary concerns in both theory and practice.</p></div>

Three general rules guide the selection: 1. All minors are required to successfully complete the one-credit capstone seminar, team-taught by two faculty members from different departments, in spring of their senior year. Juniors may enroll upon approval of the instructors, but the seminar must be taken in the spring of senior year in order to receive capstone credit. First-years are not permitted in the seminar. 2. The three remaining courses are elective but must draw upon at least three different departments. At least 4 of the 6 interpretation theory credits must be outside the major. 3. A minimum "B" average is required for all minors by their junior and senior years. Other courses may be considered upon petition to the Interpretation Studies Committee. These may include relevant courses offered at Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, and the University of Pennsylvania.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>All students participating in the Honors Program are invited to define a Honors minor in interpretation theory. Students must complete one preparation for external examination. This 2-credit preparation can be: -a 2-credit Honors seminar; -the INTP Capstone seminar plus a reading attachment or a thesis; -a combination of two eligible courses in different departments; -a 2-credit thesis; -or a combination of a thesis plus a related course. Any thesis must be multidisciplinary. The proposed preparation must be approved by the Interpretation Theory Committee.

First-Year Seminar: The Linguistic Innovation of Taboo Terms and Slang</head><p>Taboo terms vary in topic across language communities: religion, sex, disease and death, and bodily effluents are common, but other topics can appear, often depending on nonlinguistic factors (community size, demographics, and cultural beliefs). Taboo terms also vary in how they are used: exclamations, name-calling, and maledictions are common, but other uses can appear, such as modifiers and predicates. Over time less common uses tend to semantically bleach, so that historical taboo terms can be used without hint of vulgarity or rudeness. These less common uses can fall together with slang in exhibiting linguistic behavior unique within that language, at the word level and the phrase and sentence level, behavior that is telling with respect to linguistic theory. Each student will choose a language other than English to investigate. Social sciences. Writing course. 1 credit. Eligible for INTP Fall 2019. Napoli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 002A. First-Year Seminar: Language, Gender and Sexuality</head><p>From vocal fry to who gossips more, we love talking about the way women and men talk. But do men and women really use language differently? How does the way we talk contribute to making us "women", "men", "genderqueer", or "transgender"? In what ways do our linguistic practices interact with and subvert or perpetuate ideologies of gender, sex, class, and ethnicity? In exploring these questions, this course will cover a variety of subfields of linguistics, including morphology, lexical semantics, and sociolinguistics. We will also explore insights from gender theory, performance theory, and the ethnography of speaking, as well as experimental research on topics such as implicit bias and language perception. We will put all of these tools together to explore the gendered practices we see in the media and in our everyday lives. 1 credit.</p></div>

First-Year-Seminar: Indigenous Languages of the Americas</head><p>At least 300 languages were spoken in North America before the first contact occurred with Europeans. Most of the surviving languages are on the verge of extinction. Students will learn about language patterns and characteristics of language families, including grammatical classification systems, animacy effects on sentence structure, verbs that incorporate other words, and evidentials. Topics include how languages in contact affect each other, issues of sociolinguistic identity, language endangerment and revitalization efforts, and matters of secrecy and cultural theft.

But how do languages actually work? As a class, we'll work directly with a speaker of an unfamiliar language to figure out how it's organized, while using it to shed light on Language more generally. We'll practice collaborative linguistic fieldwork and language documentation, cover basic concepts in linguistic theory to help make sense of what we find, and counter some common linguistic myths. We'll address a range of questions like: How different can languages be from one to another? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 041. Dialects of American English</head><p>This course provides an introduction to dialect diversity in American English. Why are some dialect differences stigmatized, while others are barely noticed? In addition to learning about the origin and current status of regional, social, and ethnic dialects of American English, students will explore how dialects are expressed and represented in literature, poetry, and the popular media. This course will appeal to students with interests in language ideology, the history of the English language, and the surprising role that dialect diversity plays in American politics and culture. Social sciences. 1 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 043.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 045. Phonetics and Phonology</head><p>Phonetics explores the full range of sounds produced by humans for use in language and the gestural, acoustic, and auditory properties that characterize those sounds. Phonology investigates the abstract cognitive system humans use for representing, organizing, and combining the sounds of language as well as processes by which sounds can change into other sounds. This course covers a wide spectrum of data from languages around the world and focuses on developing analyses to account for the data. Argumentation skills are also developed to help determine the underlying cognitive mechanisms that are needed to support proposed analyses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 046. Linguistic Diversity</head><p>In this course we will explore issues of linguistic diversity, experiences of difference, and power structures as they relate to the perception and use of language, and struggles for justice in linguistic context. We will draw on a range of linguistic subfields including linguistic typology and sociolinguistics to ask questions such as: What is the range of human linguistic diversity? When are linguistic differences meaningful, and how do they become tied to actual social inequality How is linguistic diversity changing now, and how is the internet part of that? (Why) does linguistic diversity matter? We will consider diversity not only across the world's languages but also within languages. Students will investigate linguistic diversity on campus or in surrounding communities. Social sciences. 1 credit. Spring 2020. Weinberg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 050. Syntax</head><p>We study the principles that govern how words make phrases and sentences in natural language. Much time is spent on learning argumentation skills. The linguistic skills gained in this course are applicable to the study of any modern or ancient natural language. The argumentation skills gained in this course are applicable to law and business as well as academic fields. Social sciences. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 052. Historical and Comparative Linguistics</head><p>This course is an introduction to the study of linguistic change. Various models of language change are explored to seek to understand how and why languages change. This will be done by drawing from a wide range of languages to explore changes at all levels of the grammar (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, etc.) and the various factors that can contribute to linguistic change. We will learn how it is possible to reconstruct linguistic systems that we have no direct record of, and will consider what it means for languages to diverge and converge. Major themes of the course will be the comparative method and the relationship between sociolinguistics and historical linguistics. The topics of language shift, language endangerment and death, language birth, and language planning will also be addressed, and assigned work and projects will develop the skills to conduct historical linguistics </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LING 055. Say what? Syntactic variation in dialects of English</head><p>This course is an introduction to the analysis of syntactic and semantic variation across dialects of English. The course will consider both big picture questions about how to model syntactic variation in language, and it will review key concepts in syntactic analysis. We will apply these concepts to data from varieties of English such as African American English, Appalachian English, Canadian English, Belfast English, and Indian English. In addition to reading primary literature on syntactic and semantic variation, students will be encouraged to bring new data to class for discussion and analysis. </p></div>

Adults can "read" these books with the children regardless of their knowledge of American Sign Language (or lack thereof). Working from beloved picture books, we will add video clips of actors signing the stories as well as voice-overs and questions about sign language that the interested reader can click on to find information.</p><p>Students must have a rudimentary knowledge of American Sign Language or concurrently take an attachment in ASL language. A background in linguistics, theater, film, early childhood development, or education would be helpful. Students from Gallaudet University will join Swarthmore College students in this jointly taught course. We will travel to Gallaudet University three times and students from Gallaudet University will travel to Swarthmore College three times over the semester. Social sciences. 1 credit.

It has a number of typologically rare morphological and syntactic features, such as infixation and Noun-Adj-Det-Num word order. This course will investigate the major phonological, morphological, and syntactic structures of the language using both primary data and published sources. We will also look at the history of the language and its cultural/political context. Prerequisite: LING 050 and LING 045 or permission of the instructor. Social sciences. 1 credit.</p></div>

Structure of Kyrgyz</head><p>Kyrgyz is a Turkic language which is spoken throughout the Tien-Shanmountains and surrounding areas of Central Asia and has been influenced by Mongolian, Persian, Arabic, nd Russian. The grammar of Kyrgyz includes many intriguing phenomena, such as pervasive vowel p. 320</p><p>Linguistics harmony, productive sonority effects across syllable edges, a range of morphological and syntactic strategies for using one part of speech asanother, and an intricate system for marking tense, aspect, mood,voice, and evidentiality on verbs. In this course, students willexamine all aspects of Kyrgyz grammar, with a focus on the majorphonological, morphological, and syntactic structures of the language. Hands-on research using primary and secondary printed and digitalmaterials will guide this course. The historical and modern social and cultural contexts will also be considered. In this seminar, we address some traditional issues of concern to both linguistics and anthropology, framed in the context of the ongoing, precipitous decline in human linguistic diversity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Curriculum</head><p>Mathematics and statistics are among the great achievements of human intellect and at the same time powerful tools. As Galileo said, the book of the universe "is written in the language of mathematics." The goal of the department is to enable students to appreciate these achievements and use their power. To that end, majors and minors in the department receive a firm foundation in pure mathematics and the opportunity to apply it to a variety of disciplines, including statistics, physical science, biological science, computer science, social science, operations research, education, and finance. Students typically enter our department with strong skills, but there is always room for improvement and new knowledge. Majors and minors grow in:</p><p>• Reasoning skills: logical argument and abstraction; • Formulation skills: developing mathematical models; • Communication skills: expressing mathematical ideas and information clearly and precisely on paper, orally, and electronically; • Comprehension skills: absorbing mathematical ideas and information presented on paper, orally, and electronically; • Computation skills: mental, by hand, and by machine, as appropriate. Through core courses, students learn fundamental concepts, results, and methods. Through elective courses, they pursue special interests. In the process, students develop a further appreciation for the scope and beauty of our discipline. Graduates of the department follow many career paths. These paths lead to graduate school in mathematics, statistics, and other fields; to professional schools; and to the workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introductory Courses</head><p>Many first-year students entering Swarthmore have had calculus while in high school and place out of at least one semester of Swarthmore's calculus courses, whether they continue with calculus or decide, as is often best, to try other sorts of mathematics. See the discussion of placement later. However, some entering students have not had the opportunity to take calculus or need to begin again. Therefore, Swarthmore offers a beginning calculus course (MATH 015) and several courses that do not require calculus or other sophisticated mathematics experiences. These courses are STAT 001 (Statistical Thinking, Fall semester), MATH 003 (Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Spring semester), and STAT 011 (Statistical Methods I, both semesters). MATH 003 is a writing course. MATH 029 (Discrete Mathematics, both semesters) also does not require any calculus but is a more sophisticated course; thus, some calculus is a useful background for it in an indirect way. Once one has had or placed out of two semesters of calculus, many other courses are available, especially in linear algebra and several-variable calculus. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics and Statistics</head><p>To gain entrance to mathematics or statistics courses at any time during one's Swarthmore years, students are expected to take at least one of the following exams: the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, Swarthmore's Calculus Placement Exam, or Swarthmore's Math/Stat Readiness Exam. Students who do take AP or IB exams may be required to take the departmental exams as well, or parts thereof. In particular, students intending to take MATH 15 must take Swarthmore's Calculus Readiness Exam and those intending to take MATH 28 must take Swarthmore's Calculus Placement Exam. Versions of the Calculus Placement Exam and the Readiness Exam are available to entering first-year students over the summer, along with detailed information about the rules for placement and credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Credit</head><p>Placement and credit mean different things. Placement allows students to skip material they have learned well already by starting at Swarthmore in more advanced courses. Credit confers placement as well but also is recorded on the student's Swarthmore transcript and counts toward the 32 credits needed for graduation. The Swarthmore Calculus Placement Exam is used for placement only, not credit. The credit awarded on the basis of the AP and IB exams was updated during the 2018-2019 year and resulted in the following rules for students who matriculate in or after 2019:</p><p>• 1 credit (for STAT 011) for a score of 4 or 5 on the Statistics AP Test of the College Board. • 1 credit (for MATH 015) for a score of 4 or 5 on the AB Calculus AP Test of the College Board (or for an AB subscore of 4 or 5 on the BC Test) or for a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level Mathematics Test of the IB. • 2 credits (for MATH 015 and 025) for a main score of 4 or 5 on the BC Calculus AP Test. For students who matriculate in or before 2018, credit is awarded as follows:</p><p>• 1 credit (for STAT 011) for a score of 4 or 5 on the Statistics AP Test of the College Board. • 1 credit (for MATH 015) for a score of 4 on the AB or BC Calculus AP Test of the College Board (or for an AB subscore of 4 on the BC Test) or for a score of 5 on the Higher Level Mathematics Test of the IB. • 1.5 credits (for MATH 015 and the first half of MATH 025) for a score of 5 on the AB Calculus AP Test (or for an AB subscore of 5 on the BC Test) or a score of 6 or 7 on the higher-level IB. Students who receive this credit and want to continue calculus take MATH 026. • 2 credits (for MATH 015 and 025) for a main score of 5 on the BC Calculus AP Test. Students who receive placement but not credit for a course occasionally make use of 8.1 of the course catalog to arrange to take a course without regular attendance. See 8.1 for details. Students who are eligible on entrance for credit for a course, but who take the course anyway, will lose the entrance credit.</p><p>First-year students seeking advanced placement and/or credit for calculus taken at another college or university must normally validate their work by taking the appropriate external or Swarthmore placement examination, as described earlier. The department does not grant credit directly for college courses taken while a student is in high school. For work beyond calculus completed before entering Swarthmore, students should consult the departmental placement coordinator to determine the Swarthmore courses into which they may be placed and additional materials they may need to present for this placement. The department will not normally award credit for work above the first-year calculus level completed before entering Swarthmore.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major and Minor Application Process</head><p>Students apply for a major in the middle of the second semester of the sophomore year. Upon indication of intent to major (or minor) in the department, students will be assigned a departmental sophomore plan advisor who will help them decide on a reasoned plan of study for their last two years. This plan is then submitted to the department via their electronic Sophomore Plan. After the Sophomore Plan process is over, students may apply to add or change a major (or minor) at any time, but applications will normally be held until the next time that sophomore applications are considered (around March 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major Acceptance into the Major</head><p>The normal preparation for a major in mathematics is to have obtained credit for, or placement out of, at least four of the following five course groups by the end of the sophomore year: Calculus I (MATH 015), Calculus II (MATH 025 or 026), Discrete Mathematics (MATH 029), Linear Algebra (MATH 027 or 028), and Several Variable Calculus (MATH 033, 034, or 035). In any event, all majors must complete the Linear Algebra and Several Variable Calculus requirement by the end of the first semester of the junior year. To be accepted as a major or a minor, a candidate normally should have a grade point average of at p. 325 least C+ in courses taken in the department to date, including courses in the fall term of the first year, for which we have shadow grades. A candidate should have at least one grade at the B level. Students should be aware that upper-level courses in mathematics are typically more demanding and more theoretical than the first-and second-year courses. This is an important factor in considering borderline cases. In some cases, applicants may be deferred pending successful work in courses to be designated by the department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Course Major</head><p>By graduation, a mathematics major must have at least 10 credits in mathematics and statistics courses. At least 5 of the credits counted in the 10 must be for courses numbered over 040. (Courses numbered under 10 do not count toward the major in any event.) Furthermore, every major is required to obtain credit for, or place out of, each of the following course groups: MATH 015; MATH 025 or 026; MATH 027 or 028; MATH 033, 034, or 035; and MATH 097. MATH 097 is given in the fall only, and meets <ref type="bibr">Tuesdays,</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Normally, at least 3 of the 5 credits for courses numbered over 040 must be taken at Swarthmore, including MATH 097 and at least one upper level math writing course. Further requirements are listed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements for a Course Major in Mathematics:</head><p>All course majors in mathematics must obtain credit for, or place out of, MATH 063 (Introduction to Real Analysis) and MATH 067 (Introduction to Modern Algebra). Math 063 is offered each fall; Math 067 is offered each spring. Ideally, majors will have taken both by the end of their junior year. Of the 5 credits numbered over 040, at most one may be taken CR/NC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements for a Course Major in Mathematics with an Emphasis in Statistics:</head><p>All course majors in mathematics wishing to have a special emphasis in statistics must obtain credit for, or place out of, each of the following: Stat 021 (Statistical Methods II); Stat 051 (Probability); Math 063 (Introduction to Real Analysis); Stat 061 (Mathematical Statistics I); and Stat 111 (Mathematical Statistics II). Students also need placement or credit for CS 021. For majors with an emphasis in statistics, Stat 021 counts as a course numbered over 040. Students are advised to take CS 021 as early as possible, as it can be difficult to add this course in the junior or senior year. At least one of Stat 051 or Stat 061 must be taken at Swarthmore, and at most one of the 5 required courses listed above may be taken CR/NC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements for a Course Major in Mathematics with an Emphasis in Applied Math:</head><p>All course majors in mathematics wishing to have a special emphasis in applied math must obtain credit for, or place out of, each of the following: MATH 043 or 044 (Differential Equations); Math 063 (Introduction to Real Analysis); Math 066 (Stochastic and Numerical Methods); one of Math 054 (Partial Differential Equations) or Math 056 (Modeling); and one additional course choosen from Stat 051 (Probability), Math 054 (Partial Differential Equations), Math 056 (Modeling), or Math 103 (Complex Analysis). Students also need placement or credit for CS 021. Math 066 must be taken at Swarthmore, and at most one of the 5 required courses listed above may be taken CR/NC. Note that placement counts for satisfying the requirements but not for the 10-credit rule. Those students who are placed out of courses without credit must take other courses to obtain 10 credits. If you believe you are eligible for credit for courses taken before Swarthmore (because of AP or IB scores) but these credits are not showing on your transcript, please see the registrar. Mathematics majors are encouraged to study in some depth an additional discipline that makes use of mathematics. We also recommend that they acquire some facility with coding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit/No Credit Policy</head><p>At most one upper level course counted towards the major can be taken credit/no credit. This does not include courses which are only offered credit/no credit, but does include courses for which the grade is uncovered after completion of the course. In any case, no seminars can be taken credit/no credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Acceptance into the minors The requirements for acceptance into any course minor, such as prerequisite courses and grade average, are the same as for acceptance into the major. Students may not have more than one minor in the department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Course Minor</head><p>By graduation, a student with any type of course minor in the department must have at least 6 credits in mathematics and statistics courses. They must also have credit or placement for each of the following course groups: MATH 015; MATH 025 or 026; MATH 027 or 028; and MATH 033, 034, or 035. Courses numbered under 010 do not count towards the minor. Further requirements are listed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor in Mathematics:</head><p>All course minors in mathematics must have at least 3 credits in mathematics and statistics courses numbered 044 or higher, one of which must be either Math 063 (Introduction to Real Analysis) or Math 067 (Introduction to Modern Algebra). At least 2 of these 3 credits must be taken at Swarthmore and at most of one these 3 credits may be taken CR/NC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 326</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics and Statistics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor in Statistics:</head><p>All course minors in statistics must have credit or placement for each of the following: Stat 021 (Statistical Methods II); Stat 051 (Probability); and Stat 061 (Mathematical Statistics I). At most one of these 3 courses may be taken CR/NC and at least one of Stat 051 or Stat 061 must be taken at Swarthmore. Students must also have credit or placement for CS 021. Course Minor in Applied Math: All course minors in applied math must have credit or placement for each of the following: Math 043 or Math 044 (Differential Equations); Math 066 (Stochastic and Numerical Methods); one of Math 054 (Partial Differential Equations) or Math 056 (Modeling); and one additional course chosen from Stat 051 (Probability), Math 054 (Partial Differential Equations), Math 056 (Modeling), Math 063 (Introduction to Real Analysis), or Math 103 (Complex Analysis). At most one of these 4 courses may be taken CR/NC and Math 066 must be taken at Swarthmore. Students must also have credit or placement for CS 021.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit/No Credit Policy</head><p>For the math minor, at most one of the required upper level courses counted towards the minor can be taken credit/no credit. For the statistics minor, only one of Stat 21, Stat 51, and Stat 61 may be taken credit/no credit. For the applied math minor, at most one of the 4 required courses listed previously may be taken credit/no credit. This does not include courses which are only offered credit/no credit, but does include courses for which the grade is uncovered after completion of the course. In any case, no seminar can be taken credit/no credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>All current sophomores who wish to apply for Honors should indicate this in their Sophomore Plan and should work out a tentative Honors Program with their departmental advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic requirements</head><p>To be accepted as an Honors major in mathematics, a student should have a grade point average of at least B+ in courses taken to date, including courses taken in the fall term of their first year, for which the department has shadow grades. An Honors math major program consists of three preparations of two credits each, for a total of six distinct credits. One preparation must be in algebra and one in analysis (real or complex). The student must also satisfy all requirements of the mathematics major with the exception of the comprehensive requirement (MATH 097, Senior Conference). Note that to be an Honors math major, a student is required to also have an Honors minor in another subject.</p><p>Of the six credits used for a student's honor preparation, at most one may be taken credit/no credit (whether or not the grade is uncovered after the course is completed). In any case, no seminar may be taken credit/no credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparations</head><p>The department offers preparations in the fields listed below. Each preparation is subject to External Examination, including a 3-hour written examination and a 45-minute oral examination. Each preparation consists of a specified pair of credits. The specified credits are listed after each field. Algebra (067 and 102) Real Analysis (063 and 101) Complex Analysis (063 and 103) Geometry (either 065 and 106) Statistics (061 and 111) Topology (104, a 2-credit seminar) No course is allowed to count in two honors preparations, so it is not possible for a student to do honors preparations in both Real Analysis and Complex Analysis. The external examination component of the program is meant to prompt students to learn their core subjects really well and to show the examiners that they have done so-that is, show that they deserve Honors. However, no three fields cover everything a strong student would ideally learn as an undergraduate. Honors majors should consider including in their studies a number of advanced courses and seminars beyond what they present for Honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Honors Study/Portfolio</head><p>None is required or offered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>To be accepted as an Honors minor in mathematics, a student should have a grade point average of at least B in courses taken in the department to date, including courses in the fall term of the first year, for which the department has shadow grades. An Honors math minor consists of one preparation of two credits, chosen from those in the previous section. As mentioned before, no seminar may be taken credit/no credit. Note that to be an Honors math minor, a student is required to also have an Honors major in another subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>Courses taken elsewhere may count for the major. However, the number of upper-level transfer credits for the major is limited. Normally, at least 3 of the 5 upper-level courses used to fulfill the major must be taken at Swarthmore, including at least one of the core courses MATH 063 and MATH 067. Exceptions should be proposed and approved during the Sophomore Plan process, not after the fact. Also, the usual College rules for p. 327</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics and Statistics</head><p>transfer credit apply: students must see the professor in charge of transfer twice: in advance to obtain authorization, and afterwards to get final approval and a determination of credit. In particular, for MATH 063 and 067, students are responsible for the syllabus we use. If a course taken elsewhere turns out not to cover it all, the student will not get full credit (even though the transfer course was authorized beforehand) and the student will not complete the major until he or she has demonstrated knowledge of the missing topics. Similarly, for honors preparations students are responsible for the syllabi we use; we will not offer special honors exams based on work done at other institutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students planning to study abroad should obtain information well in advance about the courses available at the institution they plan to attend and check with the department about selecting appropriate courses. It may be difficult to find courses abroad equivalent to our core upper-level courses, or to our honors preparations, since curricula in other countries are often organized differently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Certification</head><p>Swarthmore offers teacher certification in mathematics through a program approved by the state of Pennsylvania and administered by the College's Educational Studies Department. For further information about the relevant set of requirements, please refer to the Educational Studies section of the Bulletin. One can obtain certification either through a mathematics major or through a Special Major in Mathematics and Education, in either case if taken with appropriate electives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics and Statistics Courses</head><p>Note 1: For courses numbered under 100, the ones digit indicates the subject matter, and the other digit indicates the level. In most cases, a ones digit of 1 or 2 means statistics, 3 to 6 means continuous mathematics, and 7 to 9 means noncontinuous mathematics (algebra, number theory, and discrete math). Courses below 10 do not count for the major, from 10 to 39 are first-and second-year courses, from 40 to 59 are intermediate, in the 60s are core upper-level courses; from 70 to 89 are courses that have one or more core courses as prerequisites, and in the 90s are independent reading courses. Note 2: There are several sets of courses below where a student may not take more than one of them for credit. For instance, see the descriptions of MATH 033, 034 and 035. In such cases, if a student does take more than one of them, each group is treated for the purpose of college regulations as if they have the same course number. See the Repeated Course Rule in section 8.2.4.</p></div>

Swarthmore's Medieval Studies Program offers students the opportunity to study in an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural fashion a variety of often interrelated medieval civilizations-European, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Islamic, South and West Asian-from the 4th to the 15th centuries. The program draws upon a variety of critical and cross-disciplinary approaches to explore medieval cultures, their distinctive qualities and historical connections, their material and spiritual productions, their artistic creations, and their relation to earlier and later cultures. The heart of the Medieval Studies Program is its interdisciplinary approach. The faculty and students in this program believe that the medieval period, its history, languages and literatures, art and architecture, religion and philosophy, music and meaning, are best studied from a variety of critical perspectives in which discipline and dialogue go hand in hand, where each person's knowledge is tested and expanded by another's approach, and where we come together in the words of Chaucer's Clerk to "gladly lerne and gladly teche."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>Students may major or minor in medieval studies in either the Course or Honors Program. Students must take work in a variety of medieval subjects to be drawn from art history, history, literature, music, religion, and philosophy. Majors often do research abroad on college-sponsored fellowships during the summer of their junior year and then write a thesis, which they present as seniors to an interdisciplinary Medieval Studies Committee or a panel of honors examiners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>All students who major or minor in medieval studies, either in honors or course, must fulfill the program's distribution requirements by taking medieval courses from the following distribution areas: 1. art history 2. history 3. literature (English, classics, etc.) 4. music 5. religion or philosophy. The list of Swarthmore medieval studies courses as well as medieval courses at Bryn Mawr and Haverford is regularly updated on the program website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>Course majors must take at least 8 credits in medieval subjects, including at least one medieval course in three of the five distribution areas, and pass a senior comprehensive which includes a written and oral exam given by the student's instructors in her or his medieval courses. These examinations are intended to be a culminating exercise to facilitate the review and integration of the various subjects and methods involved in the interdisciplinary field of medieval studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>Honors majors must take at least one medieval course in three of the five distribution areas. The Honors Program itself will include four doublecredit preparations in medieval subjects which reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the major and must include work in at least three of the distribution areas. The preparations may be constituted by some combination of the following: seminars, preapproved two-course combinations, courses with attachments, or a thesis. Senior Honors Study for honors majors in medieval studies will follow the policies of the individual departmental preparations used in the program. Honors majors will have a 90-to 120-minute oral panel examination with all four examiners present. These examinations are intended to be a culminating exercise to facilitate the review and integration of the various subjects and methods involved in the interdisciplinary field of medieval studies. Honors major normally do not have a separate minor as part of their Medieval Studies Honors Program, but they may apply one of their four honors preparations toward an honors minor. In such a case, a student must fulfill all the requirements set by the relevant department or program of that honors minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Course minors must take 5 credits in medieval subjects in at least two distribution areas. Only one of these credits can also be in the department of the student's major.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>Honors minors must take 5 credits in medieval subjects in at least two distribution areas. The honors preparation in a medieval subject should reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the minor and may be satisfied by one of the following: a seminar, a preapproved two-course combination, a course with an attachment, or in special cases a thesis. The minor preparation must be in a department distinct from the student's major. Senior Honors Study and written and oral honors exams will follow the pattern of the department in which the preparation is offered. Courses and seminars in the various departments which are counted as medieval studies courses are listed in the College Catalog and online. Students may also take medieval courses at Bryn Mawr or Haverford as part of their program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medieval Studies Courses</head><p>The following medieval studies courses are currently offered at Swarthmore. The Academic Program</p><p>Our courses balance traditional objects of study with emerging interdisciplinary projects on topics such as urban modernity, gender and sexuality, and media representations and manipulations of cultural values. Our curriculum engages the classics of world literature while also adapting to reflect the latest redefinitions and debates occurring within the Humanities. The linguistic knowledge students acquire in our courses enables them to speak and write confidently about texts and contexts, to go abroad and encounter the world and its residents in very different, more informed and meaningful ways. Along with demonstrated competence in the language, a foreign literature major will normally complete a minimum of 8 credits in courses in advanced language, literature, or culture, and a culminating exercise such as a thesis, an oral or written comprehensive examination, or honors examinations. Depending on the program, one or more courses for the major may be taken in English. The department encourages interdisciplinary approaches and pertinent special majors. Students interested in more than one literature are encouraged to consider a major in comparative literature. Students with strong interest in learning languages and their mechanics should also take note of the related major in Linguistics and Languages. The department collaborates with Educational Studies to help students who wish to get teacher certification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language Requirement</head><p>To receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science, candidates must fulfill a foreign language requirement. The foreign language requirement can be fulfilled by: a. Successfully studying 3 years or the "block" equivalent of a single foreign language in grades 9 through 12 (work done before p. 337</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modern Languages and Literatures (MLL)</head><p>b. grade 9 cannot be counted, regardless of the course level); c. Achieving a score of 600 or better on a standard achievement test of a foreign language; d. Passing either the final term of a collegelevel, yearlong, introductory foreign language course or a semester-long intermediate foreign language course; or e. Learning English as a foreign language while remaining demonstrably proficient in another. If you have fulfilled your language requirement, the department encourages you to use your time at Swarthmore to become truly proficient in that language, or to discover a new one. Students whose placement recommendation is above the language sequence should consider taking introductory and/or advanced courses, many of which fulfill the College's writing requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Tests</head><p>The Modern Languages and Literatures Department offers placement tests so as to appropriately position students in language classes when they arrive on campus. New students who have previously studied or have fluency in a language offered at Swarthmore should plan to take a placement test either online (French and German), during orientation week/the start of classes (Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese), or to meet with the section head (Russian). Students who have French/German AP/IB are also required to take the online placement test. Upperclass students interested in taking placement test should contact Michael Jones in the Language Resource Center for information and instructions (mjones1, 610-328-8036). For French only, first-year students with a 531 or higher on their online French placement test are required to take the written literature/culture essay placement test during orientation week to be correctly placed in a French class. Note: Placement Tests are not a substitute for an official standard achievement test of a foreign language (such as the College Board exam or the International Baccalaureate). Therefore, they do not serve as proof of achievement for the purpose of fulfilling the language requirement. These tests are only intended to assist instructors in placing students in the appropriate Swarthmore course. For additional information on placement visit each program's website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advancement Placement and International Baccalaureate Credit</head><p>The department will grant 1 credit for incoming students who achieved a score of 4 or 5 on Advanced Placement Chinese, French, German, Japanese or Russian examinations once they have successfully completed a one-credit course in that language at the College. The department will grant 1 credit for incoming students who have achieved a score of 6 or 7 in a foreign language on the International Baccalaureate once they have successfully completed a one-credit course in that language at the College. Students who took an AP or IB exam should consult the department for more information. Note: Students with French/German AP-IB scores are nonetheless required to take the online placement test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explanatory Note on First-and Second-Year Language Courses</head><p>Courses numbered 001-002, 003, and, in some languages also 004, carry 1.5 credits per semester. Four semesters in this sequence are equivalent to two or sometimes more years of work at the college level. These courses encourage development of communicative proficiency through an interactive task-based approach and provide students with an active and rewarding learning experience as they strengthen their language skills and develop their cultural competency These courses meet alternately as sections for grammar presentation and small groups for oral practice and may also require work in regular scheduled tutorials or in the Language Resource Center. Students who start in the 001-002 sequence must complete 002 to receive credit for 001. However, students placing directly in 002 can receive 1.5 semester credits for that course. Please note that students must register for both parts of the course in the 001-004 sequence, which meet five days per week. We offer teacher certification in modern languages (French, German, Russian, and Spanish) through a program approved by the state of Pennsylvania.

Study p. 338 abroad is particularly encouraged for students of Arabic; academic credit (full or partial) is generally approved for participation in programs of varying duration in different Arab countries that are recommended by the Arabic section. These include, but are not limited to, universities and programs in Jordan, Morocco, and Oman. Study abroad is particularly encouraged for students of Chinese; academic credit (full or partial) is generally approved for participation in several programs of varying duration in the People's Republic of China and in Taiwan, recommended by the Chinese section. In the People's Republic these include, but are not limited to, the Inter-University Program (IUP) Program at Tsing-hua University, the Associated Colleges in China (ACC) Program, the CET Program in Harbin and the Middlebury program in Kunming. In Taiwan, these include the International Chinese Language Program (ICLP) and the Mandarin Training Center in Taipei; and the Chinese Language Center, National Cheng Kung University in Tainan. All French/Francophone studies majors are required to complete a preapproved, semester-long study abroad program in a French-speaking country. Minors are strongly encouraged to attend such semester-long programs and should at least attend a preapproved six-week summer program in a francophone country. Students of German studies are strongly encouraged to spend at least a semester in a German-speaking country. There are several excellent opportunities to participate in an approved program, such as the Columbia Consortium Program in Berlin, the Macalester College German Study Program in Berlin/Vienna, or the Dickinson college program in Bremen. Students should consider going abroad in the spring semester. This will enable them to participate fully in the semester schedule of German and Austrian Universities. Students of Japanese are strongly encouraged to participate in study abroad programs. Swarthmore College participates in a regular exchange program with Tokyo University, and the Japanese Section has prepared a carefully selected list of other recommended programs in Kyoto, Nagoya, and elsewhere. Students interested in study abroad should consult with the head of the Japanese Section for more information. Students in Russian are strongly encouraged to spend at least one semester in the ACTR, CIEE, or Middlebury programs or at the Smolny Institute through Bard College, among others in Russia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literatures in Translation</head><p>Students who are already proficient in a particular foreign language are urged to select an appropriate literature/culture course taught in the original language. LITR courses provide students with the opportunity to study cultural material that they cannot read in the original and often to study literature in a comparative context. In some language programs, these courses cannot be substituted for the introductory course sequence between 010 and 020 to satisfy departmental prerequisites for a major or minor in the original languages, but many of these courses can satisfy the 8 credit requirement of a foreign literature/studies major as each section specifies.</p></div>

Manga, Bande Dessinée, and the Graphic Novel: A Transnational Study of Graphic Fictions</head><p>(Cross-listed as JPNS 018, FREN 018) This course provides an introduction to the study of three of the most important contemporary graphic literary forms -manga, bandes dessinées, and the graphic novel -and the national and transnational traditions with which they have become associated. Through a careful study of major artists and key works from Japan and the Francophone world, we explore the particular histories, aesthetic evolutions, and social impact of these sequential art forms, both in their specific places of origin and across the globe. We consider how these graphic fictions have managed to mirror and refract major issues of historical trauma, technology and violence, as well as how they question representations of gender, class, race and ethnicity, even as they wield a form of "soft power."

Women's Literature in Premodern China (Cross-listed as CHIN 036) Contrary to our stereotypes about the silent, invisible woman of premodern China, women actually wrote and published their work in unprecedented numbers from the late 16th century to the early 20th century. This course will explore the literary and historical significance of this output, which mainly took the form of poetry and prefaces to poetry collections, letters, some drama, and novels in verse, and which was produced primarily by gentry women (e.g. women from elite families), courtesans, and nuns. A central theme will be the place and problem of women's poetry in a male-dominated literary tradition and society. Topics to be addressed include the social function of poetry and women's literary networks, women's relationship to the publishing market as writers, editors, and readers, the forces driving male interest in women's writing at certain historical moments, and the changing ideas about what kinds of styles of past poets should be offered to boudoir poets as a repertoire of available choices to read and imitate.

Chinese Food Culture and Farming: Traditions and Transitions</head><p>(Cross-listed as CHIN 086, ENVS 052) While the challenging problem of feeding one fifth of the world's population with only seven percent of the world's arable land remains a priority in Chinese agricultural policy, extensive environmental degradation and innumerous food scandals have shifted the primary concern of food supply to issues of food safety, from quantity to quality. The class will focus on the challenges and successes of such a turn to a more ecologically friendly agricultural production and food processing industry. In addition, rapid changes in food preferences displace more traditional diets and redirect agricultural production, especially towards production of meat, bringing in foreign private equity firms like KKR and US food conglomerates like Tyson Foods. These changes also affect traditional regional food cultures. This interdisciplinary class (Environmental Studies, Economics, Sociology, Biology, humanities and Chinese Studies) will explore the following key topics: From food security to food safety -the ecological turn in China's agriculture, Organic farming in China -challenges and successes of state and private organic farm initiatives, Ministry plans and China's new farmers, Regional food Combining some of the greatest works of Chinese poetry with approaches and visual materials from the history of Chinese landscape painting, in this course we will examine the changing use of landscape as a medium to express different philosophical and social meanings by competing social groups across historical periods from early times to the 13th century. In the first half of this course, we will see how natural landscape in poetry became a medium for conveying a range different ideals and problems: official service and reclusion in the countryside, Daoist liberation and Buddhist enlightenment, the sorrows of war on the frontier or travel into exile. In the second half of this course, we then apply our knowledge of Chinese poetry to interpreting a series of paintings from the Song dynasty (960-1279). This period is the golden age of Chinese landscape painting. It saw the emergence of literati-painters who, much like the great painters of the Renaissance, argued that painting possessed the same expressive power as poetry. We will explore the ways they employed painting to comment on an unprecedented range of issues, including government affairs, the role of women in society, the relation of private to public life, as well as the experience of dynastic collapse and war. All primary texts will be read in the finest English translations available and we will make use of high-resolution on-line images. No Chinese language background is required. Humanities. 1 credit.

This course will explore the literary and historical significance of this output, which mainly took the form of poetry and prefaces to poetry collections, letters, some drama, and novels in verse, and which was produced primarily by gentry women (e.g. women from elite families), courtesans, and nuns. A central theme will be the place and problem of women's poetry in a male-dominated literary tradition and society. Topics to be addressed include the social function of poetry and women's literary networks, women's relationship to the publishing market as writers, editors, and readers, the forces driving male interest in women's writing at certain historical moments, and the changing ideas about what kinds of styles of past poets should be offered to boudoir poets as a repertoire of available choices to read and imitate.

In the first half of this course, we will see how natural landscape in poetry became a medium for conveying a range different ideals and problems: official service and reclusion in the countryside, Daoist liberation and Buddhist enlightenment, the sorrows of war on the frontier or travel into exile. In the second half of this course, we then apply our knowledge of Chinese poetry to interpreting a series of paintings from the Song dynasty (960-1279). This period is the golden age of Chinese landscape painting. It saw the emergence of literati-painters who, much like the great painters of the Renaissance, argued that painting possessed the same expressive power as poetry. We will explore the ways they employed painting to comment on an unprecedented range of issues, including government affairs, the role of women in society, the relation of private to public life, as well as the experience of dynastic collapse and war.</p><p>Humanities. 1 credit.

The class will focus on the challenges and successes of such a turn to a more ecologically friendly agricultural production and food processing industry. In addition, rapid changes in food preferences displace more traditional diets and redirect agricultural production, especially towards production of meat, bringing in foreign private equity firms like KKR and US food conglomerates like Tyson Foods. These changes also affect traditional regional food cultures. This interdisciplinary class (Environmental Studies, Economics, Sociology, Biology, humanities and Chinese Studies) will explore the following key topics:</p><p>• From food security to food safety -the ecological turn in China's agriculture (Cross-listed as POLS 087) Access to fresh water is an acute issue for the 21 st century, and yet civilizations have designed a wide range of inventive projects for accessing and controlling water supplies over the centuries. Fresh water resource allocation generates issues between upstream and downstream users, between a country and its neighbors, between urban and rural residents, and between states and regions. This course examines a range of fresh water issues, comparing China and the U.S. Topics include dams and large-scale water projects (e.g., rerouting rivers); water pollution; groundwater depletion; industrial water use (e.g., for hydrofracking); impact of agricultural practices; urban storm water management; wetlands conservation; desertification; desalination. What role do governments, transnational organizations, corporations, NGOs and grassroots citizens' movements play in these water decisions?

Special Topics in English: Text and Image: Classical Chinese Painting and Poetry From Early Times to the Middle Period (Cross-listed as LITR 091CH) Combining some of the greatest works of Chinese poetry with approaches and visual materials from the history of Chinese landscape painting, in this course we will examine the changing use of landscape as a medium to express different philosophical and social meanings by competing social groups across historical periods from early times to the 13th century. In the first half of this course, we will see how natural landscape in poetry became a medium for conveying a range different ideals and problems: official service and reclusion in the countryside, Daoist liberation and Buddhist enlightenment, the sorrows of war on the frontier or travel into exile. In the second half of this course, we then apply our knowledge of Chinese poetry to interpreting a series of paintings from the Song dynasty (960-1279). This period is the golden age of Chinese landscape painting. It saw the emergence of literati-painters who, much like the great painters of the Renaissance, argued that painting possessed the same expressive power as poetry. We will explore the ways they employed painting to comment on an unprecedented range of issues, including government affairs, the role of women in society, the relation of private to public life, as well as the experience of dynastic collapse and war. All primary texts will be read in the finest English translations available and we will make use of high-resolution on-line images. No Chinese language background is required. Humanities. 1 credit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Goals</head><p>The French and Francophone Studies Program seamlessly articulates the acquisition of French linguistic skills with cultural and literary knowledge and sensitivity throughout our 4-year curriculum. We provide students with global competence in the Francophone world through an innovative curriculum that combines national and transnational Francophone literatures, cultures and histories, with an emphasis on modern and contemporary periods. Students build a crosscultural understanding with the goal of participating in an increasingly interconnected world. Starting with our French language courses (Fr 1 through 14), students are introduced to modern France and a variety of French-speaking countries such as Algeria, Belgium, Haiti and Senegal. In our advanced courses (Fr 40 and above), students develop an in-depth, critical and comparative understanding of the textual, filmic, and cultural productions of each of these regions. We aim to:</p><p>A. Make students proficient in the four fundamental language competencies (listening, reading, speaking and writing), as well as develop a fifth, cultural competency, through explorations of culture and society in France and the Francophone World. This is a substantial element in achieving global competence as described above. Fr 1 through Fr 14: In the intensive French language sequence <ref type="figure">(Fr 1 through 14)</ref>, students develop an advanced proficiency in the five competencies delineated above. For further details on the language sequence, how it relates to internationally recognized standards, and proficiency as it relates to study abroad, contact the French section head. Fr 15 W and Fr 16: These written and aural/oral competencies are further refined. Students develop a sensibility to literary, filmic, cultural, and socio-political questions in modern French and Francophone societies. They learn to produce coherent, logical and persuasive arguments from a variety of texts and films, and learn to adopt different formats for that purpose (explication de texte, rédaction, research paper, and opEd). Fr 40 and above: Students demonstrate an extensive and intentional grappling with the topic of the course. They are further introduced to comparative methodologies and scholarly criticism, and learn to consistently articulate their reflection in persuasive ways and support their opinions through evidence. Seminars Fr 100 and above: Students master critical thinking and demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the course topic through student-led discussions and research papers. Capstone Fr 91 W: Majors and minors demonstrate an appropriate knowledge of the mechanics of scholarly research (develop a valid research question and a rigorous and coherent argument, craft an abstract, investigate secondary sources, develop a bibliographical apparatus). The goal of this competency includes the writing in French of an original, independent research paper of 20/30 pages on a topic chosen in discussion with the senior colloquium professor. B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GMST 100. German Studies Research Seminar</head><p>This senior seminar focuses on interdisciplinary research done within German Studies and between German Studies and its adjacent disciplines (e.g. Art, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Film and Media Studies, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology). For the first two weeks of the semester, the seminar will trace the development of German Studies methodologies and discuss the histories and theories that inform them. After developing a clear research trajectory with a research statement, guiding questions and a working bibliography, from October to November students will work on their own research topic with weekly guidance from the faculty member and team-based discussion meetings. This seminar will provide seniors (and juniors upon approval) with an opportunity to connect their (inter)disciplinary major to their minor through thorough analytical work that will prepare them not only for honors at Swarthmore, but also for post-graduate careers and continuing education. Drafts of the projects (minimum of 25 pages) will be workshopped with seminar participants in November, and presentations will be held colloquium-style with GMST and affiliated faculty and students at the end of the semester. The final drafts will be submitted to undergraduate and graduate publications in the field. Humanities. 2 credits.</p></div>

Berlin and Beyond: Cultural Trends and Current Affairs (Cross-listed as LITR 007) This half-credit course invites students to explore the urban culture of Berlin, a European hotspot for politics, the arts, media, high-tech start-ups, and clubbing. Venturing beyond the capital, students then examine facets of Germany's contemporary cultural, social, and political landscape. Students will help select specific topics for readings, discussions, and presentations, and participants interested in developing their German language skills will have the opportunity to engage with relevant texts and media in German. This course explores the notion of testimony as an important aspect of a literature of resistance. We investigate how testimony intertwines with questions of writing and truth, and creates a response to cultural violence. Students read theories and literature of resistance and testimony in a wide-ranging selection of time periods and cultures, from the formation of a philosophical and religious idea of testimony in antiquity (Greek and Judeo-Christian traditions) to its later development in theories of Emmanuel Levinas. We will also study the emergence of the literary notion of testimony by analyzing works of poetry, narrative, and film, with a particular focus on Jewish responses to the Shoah, and Latin American and Latino responses to political and social repression.

Humanities. 1 credit. Spring 2020. Blasina. Simon.</p><p>GMST 029. Theater of Intervention: After Shakespeare and Müller (Cross-listed as THEA 011C) In this course students will read selected texts by William Shakespeare and Heiner Müller, identify relevant contemporary themes and then create their own performances. The goal of the class is for the student to create work without distinctions between writing, acting and directing-the director as performer, the actor as the author of their own expression. This work also seeks to remove any separation between the artist and the citizen, political thinker, and activist. This course is an introduction to German cinema from its inception in the 1890s until the present. It includes an examination of early exhibition forms, expressionist and avant-garde films from the classic German cinema of the Weimar era, fascist cinema, postwar rubble films, DEFA films from East Germany, New German Cinema from the 1970s, and post 1989 heritage films.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>JPNS 042. Language Policy and Planning in Japan</head><p>Language policy and planning is a fundamental aspect of society: it has the potential to enrich the quality of human lives or impose great conflicts and struggles in our everyday lives. Despite its image of homogeneity, Japanese society has a much linguistic diversity and a great number of linguistic minorities, including indigenous groups and immigrants; however, it is questionable if the society has provided a systematic support to p. 379 maintain this diversity. Japan is also constantly facing the need to improve its language education, although, arguably, the attempts so far have been rather unsuccessful. This course aims to understand the current state of Japanese society in light of these political issues relevant to Japanese language.While learning the basic notions and theoretical approaches in language policy, the course will cover topics including historical aspects of language policy in Japan, linguistic minorities in Japan, legal issues of languages in Japan, and issues regarding Japanese language education as well as foreign/second/ heritage language education. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to critically consider the politics of using their own language as well as Japanese.</p><p>Readings and discussion will be in English. Some knowledge of Japanese is recommended but not required for this course. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Russian The Academic Program</head><p>The major in Russian language and literature covers the rise and development of Russian literature and culture up to the present. Students will encounter critical theory and develop skill in critical analysis, approaching Soviet and Russian literature and culture in relationship to historical and social forces. Our courses emphasize culture as well as literature: indeed, understanding Russian literature and other arts is impossible without some background in the history and civilization. Because Russian is a small program, we are very responsive to student demand and can develop courses almost to order, if there is sufficient interest. Students interested in a combined Russian language and linguistics major may develop a program with advanced courses and seminars in the language offered at Bryn Mawr or the University of Pennsylvania and the Linguistics Department at Swarthmore College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Russian in Combination with Other Programs</head><p>In the Course Program, Russian contributes to majors in comparative literature, film and media studies, and linguistics and to the concentrations in interpretation theory and gender and sexuality studies. Thematic courses in Russian culture can support majors or minors in history, music, philosophy, and political science and concentrations in Asian studies, Environmental studies, Global studies, Islamic studies and Peace and Conflict studies. A Russian honors minor fits well with an honors major in the humanities or social sciences, and nicely rounds out majors in engineering or the natural sciences. In the Honors Program, Russian contributes to the major or minor in comparative literature or linguistics and languages. By including advanced coursework at Bryn Mawr College, Russian can be part of a special major in educational studies for teacher certification. There is no distinction between qualification for the Russian Course Program and for the Honors Program. We recommend a minimum of one semester or summer of study in Russia. Majors and minors are urged to build and maintain fluency by taking Russian Conversation (RUSS 006A), and to support their work in the field with courses in anthropology, art, cognitive science, film and media studies, history, music, philosophy, political science, religion, sociology, theater, and other literatures. RUSS 091, the seminar attachment, may be added to any course numbered 020 or above to convert it to a seminar, for a total of two credits. The additional work is done in the original language and supported by regular meetings with the professor, readings, discussions, and significant writing assignments in Russian. We anticipate that most seminar work will be done in this format. If there is sufficient student demand, we can offer advanced seminars in any of the following areas:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Course Recommendations</head><p>Although it is often possible to take intensive Russian courses over the summer, students interested in majoring or minoring in Russian, including Russian in a major in Comparative Literature or Linguistics and Languages, or using the language for research in other fields should begin study with RUSS 001 and RUSS 002 in their first year. . Credit from study abroad may be used toward 3 of these credits. 5. One two-credit seminar: RUSS 100 and above. For students who choose not to emphasize literature, a Russian history course may be used to fulfill one content credit. Possible courses include HIST 001Q, HIST 038, and HIST 039. Students should consult Russian Section Faculty if they wish to arrange attachments to these courses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Opportunities</head><p>Besides summer abroad study or internships, and the possibility of arranging for summer humanities research under the supervision of Russian program faculty, students interested in summer language study in Russia or in summer programs in the U.S. may apply for financial support from the Olga Lamkert Fund. Russian is certified as a critical language by U.S. government agencies, meaning that for both summer study and study abroad there is funding available to support students of Russian, especially if they are working to reach a high level of proficiency. Ask us for information on this financial assistance, and for support in applying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life After Swarthmore</head><p>A major or minor in Russian can enhance a variety of career choices: strong language skills bolster any other program of work, research or study, while knowledge of literature and culture offers subtle or obvious advantages in business, politics, science and medicine. Like other less commonly taught languages, Russian on your college transcript suggests to potential employers or graduate school admissions committees that you are smart and adventurous, willing to try a challenging new subject of study and able to master it by completing a major or a minor. </p></div>

Russian Phonetics (Cross-listed as LING 008A) This course does not require any previous knowledge of Russian. It was originally conceptualized as an opportunity for students of Russian to develop their pronunciation; however, it will also allow linguists to put theory into practice with the pursuit of the acquisition of Russian phonetics. This is ultimately a practical course; therefore, attention will be focused on resetting the default positions of the tongue, jaw and lips (or, as the Russians have it, the "articulation foundation"). Work on the production of the individual phonemes will be followed by the study of phonetic rules, which govern the production of consecutive sounds in word and phrases, and by the study of intonational constructions. 0.5 credit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RUSS 012. Russian Culture through Film</head><p>The purpose of this course is to study the ways in which Russian filmmakers have used the medium of cinema to explore history, culture, politics, and social issues prevalent in the Russian society at different periods of its development. The course will follow the development of Soviet and Russian cinema from the Golden Age of silent films, through the periods of Socialist Realism, WWII, the Thaw, Stagnation, Perestroika, and finally -the Russian Federation up to the present day. In addition to exploring Russian history and culture, in this course special attention will be paid to the medium itself -cinema. As storytelling device, as historical document, as expression of imagination, as artistic object, there is no form more capable of capturing our interest and provoking the senses. Therefore, some of the main objectives in this course will be: To understand the nature and process of film production To learn how to "read" and analyze film To explore the major aesthetic trends in the history of cinema and familiarize ourselves with the main theoretical and critical approaches to film theory. The films and readings assigned for each class meeting are selected because of their relevance to theories for the week (often this relevance will be implicit rather than explicit) -for instance: The Photographic Image and Sound, The Cinematic Narrator, Reality and Film, The Film Spectator, Film Genre, etc. The goal of the course is not to focus on any single theory or group of theories, but rather to review a large selection of theories, and allow the students to practice applying these theories to film, so that by the end of the course each student will have the critical tools to provide an informed verbal and written film analysis, and be able to discuss how various aesthetic and ideological approaches to filmmaking influence cinema practice over time. Best known for political priorities and philosophical depth, Russian literature has also devoted many works to the eternal concern of love and sex. We will read significant and provocative works from traditional folk tales through the 20th century to discuss their construction of these most "natural" impulses -and how they imagine the relationship of human attraction to art, politics and philosophy.</p><p>Humanities.

Reading the Russian Media</head><p>The Russian media (средства массовой информации) offer a wide range of political positions, language styles, and thematic interests. In this course we will read and watch widely, following both current events and particular student interests. Projects will emphasize all areas of language proficiency (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and may contribute to your work in other courses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RUSS 019. Russian Culture Through Music</head><p>(Cross-listed as MUSI 004C) Music has always played a central role in Russian cultural life. By shaping and responding to various cultural, social, and political changes, it has served as a space for the construction and negotiation of individual and national identity. This course will begin with a brief historical survey, touching upon the folk tradition and the beginning of Russian classical music and opera -Glinka, Musorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, etc. We will also examine the development of Russian music through different historical periods, concentrating on an area of common interest for the specific group of students enrolled in the course. Some of the questions this course will pose, and hopefully answer, at least partially, are: How does a piece of music reflect the ideological and political situation of its time? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RUSS 106. The Culture of Dissent in Russia</head><p>This Russian-language seminar will explore artistic and non-fictional expressions of dissent throughout the last 100 years. Texts will be considered in their cultural and historical contexts as we examine dissent not only as a political act, but also as a highly personal and existential one. Readings will be selected partly in consultation </p></div>

Folklore in Russian Literature</head><p>Folklore is both an enormous field of human culture, and a rich source of literary plots, genres, ideas and materials for writers, scholars, and theorists of all directions. In this course we will read works of Russian literature in which folklore plays a significant role, as well as exploring several of the areas of Russian folklore that have most influenced literature.</p><p>Humanities. 2 credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RUSS 115. Dissidence in Russian Literature</head><p>This course will explore one of the most appealing components of Russian literature, reading controversial Russian literary and publicistic texts, written from the early 18th century through the beginning of the 21st century. The works carry hidden meanings that reward deep reading and multiple readings, and they convey a wealth of information and opinion about historical, moral, political, and existential questions. We will read the very best of these dissident writers, and each student will write a substantial research paper based on individual interests. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music</head><p>The study of music as a liberal art requires an integrated approach to theory, history, and performance, experience in all three fields being essential to the understanding of music as an artistic and intellectual achievement. Theory courses train students to understand and hear how compositions are organized. History courses introduce students to methods of studying the development of musical styles and genres and the relationship of music to other arts and areas of thought. The department encourages students to develop performing skills through private study and through participation in the chorus, gamelan, jazz ensemble, orchestra, wind ensemble, and the Fetter Chamber Music Program, which it staffs and administers. The department assists instrumentalists and singers to finance the cost of private instruction. (See "Individual Instruction" under the heading "Credit for Performance.")</p><p>The Academic Program</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>The music major curriculum normally includes the following components. Every student's program is subject to approval by music faculty, taking into consideration the student's background and goals. We welcome individualized proposals, which are evaluated and approved on the basis of consultations with the music faculty. We emphasize the importance of depth and mastery of musical skills and understanding, and we also recognize the value of studying the diversity of musical cultures. • Keyboard Skills Exam • Department ensemble for at least four semesters The following is a description of these additional requirements: Keyboard skills. This program is designed to develop keyboard proficiency to a point where a student can use the piano effectively as a tool for studying music. Students learn to perform repertoire and, in addition, play standard harmonic progressions in all keys. The department offers free private lessons to all majors and minors who need support in this area. No academic credit is given for these lessons. All music majors are expected to be able to perform a two-part Invention of J. S. Bach (or another work of similar difficulty) by their senior year. Department ensemble. The department requires majors and minors to participate in any of the departmental ensembles (Orchestra, Chorus, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, Chinese Music Ensemble, and Gamelan). We also recommend that students participate in other activities, such as playing in Chamber Music ensembles or seeking out service-learning experiences that incorporate music.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>A. Required. At least two courses in Music Theory plus Musicianship sections (MUSI 040). MUSI 040 may be taken for 0.0 or 0.5 credit at the student's option. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Senior Honors Recital. A Senior Honors</head><p>Recital preparation is available only to students who have distinguished themselves as performers. It is normally limited to those who have won full scholarships through MUSI 048. Students who wish to pursue this option must follow all of the steps listed in the departmental guidelines for senior recitals (see department website) and obtain approval of their program from the music faculty during the semester preceding the proposed recital. They should register for MUSI 099: Senior Honors Recital. This full credit, together with at least another full credit of relevant coursework in music, will constitute the 2-credit honors preparation. One faculty member will act as head advisor on all aspects of the honors recital. As part of the honors recital, the student will write incisive program notes on all of the works to be performed. This work will be based on substantive research --including analytical as well as historical work --and will be overseen by one or more members of the music faculty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Senior Thesis.</head><p>Students are encouraged to propose honors preparations in any areas that are of particular interest, whether or not formal seminars are offered in those areas. The music faculty will assist in planning the most appropriate format for these interests.</p><p>Oral examinations are given for all honors preparations in music. Written examinations, in addition to oral examinations, are given for those preparations based on courses or seminars, not for theses, performances, and composition portfolios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>A. Required. Two courses in Music Theory plus Musicianship sections (MUSI 040). MUSI 040 may be taken for 0.0 or 0.5 credit at the student's option. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music and Dance: Music Off Campus Study/Language Study</head><p>Students are encouraged to seek possibilities for off campus study, in accordance with their particular interests, in consultation with the music faculty and the off-campus study advisor. Students are advised that many graduate programs in music require a reading knowledge of at least two languages, with one most commonly being either German or French.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Process Notes for the Major or the Minor</head><p>We do not have a minimum grade point average (GPA) for admission as a major or minor. In its place is a consensus of music faculty that the student can do good work in the discipline. The situation is perhaps more complex in music than in other fields because we think that a major (or minor) should have basic musical as well as purely intellectual abilities, not all of which can be measured by a GPA. We do consider the likelihood of a student's passing the Comprehensive Examination. Students applying for admission as majors in the Honors Program should have done exceptionally high-quality work in the department and should have shown strong self-motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisites for acceptance into the program:</head><p>For acceptance as a music major: MUSI 011/040A and one Music History/Ethnomusicology course from the list below. For acceptance as a music minor: MUSI 002B or MUSI 011/040A or one Music History/ Ethnomusicology course from the list below. If a student has not completed these prerequisites at the time of an application for a major/minor, but has done good work in one or more courses in the department, acceptance may be granted on a provisional basis. Music History/Ethnomusicology courses that can be applied towards acceptance into the program: MUSI 002C, MUSI 004A, MUSI 004B, MUSI 005A, MUSI 005B, MUSI 005C, MUSI 006A, MUSI 006B, MUSI 006C, MUSI 008A, MUSI 008B, MUSI 020, MUSI 021, MUSI 022, MUSI 023, MUSI 027, MUSI 028 MUSI 031, MUSI 035.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Resources</head><p>Special scholarships and awards in music include the following (see 17 Distinctions, Awards, and Fellowships  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">047)</ref>, or Performance Gamelan (MUSI 049A) for credit with the permission of the department member who has the responsibility for that performance group. The amount of credit received will be a half-course in any one semester. Students applying for credit will fulfill requirements established for each activity (i.e., regular attendance at rehearsals and performances and participation in any supplementary rehearsals held in connection with the activity). Students are graded on a credit/no credit basis. Students wishing to take Chamber Music (MUSI 047) for credit must submit to the chamber music coordinator at the beginning of the semester a proposal detailing the repertory of works to be rehearsed, coached, and performed during the semester. It should include the names of all student performers and the proposed performance dates, if different from the Elizabeth Pollard Fetter Chamber Music Program performance dates. One semester in a Department Ensemble is a prerequisite or co-requisite for each semester of MUSI 047. This applies to all students in each Fetter Chamber group. It is expected that Fetter students in Department Ensembles will play the same instrument/voice in both activities. A student taking MUSI 047 for credit will rehearse with his or her group or groups at least 2 hours every week and will meet with a coach (provided by the department) at least every other week. All members of the group should be capable of working well both independently and under the guidance of a coach. It is not necessary for every person in the group to be taking MUSI 047 for credit, but the department expects that those taking the course for credit will adopt a leadership role in organizing rehearsals and performances. Note: MUSI 047 ensembles do not fulfill the ensemble requirement for lessons under MUSI 048.</p></div>

How about the thrill of revenge, exquisite music, demented theater, and hunchbacks? Please read on.. This class explores the exhilarating musical, dramatic and cultural tightrope walk that is opera. Before there was Justin Timberlake there was Farinelli, and way before today's trans movement there was normalized gender bending. We will examine key works from opera's 400-year history and take a closer look at the unfolding of this deeply human, monumental art form and the forces that have tried, unsuccessfully, to kill it over the last century. This class is intended to demystify what is often seen as an elitist music, and requires no pretentiousness or previous operatic experience. Humanities. 1 credit. Spring 2021. Milewski.</p></div>

By shaping and responding to various cultural, social, and political changes, it has served as a space for the construction and negotiation of individual and national identity. This course will begin with a brief historical survey, touching upon the folk tradition and the beginning of Russian classical music and opera -Glinka, Musorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, etc. We will also examine the development of Russian music through different historical periods, concentrating on an area of common interest for the specific group of students enrolled in the course. Some of the questions this course will pose, and hopefully answer, at least partially, are: How does a piece of p. 394 music reflect the ideological and political situation of its time? How does it reveal the aesthetic sensibilities and aspirations of the composers, their listeners, and society at large? How has music's function as breeding ground for social and cultural values changed in post-Soviet times? Humanities. 1 credit.</p></div>

Traditional Musics of World Cultures</head><p>Introduction to world music and ethnomusicology via a set of case studies on traditional music and music-making practices. This course stresses music as an integral to--constitutive of, rather than separate from--the culture in which it is rooted. Within this framework we will discuss how the concept of "tradition" does not necessarily imply historical fact, but can be more influenced by understandings of and nostalgic feelings about "the past" as commentary and critique of the present. The course's final project will consist of individual ethnographic projects, in which students engage with a local community group or musicians involved in some form of traditional music practice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MUSI 005D. The Art of the American Musical</head><p>(Cross-listed as ENGL 095A, THEA 005B) The triumph of Hamilton: An American Musical, by Lin-Manuel Miranda, over Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed, by George C. Wolfe, at the 2016 Tony Awards is a metaphor for the racial amnesia concerning art by and about blacks who are not useful to neoliberal public policy. This course applies #blacklivesmatter to the American musical--between the all-black-cast revival, Beyoncé, biological versus social origins of race, black culture in a "post-soul" era, blackface versus black-on-black minstrelsy, the chitlin circuit, color-blind versus conceptual casting, genre, gospel, and reviews of Porgy and Bess, by George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, and DuBose Heyward, in black daily newspapers and black monthly and weekly magazines--taking seriously Wolfe's claim about intellectual history that "given the dynamics of this country, you may find yourself at a point where your story is no longer valuable, acute or attractive, and if it hasn't been recorded, if you haven't recorded it or if you haven't put into motion people to record it, then it won't be there." These topics require students to conduct research into the African-American experience in the musical as well as listen to sound recordings of Broadway, Off-Broadway, regional/tour, and West End stage works and watch film, television, video, and video clips on YouTube. Humanities. 1 credit. Eligible for BLST This team-taught course investigates the histories, structures and cultural connections between popular music and other media. How do musical expressions and genres interact with medium specificity? How can we understand changing exhibition formats (stadium vs. lounge vs. club) and distribution venues (record store vs. Spotify)? How does celebrity culture then and now impact what is popular and how does it affect the music industry and vice versa? What lies at the intersection of national, socio-political and fan cultures? Providing a grounding in music and media history and theory, we will research and analyze mainstream and independent case studies in radio, film, theater, television and social media in order to better understand and engage with the complex webs that characterize contemporary media, its production, and its consumption.

Music, Politics, and Society in the Modern Middle East: 1922-2016</head><p>Home to many of the world's oldest civilizations and major religions, the Middle East remains a region of remarkable cultural diversity. From the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922 to the Arab Spring and the current refugee crisis, this vast territory has experienced extraordinary political and social change over the past nearly one hundred years. While often riven by conflict, the Middle East is also a site of ever-renewing intellectual, artistic, and political movements. The musical soundtrack to this constellation of dynamic forces is rich and complex, animated by shifting social environments and ongoing intercultural encounters. Arabs, Turks, Persians, Jews, Kurds, Greeks, Berbers, Armenians, Assyrians, and many other ethno-linguistic and religious identities all claim unique forms of musical expression, mirroring in many cases their environments-rural, urban, desert, coastal, seafaring, nomadic, antiquated, hypermodern, pious, and defiantly secular. In this course we will examine nearly a p. 396 century of music making in the Middle East focusing on Turkey, Iran, and the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa. Readings, audio examples, films, and in-class music making will address the ways that music of the Middle East intersects with religious practices, nationalism, gender, sexuality, language, ethnicity, migration, and protest movements. Through an exploration of elite, popular, folk, and sacred music among others, we will attempt to make sense of the rich and varied soundscapes of the modern Middle East. 1 credit.

Color and Spirit: Music of Debussy, Stravinsky, and Messiaen</head><p>A focused survey of 20th-century music centering on the great renewal of musical expression, increasingly diverging from the Austro-German classic-Romantic tradition, found in the works of these three very individual French and Russian composers, as well as the resonance of their music in the work of their contemporaries and successors, including Ravel, Dukas, Prokofiev, Boulez, and others. The course begins by tracing the origins of this "alternative" conception of what music can do, and how it can work, well back into the 19 th century, especially in the music of Liszt and the Russian "Mighty Handful", then considers its continuing and seminal contribution to musical modernism throughout the 20th century.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance</head><p>At Swarthmore, dance is a global discourse. The dance and music programs share an integrated approach to composition, history, performance, and theory in lecture/discussion and studio practice courses. We believe this is central to the understanding of dance as an artistic, intellectual, and social inquiry within a liberal arts context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>The mission of the program is to offer students dance experiences that privilege a merging of embodied practice and history/theory in relation to more than one situated perspective (those listed above). Some courses concentrate on one cultural context only (this is true generally in history, repertory, and technique). Others put a variety of perspectives in conversation (choreographic laboratories, improvisation, history, repertory, and theory).The role of dance as an agent of social change is also present in Swarthmore dance offerings. All dance studies courses engage students in an investigation of the relationship of dance to other arts and areas of thought. Given the program's emphasis on developing an awareness of the global nature of dance, study abroad opportunities are seen as a very useful aspect of a student's undergraduate dance experience. Such study is especially encouraged for dance majors and minors. Study abroad dance programs developed by members of the dance faculty are available in France, Ghana, India, Japan, and United Kingdom. Dance components are also available in programs in Spain and Argentina. Social change engagement is available as an aspect of study abroad experiences in Ghana, India, and Northern Ireland. Additional information regarding study abroad experiences is listed below and can also be found on both the Dance Program and Off-Campus Study websites. In order to further enhance student engagement with the field at large, every year the program hosts diverse national and international dance artists and scholars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Major</head><p>The program for a Special Major comprises a minimum of five credits in dance coursework. The two disciplines in this major may be philosophically linked or may represent separate areas of the student's interest. The faculty encourages students to consider the philosophical links between the two disciplines. Examples of past special majors include: Dance and Anthropology, Dance and Art, Dance and Biology, Dance and Education, and Dance and Psychology. Special Majors are encouraged to take at least one dance class before applying. All Special Majors will design their programs in consultation with a faculty advisor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Information Regarding the Dance Program</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance Technique Courses</head><p>In a typical semester, more than 30 hours of dance technique classes are offered on graded levels presenting a variety of movement styles. Technique courses, numbered 040 through 048, 050 to 053, and 060 or 061, may be taken for academic credit or may be taken to fulfill physical education requirements. Advanced dancers are encouraged to consult with instructors regarding placement in level III technique classes. A total of not more than 8 full credits (16 0.5-credit courses) in performance dance technique classes and in music performance classes may be counted toward the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor of science. No retroactive credit is given for performance classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dance Program Performance Opportunities</head><p>All interested students are encouraged to enroll in repertory classes (DANC 049, 071 or 078) and/or to audition for student and faculty works. These auditions occur several times each semester; dates are announced in classes and in postings outside the dance studios. Formal concerts take place toward the end of each semester; informal studio concerts are scheduled throughout the year. The Dance Program regularly sponsors guest artist teaching and performance residencies. In addition, the program regularly hosts guest choreographers who work with student ensembles in technique and repertory classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Given the Dance Program's emphasis on the crosscultural study of dance, we strongly encourage students to pursue study abroad opportunities. The possibility to study dance in another country gives students the opportunity to hone their technique in a different cultural setting (in many cases in a different language!) as well as to explore dance studies and choreography from new perspectives and styles. In recent years, students from the Dance Program have studied in countries including England, France, Ghana, India, and Japan as well as pursuing intensive dance study through domestic off-campus study programs. Swarthmore has a special affiliation with the University of Ghana, where students have the opportunity to study traditional dances from a wide variety of ethnic groups and regions of Ghana as well as drumming and singing. Majors and minors interested in off-campus study should contact their faculty advisor for assistance in identifying an appropriate program.</p></div>

Performance in Early Modern Europe</head><p>As Enlightenment ideals gave way to Revolutionary impulses, dancers doubled as singers, circus performers shared their stages, and entertainments took place on the fairgrounds and in aristocratic palaces. Performances in these distinctive multi-genre traditions raise a number of questions that are equally relevant for us today: What is the artwork? How can we restate a history that was intended to be fleeting? What is the relationship between "text" and performance? This course explores the hybrid genres of dance, mime, music and drama from the past to analyze their present relevance as "art."

In this seminar, we explore 'dance and disability' through the paradigm of choreography and consider the choreographic possibilities of disability in our shared contemporary political climate. Through readings, choreographic analysis, and discussion, we will discover, question, and analyze how 'choreography' and 'disability' are entwined political concepts that inform and instruct ways of being and moving. Assigned readings will draw from dance studies scholarship and emerging texts in the field of disability studies. We will study a range of choreographic sites created by, featuring, and/or about individuals who identify as disabled. These sites will include recorded and live performances.

Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies</head><p>In Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies, we learn that peace and conflict are not mutually exclusive. To paraphrase Conrad Brunk, the goal of peace and conflict studies is to better understand conflict in order to find nonviolent ways of turning unjust relationships into more just ones. We examine both the prevalence of coercive and non-peaceful means of conducting conflict as well as the development of nonviolent alternatives, locally and globally, through institutions and at the grassroots. The latter include nonviolent collective action, mediation, peacekeeping, and conflict transformation work. Several theoretical and philosophical lenses will be used to explore cultural and psychological dispositions, conflict in human relations, and conceptualizations of peace. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach with significant contributions from the social sciences. U.S.-based social justice movements, such as the struggle for racial equality, and global movements, such as nonviolent activism in Israel/Palestine, and the struggle for climate justice around the world, will serve as case studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PEAC 003. Crisis Resolution in the Middle East</head><p>This introductory course is designed for students without a background in Peace and Conflict Studies or Middle East Studies. Central questions include: How do we define crises in the contemporary Middle East/North Africa region? How does the nature of the crisis (political, economic, social, and environmental) impact communities differently? How are grassroots actors, civil society institutions, states, and international organizations responding to these challenges in their nation-states and across borders? What transnational networks of solidarity have linked the Middle East to other regions across the globe? For instance, this course will examine the consequences of environmental degradation and escalating food prices on conflict and instability across the region. We will trace the origins of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and social movements calling for rights and reforms on one hand and the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism (i.e. Al-Qaeda and ISIS). Furthermore, the course will explore crises such as contemporary Syria, and how local and international interventions aimed at reversing the marginalization of-and threats against-minority populations (ethnic, religious, gender, sexuality, ability) have come to constitute a realm of crisis management. By understanding crises through theoretical prism of human security frameworks, we will ascertain the prospects for democratization, development, pluralism, and peace in the region.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PEAC 015. Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies</head><p>In Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies, we learn that peace and conflict are not mutually exclusive. To paraphrase Conrad Brunk, the goal of peace and conflict studies is to better understand conflict in order to find nonviolent ways of turning unjust relationships into more just ones. We examine both the prevalence of coercive and non-peaceful means of conducting conflict as well as the development of nonviolent alternatives, locally and globally, through institutions and at the grassroots. The latter include nonviolent collective action, mediation, peacekeeping, and conflict transformation work. Several theoretical and philosophical lenses will be used to explore cultural and psychological dispositions, conflict in human relations, and conceptualizations of peace. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach with significant contributions from the social sciences. U.S.-based social justice movements, such as the struggle for racial equality, and global movements, such as nonviolent activism in Israel/Palestine, and the struggle for climate justice around the world, will serve as case studies.

First Year Seminar: Global Responses to Violence</head><p>This first-year seminar will examine responses to political violence on an international scale. The first half of the semester will be devoted to examining the role of religious institutions, representing a wide range of faith-based communities, in exacerbating or ameliorating violence. The second half of the semester will cover examining the role of global secular institutions, such as the United Nations, in addressing political violence. Students will be exposed to two subfields of peace and conflict studies -the study of religion and violence, as well as the study of international organizations in conflict and post-conflict settings. This first year seminar does not fulfill the Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies requirement for PCS majors and minors. 1 credit. Eligible for PEAC PEAC 025B. Transforming Intractable Conflict (Cross-listed as SOCI 025B) This course will address the sociology of peace process and intractable identity conflicts in deeply divided societies. Northern Ireland will serve as the primary case study, and the course outline will include the history of the conflict, the peace process, and grassroots conflict transformation initiatives. Special attention will be given to the cultural underpinnings of division, such as sectarianism and collective identity, and their expression through symbols, language, and collective actions, such as parades and commemorations.

Civil Wars &amp; Neoliberal Peace in Central America</head><p>This course focuses on the sociopolitical turmoil that devastated Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador as a wave of revolutionary wars swept across the region from the 1960s to the early 1990s and sought to end decades of oppressive military dictatorships. After studying the civil wars and their causes, the course will then focus on the p. 418 peacebuilding efforts and the implementation of democracy within the neoliberal economic order. Of particular interest are the failures of the peacebuilding process, the current gang violence in the region, and the widespread political corruption supported by an economic system that has made of everyday life an exercise in survival. We will pay special attention to U.S. intervention in Central America, particularly the consequences of its involvement in the military dictatorships and armed conflicts in the region. We'll focus on issues of social trauma and social disaffection, of historical memory and the genocide of the Mayas, of political resistance and the struggle for social justice, and of the limits of postwar reconstruction and reconciliation in the era of neoliberalism. This course will help us understand the current crisis of Central American immigration to the U.S. HU Eligible for LALS, PEAC Fall 2019. Buiza. Fall 2020. Buiza.</p></div>

Humanitarianism: Anthropological Approaches (Cross-listed as ANTH 103) This honors seminar will introduce students to the most salient theoretical debates among anthropologists on humanitarian intervention around the world. We will also examine a range of case studies, from the birth of Western Christian humanitarian missions in colonial contexts to humanitarian interventions (e.g. military, foodbased assistance, natural disaster relief, postconflict reconstruction) today. The geographic scope of this seminar will encompass North America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East/North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia. We will consider, for instance, how anthropologists have examined relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. What social science scholarship has been produced on mental health interventions after political and natural crises in Haiti? How are victims of torture at the hands of the Indian military supported by international organizations in Kashmir? What is the nature of global Islamic humanitarianism today? How are local national staff employed by international organizations shaping humanitarian approaches to gender-based violence in Colombia?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 421</head><p>Philosophy analyzes and comments critically on concepts that are presupposed and used in other disciplines and in daily life: the natures of knowledge, meaning, reasoning, morality, the character of the world, God, freedom, human nature, justice and history. Philosophy is thus significant for everyone who wishes to live and act in a reflective and critical manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>The Philosophy Department offers several kinds of courses, all designed to engage students in philosophical practices.</p><p>A. There are courses and seminars to introduce students to the major systematic works of the history of philosophy with other disciplines and recognize that philosophical inquiry is naturally related to concerns in other areas of study. They attempt to make these relations explicit, and so course and seminars are designed to be accessible to a broad range of students, not just those who intend to major in philosophy. Various courses and seminars in philosophy appear in concentrations in gender and sexuality studies, German studies, medieval studies, interpretation theory, and environmental studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisites</head><p>Satisfactory completion of either any section of PHIL 001 Introduction to Philosophy, or PHIL 012 Logic, or any First-Year Seminar (numbered 002-010) is a prerequisite for taking any further course in philosophy. Sections of Introduction to Philosophy and First-Year Seminars are intended to present introductions to philosophical problems and techniques of analysis. There are no prerequisites for these entry-level courses. Students may not take more than one introductory level course (First-Year Seminar or Introduction to Philosophy), with one exception: students may take Logic either before or after taking any other introductory course. Juniors and seniors may enter intermediate courses in philosophy without having taken an introductory level course in philosophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>One can major in philosophy in either the Course Program or the Honors Program. Internal distribution requirements are the same for both programs. Only students who will have satisfactorily completed two philosophy courses by the end of their sophomore year will be considered for acceptance as majors. Normally, applications to complete a major in philosophy will not be accepted after the add/drop period in the fall term of a student's senior year. Philosophy students changing their program from course to honors (or honors to course) must do so by the end of the add/drop period of the fall term of senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>In addition to having completed two courses, majors must meet the general requirements for remaining in good standing at the College and have the ability to satisfy the department's comprehensive requirements. They must further normally have at least a B-average in all p. 424 Philosophy philosophy courses taken at Swarthmore. For double majors, the standard is somewhat higher, and the philosophy faculty determines whether the student has the ability to complete the comprehensive requirements of two departments satisfactorily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>Students majoring in philosophy must earn a total of eight credits, exclusive of senior work and complete at least A. One course or seminar in logic and B. Two credits in history: of these 2 credits, at least 1 must be in either ancient or modern (17th and 18th century) philosophy and C. Two credits in at least one course covering one or more of the following areas: Advanced Logic, Philosophy of Science, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Mind and D. Two credits in at least one course covering one or more of the following areas: Moral Philosophy, Social and Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Law, Feminism, Aesthetics. Note: With the exception of Logic (PHIL 012)introductory level courses and First Year Seminars (PHIL 001-010) do not count toward the distribution requirements. In addition, students majoring in philosophy are urged to take courses and seminars in diverse fields of philosophy. Prospective majors should complete the logic requirements as early as possible. Course majors are encouraged to enroll in seminars. Mastery of at least one foreign language is recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Course Study work</head><p>A student will complete a course major in philosophy by registering for a single credit of Senior Course Study in the spring term of the senior year. Senior Course Study does not count toward fulfilling the eight credit requirement for the major. Under this heading, the student will produce two independent essays, each of no more than 4,000 words, based on problems or texts considered in seminars or courses that they have already completed, and in response to questions set by the department faculty. These two independent essays must fall in two different areas of philosophy from the following list:</p><p>A inform the chair about the general areas in which they wish to write their essays by the 10th week of the fall term. The faculty of the Philosophy Department will then set questions and specify additional readings (1-3 articles or book chapters) for each area. These questions will be available to students by the end of the fall term. It is expected that these essays will demonstrate initiative in engaging with problems and texts and that they will develop lines of argumentation beyond what is normally expected of course or seminar papers. Conversation among students who are preparing these essays is encouraged, but each student must produce an independent, original essay. After completing these essays, each course major will be examined orally on both essays by two members of the department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Students may complete a minor in philosophy by earning any 5 credits in philosophy courses. There is no distribution requirement for the minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major</head><p>Acceptance Criteria Students undertaking to pursue honors in philosophy should have B+ grades in philosophy courses and a B+ average overall. The opinions of the philosophy faculty concerning the philosophical ability of students weigh heavily in borderline cases. Only students who have already completed two philosophy courses will be considered for admission to the Honors Program. Philosophy students changing their program from honors to course (or course to honors) must do so by the end of the add/drop period of the fall term of senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparations</head><p>Students will normally prepare for external examination in a given field in philosophy by completing a double-credit seminar at Swarthmore. With the approval of the department, it is possible to combine one-credit courses or attachments, taken either at Swarthmore or elsewhere, to form a preparation. With the approval of the department, a double-credit thesis may be counted as one preparation and submitted to an examiner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>Honors majors will register for one-credit of Seniors Honors Study in philosophy during the spring term of their senior year. Senior Honors Study does not count toward fulfilling the eight credit requirement for the major. External examiners will set questions and specify additional readings (3-4 articles or book chapters) for each p. 425 Philosophy preparation that is to be examined. These questions will be available to students by the end of the fall term. Honors majors will choose one question for each preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Honors Study</head><p>Honors majors will then produce for each preparation an independent essay of no more than 4,000 words in response to the question they have chosen. It is expected that these essays will demonstrate initiative in engaging with problems and texts and that they will develop lines of argumentation beyond what is normally expected of papers produced for seminar discussion. The preparation of the essays will not be supervised by members of the faculty. Conversation among students who are preparing these essays is encouraged, but each student must produce an independent, original essay. The essays must be submitted to the department to be sent to the external examiners by the beginning of the written examination period. There will be no further written examination of preparations beyond these independent essays. An examiner will conduct a 60 minute oral examination for each preparation on both the independent essay and the materials considered in the preparation (typically all the materials listed on the syllabus for the related seminar).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor Requirements</head><p>Honors minors must complete six credits of work in philosophy. Minors in philosophy will register for 0.5 credit of Senior Honor Study in the spring term of their senior year. Senior Honors Study does not count toward satisfying the six credit requirement for the minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Honors Study</head><p>Students will prepare one independent, original essay of no more than 4,000 words in response to a question set by an external examiner (as above with majors). An external examiner will conduct a 60 minute oral examination on both the independent essay and the materials considered in the preparation (typically all the materials listed on the syllabus for the related seminar).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Process Notes for the Major or the Minor</head><p>Follow the process described by the Dean's Office and the Registrar's Office for how to apply for a major. Submit application, with transcript, plan of study, and if applicable, honors application. Transfer students will be deferred until they have obtained at least 1 philosophy credit from Swarthmore. Students who are deferred may apply again after addressing the reason(s) for being deferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>With prior approval from the Chair, a student may take philosophy courses abroad for a semester or year and have them count both toward a major and as part of an Honors Program. Courses abroad do not, however, always fit neatly into a philosophy major and are not always suitable for full course credit. Full consultation with the Chair about study abroad is essential for constructing a viable program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deadlines</head><p>Students wishing to add a major or minor in Philosophy must do so by the end of the add/drop period of the fall term of the senior year. Philosophy students changing their program from course to honors (or honors to course) must do so by the end of the add/drop period of the fall term of the senior year. Philosophy honors students must declare their honors preparations by the end of the add/drop period of the fall term of senior year. Philosophy students wishing to drop an honors major or minor must do so by the end of the add/drop period of the fall term of the senior year. Philosophy students wishing to drop a course major or minor after the add/drop period of the fall term of the senior year should speak to the chair of the department. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 021. Social and Political Philosophy</head><p>In this seminar, we will examine in-depth philosophical approaches to theory and practice of law. We begin with the classical theoretical questions. We cover the foundations of law as explained through legal positivism, natural law, and critical legal theory. We examine the roles of lawmakers, citizens, and judges. We then move to questions with a more practical dimension. We discuss the foundation for criminal law and punishment as well as issues of racism and sexism in law. Other topics include individual rights, paternalism, policing, privacy, and technologyThe focus of this course is to explore the relationship between the individual and the state. We will examine three different conceptions of individuals and the three different theories of the state to which they give rise: political realism, political liberalism, and critical political theory. First we examine the historical foundations of these three theories. Then we will read contemporary work on particular issues in order to draw out the implications of the three frameworks. We will see how each framework deals with questions about censorship, personal liberty, civil disobedience, and national security. PEAC eligible with the approval of the instructor. Prerequisite: First-and second-year students must complete one introductory level PHIL course before enrolling in this course. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 031. Advanced Logic</head><p>A survey of various technical and philosophical issues arising from the study of deductive logical systems. Topics are likely to include extensions of classical logic (e.g., the logic of necessity and possibility [modal logic], the logic of time [tense logic], etc.); alternatives to classical logic (e.g., intuitionistic logic, paraconsistent logic); metatheory (e.g., soundness, compactness, Gödel's incompleteness theorem); philosophical questions (e.g., What distinguishes logic from non-logic? Could logical principles ever be revised in the light of empirical evidence?).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 429</head><p>The aim of the department is to contribute to the total education of all students through the medium of physical activity. We believe this contribution can best be achieved through encouraging participation in a broad program of individual and team sports, aquatics, physical fitness, and wellness. The program provides an opportunity for instruction and experience in a variety of activities on all levels. It is our hope that participation in this program will foster an understanding of movement and the pleasure of exercise and will enhance, by practice, qualities of good sportsmanship, leadership, and cooperation in team play. Students are also encouraged to develop skill and interest in a variety of activities that can be enjoyed after graduation. The Intercollegiate Athletics Program is comprehensive, including varsity with teams in 22 different sports: 10 for men and 12 for women. Ample opportunities exist for large numbers of students to engage in intercollegiate competition, and those who qualify may be encouraged to participate in regional and national championship contests. Several club teams in various sports are also organized, and a program of intramural activities is sponsored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements and Recommendations</head><p>Students are encouraged to enjoy the instructional and recreational opportunities offered by the department throughout their college careers. As a requirement for graduation, all non-veteran students, not excused for medical reasons, are required to complete 4 units of physical education by the end of their sophomore year. In addition, all students must pass a survival swim test or complete one-quarter of aquatics instruction.</p><p>Students who enter Swarthmore as transfer students can either apply transfer PE units toward the 4-unit physical education requirement or opt for a reduction in the PE requirement based on the student's transfer status, but transfer students cannot both transfer PE units and receive a reduction in the requirement. The optional reduction in PE units depends on the transfer class of the student. Transfer students who enter Swarthmore as sophomores can opt to complete 3 units of physical education and pass a survival swim test (a reduction of 1 PE unit). Transfer students who enter Swarthmore as juniors can opt to complete 2 units of physical education and pass a survival swim test (a reduction of 2 PE units). Courses offered by the department are listed subsequently. Credit toward completion of the physical education requirement will also be given for participation in intercollegiate athletics, as well as PE Dance Courses, which are semester-long courses. Credit will also be given for participation in approved club sports and student activity groups (max 2). The approved club sports are as follows: fencing, rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, and men's badminton. The approved student activity groups are as follows: aerobics, aikido, capoeira, folk dance, swing dance, tango, squash, men's soccer, coed volleyball, Wing Chun Self Defense. Under ordinary circumstances, physical education credit will not be awarded for independent study. The Physics and Astronomy Department teaches the concepts and methods that lead to an understanding of the fundamental laws governing the physical universe. Emphasis is placed on quantitative, analytical reasoning, as distinct from the mere acquisition of facts. Particular importance is also attached to laboratory work because physics and astronomy are primarily experimental and observational sciences. With the awareness that involvement in research is a major component in the education of scientists, the department offers a number of opportunities for students to participate in original research projects, conducted by members of the faculty, on campus. Several research laboratories are maintained by the department to support faculty interests in the areas of plasma physics, nanophysics, computer simulation, liquid crystals, materials physics, granular media, and observational, theoretical astrophysics and cosmology. The department operates the Peter van de Kamp Observatory for student and faculty research, plus several small telescopes for instructional use. The observatory is equipped with a 61-cm reflecting telescope, a high-resolution spectrograph, and a CCD camera for imaging and photometry. A monthly visitors' night at the observatory is announced on the department website. Three calculus-based introductory sequences are offered. PHYS 003 and 004 cover both classical and modern physics and are an appropriate introductory physics sequence for those students majoring in engineering. A parallel sequence, PHYS 003L and 004L, has a focus on the life sciences and is an appropriate sequence for students interested in chemistry, and biology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical Education and Athletics Courses</head><p>PHYS 007 and 008, on the other hand, which are normally preceded by PHYS 005, are at a higher level. They are aimed towards students planning to do further work in physics or astronomy and are also appropriate for engineering and chemistry majors. The sequence of courses from PHYS 005 to PHYS 018 is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the major topics and mathematical tools of physics. Additional information is available at www.swarthmore.edu/physics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>In order to receive a degree from Swarthmore as a physics, astrophysics, or astronomy major, a student must have taken and satisfactorily passed one of the programs described below. In the Physics and Astronomy Department, the seminar is the standard format for most junior and senior level work. All prospective majors and minors in the department should realize this when planning programs. The seminars are open to all students, both honors and course majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Course Recommendations</head><p>PHYS 005. Spacetime and Quanta introduces and explores in some depth special relativity and quantum mechanics -two key theories of modern physics and astronomy. This course is intended as an entry point to the major track for both physics and astronomy, regardless of the degree of high school physics and math preparation a first-year student has had. PHYS 003. General Physics I: Motion, Forces, and Energy is calculus based and has a weekly lab component and is the entry point for a two-course physics sequence required of engineering majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 436</head><p>Physics and Astronomy PHYS 003L. General Physics I: Motion, Forces, and Energy with Biological and Medical Applications is calculus based and has a weekly lab and is the entry point for a two-course physics sequence intended for biology, pre-med, and chemistry students. It covers the same basic physical ideas as Physics 003, but applies those ideas to systems of interest to those studying biology, medicine, or chemistry. Note that in general, majors cannot "pass out" of Physics 005 or most other major requirements, but that students who need to take Physics 003 or Physics 003L can get Swarthmore credit for work done prior to college if they scored a 5 on the physics AP exam *and* they achieve a good score on the department's placement test, which is given the week before classes start in the fall (but in certain cases may be taken at other times throughout the year).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Programs</head><p>In the spirit of a liberal arts education, we note that one need not be considering a career in physical science to find a physics, astrophysics, or astronomy major beneficial and stimulating. The physics core curriculum and the astronomy core curriculum listed below both provide excellent training in quantitative reasoning and independent problem solving, skills that are applicable in a wide variety of arenas (finance, law, medicine, science journalism, public policy). Since all of the fundamental areas are covered, the physics core curriculum is also excellent preparation for a career in a scientific field related to physics, such as engineering or teaching physics in high school. The astronomy curriculum is excellent preparation for teaching astronomy in high school, or working as a telescope operator or data analyst. These curricula are ideal for double majors. While the physics core curriculum is adequate preparation for graduate study in physics, students considering graduate school are encouraged to take additional seminars, especially those listed below under "Enhanced Programs." Most graduate programs in astronomy expect somewhat more physics preparation than the minimum listed in the astronomy curriculum. Those considering graduate school in astronomy are encouraged to take as much additional physics as scheduling permits, and ideally, to choose the astrophysics major listed below under "Enhanced Programs." * Note: The Mathematics and Statistics Department offers many sets of courses covering similar material at different levels of sophistication. In each case noted, the most elementary version from each set has been listed. Students should always take the most advanced version for which they qualify, e.g. MATH 034 or 035 rather than MATH 033, if possible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enhanced Programs</head><p>These programs provide strong preparation for graduate study in physics, astrophysics, or astronomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physics Enhanced Curriculum</head><p>In addition to the physics core requirements listed above, any two advanced seminars Astrophysics Curriculum PHYS 005 PHYS 007, 008, 013, 015, 017, 018, ASTR 014 or 016 Two Astronomy Seminars PHYS 111, 112, 113, 114 MATH* 015, 025, 027, 033</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Requirements</head><p>Seniors not in the Honors Program must complete a comprehensive exercise, which is intended both to encourage review and synthesis and to allow students to demonstrate mastery of fundamentals studied during all four years. In addition, all students must satisfy the College distribution requirements and the 20-course rule (except for special majors such as astrophysics or chemical physics, for whom the 20-course rule is waived).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>A student applying to become either a physics major in the core program or an astronomy major should have completed or be completing PHYS 005 and either PHYS 004 or PHYS 008. Otherwise it will be impossible to fulfill all program requirements. To be accepted as a major, the applicant must have received grades of C+ or better in Physics, Astronomy, and Math courses. A student applying to become a physics major in either the enhanced program in course or the Honors Program should have completed or be completing courses through PHYS 008, PHYS p. 437</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physics and Astronomy</head><p>013, PHYS 015, PHYS 017, PHYS 018. In addition, to be accepted into the course major, these courses must be completed with an average grade of C+ or better. To be accepted into the Honors Program with a physics major, the average grade should be a B or better. Grades in math courses should be at a similar level. A student applying to become an astrophysics major in course or in honors should have completed or be completing PHYS 008, PHYS 013, PHYS 015, PHYS 017, PHYS 018, and ASTR 016 or ASTR 014. In addition, applicants for the Honors Program in either astrophysics or astronomy must normally have an average grade in physics and astronomy courses of B or better. Since almost all advanced work in physics and astronomy at Swarthmore is taught in seminars where the student participants share the pedagogical responsibility, an additional consideration in accepting (retaining) majors is the presumed (demonstrated) ability of the students not only to benefit from this mode of instruction but also to contribute positively to the seminars. Grades in prior courses are the best criteria in admitting majors, since they tend to indicate reliably whether or not the student can handle advanced work at Swarthmore levels without being overwhelmed. However, constructive participation in classes and laboratories is also considered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>The Physics and Astronomy Department offers two types of course minor, one in physics and one in astronomy. Under some circumstances, PHYS 003 and/or PHYS 004 may be substituted for PHYS 007 and/or PHYS 008. †We prefer that minors have two advanced seminars, one in "classical" and one in "quantum" physics. PHYS 111 is a prerequisite for future seminars and fulfills the "classical" requirement. While we recommend PHYS 113 as the second advanced seminar, a different seminar may be substituted upon consultation with the Chair.</p></div>

Note: In some cases, elective seminars may be used as honors preparations. Note: External examination for honors major programs includes two or three 3-hour written examinations on the chosen preparations, plus two or three 30-45 minute oral examinations on the chosen preparations, plus one 45-60 minute oral examination on the honors thesis (for thesis writers).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Opportunities</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Laboratory Program</head><p>In the junior and senior years, all physics majors must take PHYS 081 and PHYS 082. Students enrolled in PHYS 081 and PHYS 082 must arrange their programs so that they can schedule an afternoon for the laboratory each week free of conflicts with other classes, typically Friday afternoon. Enrollment in each of these laboratories will appear on the student's transcript with a letter grade for 0.5 credit for each semester. PHYS 081, 082 together count as a "writing course" for collegiate graduation requirements. Students with credit for ENGR 072 may replace PHYS 081, 082 with PHYS 083, which is an advanced lab experience without an electronics component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Work</head><p>Physics, astrophysics, and astronomy majors are encouraged to undertake independent research projects, especially in the senior year, either in conjunction with one of the senior seminars, or as a special project for separate credit (PHYS/ASTR 094). Members of the physics or astronomy faculty are willing to suggest possible projects and to supervise one of these if the student chooses to pursue it. Students completing work under PHYS/ASTR 094 are required to submit final written and oral reports of their work to the department. In preparation for independent experimental work, prospective physics majors are strongly urged to take the required 0.5 credit course PHYS 063, Procedures in Experimental Physics, during their fall semester of their sophomore year, which will qualify them to work in the departmental shops. There are usually many opportunities for students to receive financial support to work with faculty members on research projects during the summer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis</head><p>Students may do a theoretical or experimental research thesis representing the results of independent work done under the supervision of a faculty member. This thesis will usually cover work begun in the summer after the junior year and completed during the senior year. A thesis is optional for all students in the Honors Program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>With proper planning, study away from Swarthmore for one or two semesters is possible while majoring in physics, astronomy, or astrophysics. However, the many prerequisites in the Physics and Astronomy Department make careful planning for study abroad a necessity. Spring of junior year is often the easiest time to make this work. The important point is to begin planning at an early stage. This allows students (1) to make sure courses not available abroad are taken at Swarthmore, and (2) to find out well in advance what physics and astronomy courses are available in the various study abroad programs. While it is completely feasible to complete a physics major without taking physics abroad (e.g. if one is studying in a non-English-speaking country), students should note when planning their programs that PHYS 111 must be taken before PHYS 113 or PHYS 114.</p></div>

Electricity, Magnetism, and Waves -Intensive</head><p>An alternate pathway through the material covered by Physics 008 (electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetic waves), but beginning with a more concrete, physical approach and moving to a more abstract approach after laying an initial foundation. Students will participate in the Physics 004 course meetings and laboratories during the first nine weeks of the semester, which are devoted to electricity and magnetism, supplemented by once-per-week hour-long meetings with the Physics 008S instructor to apply multivariable calculus to the material covered that week. During the last five weeks, Physics 008S students will receive their own instruction in the remaining topics covered in Physics 008, and will participate in the Physics 008 laboratories. Physics 008S will reach the same final point as Physics 008, thereby providing equivalent preparation for Physics 112 and other advanced physics and astrophysics courses. Recommended for students concurrently enrolled in multivariable calculus, and/or for those who have had very little exposure to electricity and magnetism in previous (high school) physics classes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>Politics is about who governs. Whether by bullets or ballots, by violent struggle or peaceful competition for office, politics is about deciding who rules, for what purposes, and under what constraints. Politics influences the duties of rulers and ruled, the rights of citizens, and whether people live in fear or not. In politics people acquire and use power, cooperatively or non-cooperatively, for creative or destructive purposes. They forge collective symbols and craft (and recraft) compelling narratives about mutual identities and social goals. They demand recognition and justice --which means that they redefine what counts as political. They focus attention on collective problems --or try to prevent such a focus. Finally they distribute or redistribute economic resources -which is one reason why politics can be terribly contentious. The faculty members of the Swarthmore political science department reflect, in their intellectual and research interests, the exceptional pluralism of political science and seek to convey the discipline's richness and variety in their courses, in the speakers we bring to campus, and in discussions with students after class or during office hours. We arrange course offerings by the traditional subdivisions of the discipline as it is practiced in the United States: American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory. Our offerings are particularly strong in the study of China, constitutional law, the study of Congress, environmental policy and politics, faith-based social policy, the presidency, the study of American parties and elections, U.S. civil rights, international trade and political economy, the cognitive and perceptual dimensions of international politics, Latin American politics, theories of prophetic political vision, ancient and modern political theory, democratic theory and civic engagement, Iranian politics, and American political development. Students currently have access to interdisciplinary and innovative pedagogies in GIS training, for understanding local democracy in and around Swarthmore and poverty in Chester, PA, and for understanding the nature of mass incarceration in the United States. We also offer many opportunities to explore linkages between theory and practice of politics. Some courses are earmarked for their emphasis on community-based learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First course recommendations</head><p>The following serve as both an introduction to the discipline of political science and as required introductory courses before acceptance as a major/minor in the department (please see specific acceptance guidelines for each major/minor): POLS 002 American Politics, POLS 003 Politics Across the World, and POLS 004 International Politics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution of courses within the department</head><p>Political science majors are required to take one course or seminar in each of the following areas: 1) American politics; 2) comparative or international politics; and 3) political theory. All distribution requirements must be met by courses taken at Swarthmore. Political Science satisfy the distribution requirement for theory in the department. Majors and minors may take one directed reading within the department for credit with approval from the department chair. Other courses eligible for Political Science credit are PEAC 003 and PEAC 053. These courses count towards the major/minor but do not satisfy distribution requirements. Honors majors and minors, course majors, double majors, and special majors may take one course in the department credit/no credit after all distribution and department requirements have been fulfilled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political theory requirement</head><p>At least one course in ancient or modern political theory is required of all majors and minors. This requirement can be met by enrollment in either one course or one honors seminar, listed below. It is strongly recommended that all majors and minors complete this requirement no later than their junior year. Eligible courses are: POLS 011. Ancient Political Thought POLS 012. Modern Political Thought POLS 100. Ancient Political Thought POLS 101. Modern Political Theory Only ancient or modern political theory, either the course or the seminar, count as fulfilling the political theory requirement. Courses taken abroad or outside of Swarthmore are not considered the equivalent of these courses. This requirement must be met at Swarthmore, in the Political Science Department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lotteries</head><p>Sometimes courses have to be lotteried. If a student is lotteried for a course one semester, their name will go on a list and they will not be lotteried for that same course the next semester that the course is offered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>1. To graduate with a major in political science, a student must complete 8.5 credits in the department-at least eight courses in the department, plus the 0.5 credit requirement for completing the senior comprehensive exercise. At least five of these eight courses must be taken at Swarthmore, including all of the distribution requirements (see below), and two introductory level courses (POLS 002, 003, 004, 010) must be completed at Swarthmore before acceptance as a major. Introductory level courses will count as distribution requirements. 2. Course prerequisites. Students must have completed two introductory courses at Swarthmore (POLS 002, 003, 004, 010) by the end of their first semester of sophomore year. This is the prerequisite for further work in the department and acceptance into the major. Majors will be deferred from acceptance into the department until both intros are completed. Only one intro can be a first-year seminar. 3. Grade requirements. We consider student applications to join the department individually, taking into account each student's background and college performance to date. Normally, the following expectations apply: a.</p><p>For acceptance as a course major, the department expects performance at the 2.33 level in all college courses and at the 2.67 level in courses in political science (including courses graded Credit/No Credit). b. For acceptance as a double major, the department expects performance at the 3.0 level in all college courses and at the 3.33 level in courses in political science (including courses graded Credit/No Credit).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Prerequisites for individual courses.</head><p>Students should note that certain courses and seminars have specific prerequisites. 5. The senior comprehensive requirement. To graduate from Swarthmore, all majors and special majors in the Course Program need to fulfill the senior comprehensive requirement in the Political Science Department. This can be done in one of two ways. The preferred option is POLS 092: the Senior Comprehensive Exam, which is a 0.5 credit graded exercise. Working with a faculty advisor, students will produce a short paper in the spring semester of their senior year, which tackles a major puzzle in political science. Students will then present their work at a department conference. Option two, POLS 095 is a one-credit graded written thesis, which may be chosen by students who meet the eligibility requirements and get the approval of a faculty advisor and the chair. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political Science</head><p>Honors Major 1. Political science honors majors must meet all current distributional requirements for majors, including the political theory requirement, preferably with the honors versions of ancient or modern political theory. 2. They must have a minimum of ten credits inside the Political Science Department. 3. Six of these credits will be met with three</p><p>(3) two-unit honors preparations which will help prepare honors majors for outside examinations, both written and oral. These two-unit preparations will normally be either a two-credit honors seminar or a "course-plus" option. Of these three (3) two-unit preparations, no more than two may be in a single field in the department, and no more than one may be a course-plus option.</p><p>The "course-plus" option will normally consist of two one-unit courses that have been designated to count as an honors preparation, or in some cases a one-unit course and a one-unit seminar that have been so designated. It is up to the student to arrange a course-plus option with a specific faculty member and to have this approved by the chair. 4. To fulfill the senior honors study requirement for honors majors, students will revise a paper written for one of their department seminars. This paper will be submitted to the appropriate external examiner as part of the honors evaluation process. 5. To be accepted into the Honors Program students should normally have at least an average of 3.67 inside and 3.5 outside the department, and should have given evidence to the departmental faculty of their ability to work independently and constructively in a seminar setting. Seminars will normally be limited to eight students and admission priority will go to honors majors, first seniors and then juniors, including special majors. 6. Honors majors are strongly encouraged to attend the department senior comprehensive exercise conference in March.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Seminars</head><p>Placement in honors seminars is normally limited to honors students. Occasionally, there is room in a seminar for highly qualified non-honors students, but this is rare and at the discretion of the teacher. Honors seminars in the Political Science Department are normally full. Students should request placement in scheduled honors seminars by including the seminar in the Sophomore Plan or by including it in the application for participation in the Honors Program. All honors students in the department must get the approval of the Chair of the department for their Honors Program by meeting with the chair. The department maintains priority lists for enrollment in every seminar we anticipate offering in the next two academic years. We add the names of qualified students to these lists in the order their requests for seminar placement are received, with honors majors always receiving priority over non-honors majors. Seniors, including special majors, are given priority over juniors and non-honors majors. If a seminar is full, the names of students who wish to be placed in that seminar are added to a waiting list.</p><p>To be fair to everyone, we ask each student not to request placement in more than two seminars in any one semester. In addition, there is an overall limit of three seminars for majors and one seminar for others. We make every effort to offer the seminars we announce. But inclusion on a priority list is not a guarantee that the seminar will be offered, or that a student will get in. Sometimes seminars are lotteried.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>Honors minors in political science will be required to have at least five credits in political science. Among these credits there must be one introductory course (POLS 002, POLS 003 or POLS 004; a first-year seminar does not count), one course in political theory (POLS 011, POLS 012, POLS 100, or POLS 101), one other political science course and one (1) of the two-unit honors preparations offered by the department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Exams</head><p>The honors exams will normally consist of a three hour written exam in each of the student's seminars, and an oral exam in each seminar, conducted by an external honors examiner.</p></div>

Course prerequisites: To be accepted as a double major in the department, students must have completed two introductory courses at Swarthmore (POLS 002, 003, 004, 010) by the end of their first semester of sophomore year. This is the prerequisite for further work in the department and acceptance as a double major. Majors will be deferred from acceptance into the department until both intros are completed. Only one intro can be a first-year seminar. 2. Grade requirements: We consider student applications to join the department individually, taking into account each student's background and college performance to date. For acceptance as a double major, the department expects performance at the 3.0 level in all college courses and at the p. 448</p></div>

Prerequisites for individual courses. Students should note that certain courses and seminars have specific prerequisites. 4. To graduate with a double major in political science, a student must complete 6.5 credits in the department -at least six courses in the department, plus the 0.5 credit requirement for completing the senior comprehensive exercise. All distribution requirements within the department (please see Distribution of courses within the department for details) must be taken at Swarthmore. 5. The senior comprehensive requirement. To graduate from Swarthmore, all majors and special majors in the course program need to fulfill the senior comprehensive requirement in the Political Science Department. This can be done in one of two ways. The preferred option is POLS 092: the Senior Comprehensive Exam, which is a 0.5 credit graded exercise. Working with a faculty advisor, students will produce a short paper in the spring semester of their senior year, which connects work they have done in two different sub-fields of political science (political theory, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations). Students will then present their work at a department conference. Option two, POLS 095 is a one-credit graded written thesis, which may be chosen by students who meet the eligibility requirements and get the approval of a faculty advisor and the chair. All junior and senior course majors (unless abroad) are required to attend the department senior comprehensive exercise conference in March.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Major</head><p>All special majors must have a designated faculty advisor and consult with the chair to receive approval for the proposed program. Within that approved program, 5.5 credits must be taken in the department, including one introductory course (POLS 002, POLS 003, POLS 004; a first-year seminar does not count), and the distribution requirements must be met by courses taken at Swarthmore including theory and two other subfields (see Distribution of Courses within the department section </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 010M. First Year Seminar: Political</head><p>Theory and the Future of Work Artificial intelligence seems likely to transform the way we live. Once self-driving cars arrive, for instance, those who currently drive trucks or taxis might well lose their jobs. Automation seems likely to have similar effects on many professions, from manufacturing to medicine. It is never easy to predict the future, but it does seem possible that we are entering an era of mass unemployment. How should societies respond to this threat? Should the state intervene to prevent automation, for example, or provide some kind of universal basic income? Such questions are currently being debated by think tanks and governments around the world, with various pilot schemes already underway. Rather than discussing specific policy proposals, this course will focus on the underlying philosophical issues. Topics will include the role of work in a good life; the relationship between the division of labor and social solidarity; and the nature of exploitation. Readings will range from the philosophical to the sociological and from the classic to the contemporary. As such, the course will provide a window into different styles of political theory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 011. Ancient Political Thought</head><p>Reason, force, and persuasion are central tools of politics. They are also considered and weighed by political philosophers as they write about the best (or best achievable) organization of political life to achieve some goal, and the best chance of making those arrangements endure. Use of each tool tends to reflect particular views about human nature, capacities, and differences. This course explores these and other key concepts of political thought, drawing on major works in the Western tradition, including Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Aquinas, and Machiavelli.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 012. Modern Political Thought</head><p>This course introduces some of the major concepts and themes of modern political thought through a close reading of texts from the 16th to the early 20th century. The starting point of the course is Machiavelli's novel "science" of statecraft, which identified the state as the focal point of political activity, and announced that a good politician must be prepared to act immorally, or even love his city more than his soul. In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought.</p><p>Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. </p></div>

Political Psychology and Moral Engagement</head><p>This course combines readings from the fields of political psychology, social psychology and political theory for the purposes of understanding ourselves as citizens and moral agents. Students will canvas theories as well as empirical studies that describe the processes of political and moral decision-making. We will also ask whether the same processes that usually lead to normal political and moral decision-making might occasionally produce disastrous consequences, and we will investigate means of avoiding the worst outcomes.

Ethnic Politics: Elections, Conflict and Change</head><p>In media discourse and social science research, ethnic diversity and ethnic politics are viewed as threats to order and democracy.In this course we will consider the questions of where ethnic identities come from, how they change, and why we see non-violent political competition or violent conflict between groups in some cases and not others. Drawing on theories of social science and case studies from South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, among others, students will learn to think critically about these questions. This course will be useful for students interested in learning more about the role that ethnicity plays in developing countries and how to approach these questions in a rigorous manner. Recommended: One social science course. Social sciences. 1 credit. This course examines political attitude formation and the aggregation of these attitudes to form what we call "public opinion." The course covers individual level attitude formation, sampling and survey methodology, macro-level opinion and topics related to macro-level opinion including democratic values and policy representation. Students will become familiar with democratic theory and the role that the public plays in democratic theory. Readings will cover cuttingedge social science research as well as the classics of public opinion and political behavior.

Borders and Migration</head><p>This course offers an introduction to the causes and consequences of international migration and examines the political responses of different national communities to the phenomenon. In the first part of the course we explore why and how people leave their homes for a different country. We will also consider normative questions around the rights and responsibilities of both host countries and migrants. Do states have the right to close their borders and exclude non-citizens from their territories? Our readings address debates around citizenship, multiculturalism, group membership, and minority rights. The second part of the course focuses on the dynamics of incorporation: the processes through which immigrant groups settle and integrate in their new country of residence. The growing ethnic, racial, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by immigration has spawned fierce debates over national identity and social cohesion. We will analyze different regimes of political, cultural, and economic integration and ask how states accommodate (and fail to accommodate) ethnoreligious minorities by examining struggles over language rights, religious differences, gender and sexuality, and citizenship. Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the politicoeconomic effects and ideological battles over migration in a number of different countries across the globe.

How do political processes, institutions, and leaders affect disaster events and their aftermath? Do disasters lead to meaningful policy change, or is their impact fleeting? This course examines the political and policy dynamics associated with disasters-those that are predominantly "natural" (e.g., hurricanes and tornadoes), and those that result mainly from human action or inaction (e.g., airplane crashes, mass shootings, building collapses). Using a variety of cases from different historical periods, different regions of the world, and different levels of political analysis (national, regional, and local), this course will examine the causes and consequences of disaster, policymaking and disaster, and the new professional field of disaster management.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 070. Biopower and Biopolitics</head><p>How did life itself become an object of politics? In The History of Sexuality, Michel Foucault argues that the modern era is marked by an important transformation in the exercise of power. Sovereign power, understood as the power to "take life or let live" has been gradually supplanted by biopower aimed at "fostering life or disallowing it to the point of death." This shift has been accompanied by strategies to strengthen the body politic through social regulation and the calculated management of life. In the first part of this course we will examine the concept of biopower as developed by Foucault in his writings and lectures at the College de France. These works have had a wide-ranging influence in political theory and beyond. The notion of biopower has been central to contemporary inquiries into the securitization of borders, political asylum and deportation, disaster management, biotechnology and genetics, organ donation and surrogate motherhood, drone warfare, suicide bombing and the weaponization of life, and how socio-economic and racial hierarchies influence the differential distribution of death. We will explore these issues in subsequent sessions through the works of Giorgio Agamben, Hannah Arendt, Talal Asad, Judith Butler, Achille Mbembe, Anne Phillips, Paul Rabinow, Nikolas Rose and others in an effort to connect theoretical arguments about the articulation of sovereign power to real world examples of what Rabinow and Rose have termed "strategies for governing life."

Politics of Punishment</head><p>The question of why the United States has become a vastly more punitive society-some 2.3 million Americans are held in jails and prisons throughout this country, at last count-is the subject of this upper-level division seminar. The aim of the seminar is to provide both a critical and in-depth exploration of the interplay among American electoral politics, public concerns regarding crime, and criminal justice policy. Among the central questions we will examine are: How is it that so many Americans are either locked up behind bars or under the supervision of the criminal justice system? And where did the idea of using "jails" and "prisons" as instruments of social and crime control come from? What explains the racial and class differences in criminal behavior and incarceration rates? What does it mean to be poor, a person of color-and in "jail" or "prison?"

What changes need to be made to address problems such as corruption, ethnic conflict, and poor quality public services in developing democracies from South Asia to Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa (with an emphasis on South Asia). In this course, we carefully diagnose these challenges with attention to political and state institutions and the specific contexts of the democracies we study. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights of political science, we explore long-term and shortterm obstacles to better governance and discuss plausible solutions. This class will be useful to students interested in the politics of developing countries and those interested in how social scientists understand the challenges they face.

Islam and Muslims in the West</head><p>In the post-9/11 West, the figure of the Muslim has become central to heated political debates over the meaning of secularism, democracy, and citizenship. Politicians and pundits on both the left and right have equated Islam with violence and terrorism despite the small minority of selfprofessed Muslims who carry out such attacks. This perception has called into question Islam's compatibility with Western values and ways of life. Such discussions raise new questions about the limits of free speech, the challenges of multiculturalism, women's rights, gender equality, and sexuality, as well as the visibility of religion in the public sphere.

It focuses on the ways in which ethnic, religious, and racial minorities are incorporated into and/or excluded from processes of nation formation. We will consider how notions of belonging, citizenship, and otherness have been defined in particular locales, how they are socialized through a variety of institutional contexts, and how they change over time. Our readings draw from a broad range of academic disciplines and cover topical issues such as the headscarf affair, cartoon controversies, and rising Islamophobia.

The Politics of Poverty Alleviation in the Developing World</head><p>How should we understand the challenge of poverty alleviation and what can be done to fight poverty in developing countries? To understand the mixed record of progress in this area, we will engage three central questions in this course: (1) What are the causes of poverty and its persistence?</p><p>(2) What are the best strategies for fighting poverty? (3) How do institutions and political incentives support or undermine the success of anti-poverty policies? We will discuss how scholars across the social sciences think about poverty and what this tells us about how to address this problem. Next, we will engage debates over the best strategies for fighting poverty in countries where it is often difficult to ensure that program benefits reach the poor. Cases will be drawn from South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. This class will be useful to students interested in applying social science concepts to understand policy challenges in developing countries and particularly useful to those interested in careers in development.

Ancient Political Thought</head><p>This course will consider the development of political thought in the ancient and medieval periods and the emergence of a distinctively modern political outlook. Special attention will be paid to the differences between the way the ancients and the moderns thought about ethics, reason, wisdom, politics, democracy, law, power, justice, the individual, and the community. Key philosophers include Plato, Aristotle, and Hobbes. Social sciences. 2 credits. Eligible for INTP Spring 2020. Thakkar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POLS 101. Modern Political Theory</head><p>In this seminar, we will study the construction of the modern liberal state and capitalism through the works of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, and then, in more detail, we will examine the greatest critics of the modern age-Marx, Nietzsche, Jung, and Foucault. Marx demands that we take history and class conflict seriously in political theory. Nietzsche connects the evolution of human instinct to the politics of good and evil for the sake of political transformation. Jung establishes psychology and mythology as foundations for politics, and Foucault uses all three of these critics to question the modern subject and the disciplines of power and knowledge that construct selves and politics in a postmodern age.

Power, Identity and Culture</head><p>Power, external and objective, is also internal and subjective, invisibly working to shape understandings of who we are even as it performs the visible rituals of regulation typically associated with states and governments. This course takes as its central thesis that immaterial and invisible forms of power are power's most effective form as well as the most difficult for political science to measure and understand. Alternating between case and theory, and looking at power both naked and sublime, we will examine the struggle by the state and other elite actors to shape subjectivities through culture and identity formation in order to secure quiescence and rule. Close attention will be paid to how socializing agents, including schools and the educational system, media and film, and families and local communities, shape and reshape formal efforts to have ordinary citizens internalize what Stuart Hall describes as "the horizon of the taken-for-granted," those ruling ideas and beliefs that consist "of things that go without saying because, being axiomatic, they come without saying; things that, being presumptively shared, are not normally the subject of explication or argument." This course seeks to understand how such efforts succeed, falter, and change as they face the negotiations of the ordinary and the less powerful. Authors include Antonio Gramsci, Steven Lukes, James C. Scott, Clifford Geertz, Michel Foucault, Joel Migdal, Stuart Hall, and Robert Dahl. Social sciences. 2 credits.</p></div>

This course focuses on topics in cognitive development and consider each with respect to the nature vs. nurture debate. This course will seek to move beyond the traditional solution of accepting that every developmental process is about nature and nurture working in concert. Instead we will think more deeply about when the question is a helpful framework and when it is not. PSYC 005 is intended for first year students and serves as an alternate prerequisite for further work in the department. Other courses open to first year students that do not count as a pre-requisite for further coursework in the department.

Off campus study courses do not count towards the minor in psychology. In general, all coursework for the minor must be completed here at Swarthmore. Students who would like to receive psychology credit for a psychology course taken at another institution must have taken PSYC 001 or a relevant first year seminar in psychology, or placed out of this requirement through AP or IB work. The department may consider exceptions for students who have taken COGS 001 (Intro to Cognitive Science) when taught by a member of the psychology department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research and Service-Learning Opportunities</head><p>Students are encouraged to get involved with research at any point in their time at Swarthmore, and many seniors also do field placements through the clinical practicum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Year Opportunities</head><p>There are many opportunities for research with the faculty of the department during the academic year either for academic credit ( The clinical practicum (PSYC 090) provides field experience for students who are considering careers in clinical psychology, psychiatry, social work, and counseling. Students undertake field placements in varied settings to gain direct clinical experience. In past years, students have completed placements in organizations providing psychological and educational services to children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental difficulties, outpatient and inpatient therapy programs for children and adults with anxiety and depression, and non-profits providing clinical and psychosocial support to survivors of violence, immigrants and other underserved populations. Enrollment is often limited to seniors and requires at least a B average in Psychology as well as appropriate course preparation. The clinical practicum is a Community-based Learning course.</p></div>

First Year Seminar: Psychology in Schools</head><p>The role of psychology in an educational setting is to help educators "see" better the internal, external, and socialized learning processes that are occurring in and out of the classroom. In this course, students will be introduced to psychological theory and concepts by considering their relevance to schools and student learning. This course draws from cognitive, developmental, and multicultural psychology to help students understanding and appreciate learning and the diversity of learners. PSYC 004 does not serve as an alternate prerequisite for further work in the department. to many species, others are actually cultural products created by humans. Does the nature vs. nurture question make sense for both of these sets of problems? In this seminar we will focus on four topics in cognitive development and consider each with respect to the nature vs. nurture debate. First, we will consider topics for which the question does seem quite sensible, such as how children understand objects and perceive faces. Next we will move onto children's development in several areas for which this question may not be so sensible: language acquisition and theory of mind development. This course will seek to move beyond the traditional solution of accepting that every developmental process is about nature and nurture working in concert. Instead we will think more deeply about when the question is a helpful framework and when it is not. PSYC 005 serves as an alternate prerequisite for further work in the department.

First-Year Seminar: Language, Psychology, and Advertising</head><p>This course explores the social and cognitive mechanisms of language through the lens of advertising. Marketers and politicians have an intuitive grasp of many of the ways in which communication works. We will investigate the psychological and linguistic underpinnings of how people communicate literally and between the lines in order to understand how and when these messages are effective. We will also review the role that mental processes such as attention, memory, inference, and decision making play in shaping how we interpret persuasive messages.</p><p>Having a better grasp of these mechanisms will help students consciously evaluate the intended impact of certain advertising techniques. A further goal is to provide conceptual tools for evaluating the scientific soundness of laws and policies pertaining to advertising. Social sciences.</p></div>

How do these techniques contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying language, development, attention, perception, and memory? This course will provide a foundation of knowledge and experience with methods, analyses and interpretation for consumers of research as well as those who intend to use EEG and ERP. 0.5 credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSYC 025. Research Design and Analysis</head><p>How can one answer psychological questions? What counts as evidence for a theory? This course addresses questions about the formulation and evaluation of theories in psychology. The scientific model of psychological hypothesis testing is emphasized, including the critical evaluation of various research designs and methodology, understanding basic data analysis and statistical issues, and the application of those critical thinking skills to social science findings reported in the media. Students also learn to design and conduct psychology studies, analyze data generated from those studies, and write up their findings in the format of a psychology journal article.

Scientific Computing for Psychology</head><p>Progress in psychology (and many other fields) increasingly relies on using computational tools for data analysis. This course is intended to provide an introduction to scientific computing for students interested in Psychology, but who have little programming experience. Students will learn Python, a programming language widely used for scientific research, through a process of framing hypotheses, performing statistical tests, and visualizing results using large datasets collected from psychological experiments. Note that this course serves as a possible prerequisite for a more advanced scientific computing course in the Spring. Prerequisite: PSYC 001 and PSYC 025 or permission of Instructor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSYC 028. Stereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination</head><p>Humans are social creatures; interpersonal relationships and group membership are critical to our survival and well-being. The formation of groups, however, can give rise to ingroup favoritism, stereotyping, and discrimination against outgroup members. This course will examine social psychological theory and research on the causes and consequences of stereotypes, prejudice &amp; discrimination, emphasizing sociocultural, cognitive, personality, neuroscience and motivational perspectives. We will study the development and causes of stereotypes and prejudice, and reasons for their persistence and prevalence. We will consider both the effects that stereotypes and prejudice have on people's perceptions of and behaviors toward particular groups or group members, as well as their effects on members of stereotyped groups. Finally, we will explore the implications of research findings on stereotypes, prejudice &amp; discrimination for education, business and government policies; and will discuss possible techniques for reducing prejudice and discrimination.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSYC 031A. Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</head><p>This course focuses on the neural underpinnings of cognitive (memory, attention), social (theory of mind, empathy), and affective (emotion, evaluation) processes, as well as how they interact with and contribute to each other. We consider how such processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social and emotional phenomena. Many believe that the expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with others -competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we review current theories and methods guiding social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience, taking a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSYC 032. Perception</head><p>Perception is fundamental to both cognition and action. How does perception work? This course covers a variety of scientific theories of perception including biological analyses of comparative functional anatomy of sensory systems and the informational "ecology" in which they have evolved, as well as functionalist information processing theories including computational, statistical and inferential approaches. An integrated series of laboratories and demonstrations provides students with experience testing theories of perception empirically. The capacity for language sets the human mind apart from all other minds, both natural and artificial, and so contributes critically to making us who we are. In this course, we ask several fundamental questions about the psychology of language: How do children acquire it so quickly and accurately? How do we understand and produce it, seemingly without effort? What are its biological underpinnings? What is the relationship between language and thought? How did language evolve? And to what extent is the capacity for language "built in" (genetically) versus "built up" (by experience)? Prerequisite: PSYC 001, or COGS 001, or permission of the instructor.

In those contexts, we learn about what it means to be and how to behave as members of a group or groups. Further, societally, group membership is associated with power and privilege for some, and marginalization for others. In this course, we will review how researchers have conceptualized culture, difference, and multiculturalism. A significant portion of the class will be spent considering race, ethnicity, and culture from a psychological perspective, particularly as they relate to interactions between dominant and nondominant groups.

Interested students with The Religion Department plays a central role in the Swarthmore academic program. One attraction of the study of religion is the cross-cultural nature of its subject matter. The discipline addresses the complex interplay of culture, history, text, morality, performance, and personal experience. Religion is expressed in numerous ways: ritual and symbol, myth and legend, story and poetry, scripture and theology, festival and ceremony, art and music, moral codes and social values. The department seeks to develop ways of understanding these phenomena in terms of their historical and cultural particularity and in reference to their common patterns. Courses offered on a regular cycle in the department present the development of Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Afro-Caribbean religions, and Christianity as well as the development of religion and religions in the regional areas of the Indian Sub-Continent (Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh), Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam), China (Taoist, Confucian, spirit cults), Japan (Buddhist and Shinto), Africa (Fon, Yoruba, Dahomey, and Kongo), the Middle East (Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Gnostic, Mandean), Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Europe and the Americas (from New World African traditions, Vodou and Candomblé, to Neo Paganism and Civil Religion in North America). Breadth in subject matter is complemented by strong methodological diversity; questions raised include those of historical, theological, philosophical, literary, feminist, sociological, and anthropological interests. This multifaceted focus makes religious studies an ideal liberal arts major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>Normally, the student who applies for a major or minor in religion will have completed (or be in the process of completing) two courses in the discipline. Majors successfully complete eight credits in religion, including the required Senior Symposium (Religion Café) in the fall of the senior year, to meet departmental and college graduation requirements. Minors complete five credits in the Religion Department and are not required, but are strongly recommended to enroll in the Senior Symposium. Majors and minors are required to take one introductory course.</p><p>Students come to the study of religion through various courses at various levels, and the department encourages this flexibility and diversity of entry-points by having no introductory course requirements, nor are there required distribution courses. The major in religion is planned in consultation with faculty members in the department, the individual student's advisor, along with other relevant faculty, who encourage curricular breadth (close work in more than one religious tradition) and methodological diversity in the proposed program. Such breadth and diversity in the program is encouraged at the very beginning in the major's Sophomore Plan. The curriculum in the Religion Department is strongly comparative, thematic, and interdisciplinary, so it is relatively easy for students to propose programs that are crosscultural and trans-disciplinary in scope. Religion majors are encouraged to include study abroad in their programs, planned in collaboration with the department. Often a student's independent study project done while studying abroad is expanded into a one or two-credit honors or course thesis upon return to Swarthmore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major and Minor</head><p>Requirements General major requirements are 8 credits in religion, including the Senior Symposium (Religion Café). In addition to completing (at least) eight religion credits, students who major in religion are free to take a variety of courses of their own choice, in consultation with the department and their departmental advisor; however, students are required to take one introductory course. Introductory courses include:</p><p>• RELG 003. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religion</head><p>• RELG 019. First-Year Seminar: Religion and Food • and all writing (W) courses Majors are also required to enroll in the Senior Symposium: Religion Café, in the fall of the student's senior year. Successful completion of the Religion Café will be the culminating requirement for the course major. For all religion majors the Religion Café will be a one-credit seminar style course and will include a term essay assignment. Religion minors will complete (at least) five religion credits, and are not required, but are strongly recommended to enroll in the Senior Symposium: Religion Café. Students may choose to write a thesis. Those seniors who desire to complete a one-credit thesis or a two-credit thesis as part of the major will need to obtain permission from a faculty advisor in consultation with the department. For majors, this exercise will not substitute for the Senior Symposium. With department approval, up to three courses cross-listed but not housed within the Religion Department may count toward the major. Only one such cross-listed course will count toward the minor. Up to two non-Swarthmore courses (i.e., courses taken abroad or domestically) may count toward the major; only one such course is permissible for the minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Major</head><p>The Religion Department considers two areas when evaluating applications: overall GPA and quality of prior work in religion courses. Applicants are sometimes deferred for a term so the department can better evaluate an application for the major (generally it is expected that students will have taken two courses in religion before being accepted into the major/minor). A student's demonstrated ability to do at least B/B-work in religion is required for admission to the major in course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Major and Minor</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements</head><p>All honors majors and minors fulfill requirements for the Course Program. Beyond this step, the normal method of preparation for the honors major will be done through three seminars, although with the consent of the department, a single 2-credit thesis, a 1-credit thesis/course combination, or a combination of two courses (including attachments and study abroad options) can count for one honors preparation. In general, only one such preparation can consist of non-seminar-based studies. In the religion major, the mode of assessing a student's three 2-credit preparations in religion (seminars or course combinations, but not 2-credit theses) will be a three-hour written examination set by an external examiner. In addition, with the exception of a thesis preparation, a student will submit to each external examiner a Senior Honors Study paper. Senior Honors Study papers will be between 2500 and 4000 words and will normally be a revision of the final seminar paper or, in the event of a non-seminar mode of preparation, a revised course paper. A final oral examination by the examiner follows the written exam. 2-credit theses will be read and orally examined by an external examiner (with no extra Senior Honors Study requirement). In the minor, the mode of assessing a student's one 2-credit preparation in religion will also be a threehour written examination (and the oral) set by an external examiner, along with a Senior Honors Study paper. Seminars and the written and oral external examinations are the hallmarks of honors. Seminars are a collaborative and cooperative venture among students and faculty members designed to promote self-directed learning. The teaching faculty evaluates seminar performance based on the quality of seminar papers, comments during seminar discussions, and when required, a final paper. Since the seminar depends on the active participation of all its members, the department expects students to live up to the standards of honors. These standards include: attendance at every seminar session, timely submission of seminar papers, reading of seminar papers before the seminar, completion of the assigned readings prior to the seminar, active engagement in seminar discussions, and respect for the opinions of the members of the seminar. Students earn double-credit for seminars and should expect twice the work normally done in a course. The external examination, both written and oral, is the capstone of the honors experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Honors Program</head><p>Because of the nature of different instructional formats (e.g., seminars) and of the culminating exercise in the Honors Program, the department expects applicants to this program to have at least a B+/B average in religion courses as well as an overall average above the College graduation requirement for admission to the Honors Program.</p></div>

These two disciplines approach the study of social life from different avenues, each bringing a set of separate and overlapping analytical and research tools to intellectual tasks that are complementary and synergistic. Our students seek knowledge about societies of the world and the social dynamics within them. To that end, our majors each conduct independent projects based on primary research and/or fieldwork during their senior year. Anthropology and Sociology analyze experiences at the level of the individual or the group and connect them to larger social dynamics. The disciplines illustrate how matters that are often perceived as "private troubles" are actually consequences of cultural categories and social structures, including those that appear and feel natural and inevitable. Among the goals of Anthropology and Sociology are to acquire knowledge about different social groups and culture systems and to engage critically with the complexities of social life. The Department of Sociology and Anthropology offers a Course Major, Honors Major and Minor, and several Special Majors, but no Course Minor.</p></div>

Foundations: Culture, Power and Meaning offers students a foundation in theories, methods, and history of the discipline of cultural anthropology. Anthropology is a comparative study of culture, practice, and human diversity. This course will introduce students to some of the discipline's key conceptual innovations, theoretical approaches, and past and present debates. Anthropologists study various societies to understand how meaning is constituted and circulated, how daily practices are structured by social norms and power systems, and how people resist, subvert, and transform inequalities and common modes of identification. Drawing on deep engagement with specific groups, communities, and processes, anthropology offers unique insights into pressing questions of our time, such as the effects of the global circulation of capital and people and how social structures, cultural-political ideologies, and everyday life interact. Topics to be covered include ritual and religion, kinship and family, gift and exchange, citizenship and nationalism, gender and sexuality, medicine and healing, media and circulation, and food and consumption. Students will gain familiarity with ethnography, anthropology's flagship genre. We will also explore the discipline's key field research methods and the ethical issues related to its goals to understand, interpret, and represent the lived experiences of people in diverse contexts. SOCI 001. Foundations: Self, Culture and Society a foundational introduction to the discipline of sociology. Throughout the course, we will examine key theories and concepts sociologists use, reading authors like W.E.B. DuBois, Marx, Weber, Durkheim and Bourdieu. We will also explore some of the key issues sociology tackles, including race and racism, gender and sexism, class and inequality, and the role of states and other power structures in shaping these and other facets of our social world.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and Off-Campus Study</head><p>There are a number of ways in which off-campus study can be either integral or complementary to an honors major in Sociology and Anthropology. These include, but are not restricted to, the development of an honors preparation from work abroad and preparation for the senior thesis. To explore off-campus study possibilities, students must consult with the Chair of the department. Students who contemplate basing an honors preparation on off-campus study work must seek the department's conditional approval for this, before undertaking off-campus study. Upon returning from abroad, students must request departmental approval of the honors preparation based on work done abroad. To do this, students must submit to the department all materials done abroad, including syllabi and written work, which are intended to be part of the honors preparation. Upon review of these materials, the department will notify the student as to whether or not the proposed honors preparation is approved. Students should expect approval of only one honors preparation which includes off-campus study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Minor</head><p>Acceptance to the SOAN honors minor normally requires completion of at least two courses in the department with at least a B average for work in the department and at least a B average overall. The department will evaluate the progress of students writing Senior Honor Thesis before the end of November. If progress is deemed inadequate, the student will be asked to withdraw from Honors. Students seeking to complete an Honors minor normally complete at least five units of work in the department; -three are required: ANTH 001, SOCI 001, and at least one designated methods course -one 2-credit preparation: an honors seminar, a thesis, a class with an attachment, or with permission, paired upper level courses. The Honors Minor includes: One honors preparation in Sociology and Anthropology. Depending on the format of the presentation, the examiner will receive the materials: 1. For thesis preparations: thesis will be sent (the last day of April in your senior year) to and read by an external examiner, who will also administer an oral exam. These will be the bases for the examiner's evaluation of thesis. 2. For non-thesis preparations: evaluations will be in the form of written assignments or examinations given by the external examiners and completed by honors students at the end of the senior year.</p><p>External examiners will also administer oral examinations. attachment, paired upper level courses, or in special circumstances, off campus study. The latter three forms of preparation must have the advance approval of the supervising faculty member and of the department. 2. For thesis preparations: thesis will be sent (the last day of April in your senior year) to and read by an external examiner, who will also administer an oral exam. These will be the bases for the examiner's evaluation of thesis. 3. For non-thesis preparations: evaluations will be in the form of written examinations based on the syllabi given by the external examiners and completed by honors students at the end of the senior year. External examiners will also administer oral examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thesis / Culminating Exercise</head><p>In order to graduate, all majors housed in the Sociology and Anthropology Department must complete a 2-credit thesis. The 2-credit senior thesis requirement, normally completed in the fall and spring semesters of the senior year, includes thesis Writers Masters Class and a thesis tutorial in which the student works closely with a faculty advisor. The senior thesis project represents the centrality of research to our disciplines, and allows students to develop their research interests through working directly with a faculty member. Students develop their analytical and writing skills and learn the process of developing and conducting a substantial research project from proposal to completed manuscript.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Because of its strong cross-cultural and transnational orientations, the department encourages students to study abroad. For many students, study abroad provides a basis for their senior thesis project (see the department's homepage for a listing of students' projects). The senior thesis project allows students to develop their research interests through working directly with a faculty member. This combination of breadth of knowledge, global understanding, and independent research make sociology and anthropology an ideal liberal arts major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research and Experiential Learning Opportunities</head><p>The Sociology and Anthropology Department emphasizes independent research. We prepare students to conduct research on primary and secondary documents as well as to conduct interviews, engage in participant observation, organize focus groups, administer surveys, and produce ethnographic films. By senior year, our students are ready to write a senior thesis that is not only based on library research but also in realworld experience. Recent student research projects have focused on issues such as alternative development programs in Latin America, health reform policies in the United States, and human rights in Africa. Independent research conducted by our students is one feature that consistently distinguishes them when they are pursuing jobs, fellowships, or graduate school admission. Some students have the opportunity to conduct original research with faculty -whose approaches run the gamut from ethnography to discourse analysis to survey research. Students also explore the historical development of Sociology and Anthropology. Research design, qualitative research, and statistical analysis are important components of many of our courses, enabling students to undertake rigorous research projects and best analyze, interpret, and communicate their findings. The curriculum also provides opportunities for students to learn techniques to creatively convey their work through photography and documentary films.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiential and Service Learning Opportunities</head><p>Experiential learning is an important component of much work in Sociology and Anthropology. Our department strongly supports participation in study abroad as well as work in the field. For many students, these experiences challenge them to ask questions that eventually serve as foundations of their senior thesis project. Study abroad and fieldwork provide an opportunity for students to develop contacts and gain rapport within their eventual research setting. Funding is available from the College to support students in their pursuit of these experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Opportunities</head><p>Summer funding opportunities exist and are particularly relevant for juniors planning research towards their senior thesis projects. Grants from a variety of college-administered sources are available to support research by students during the summer. Please have a look at our website: http://www.swarthmore.edu/x8583.xml to learn more about our extensive and generous funds for travel, research, internships, and faculty/student collaboration. We especially encourage our juniors to explore these possibilities. Funded summer research has often been the basis for fine senior theses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Certification</head><p>Each year, in conjunction with the Educational Studies Department, a number of our majors seek teacher certification. Students contemplating teacher certification would normally schedule their program in a semester which does not conflict with their senior thesis. Such programs should be developed in close consultation with advisors in the Educational Studies Department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spanish</head><p>Department of Spanish. Only two courses taken abroad that pertain to the curriculum of the department may count toward fulfillment of the major. For full immersion, all courses taken abroad must be taken in Spanish. Only advanced language courses taken abroad may receive Spanish credit.</p><p>Exceptions to the study abroad requirement: In special cases, depending on the student's language proficiency, this requirement may be waived or fulfilled with a summer-long study abroad program identified and approved by the Department of Spanish. (For summer programs, only one relevant course taken abroad may count towards fulfillment of the major.) The requirement will be waived for students who have recently arrived in the US and/or have had extensive schooling in Spanish in Spanish-speaking countries. Spanish/English bilingual students who have grown up in Spanish-speaking environments in the United States may petition to have the requirement waived or fulfilled with a summer-long study abroad program. The Spanish faculty will evaluate each case individually. 9. Upon returning from abroad, students must enroll in a one-credit advanced course in the department. 10. To graduate with a major in Spanish, a student must maintain a minimum grade of B in the discipline, and a C average in course work outside the department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culminating Exercise/Final Examination</head><p>Along with development of analytical literary and cultural abilities, majors are expected to reach an advanced level of linguistic proficiency. The Spanish Final Exam has oral and written components, both entirely in Spanish.</p><p>In the spring semester of their senior year, Spanish majors will register in SPAN 095 to develop their Spanish final paper and prepare for their oral examination. Spanish majors will re-write one of the best term papers they wrote for courses in the department. The new research paper will: a) deepen the original analysis; b) enhance the critical work on which it is based to include ample documentation; and c) increase the paper's length to at least 20 pages, plus bibliography.</p><p>Once the student has selected the paper to be revised, he/she needs to meet with the specific Spanish faculty member to agree on a timeline to turn in drafts, and discuss changes and revisions. The oral examination is based on the content of the written essay and on overall course preparation. This essay-and the student's overall course preparation-will provide the basis for the oral examination in May, conducted exclusively in Spanish. The Spanish language ability of majors, as exhibited in this paper and the oral examination, will be part of the final evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acceptance Criteria</head><p>For admission to the course major, the student needs a minimum of B level work in courses taken at Swarthmore taught in Spanish or the required introductory-level literature course (SPAN 022 or SPAN 023), demonstrated ability and interest in language and literature, and a minimum C average in course work outside the department.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Academic Program</head><p>Planning a major or minor in theater requires thoughtful care and deliberate planning. First-and second-year students thinking about a theater major should read these requirements and recommendations closely and should consult with their faculty advisor or the chair of theater Department early and often. Leave schedules, study abroad, a wide variety of intern and apprentice programs, and the importance of course sequences make long-range planning essential. Almost all theater courses and seminars are offered on a regular, annual schedule. Courses numbered 001 to 010 are introductory and are prerequisite to intermediate courses.</p><p>Courses numbered 011 to 049 are intermediate and are prerequisite to advanced courses numbered 050 through 099. Seminars carry numbers 100 and above.</p><p>Intermediate work in each of the course sequences requires a beginning course in that area. Some advanced courses carry additional prerequisites that are listed in the course descriptions.</p><p>For those majors who intend a career in theater, whether academic, not-for-profit, or commercial, internships in professional theaters are strongly recommended. Because of scheduling difficulties, students should plan and apply for internships, time spent off campus, and community projects as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Alumni guest artists are typically in residence on campus during the summer as part of the Swarthmore Project in Theater. Positions are usually available in production, development, public relations, marketing, box office, and house or stage management. Positions are usually not available in acting, directing, or design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First course recommendations</head><p>THEA 001, Theater and Performance provides an understanding and appreciation of the importance of live performance in the world. It introduces the various aspects and elements of theater as it it practiced today while helping you to identify areas of interest so you can pursue them further. The class will attend live performances, read plays and critical texts, participate in performance workshops, and focus on the process of writing effectively about theater and performance. This is a writing course that fulfills a general requirement for all theater major and minors. Next offered in Fall 2020. THEA 002A, Acting I is designed as a practical introduction to some of the principles, techniques, and tools of acting using theater games and improvisational exercises to unleash the actor's imagination, expand the boundaries of accepted logic, encourage risk-taking, and free the body and voice for the creative process. This course is open to all students without audition and requires no previous experience. It fulfills a general requirement for all Theater majors and minors and is a prerequisite for several intermediate courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 527</head><p>Theater THEA 004 courses in design (THEA 004A Set Design; THEA 004B, Lighting Design; THEA 004C, Costume Design; THEA 004D, Integrated Media; THEA 004E Sound Design) are introductory in nature, have no prerequisite, and require no previous experience. These are hand-on courses that introduce students to various aspects of creating live theater and may lead to independent projects and/or opportunities to design for Theater Department productions under the mentorship of the Department's faculty. Design courses fulfill a general requirement for all Theater majors and minors. THEA 006, Playwriting Workshop introduces students to essential elements of dramatic writing.</p><p>In-class writing exercises and weekly assignments lead to the development of character monologues, scenes, and two original one-act plays. Students will explore their individual creative voice, learning how to translate their visions through character, image, and story. This course is open to all students without prerequisite and requires no previous experience. Playwriting Workshop fulfills a general requirement for all Theater majors and minors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Major</head><p>Requirements Nine credits of work including:</p><p>• THEA 001: Theater and Performance (formerly called Introduction to Theater) • THEA 002A: Acting I (or ARTT 001:</p><p>Foundation Drawing for design-emphasis students) • Any Course in Design (THEA 004A, THEA 004B, THEA 004C, THEA 004D, hours, to be arranged with Production Manager Scott Cassidy or Costume Shop Manager Tara Webb) NB: Theater majors must complete written and oral comprehensive exams in the spring of the senior year. The areas of specialization are acting, solo performance, directing, design, playwriting, dramaturgy, and theater history. Special arrangements will be made for students who seek secondary school certification. Prospective majors should consult with the chair or their department advisor about their choice. In addition to these course requirements, the major includes a comprehensive examination in two parts: (1) an essay relating the student's experience in Senior Company; and (2) an oral examination on the essay and related subjects by theater faculty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Minor</head><p>Course minors are required to take 6.0 credits of work including:</p><p>• THEA 001: Theater and Performance (formerly called Introduction to Theater) • THEA 002A: Acting I (or ARTT 001:</p><p>Foundation Drawing for design-emphasis students) • Any Course in Design (THEA 004A, THEA 004B, THEA 004C, THEA 004D, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theater</head><p>• Two additional thesis projects or seminars to be arranged individually in consultation with the student's major advisor. • Technical/Crew Hours (approximately 40 hours, to be arranged with Production Manager Scott Cassidy or Costume Shop Manager Tara Webb) • NB: Theater majors must complete written and oral comprehensive exams in the spring of the senior year. Each major will choose an area of specialization and take one additional course in that area. One specialization will constitute the normal honors major in theater. Honors students will take Senior Company THEA 099 the fall of senior year while they are planning their production project. The usual schedule will be:Theater Seminar in the spring of junior year; fall of senior year, and prerehearsal thesis project preparation in the fall of senior year; and, rehearsal and performance of thesis project in the spring of senior year. Double majors taking three examinations in theater will also follow that schedule. For double majors taking one honors examination and comps in theater, the examination may be a production project, depending on available resources. Approval of the Sophomore Plan for any honors major is conditional upon;</p><p>• the student maintaining good academic standing through the end of the junior year. • theater honors majors approved for production thesis projects in the senior year are required to notify the department chair of their intention to drop or change their Honors Program by the end of the junior year. • an honors major in theater must receive the approval of their major advisor before committing to any extracurricular or offcampus projects during the junior or senior year in order to avoid potential conflicts with their honors thesis work. • students who prove unable to fulfill the expectations of the faculty for their Honors Programs in theater may be dropped from honors at the department's discretion. • unless for reasons of health or other personal circumstance beyond the student's control, leaving the department's Honors Program after the end of the junior year is considered a significant compromise of a student's academic performance. Honors students majoring in theater will typically make a total of three preparations as follows:</p><p>1. Seminar (listed earlier), written examination, and an oral set by an outside examiner.</p><p>2. Production project in one of the following fields: Acting, Design, Directing, Dramaturgy, Playwriting, or Solo Performance (see descriptions below). 3. A third preparation for honors will be approved at the discretion of the faculty at the end of the student's junior year. In the student's Sophomore Plan of study and again in the junior year, they will be asked to indicate their first and second preference for their third honors preparation, only one of which may be for an additional production thesis. In addition to thesis preparations in the form of performance projects, the third preparation may consist of a second seminar, staged readings in playwriting or production dramaturgy, portfolio projects in design, written thesis work in performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, etc. Due to scheduling and staffing constraints, the department can only guarantee one individual performance thesis project per student. Decisions on the third preparation in honors will be made on a case-bycase basis, in part on the quality and completeness of each student's coursework in the department through the end of the junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acting</head><p>The student, together with their advisor, will undertake a project that will take place over the course of two semesters. The fall semester will consist of a series of workshops and assignments designed to further develop the critical and practical skills required for performance. This preparatory work in the fall semester will be put to use in the spring through the production of a play or performed by the students and directed by the acting faculty. An external examiner will attend as many rehearsal sessions as possible to observe the student's process. The examiner also attends one or more of the public performances. The examination proper will consist of an extended interview directly following the performance and a briefer oral during honors weekend. The subject of the first interview will be the student's processes as he or she relates to the production. The second oral will concern the student's assessment of the entire process as a part of his or her undergraduate education and future plans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The student will function as the designer for a production presented by theater Department in one area of design. The student will produce appropriate preparatory materials for this project (research, sketches, color renderings, drafting, models, digital media, light or sound plots, etc.). Because this is a collaborative project, a production time line will need to be prepared and production meetings scheduled. In addition to the development of the design, the student will collaborate with all relevant staff and craftsmen during the fabrication stage, ensuring the full-scale design is executed as designed. The local p. 529 Theater instructor will supervise these activities appropriately, on the model of a special project in theater. The external examiner will receive copies of all materials as the student creates them and will pay close attention to the way in which the project develops under continual revision. The examiner will attend one of the public performances and in advance of honors weekend will receive in digital form the student's completed portfolio for presentation. The examination proper will consist of an extended interview directly following the performance and a briefer oral during honors weekend. The subject of the first interview will be the student's processes as he or she relates to the production. The second oral will concern the student's assessment of the entire process as a part of his or her undergraduate education and future plans. The student may also prepare a portfolio project in design as an honors thesis, with all appropriate studio work but without being linked to a specific production in the department. Such a project permits the student to create a project beyond the givens of the department's specific production environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directing</head><p>The student will, under faculty supervision, read around a given playwright's work, make a director's preparation for the entire play, and rehearse for public presentation a locally castable portion of the chosen play. Original developmental projects may be proposed, subject to the approval of the faculty advisor for thesis. The department will hire a professional collaborator (usually an actor) for a set number of rehearsal hours in connection with the project. The instructor will supervise these activities appropriately, on the model of a special project in theater. The external examiner will visit this project several times (depending on schedule and available funds). These visits (to rehearsal or planning session) will not include feedback from the examiner. The examiner attends rehearsal to know as much as possible about the student's methods of making the work. The examiner also attends one or more of the public performances. The examination proper will consist of an extended interview directly following the performance and a briefer oral during honors weekend. The subject of the first interview will be the student's processes as he or she relates to the production. The second oral will concern the student's assessment of the entire process as a part of his or her undergraduate education and future plans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dramaturgy</head><p>This project will be done in one of the following ways:</p><p>1. As a production project in the form of a one-credit attachment to the Fundamentals of Dramaturgy class (THEA 021A) or Production Dramaturgy Seminar (THEA 121) consisting of work with a faculty or student director. This will typically be in connection with Production Ensemble (THEA 022) or an honors thesis in directing. The student will create a body of writing appropriate to the specific project. This will include (but is not limited to) notes on production history, given circumstances, script analysis, program and press-kit notes, study guide, and a grant proposal. The student's work will continue in rehearsal. The external examiner will receive all materials as they are generated.</p><p>The examiner also attends one or more of the public performances. The examination proper will consist of an extended interview directly following the performance and a briefer oral during honors weekend. The subject of the first interview will be the student's processes as he or she relates to the production. The second oral will concern the student's assessment of the entire process as a part of his or her undergraduate education and future plans. 2. The completion of a stage adaptation of a non-dramatic text or combination of texts. A complete draft of the adaptation will be completed under the supervision of a faculty member in production dramaturgy, and a staged reading of a revised version of the text will be presented in collaboration with a professional director as guest artist. This is a two-credit thesis project to be completed over two semesters in the senior year, generally parallel to the honors thesis model for playwriting. The examiner will attend at least two rehearsals and the final staged reading, in addition to reading the final text and its original source. The examination will consist of an extended oral presentation given during honors weekend. 3. Students fluent in a second language can apply to do a translation of a play into or out of English as an honors thesis attachment to Production Dramaturgy. This may be a one-credit attachment for a written draft only (done with a member of the faculty) or as a two-credit thesis with a staged reading done in collaboration with a guest director, as in the adaptation thesis above. In the case of a staged reading, the examiner will attend at least two rehearsals and the final staged reading, in addition to reading the final text together with the original source. The examination proper will consist of an extended interview directly following the performance and a briefer oral during honors weekend. The subject of the first interview will be the student's processes as he or she relates to the production. The second oral will concern the student's assessment of the p. 530</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Medieval and Renaissance literature (Med/Ren) • 18th and 19th century literature (18th/19th c.) • 20th and 21st century literature (20th/21st c.)</figDesc></figure>

Latin Rhetoric &amp; History This</head><label></label><figDesc>This is an advanced Latin course, intended for students with one or more intermediate Latin courses at the college level, or c. 4 years of Latin in high school. The emperor Gaius Caligula, famous for considering his favorite racehorse for the office of consul, raises urgent questions about what we consider normal in our leaders. The emperor Claudius, made generally famous by the classic TV series "I Claudius," presents similar questions. He was a transformative figure in Roman imperial history, responsible for the creation of a civil service, expansion of the Roman citizenship, and the conquest of Britain. But he also had medical problems, and made some spectacularly inappropriate marriages. The principal Latin texts will be Suetonius' Life of Gaius Caligula, Tacitus' bitter account of Claudius in his Annals, and selected documents (inscriptions and Latin papyri). We will also read Seneca's exposition of Stoic ideals in his de Providentia, and Seneca's (?) Apocolocyntosis, a spoof account of Claudius' posthumous journey to heaven. poems in this course will be chosen in consultation with participants. Depending on interest, texts to be read in Latin may include Catullus, "The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis" and "The Lock of Berenice"; Lucretius; Vergil, Eclogues or Georgics; Ovid, esp. Ars Amatoria; the Pervigilum Veneris; selections from the Anthologia Latina; selections from the Carmina Burana or other medieval texts. Students will read modern critical scholarship and write a number of critical essays. Students interested in this course should contact the instructor, preferably before the start of classes. Prerequisite: Students should have completed one or two intermediate Latin courses at the college level, or the equivalent in high school (e.g.Classicssuccessful completion of the AP or IB programs). is an advanced intermediate course suitable for students with two or more courses of Latin at the intermediate level (or equivalent). Texts to be read in Latin may include Tacitus, Agricola and Annals (selections), Suetonius, Sallust, or Cicero. In addition, we will read certain rhetorical texts in translation, e.g. Cicero, Quintilian, or the Auctor and Herennium. This course is NOT a writing course. This course will focus on the Latin satirical poetry of Horace and Juvenal. We will also read Greek and Latin texts in English (e.g. Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence, Lucian), to explore ancient ideas about humor in general and literary characters in particular. For students at the advanced intermediate level in Latin, e.g. a 5 on the Latin AP or one or two intermediate Latin courses at the college level.

What were the secret rites of these religions? How do their mythological themes have universal value? Why are the language and themes of mystery traditions so central to the philosophical thought of Parmenides, Empedocles, and Plato? This seminar will study texts associated with Orphism, Pythagoreanism, the Eleusinian and Dionysian mystery cults, Isis and Osiris, and Presocratic and Platonic philosophy. Readings may include The Homeric Hymn to Demeter; Euripides' Bacchae; fragments of Parmenides and Empedocles; the Derveni Papyrus; Plato's Phaedo, Symposium, and Phaedrus; and Apuleius' Golden Ass. Topics discussed will include cosmology, mystical knowledge/ascent; philosophical method; allegorical interpretation; immortality of the soul; archetypal figures of mother/daughter and rebirth.

The emperor Gaius Caligula, famous for considering his favorite racehorse for the office of consul, raises urgent questions about what we consider normal in our leaders. The emperor Claudius, made generally famous by the classic TV series "I Claudius," presents similar questions. He was a transformative figure in Roman imperial history, responsible for the creation of a civil service, expansion of the Roman citizenship, and the conquest of Britain. But he also had medical problems, and made some spectacularly inappropriate marriages. The principal Latin texts will be Suetonius' Life of Gaius Caligula, Tacitus' bitter account of Claudius in his Annals, and selected documents (inscriptions and Latin papyri).

Finally, it analyzes the effects of various market-oriented education reforms such as vouchers and charter schools.Economics government stabilization policy. Models are developed of the determination of output, interest rates, prices, inflation, and other aggregate variables such as fiscal and trade surpluses and deficits. Students analyze conflicting views of business cycles, stabilization policy, and inflation/unemployment trade-offs. This course is designed to provide students with an intermediate level study of corporate accounting theory and practice as it falls within the framework of United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A major focus of the course is how accounting provides information to various user groups so that they can make more informed decisions. In particular, students will learn the steps in the accounting cycle leading up to the preparation and analysis of corporate financial statements. Students are also exposed to some of the fundamental differences between federal tax rules and external financial reporting requirements and are made aware of the organizations that influence and contribute to the body of knowledge in financial accounting.

This course will examine how Shakespeare, Jonson, and their contemporaries turn repeatedly to the law for dramatic energy. Their plays compel a number of questions: what does it mean to take pleasure in injustice? What is the relationship between human and divine justice? These questions often demand historical answers, and our class will examine howENGL 046.

The focus will be on creating nuanced symbolic representations of the language that can be employed by computers, to the benefit of both language researchers who wish to test grammatical models, and language communities which lack the social capital to benefit from corporately developed resources. Topics covered include input methods and spell-checking, morphological analysis and disambiguation, syntactic parsing, building corpora, and rule-based machine translation, with an emphasis on open source technologies.

Syntax II This course builds on the concepts and tools of syntactic analysis from Ling 050 by closely examining a single topic in the primary literature in syntactic theory. This semester we explore the notion ofsubjecthood in syntactic theory. As we read classic and recent papers on how subjecthood has been defined, we will ask questions such as: How do we know when a constituent is the subject of a sentence? Why do only some languages seem to have restrictions on subjects? Are restrictions on subjecthood relevant to syntax, semantics, or to discourse? Is it possible for a sentence to have no subject? If a constituent has some properties of subjecthood but not others, is it appropriate to call this constituent a "subject"? This course will deepen critical reading and writing skills and as well as students' familiarity with syntactic phenomena in languages other than English.

This course builds upon foundational concepts in sociolinguistic theory to examine discourses of news and entertainment media, across science fiction and politics. Drawing upon contributions in applied linguistics, media studies, cultural studies, and animal studies, we ask which realities are mirrored in our everyday language and in the fictional and sensationalized worlds we engage in through the media we consume. What role does science fiction play in our explorations of social difference, deviance, control, disability, sexuality, and normativity? Can science fiction assist the goals of social justice and democracy? How does language surface in the biopolitics of human and non-humans? Together, we will explore key film and television, and select novels by authors Max Brooks, Octavia Butler, Philip K. Dick, and George Orwell. Students will learn advanced methods and theories in multimodal critical linguistic typology to critically assess the design of existing constructed languages such as Esperanto and Klingon.

First Course Recommendations PEAC 003. Crisis Resolution in the Middle East This introductory course is designed for students without a background in Peace and Conflict Studies or Middle East Studies. Central questions include: How do we define crises in the contemporary Middle East/North Africa region? How does the nature of the crisis (political, economic, social, and environmental) impact communities differently? How are grassroots actors, civil society institutions, states, and international organizations responding to these challenges in their nation-states and across borders? What transnational networks of solidarity have linked the Middle East to other regions across the globe? For instance, this course will examine the consequences of environmental degradation and escalating food prices on conflict and instability across the region. We will trace the origins of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and social movements calling for rights and reforms on one hand and the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism (i.e. Al-Qaeda and ISIS). Furthermore, the course will explore crises such as contemporary Syria, and how local and international interventions aimed at reversing the marginalization of-and threats against-minority populations (ethnic, religious, gender, sexuality, ability) have come to constitute a realm of crisis management. By understanding crises through theoretical prism of human security frameworks, we will ascertain the prospects for democratization, development, pluralism, and peace in the region.

Without a representative assembly, to be sure, democracy becomes plebiscitary and juristocratic. But a wellfunctioning national legislature is hardly guaranteed because legislatures are inherently unstable -even fluid ---institutions. Congress today is not the same institution it was a decade ago or a century ago. With these premises in hand we explore the evolution of the House and the Senate, We also treat the congressional career, majority and minority rights, parties in Congress, Topics in environmental politics, policy, and law. In the United States, we focus on national regulation and proposals for more flexible responses to achieve environmental goals; environmental movements and environmental justice; the role of science in democratic policymaking; courts and the impact of federalism, the commerce clause, and rights on regulation. The course also considers the role and efficacy of supranational institutions and NGOs and controversies between more and less developed nations. Topics include most of the following: air and water pollution, common-pool resource problems, toxic and radioactive waste, sustainable development, food, natural resource management, wilderness, environmental racism, effects of climate change. Examines historical, political, and activist roots of the field of environmental justice. Using interdisciplinary approaches from political ecology, environmental science, history, geography, cultural studies, and social movement theory, we analyze diverse environmental justice struggles and community activism in contemporary environmental issues such as: air quality and health, toxic contamination and reproductive issues, sustainable agriculture and food security, fossil energy-coal, oil, hydrofracking-and livelihoods, climate change and climate justice.

Fantastic Spaces in Modern</head><p>Japanese Literature (Cross-listed as JPNS 041) As Japanese society has transferred rapidly in the 20th century and beyond, a number of authors have turned to the fantastic to explore the pathways of cultural memory, the vicissitudes of interpersonal relationships, the limits of mind and body, and the nature of storytelling itself. In this course, we will consider the use of anti-realistic writing genres in Japanese literature from 1900 to the present, combining readings of novels and short stories with related critical and theoretical texts. Fictional works examined will include novels, supernatural tales, science fiction, and cyber-fiction by authors such as Tanizaki Junichirô, Abe Kôbô, Kurahasi Yumiko, and Murakami Haruki. Humanities.

Introduction to Philosophy:</head><p>Knowledge and the World "Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth-more than ruin, more than even death." Bertrand Russell believed that education's primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 118. Philosophy of Mind</head><p>The course is divided into three principal sections, focusing on philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. Section 1 covers four core positions in the philosophy of mind "dualism, behaviorism, materialism, and functionalism," and it serves as an overview of traditional philosophy of mind. Section 2 explores how the philosophical ideas developed above connect to ongoing research in artificial intelligence. Section 3 concerns the philosophy of cognitive science, a field that investigates the biological and neurophysiological underpinnings of human mentality. Part of the aim is to clarify the goals and methods of cognitive science and to investigate ways in which advances in cognitive science may yield philosophical insights into the nature of mind.</p><p>Humanities. 2 credits.

Philosophy of Science</head><p>A study of philosophical problems arising out of the presuppositions, methods, and results of the natural sciences, focusing particularly on the effectiveness of science as a means for obtaining knowledge. Topics include the difference between science and pseudoscience; the idea that we can "prove" or "confirm" scientific theories; explanation and prediction; the status of scientific methodology as rational, objective, and value free; and the notion that science aims to give us (and succeeds in giving us) knowledge of the underlying unobservable structure of the world.

Phenomenology, Existentialism, and Poststructuralism</head><p>In this course, we will examine themes of reality, truth, alienation, authenticity, death, desire, and human subjectivity as they emerge in contemporary European philosophy. We will consider thinkers such as Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Derrida, Irigaray, and Deleuze to place contemporary themes of poststructuralist thought in the context of the phenomenological and existential tradition out of which they emerge. This course is designed for students who are interested in learning about issues surrounding science education, particularly at the high school and college level. How do students most effectively learn science? How can we facilitate this learning process as instructors and educators? How do we best assess whether such learning is happening? Since the course will integrate educational theory with concrete, practical strategies for becoming better teachers, it will be particularly relevant for students currently serving as Science Associates (or those who are interested in being Science Associates.) We will touch on issues related to students' conceptual development and conceptual change, collaborative learning, as well as practical issues encountered when engaging in responsive, interactive teaching. This is a seminar course where students are responsible for weekly readings (1-2 papers per week from the education research literature), in class discussions, and brief written reflections. Students will be encouraged to bring to the discussion their own unique experiences as both science students and science teachers.

Jah, Rastafari! Elements of Rasta culture --reggae music, locking one's hair, smoking ganja --became iconic in global media over the 20th century. However, much mystery still shrouds the everyday livity of the Rastafari, or those practices that Rastas use to manage their daily riddims, that take their shape along a moral horizon that loathes oppression and frames the experience of Transatlantic slavery and capitalism as a Babylonian Captivity of biblical proportions, but that nevertheless holds open the possibility of community to outsiders through an ethos of one love, good vibrations, and feelin' irie.</p><p>Through primary and secondary readings, ethnographic videos and audio recordings (including music-immersive listening activities), material and sartorial culture objects, and in-class lectures and discussions, this course approaches the Rastafari as a mythic story of Jamaican experience told in a kaleidoscope of dimensions: tropes of Ethiopianism across the Diaspora, African antecedent traditions (myal, obeah, kumina, and burru), Jamaican Christianity, Anglican hymnology, and the Biblical typology of Israel, reggae as world music and political movement, the Black Radical Tradition that views freedom as marronage and fugitivity, and that manifests within Jamaican histories of slave uprisings like Tacky's Rebellion or Marcus Garvey's UNIA "Back to Africa" nationalism.</p><p>Humanities. 1 credit.

Foundations: Culture, Power and Meaning</head><p>This course offers students a foundation in theories, methods, and history of the discipline of cultural anthropology. Anthropology is a comparative study of culture, practice, and human diversity. This course will introduce students to some of the discipline's key conceptual innovations, theoretical approaches, and past and present debates. Anthropologists study various societies to understand how meaning is constituted and circulated, how daily practices are structured by social norms and power systems, and how people resist, subvert, and transform inequalities and common modes of identification. Drawing on deep engagement with specific groups, communities, and processes, anthropology offers unique insights into pressing questions of our time, such as the effects of the global circulation of capital and people and how social structures, cultural-political ideologies, and everyday life interact.

This course will provide students with an introduction to the origin and evolution of ideas about development, and will encourage them to examine major theories and approaches to development from classical modernization theories to world-systems theories. Students will gain insight into how ideas of development fit into larger global dynamics of power and politics and how, contrary to professed goals, the practices of international development have often perpetuated poverty and widened the gap between rich and poor.

Ethnography is the bread and butter of sociocultural anthropology, both as a research method and genre of writing. Ethnographic research methods are also gaining in popularity as a research methodology beyond the discipline as well as beyond the academy. Ethnographic research can be used to explore a range of scales, from the minutia of everyday experience-what Bronislaw Malinowski called the "imponderabilia of actual life"-to broad brushstroke analyses of social structure and symbolic meaning. But how do anthropologists practice their craft? What exactly do they do "out there" in the field and what is unique about their modes of studying human experience? This course offers students an opportunity to explore and gain practice using a variety of methods used in ethnographic research. We will pay particular attention to questions of knowledge, location, evidence, ethics, power, translation, experience, and the way theoretical problems can be framed in terms of ethnographic research. This course is in large part a workshop in which students will learn and mobilize various ethnographic methods and techniques, engage in ethnographic writing, and actively evaluate and guide one another's work.</p><p>Students will apply what they learn during the course toward designing their own ethnographic research project.

We work historically by reading classical texts that exemplify different approaches (such as functionalism, structuralism, symbolic anthropology, and reflexive anthropology) used to analyze culture and social structure. We address questions such as: How did Malinowski understand ethnography? How does this understanding compare to more recent views of anthropologists such as Geertz? How did the meaning of fieldwork change over time? We pay special attention to the politics of representation and the anthropologists' continuous struggle to find new ways to write about culture.

Environmental Anthropology</head><p>This course offers students an introduction to Environmental Anthropology, a subfield of anthropology which encompasses the study of the interrelationships between humans and the ecosystems in which they are embedded as well as analysis and application of anthropological knowledge to contemporary environmental issues. Humans have transformed their environments for millennia, but in recent decades, have altered the global environment in ways that have no precedent in human history or in geological time. With contemporary environmental crises as its backdrop, this course examines some classic and contemporary anthropological approaches to the environment, exploring the value of anthropological theory, methods, and approaches in the humanistic study of the environment. In this sense, the course will expose students to diverse ways for thinking about the environment in its many dimensions and critical perspectives on contemporary environmental issues. We will review various theoretical approaches and their implications for our understanding of human relations to the environment, and explore how anthropologists and those they study are engaging with contemporary environmental issues including biodiversity conservation, deforestation, community-based natural resource management, ecotourism, and climate change.

Who makes our food, what we eat, how we eat, and with whom we eat all reflect and reproduce various social connections and inequalities. This class explores how food, its making, and its consumption have been analyzed by different scholars, particularly anthropologists. We will also look at how various societies define, manage, and regulate the preparation and consumption of food. The class consider questions such as: Why do we serve specific foods at certain occasions? What constitutes a proper meal? How does class, gender, race, and ethnicity shape the making and serving of certain foods? Why might a particular food be viewed a delicacy in one society, but be seen as disgusting and repulsive in another? How did food become a "problem" that has to be managed in many of our contemporary societies? Through our readings and discussions, we will seek a deeper understanding of edible matters, how we shape them and how they shape us. Social Sciences. 1 credit. </p></div>

Art, Money, Power</head><p>By the dawn of the twenty-first century, a massive international network of public and private institutions, commercial art galleries, annual art fairs and plurennial mega-exhibitions had become firmly entrenched as a new global infrastructure through which art works, artists, professional curators, and art collectors now roam. How did this international art system come to be? How does it serve both to authorize and to constrain the kinds of practices that can assume the label of "contemporary art"? In this course we will take an historical and cross-cultural approach to understanding the multiple, dynamic relationships between art, money, and power, asking how different sociocultural modes of accumulating wealth have facilitated the development of different artistic practices, and how these in turn have both challenged and reproduced existing arrangements of power relations. Our case studies will come from cultural anthropology, art history and monetary history, and we will practice interpreting artworks through the lens of critical theories of power.

The human experience of sickness entails a complex interplay between biological, socio-economic and cultural factors. This course offers an introduction to medical anthropology, and draws upon social, cultural, biological, and linguistic anthropology to better understand those factors which influence health and well being (broadly defined), the experience and distribution of illness, the prevention and treatment of sickness, healing processes, the social relations of therapy management, and the cultural importance and use of pluralistic medical systems.

Anthropology of Public Health</head><p>This course introduces students to the study of "public health" and various problems framed by public health actors through theoretical and methodological lenses of sociocultural anthropology. The field of public health is typically defined by its commitment to understand not just the manifestations and patterns of illness in populations, but the social, political and economic forces that place certain individuals and populations at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. By critically examining various frameworks for understanding disease in human populations, the class will explore the potentials and challenges of improving health and healthcare in various populations, both within and outside of the United States. Additionally, this class aims to demonstrate the value of anthropology to the field of public health and to efforts to solve national and global health problems. Students will be urged to think about "public health" and "global health" as dynamic cultural artifacts and cultural systems; and likewise, to consider how ethnography is an important methodological tool, both to understand public health agendas as well as to investigate the subjects and elisions of public health interventions.

In addition, we read ethnographies and novels and watch films to explore questions such as: How is space socially constructed? What is the relationship between space and power? How is this relationship embedded in urban forms under projects of modernity and postmodernity? How do the ordinary practitioners of the city resist and transform these forms? Our discussion will pay special attention to issues related to racism and segregation, ethnic enclaves, urban danger, gendered spaces, colonial urbanism, and the "global" city.

Anthropology of Capitalism</head><p>In the wake of the global financial system's recent paroxysms, it is more urgent than ever that students of anthropology be equipped to understand the social and cultural dimensions of contemporary capitalism. This seminar will therefore examine the defining features of the current capitalist milieu through the lens of comparative ethnography. Combining classic theoretical readings on the structure and development of capitalism with concrete ethnographic studies, we will analyze a broad sample of the many guises under which capital travels across political, economic, and cultural borders. These analyses will then enable us to approach the more pressing question of how individual actors can and do contribute to the transformation of the global cultural economy. </p></div>

Urban Ethnographies (M)</head><p>As key players in the global economy, cities are the focus of a rich body of literature that explores how urban life is shaped by the complex interplay between global, national, and local processes. How to best understand this interplay and how it shapes daily life in cities? How can we understand the inequalities that structure daily life in urban centers around the globe? How to analyze the different identities, spaces, and subjectivities that are being constituted under changing economic, social, and political conditions? In this seminar, we read ethnographies from and about cities around the globe and analyze how scholars, particularly anthropologists, have studied cities, their cultures, and social groups. We pay attention to the forces (such as neoliberalism, modernism, nationalism, and globalization) and inequalities (such as class, race, and gender) that shape urban life. The texts we read explore current pressing issues such as poverty, violence, policing, gentrification, and homelessness. Alongside our investigation of city life, students also will have the opportunity to develop their skills in ethnographic research methods by closely analyzing how different authors accessed and wrote about cities as well as by conducting their own mini-ethnographies.

First-Year Seminar:The Working Class and the Politics of Whiteness</head><p>Who are the "white working class" in the United States? How do they live, what do they believe, and why? Do they constitute the base of support for Donald Trump in the US? Are they motivated by "racial resentment" or "economic precarity"? Or, is there even such a thing as "the" white working class? How did this racialized category come to evoke images of both "everyday Americans" in some circles, and (in at least in some others) people who belong in the "basket of deplorables" described by Hillary Clinton?Or, is there even such a thing as "the" white working class? How did this racialized category come to evoke images of both "everyday Americans" in some circles, and (in at least in some others) people who belong in the "basket of deplorables" described by Hillary Clinton? This course is dedicated to both sets of questions. First, we will look at the actual lives, beliefs, and political behavior of people who could be categorized as white and poor or working class.

Introduction to Race and Ethnicity in the United States</head><p>Today, most sociologists and anthropologists acknowledge that race is a social construct and not a biologically measurable and discrete category. Although race does not exist in any consistent physiological way, it remains a central aspect of personal and cultural identity, often standing in for the concept of culture or ethnicity and usually connoted by physically identifiable (or marked) difference. Race is also one of the most significant predictors of quality of life for groups and individuals in the United States. With this in mind, we will examine the concepts of race and its history in the United States. Paying particular attention to the legacy of white supremacy in the United States, we will explore the multiple ways that race and ethnicity function in this country. Social sciences.</p><p>1 credit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language Requirement</head><p>To receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science, candidates must fulfill a foreign language requirement. The foreign language requirement can be fulfilled by:</p><p>1. Successfully studying 3 years or the "block" equivalent of a single foreign language in grades 9 through 12 (work done before grade 9 cannot be counted, regardless of the course level); 2. Achieving a score of 600 or better on a standard achievement test of a foreign language; 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spanish Placement Test</head><p>The Department of Spanish offers a placement test so as to appropriately position students in language classes when they arrive on campus. New students who have previously studied or have fluency in Spanish should plan to take the placement test. The Spanish Placement Test is in an online multiple-choice format, which allows you to take it at your convenience. Immediately upon completion of the test, you will receive a score and p. 517 Spanish placement recommendation. You may register in the designated course during the registration period, unless an oral interview is required. It is important to emphasize that the online placement test and survey are for diagnostic purposes only. These diagnostic tools may be supplemented by your instructor's evaluation during the first week of classes, at which time he or she may recommend a change of course level. The test must represent your own work. When taking it, you will be bound by Swarthmore College's Code of Academic and Personal Integrity. You may take this test only once. Please remember to complete the language survey that appears at the beginning of the test.</p><p>First-year students must login to mySwarthmore and click on the Placement exam tab for access and detailed instructions. It is important that students complete the language survey that appears at the beginning of the test. Upon completion of the exam, students can register in the designated course during the registration period, unless an oral interview is required. Upper-class students interested in taking the test should contact the Spanish department for information and instructions (spanish@swarthmore.edu or (610) 328-8143). The Spanish Placement Test is not a substitute for an official standard achievement test of a foreign language (such as the College Board exams or the International Baccalaureate). Therefore, it does not serve as proof of achievement for the purpose of fulfilling the language requirement. This test is only intended to assist instructors in placing students in the appropriate Spanish courses at Swarthmore. The Spanish Placement Test is required for all students, including students with AP/IB scores.</p></div>

The department will grant 1 credit for incoming students who have achieved a score of 6 or 7 in a foreign language on the International Baccalaureate once they have successfully completed a one-credit course in Spanish at the College. Note: Students with Spanish AP-IB scores are nonetheless required to take the online placement test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Off-campus study is an enriching intellectual experience when it is fully integrated into the student's overall academic experience at Swarthmore. Since the principal educational advantages of study abroad are in-depth crosscultural exposure and language learning, the best study abroad programs are those that maximize these benefits by fully immersing students in the host country's culture and society. This goal can only be effectively achieved by choosing full immersion off-campus study programs. Pursuing academic coursework in English in a Spanishspeaking country does not comply with the academic goals and mission of the Department of Spanish. Students on financial aid may apply that aid to designated programs of study abroad. All Spanish majors and minors are required to complete an off-campus study program in a Spanish-speaking country. Swarthmore College offers students interested in studying abroad several programs listed on the department's website. We strongly suggest that majors and minors as well as non-specialists meet with a Spanish faculty member to discuss the possibilities and find the program that best suits their academic needs and interests. Waiver of the study abroad requirement for students of Spanish: Majors and minors of Spanish who cannot go abroad for one semester due to academic or other constraints should speak to the chair of the department to discuss their circumstances. In special cases, depending on the student's language proficiency, the off-campus study requirement may be waived or fulfilled with a summer-long off-campus study program identified and approved by the department. For summer programs, only one relevant course taken abroad may count towards fulfillment of the minor or major. Please consult with the chair of the department if you have any questions. The Department of Spanish encourages students to choose programs that build on previous language study. In order to be better prepared for academic work in Spanish, we recommend students take a writing course in Spanish <ref type="figure">(SPAN 008, SPAN  012, SPAN 022, or SPAN 023)</ref> at Swarthmore prior to going abroad. Upon returning from abroad, majors or minors must enroll in an advanced literature course in the department.</p></div>

The goal is to understand the key cultural processes that have shaped Latin America and Spain. We will begin by examining early contact between Europeans and Amerindian civilizations. We will analyze how the history of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions in Spain had a great impact on how the Spanish colonial empire developed in the New World. We will then study the nation-building processes of the nineteenth century in Latin America, and continue on to more recent topics, such as the periods of war and postwar in Spain and some Latin American countries. Students will develop advanced skills in written Spanish by completing several written assignments over the course of the semester. This course is an introduction to the writings of Latino/as in the U.S. with emphasis on the distinctions and similarities that have shaped the experiences and the cultural imagination among different Latino/a communities. We will focus particularly in works produced by the three major groups of U.S. Latino/as (Mexican Americans or Chicanos, Puerto Ricans or Nuyoricans, and Cuban Americans). By analyzing works from a range of genres including poetry, fiction, film, and performance, along with literary and cultural theory, the course will explore some of the major themes in the cultural production of these groups. Topics to be discussed include identity formation in terms of language, race, gender, sexuality, and class; diaspora and emigration; the marketing of the Latino/a identity; and activism through art.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spanish</head><p>Don Quijote is a complicated thing, related not only to light-hearted humor but also to brutal physical violence and biting social and aesthetic critique. In this course we will explore the nature and function of laughter in Cervantes' novel as well as situate our own readings within a context of the history of ideas about laughter through weekly discussions of short texts by authors such as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Nietzsche, Freud and Foucault. This course will introduce students to Latinx performance in the U.S., from the mid-20 th century to today. Students will study different modes of performances such as theater, film, the work of performance artists and everyday performances (such as political events) through various Latinx lenses. Following a critical performative pedagogy, the class will combine seminar-style discussions with performance workshops. Topics covered will include the representation and embodiment of gender and race, acts of decolonization, memory construction and diasporic experiences, citizenship and community building, and the politics of latinidad. By analyzing these and other relevant issues through discussions and performance exercises, we will be able to survey the state of contemporary Latinx performance in the U.S. while gaining a better understanding of the connection between performance theory and practice, and the relevance of performance in everyday aesthetics and life. This course is taught in English. Focusing on the so-called 'Age of Exploration,' this course examines the ways in which authors, artists, politicians and philosophers imagined the limits between the human and the monstrous during the early modern period. Ranging from classical mythology and the medieval worldview to Renaissance drama and the chronicles of the discovery of the New World, we will consider the physical, psychological and cultural boundaries of the human and the monstrous, as well as explore the ways these identities shift across time and space and have a continuing impact on the way with think of otherness today.

Romper las reglas: la transgresión en la temprana modernidad</head><p>The early modern period in Spain is one marked by the construction of political borders, geographical boundaries, social identities and linguistic and cultural norms. However, there is also a strong countercurrent of transgression, rulebreaking and even rebellion.

We will study literary texts, films and other cultural artifacts to commemorate the silenced voices of the past. The work of several Spanish authors, film directors and intellectuals of the last decades, who try to recover the silenced voices of the past in an effort to contest the "rhetoric of amnesia", so persistent in the early transition to democracy in Spain, will be studied through close readings and a theoretical component. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of memory in literary, film and cultural narratives to build national identity.

Migrant movements within and outside Spain, and their impact on transforming Spanish society, will be studied in theatre, film and literature. The imaginary vision of the "other" will be unveiled as an integral part of the imagined self-identity. Through different readings and visual art forms we will observe the challenge to identity definition caused by an array of people from different races, cultures and religions.

The Politics of Latinx Art and Activism</head><p>(Cross-listed as LITR 062S and LALS 062) (Art)ivism, or the practice of social and political activism through art and artistic devices, has been fundamental for the development and strengthening of Latinx communities in the US since the beginning of the Chicano movement until today when Latinx writers and artists are actively involved in politically contentious issues such as racial discrimination, gender equality, immigration rights, environmental justice, among others. In this course, we will explore and discuss the work of established and emergent Latinx writers and artists that engage in practices of artivism trying to expose, better understand and fight the many forms of injustice and oppression faced by Latinx communities while promoting practices of radical democracy. Artivists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Guillermo Gómez Peña, Tania Bruguera, Favianna Rodriguez, Daniel Alarcón, among others, use their art not only to raise awareness about social injustices and oppression; their works function also as springboards for community building, solidarity, and political action that can have lasting impacts. The work of many artivists will also open the door to discuss how non-traditional forms of literary and artistic expression such as street art, spoken word, performance art, and artistic pedagogical projects are powerful forms of political intervention and citizenship participation. Furthermore, we will discuss issues such as the relevance of art in the contemporary world, the reception and distribution of politically engaged art, the ethics of artivism, and the importance of pedagogical practices based on a radical democracy model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPAN 069. Cartografías urbanas</head><p>The city as a cultural artifact offers writers myriad narrative possibilities; mere location, cultural symbolism or the link for values and concepts that determine the human being's place in its own society and historical moment. We will explore cultural representations of the city as an icon of industrialization in the nineteenth century and the declining of the modern city and its narratives in post-industrial and post-colonial times. Cultural cartographies of the city will help us to better understand new urban configurations and subjectivities. The discussion will focus on Madrid, Barcelona and other Spanish cities of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. We will see urban representations in novels by Galdós, Pardo Bazán, Baroja, Laforet, Cela, Rodoreda, Roig, Mendoza and representative films.

The course will begin in the early 19 th century with masters whose daring work in this "minor" form gave the short story new prominence in literary history: Poe, Hawthorne, and Chesnutt. Later, the class will focus on Quiroga and Borges whose innovations redefined the genre, and moved Latin American fiction into the forefront of world literature. By focusing on close reading and class discussions, we will seek to discover the distinctive characteristics of the short story, and outline its development and transformation across the continents. </p></div>

Narrativas latinoamericanas: identidad y conflicto cultural</head><p>This class traces the development of the contemporary Latin American novel, considering its representation of regional, national, and individual identity. Works include novels from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. The selected novels present different strands of cultural conflict due to the simultaneous presence of markedly different modes of identity. Several primary questions will guide our analysis of the course texts: What is identity? How are national and regional identities constructed and why? What are the socio-historical, cultural and political influences on identity? What does the study of the Latin American novel reveal about the relationship among economic development, the construction of social identities, and citizenship? How can the study of the novel help us to understand the dynamics of race, class and gender in specific Latin American contexts?

García Márquez y su huella</head><p>This course examines the work of Nobel Prize winner Gabriel García Márquez , and his literary influence on a younger generation of Colombian writers. García Márquez has been involved in many of the crucial literary, political and cultural issues of this era, in Colombia, Latin America and globally. His work exemplifies these conflicts and ranges from so-called realismo mágico (Cien años de soledad) to historical fiction (El general en su laberinto) and documentary writing (Relato de un náufrago). We will read his major novels, and works by Laura Restrepo, William Ospina, Fernando Vallejo and Juan Gabriel Vázquez. The goal is not to trace the inheritance of the Macondian imaginary world, but rather to reflect on a particular understanding of literary genres, and the power of fiction to represent social, economic and political challenges.

Los hijos de la Malinche: Representaciones culturales de la Revolución Mexicana</head><p>This course will examine the representations of the Mexican Revolution in novels, short stories, essays, theatre, films, and corridos by Mexican authors and artists. We will pay attention to the complexity of perspectives generated by this sociopolitical upheaval, whose legacy has been riddled with ambivalence. The objective is to gain a critical understanding of how and why the Revolution became such a fundamental part of Mexican identity and culture. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPAN 105. Federico García Lorca</head><p>We will examine the masterful literary production of this internationally known Spanish writer who speaks to the "outcasts." Lorca's work synthesizes traditional Spanish themes and values with contemporary European trends. The readings will cover different periods and genres of Lorca's literary production in works of poetry such as Romancero Gitano and Poeta en Nueva York, and dramatic works, including Doña Rosita la soltera, Yerma, La casa de Bernarda Alba, Bodas de sangre, and others.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPAN 108. Jorge Luis Borges</head><p>This seminar focuses on Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. He devoted his entire life to literature, as a writer but also as an irreverent and subversive reader. None of his lines, none of his declarations happened inadvertently. Hated or held dear, Borges is incessantly quoted. The objective of this course is to read Borges from the double perspective required by his worldwide fame: as a universal writer who transcends national borders, but also as a writer that seeks to reinvent the history and the traditions of his own country, Argentina. </p></div>

We will focus particularly in works produced by the three major groups of U.S. Latino/as (Mexican Americans or Chicanos, Puerto Ricans or Nuyoricans, and Cuban Americans). By analyzing works from a range of genres including poetry, fiction, film, and performance, along with literary and cultural theory, the course will explore some of the major themes in the cultural production of these groups.

Performing Latinidad: Latinx Film, Theater &amp; Performance Art</head><p>(Cross-listed as SPAN 057 and LALS 057) Richard Schechner sums up the notions of performance and performativity as "embodied behaviors". Embodied behaviors are at the center of the expression and representation of all sort of identities <ref type="bibr">(gender, racial, ethnic, political)</ref> and other concepts and practices like ideology, memory, political resistance, citizenship, belonging, and everyday aesthetics. This course will study the notion of Latinidad through the analysis of politically engaged performances, that is, through "embodied behaviors" that represent, reinforce, and resist the expression of Latino/a/x identities and politics. To do so we will study films, stage plays, the work of performance artists and everyday performances (such as political events) while asking questions such as: How is latinidad represented and performed in different contexts across our society? What are the uses, misuses, and politics surrounding the performance of latinidad? What does it mean to be/behave like a Latino/a/x? What is the role of performances in other forms of identity expression such as memory construction, community building, and citizenship participation? In addition to the in-class discussions of theory texts, films, and plays, the course will offer opportunities to interact directly with performance artists and scholars. This course is taught in English. Focusing on the so-called 'Age of Exploration,' this course examines the ways in which authors, artists, politicians and philosophers imagined the limits between the human and the monstrous during the early modern period.

In this course, we will explore and discuss the work of established and emergent Latinx writers and artists that engage in practices of artivism trying to expose, better understand and fight the many forms of injustice and oppression faced by Latinx communities while promoting practices of radical p. 525 Spanish democracy. Artivists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Guillermo Gómez Peña, Tania Bruguera, Favianna Rodriguez, Daniel Alarcón, among others, use their art not only to raise awareness about social injustices and oppression; their works function also as springboards for community building, solidarity, and political action that can have lasting impacts. The work of many artivists will also open the door to discuss how non-traditional forms of literary and artistic expression such as street art, spoken word, performance art, and artistic pedagogical projects are powerful forms of political intervention and citizenship participation. Furthermore, we will discuss issues such as the relevance of art in the contemporary world, the reception and distribution of politically engaged art, the ethics of artivism, and the importance of pedagogical practices based on a radical democracy model. This course is taught in English. Prerequisite: No prerequisites required. Humanities. 1 credit. Eligible for LALS Spring 2021. Díaz.</p></div>

The Short Story En Las</head><p>Américas (Cross-listed as SPAN 071 and ENGL 071A) This team-taught course will offer a wide-ranging overview of the short story in the Americas from a comparative perspective, emphasizing continuities and also identifying areas of innovation and transformation. The course will begin in the early 19 th century with masters whose daring work in this "minor" form gave the short story new prominence in literary history: Poe, Hawthorne, and Chesnutt. Later, the class will focus on Quiroga and Borges whose innovations redefined the genre, and moved Latin American fiction into the forefront of world literature. By focusing on close reading and class discussions, we will seek to discover the distinctive characteristics of the short story, and outline its development and transformation across the continents. Theater major uses the study of all aspects of performance as the center of a liberal arts education. It is intended to be of broad benefit regardless of a student's professional intentions. All courses in the department address the processes of play production, especially as they involve collaboration; all production for performance in the department is part of coursework.

In a second semester, the department will hire a professional director for a set number of rehearsal hours in preparation for a staged reading, with whom the student will work through a rehearsal and revision process based on the earlier work with the production dramaturgy. The faculty advisor and/or the production dramaturgy faculty will continue to assist during the rehearsal/revision process. The external examiner will read the completed first draft and attend as many rehearsal sessions as possible and the final staged reading to observe the student's writing and collaborative process. The examination proper will consist of an extended interview directly following the staged reading, the reading of the student's revised draft based on the rehearsal process and performances, and a briefer oral examination during honors weekend. There is also the option of a purely written playwriting thesis preparation, without the production component.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Department Policies for All Theater Majors and Minors</head><p>Co-curricular and extracurricular work in theater Department, although not specifically required, is strongly recommended for majors. Opportunities include paid and volunteer staff positions with the department, in-house projects for various classes, production work in The Eugene M. and Theresa Lang Performing Arts Center, and Drama Board productions. While theater faculty recognizes the value of cocurricular and extra-curricular performance work by students, such commitments at times can create serious stress and scheduling conflicts that can negatively impact a student's health and academic performance. The department therefore requires all majors and minors to receive written preapproval from either their advisors or the chair before committing to any performance work outside of the department. In the case of conflicts for students between dress rehearsals or performances in the department and other classes, the faculty will gladly make arrangements for excused absences with professors in other departments. Students should alert the department faculty about any such conflicts in the first weeks of rehearsals for any given production in the department, and never less than two weeks before the date of the conflict with dress rehearsals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p. 531</head><p>Theater Working consistently with faculty on such timemanagement issues is essential for all rising theater majors and minors, and is of the highest priority for students planning to participate in the Honors Program. With respect to the 20-course rule, courses in dramatic literature taught in the English Literature, Classics, or Modern Languages and Literatures departments may be designated as part of the major. Courses in non-dramatic literatures taught in those departments will not be considered part of the major.</p></div>

Diverse theater artists have been turning to Greek tragedy for inspiration for centuries. This course draws on the original Greek plays, contemporary American screenwriting theory and European philosophy (Nietzsche, Ricoeur) to re-imagine the original tragedies for the contemporary world. After reading a number of the texts, students will choose one tragedy to translate into contemporary English and for the contemporary theater. The class will end with a staged reading of the work generated. Students will have the opportunity to enroll in a follow-up class in the spring in which this tragedy will be staged by the Department of Theater, also directed by Michał Zadara. Fulfills THEA 001 credit for all Theater Department majors and minors. Prerequisite: Open to all students without audition or prerequisite. Fall 2019. Zadara. THEA 011C. Special Topic: Theater of Intervention: After Shakespeare and Müller GMST 029 In this course students will read selected texts by William Shakespeare and Heiner Müller, identify relevant contemporary themes and then create their own performances. The goal of the class is for the student to create work without distinctions between writing, acting and directing-the director as performer, the actor as the author of their own expression. This work also seeks to remove any separation between the artist and the citizen, political thinker, and activist. How can theater function as a performative political statement? How can a theater artist intervene in making social change? Readings will include Titus Andronicus, Macbeth, and Hamlet, both Shakespeare's original versions and Müller's contemporary adaptations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intermediate Courses</head><p>THEA 012. Acting II This course is designed to deepen a student's comfort and ability with the principles, techniques, and tools of acting developed in Acting 1. To do so, the actor will engage in exercises and assignments to evolve their ability to be "present" on stage, to work as an ensemble, to take risks, to work with text, and to fully engage the body and voice in the creative process. In order to do so, students will mostly work on classical theatre texts (Shakespeare and Ancient Greek Theatre) as well as contemporary texts that move beyond realism and feature challenging, heightened language. Additionally, Guest Artists will visit the class throughout the semester for one-day workshops, introducing students to Commedia dell'Arte, Greek choral performance, and red-nose clown. Actors will be asked to perform frequently in front of the class, at times improvising, and at times using existing text. The course provides an opportunity for students to deepen the practice of the actor by engaging with challenging material that requires a large, risk-taking performance style.
