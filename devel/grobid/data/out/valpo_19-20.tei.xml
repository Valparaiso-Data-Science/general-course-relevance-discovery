<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The General Catalog of Valparaiso University is designed to describe the programs of the University and to give that information needed to guide students in the successful achievement of their academic goals. Nevertheless, the material is for information only and does not make a contract between the student and the University. Students themselves are ultimately responsible for completion of the requirements for their degrees as well as for the value they receive from University programs.</p><p>The relationship between the University and its students is not custodial in nature. There is no special relationship with the University created by a student's enrollment. The University does not assume any duty toward any student that is not otherwise required by operation of law or by the terms of this catalog.</p><p>In years when the GENERAL CATALOG is not published, an announcement bulletin gives information on important changes in courses, calendar, staff, program and policies. The University reserves the right to discontinue an academic program if it is deemed no longer central to the University's mission.</p><p>Separate catalogs are issued for the Law School and the Graduate School which should be consulted for details about the related programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement on Equality of Opportunity</head><p>Please refer to the University's "Nondiscrimination and Equality of Opportunity <ref type="bibr">Policy" and its "Nondiscrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct Policy,"</ref> which are available in the STUDENT GUIDE TO UNIVERSITY LIFE and on the General Council website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Rate of Entering Freshmen</head><p>The graduation rate for all students entering Valparaiso University as first-time freshmen during the 2012-2013 academic year was 71.0%. This graduation rate represents the percentage of students entering Valparaiso University as first-time (i.e., new) fulltime degree-seeking freshmen during the 2012 Summer and Fall semesters who subsequently were awarded baccalaureate degrees by Valparaiso University within six calendar years (i.e., through August 2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University-Wide Student Learning Objectives</head><p>Through the following student learning objectives, Valparaiso University affirms its mission-based commitment to educate responsible global citizens who are ready to lead and serve church and society. These objectives are designed to help colleges and departments clearly link their student learning objectives to those of the University. All academic units will indicate how the learning outcomes of their curriculum and of individual courses within that curriculum link to some, or all, of the University-wide student learning objectives. The objectives are designed to include the cognitive, skill, and value domains of learning.</p><p>Students will:</p><p>1. Demonstrate theoretical and practical knowledge as well as the intellectual skills and creative capacities pertinent to their respective fields of study. 2. Solve both conceptual and applied problems by integrating broad-based knowledge, evidence-based reasoning, and informational literacy. 3. Practice experiential, interdisciplinary, and collaborative learning in both academic and co-curricular pursuits. 4. Communicate effectively in oral, written, and digital forms in increasingly complex contexts. 5. Engage in cross-cultural dialogue and experiences with the requisite knowledge to succeed in a diverse, global community. 6. Develop character, integrity, and wisdom as they discern their vocations and prepare to ethically lead and serve church and society. Having many diverse cultures represented on campus gives the OMP the chance to celebrate with our students. Students are given the opportunity to increase their appreciation of people and experiences that are vastly different from their own. VU students have the chance to celebrate the world we live in through their connections to fellow students and multicultural and multi-ethnic events and celebrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees</head><p>Students have the opportunity to lead through participation in affinity-based student organizations. The OMP advises four student organizations: Asian American Pacific Islander Coalition (AAPIC), Alliance (LGBTQ+), Black Student Organization (BSO), and Latinos in Valparaiso for Excellence <ref type="bibr">(LIVE)</ref>. All students are invited to be involved with these groups. Students that are involved will practice and refine the social, financial, and practical skills needed to lead in any diverse community.</p><p>To help retain underrepresented populations at VU, the OMP has developed, and features, one mentoring program and two gender-based affinity groups that work to ensure the persistence of all our students. "Smart Connections" is a strong peermentoring program that focuses on first-year students and connects them to an upperclassman in a big brother/sister style relationship. Students are matched 1-on-1 with a "pace setting peer" who is trained to help students get connected and navigate the first year. Women of Worth (WOW) and the Male Empowerment Network (MEN) give students the opportunity to connect with Valpo alumni and others as they pave their pathway to a successful future.</p></div>

This can be done by contacting the AARC located in CCLIR 165, or emailing them at aarc@valpo.edu. 2. After the student has disclosed a disability, AARC will ask for documentation of the disability. 3. AARC will review the documentation and determine the following  Does the student's condition rise to the level of a disability as defined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and with the Americans With Disabilities Act amended in 2008?  What are the functional limitations of the disability in an educational setting?  What, if any, accommodations would be reasonable and appropriate for the student? 4. If a student's documentation verifies the need to receive accommodations, staff in the AARC will produce an accommodation letter that will be distributed to the student's professors and academic advisor. These letters will verify disability (diagnosis not stated) and list reasonable accommodations. It is the student's responsibility to discuss the listed accommodations with the professors and to arrange the usage of accommodations when applicable. 5. If a student has problems relative to the provision of accommodations, the student should contact the AARC.</p><p>For further information, please refer to Valparaiso University's Access and Accommodations Resource Center website: valpo.edu/access-and-accommodations-resource-center.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Support Services</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Learning Centers</head><p>There are four academic learning centers on campus: Academic Success Center (ASC), Hesse Learning Resource Center, Language Resource Center, and Judith L. Beumer Writing Center. These learning centers are united in purpose and distinct in service. Valpo students have access to numerous campus resources committed to success inside and outside the classroom. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the learning centers, where peer tutors are available to help them grow as writers, strengthen learning strategies, practice language skills, and thrive during their academic journey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tutoring</head><p>The learning centers provide free tutoring services in a variety of forms and venues across campus. Students experiencing difficulties with coursework, or students wanting to further improve their skills, should consider the following options:</p><p>1. Work with the Professor -The first option for help in a course is usually for the student to work directly with the professor during weekly office hours. Frequently, simple concerns regarding coursework can be resolved by speaking to the professor.</p><p>2. Help Sessions -Besides seeking support from the professor, the student should also seek help provided by departments, colleges, and learning centers. Some departments have undergraduate teaching assistants and student aides who provide group help sessions for first and second year courses free of charge to students. Professional colleges also arrange academic support in conjunction with particular courses, and the university's learning centers function to offer group and individual learning assistance.</p><p>3. Tutoring -If help sessions are not available or have not met the need, then a student can seek tutoring opportunities from one of the campus learning centers. Each center connects students with tutors through a specific process. Some centers have an application process where students can request to be paired with a tutor for certain courses; pairing is based on individual needs and tutor availability. Other centers serve students through drop-in tutoring hours or online scheduling for individual or shared appointments. Students should contact the appropriate center to learn how to connect with a tutor for a specific course or subject. If students are uncertain where to begin, they should visit the welcome desk in the Academic Success Center (ground floor of the library) for a referral. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>. Study Groups -Students are also encouraged to gather in small groups and work with each other in mastering class material. This practice reinforces learning from daily lectures and supports good study habits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Success Center (ASC)</head><p>The ASC is located in the Christopher Center Library, Room 110, on the lower level by the Writing Center.

The ASC promotes academic achievement through the following core programs and services:  Referral Services (connecting students to appropriate campus resources via email, phone, and drop-in visits)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Peer Tutoring Program</head><p>After seeking support from the professor, help sessions, and any available Supplemental Instruction sessions, then a student can request a spot in the ASC Peer Tutoring Program for a specific course by submitting a Peer Tutor Request form on the ASC website. The ASC hires and assigns peer tutors to work with undergraduate students enrolled in a variety of 100-200 level courses. Peer tutors have successfully completed the courses (or similar courses) for which they provide tutoring and are recommended by professors. The tutoring sessions arranged by the ASC uphold the standards set by the university's Honor Code. It is the student's responsibility to abide by what is authorized and unauthorized aid in a particular course.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Major Field Requirements</head><p>Students may fulfill the major field requirements of the Bachelor of Arts degree by completing either a Departmental Major or an Individualized Major and by meeting one of the completion requirements listed below, or by completing an Interdisciplinary Program (see page 51).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Major</head><p>In order to fulfill requirements under the Departmental Major, students must complete the required credits for the academic major, but may not exceed 60 credits in any one subject. For a list of the academic fields of study, see page 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individualized Major</head><p>An approved individualized major of thirty credit hours may be presented instead of the departmental majors listed above. This major is intended for students with clearly defined academic or career objectives who feel that their specific needs are not met by the departmental major option nor by the interdisciplinary program option described below. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences may propose a plan for an individualized major, using the form available at valpo.edu/registrar/forms. The major must satisfy the following conditions. 1. The proposed major must include at least 30 credit hours but not more than 48 credit hours chosen from two or more departments. 2. The proposed major must be accompanied by a minor within a discipline listed in the GENERAL CATALOG. <ref type="bibr">3</ref>. None of the courses chosen may be courses used to meet the General Education requirements. 4. Courses taken for this major may not be counted for credit towards a minor or second major. 5. The proposed major must be supported and supervised by a faculty advisor. <ref type="bibr">6</ref>. A comprehensive rationale statement by the student justifying the major must accompany the Individualized Major form.</p><p>This form must list the specific courses to be taken and be approved by the faculty supervisor before it is presented to the Dean's Office for approval. Any revisions must also be approved by the Dean of the College. 7. The proposed major must be submitted to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for approval, preferably by the beginning of the junior year, but no later than November 1 for December degree candidates and April 1 for May or August degree candidates.</p><p>The selection of courses for an individualized major should reflect serious deliberation on the part of the student and advisor. Normally, an individualized major will not include lower division courses or courses of an introductory nature.</p><p>An individualized major may be freely substituted for a departmental major in any of the various combinations available to students in meeting major requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree only. An individualized major may not be used to meet the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree. Students may not pursue Honors Work as part of an individualized major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completion of Major Field Requirement</head><p>In addition to completing either a departmental or an individualized major, students must complete one of the following:</p><p>1. An academic minor. The faculty recommends that minors be selected that are correlated to the major. No course may be used to fulfill two majors or both a major and a minor requirement except with the permission of the dean of the college. This restriction refers to courses within the major or minor field, not to additional courses required from outside of the major or minor field. 2. An approved individualized minor. 15 credit hours may be presented in lieu of the departmental minor. At least 9 credit hours must be taken beyond the introductory level. None of the courses chosen may be courses used to meet the General Education Requirements. Forms for individualized minors are available at valpo.edu/registrar/forms. A student may not graduate with both an individualized major and an individualized minor as the method of fulfilling major area graduation requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A second academic major. A second major may be chosen from Departmental Major options or an interdisciplinary</head><p>program. An approved individualized major may also be presented in fulfillment of requirements of a second major, unless the first major is also an individualized major. Only one individualized major or minor may be applied to the major field requirement. 4. A complementary major. A major which enhances and expands a first major. This major may not be a first major. 5. A first major with at least forty credit hours. However, no more than sixty credit hours from one subject area may be applied toward the 124 required for graduation. Students may not complete an individualized major of forty credits or more to satisfy the major field requirement. The limitation does not apply to students pursuing the Bachelor of Music or Bachelor of Music Education degrees, or the Bachelor of Physical Education degree with a major in Teacher Education. 6. An interdisciplinary minor, see listing below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary Programs</head><p>The College of Arts and Sciences offers several interdisciplinary programs of study that students may pursue instead of the major options outlined above. These programs are coordinated by special administrative committees composed of faculty members drawn together by their interest in a particular subject not defined by boundaries of the traditional academic disciplines. Interdisciplinary Programs are currently offered in Actuarial Science, Chinese and Japanese Studies, Data Science, Environmental Science, International Economics and Cultural Affairs, Global Service, Latin American/Latino Studies, and a complementary major in <ref type="bibr">Theology and Ministry.</ref> In addition, minors in interdisciplinary programs in Applied Statistics, <ref type="bibr">Business Administration, Business Analytics, Cinema and Media Studies, Environmental Studies, Ethnic Studies, Forensic</ref> Science, Fundamentals of Business, Gender Studies, Human Aging, Philanthropic Leadership and Service, and Urban Studies may be added to departmental majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Music Degree (128-136 Cr.)</head><p>To be eligible for the Bachelor of Music degree, students must complete the required curriculum for the program area.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Major Field Requirements</head><p>The first major, if the student has a double major, must be physical education. See page 178 for specific major requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional and Pre-Professional Areas</head><p>The College of Arts and Sciences offers degrees especially designed for teaching in elementary schools, teaching of music, performance of music, creation of art works, work in physical education, and social work. The appropriate degrees are described earlier, beginning on page 46. In addition, students can prepare for teaching in secondary schools under a variety of majors for Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. The Diaconal Education and Formation Process, the pre-legal program, and the pre-medical arts programs are professional preparatory programs a student may complete while pursuing a liberal arts major.</p><p>Students interested in any of these programs should declare the program before entering the sophomore year.</p><p>Those pursuing an Associate in Science degree may elect the cytotechnology certification option. This program requires the student to complete a one-year program in an accredited school of cytotechnology and a one year prescribed course of study at Valparaiso University. The credits from the cytotechnology program (usually 30) will transfer to Valparaiso University to meet about half of the requirements for the A.S. degree. See page 48 for the degree requirements for the Associate in Science degree. Students should contact a pre-medical arts advisor for specific science courses that must be completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Education Programs</head><p>The Teacher Education Program is under the direction of the Department of Education.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation for the Medical Arts</head><p>Students can prepare for entrance into medical, dental, veterinary, medical technology, physical therapy, or paramedical schools by entering one of the pre-medical arts programs of the college. Students in these programs must have their schedules approved at the beginning of each semester by a major advisor. All recommendations to the professional schools are sent out by this Committee: Professors Nelson (Psychology), Scaglione-Sewell <ref type="bibr">(Biology)</ref>; Associate Professors Goyne (Chemistry), K. Jantzi <ref type="bibr">(Chemistry)</ref>, R. Clark <ref type="bibr">(Chemistry)</ref>, and L. Rowe <ref type="bibr">(Chemistry)</ref>.</p><p>Students are invited to join the Alliance of Healthcare Professionals, an organization that promotes interest in medical and healthcare fields through a program of guest lectures and social events. Students intending to earn a D.O or M.D. degree and who have outstanding academic records may be invited to join Alpha Epsilon Delta, a national medical honorary society.</p><p>In some fields such as medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, and pharmacy, completion of a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree is often required before admission to a professional school. However, if three years or less of college work are needed for entrance into a professional program, a student may earn a bachelor's degree through the University's Combined Liberal Arts-Medical Arts program. This involves three years of work at Valparaiso University and one year of work at an approved professional school. Details are in the next section of this catalog. This program is often used by students in medical technology and pharmacy.</p><p>Students who want to enter allied health fields that require two years or less of college preparation may want to earn the Associate in Science Degree described on page 48.</p><p>The course, GS 394, Health Care Professional Apprenticeship (see page 65), is offered in the Summer I Session (see page 406) and is of interest to students in pre-medical arts. Details are given in a Summer Session announcement each year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Liberal Arts-Medical Arts Program</head><p>Students may complete the degree Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science from Valparaiso University by completing three years of study at this University and completing an additional year's work at an approved school of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, medical technology, or other allied health disciplines. Prior approval of the program must be secured from the Committee on Pre-Medical Arts.</p><p>Specifically, students who elect one of these programs must meet the following requirements:</p><p>1. They must spend the junior year in residence at Valparaiso University. 2. They must meet all General Education Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree with the exception that one course in theology is waived. 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation for the Study of Law</head><p>Students who plan to attend law school after graduation should select any rigorous course of study for their majors. According to the American Bar Association, "The ABA does not recommend any undergraduate majors or group of courses to prepare for a legal education. Students are admitted to law school from almost every academic discipline. Taking a broad range of difficult courses from demanding instructors is excellent preparation for legal education." Based on these ABA recommendations, Valparaiso University does not require Pre-Law students to follow a specific curriculum. Instead, students are encouraged to select a major that will be both challenging and interesting and that will help them develop strong research and writing skills. Additionally, students may choose from an array of elective courses on legal topics offered by several of the College of Arts and Sciences departments, including Communication, Political Science and International Relations, and Sociology and Criminology. The College of Business also offers courses in business law.</p><p>Pre-Law students at Valparaiso University are encouraged to be active in the Pre-Law Society, seek guidance on law school admissions, and participate in several programs, including the Career Fair, Mock Trial Team, and legal career panels.</p><p>The combination of rigorous academic work has prepared many of the University's graduates for placement in some of the finest and most prestigious law schools in the country. For more information, visit the website at valpo.edu/prelaw or contact the program coordinator at James.Old@valpo.edu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation for Seminary</head><p>Graduates of Valparaiso University are accepted into the seminaries not only of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), but also of other Protestant bodies, and into graduate divinity schools throughout the United States. (Students are encouraged to consult the web sites of divinity schools or graduate programs in theology or religion for specific admission requirements.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommended Preparation for Admission to M.Div. Program at LCMS Seminaries</head><p>The LCMS seminaries in St. Louis, Missouri, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, recommend a bachelor's degree that includes a broad liberal arts curriculum and preferably the ability to read languages (especially German, Latin, <ref type="bibr">Greek, and Hebrew)</ref>. Language skills can be acquired through courses provided at the seminary as well. Students accepted into the M.Div. program must pass the Entry Level Competency Examinations (Old Testament content, New Testament content, Christian doctrine, Biblical Greek, and Biblical Hebrew) before they can enroll in M.Div. courses. Valparaiso University offers courses in all of these areas of study through the departments of Theology and World Languages and Cultures. Finally, both seminaries expect applicants to have taken courses to improve written and spoken English: English composition and writing, and speech (both writing and delivering).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For Students Preparing for Admission to the Seminaries of the ELCA</head><p>The eight seminaries of the ELCA offer a variety of post-baccalaureate degree programs, including the M.Div., which is the basic professional degree for those seeking ordination as pastors, and the M.A., which may be used to prepare for other ministries in and beyond the church (diaconal ministers, Associates in Ministry, and education).</p><p>While specific requirements for admission vary, the following captures the typical academic prerequisites:</p><p>1. a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university (some seminaries specify the B.A. degree; others do not) with a cumulative GPA of 2.500-3.000 on a 4.000 scale; 2. a broad background in the liberal arts <ref type="bibr">(English composition and literature, history, philosophy, psychology, the</ref> biological/natural and social sciences, and world languages); 3. some seminaries require up to two semesters of classical or koine Greek (which may often be met by means of a summer intensive language course).</p><p>Beyond these academic requirements, another part of the application for admission to the ELCA seminaries addresses personal qualifications. Those interested in pursuing a rostered ministry in the ELCA should also begin to forge a relationship with their synod candidacy committee as they begin the application process.</p><p>Students may be interested in the special articulation agreement with the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, whereby they can earn a bachelor's and master's degree in a total of seven years (including internship). See "4+3 Option" under the Department of Theology (page 263) for details.</p><p>Further information is available from the chair of the Department of Theology and on the department's web site: valpo.edu/theology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arts and Sciences Pre-Engineering Program</head><p>Applicants for admission to the College of Engineering may require additional work, usually in mathematics or the sciences, before admission is granted. Such students may be admitted to the pre-engineering program in the College of Arts and Sciences for this preparation if they are registered for, or have completed a college-level pre-calculus course. While in the program, preengineering students may take engineering courses if they satisfy the prerequisites and corequisites. Students in this program are expected to make progress toward admission into the College of Engineering in a timely manner. In order to enter the College of Engineering, pre-engineering students must have a cumulative resident grade point average of 2.000 or higher in each of the three categories listed in the College of Engineering Graduation Requirements section (page 330). Pre-engineering students who have not matriculated into the College of Engineering within three semesters will be removed from the program and will need to select another major within the <ref type="bibr">College</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diaconal Education and Formation Process</head><p>The University and the Lutheran Deaconess Association (LDA) cooperate in the education and formation of men and women for service in diaconal ministry. In response to a changing world, the LDA offers a process that allows students to express their Christian vocation through church, civic, or human service professions. Plans may be individualized, combining diaconal students with many academic majors, to earn a graduate or undergraduate degree.</p><p>The education and formation process is under the counsel and guidance of the staff of the Lutheran Deaconess Association. Inquiries should be directed to the Director of Education and Formation, Center for Diaconal <ref type="bibr">Ministry, 1304 LaPorte Avenue, Valparaiso, Indiana 46383-9978. Phone 219.464.6925. Email: deacserv@valpo.edu</ref>. Application forms and fee schedule are outlined on the website: valpo.edu/lda. Students may apply during their sophomore year, but must be at least 20 years old or have junior standing. Week-long orientation and annual seminars are required during each year of the process.</p><p>Diaconal students work with the LDA staff and academic advisors to determine a program of academic study, planned experiences, and reflection in these areas:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Liberal Arts-Engineering Program</head><p>Students may earn in five years (ten semesters) both the Bachelor of Arts degree and one of the Bachelor of Science in engineering degrees. They may earn the two degrees by completing one of the engineering curricula and the General Education Requirements of the Bachelor of Arts degree as well as the major requirement of the College of Arts and Sciences. This requires them to earn at least 157 credit hours and to have a standing of at least 2.000 in all of their work. Students who elect such a program must have their schedules approved by both the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and the dean of the College of Engineering at the beginning of each semester. Sample or representative curricula for such programs may be obtained upon application to the dean of the College of Engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Honors Work</head><p>Honors Work is designated for students of exceptional ability who may benefit by earning a limited number of the credits required for graduation through supervised independent study rather than through regular course work. Students who apply for Honors Work should understand that their work will be evaluated according to the highest standards of scholarly achievement.</p><p>Honors Work may be pursued by any student who is a degree candidate in the College of Arts and Sciences and whose major or program is administered by a department or an administrative committee within the college. Students may not pursue Honors Work as part of an individualized major.</p><p>A student who has completed at least 80 credit hours, but has not yet entered upon the work of the last two semesters, and who has a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.000 and a grade point average in the major of at least 3.500 may apply through the major department or program committee for admission to Honors Work. To apply, the student must submit a plan for a major independent project that will be undertaken under the supervision of a member of the major department or program. The application form, which requires the student to articulate the independent project briefly, clearly, and with a timetable and modest bibliography, is available on the College of Arts and Sciences website. (For more information, please attend the Beyond Valpo program held annually during the spring semester.) This plan must be presented to the chair of the student's department or program for approval and forwarded to the Dean's Office no later than 12:00 p.m. on the first Monday of April of the student's second semester, junior year. The dean will then forward the application to the Scholarship and Advising Committee for final approval. If the proposed independent study project is approved, the student should enroll in a course numbered 497 Honors Work in (the major department or program) in the first semester of the senior year.</p><p>A student who has been admitted to Honors Work must present four copies of a completed draft of the project to the chair of the major department (or program) at least ten class days before the beginning of the final examination period of the student's first semester of the senior year. With prior approval, the student may substitute for the completed draft a status report demonstrating substantial progress (in certain areas, such as in the experimental sciences). In the case of a status report, the student should describe the work accomplished during the semester and the plans for continued work during the following semester. The project is then judged at midyear by a project committee consisting of the chair of the major department or program, the project advisor, one additional department reader, and one outside reader who is a member of the Scholarship and Advising Committee. If, based on the status report or draft, the project committee affirms the likelihood that the student will be able to conclude an exceptional piece of scholarship appropriate to the student's discipline by the end of the following semester, that student will be admitted to Candidacy for Honors. If the project has not progressed as had been expected (the student must earn an A or A-for the first semester), the student will be denied admission to Candidacy for Honors. The student should consult with the project advisor for departmental/program evaluation policy.</p><p>If admitted to Candidacy for Honors, the student should register during the second semester of the senior year for a course numbered 498, "Honors Candidacy in (major department or program)" A student must complete the independent study project begun in the previous semester, incorporating additions or revisions suggested by the project committee to its satisfaction. Four copies of the completed project report must be delivered to the chair of the major department or program at least fifteen class days before the beginning of the final examination period of the student's final semester. The original project committee shall then schedule an oral examination for the Honors Candidate to assess the student's knowledge of matter covered in the independent study project and any other closely related matters deemed appropriate by the project committee. The Honors Candidate shall be notified beforehand of the related matters to be included in the examination. If, in the opinion of the project committee, the candidate is worthy of honors, it shall recommend to the dean that the student be awarded three credit hours with a grade of A or A-for course numbered 498 and be graduated "With Honors in (the major field)." If the candidate is not deemed worthy of honors, the Dean's Office, upon consultation with the project committee, may recommend that the student be granted three credit hours for Independent Study in the major department or program, with a grade determined by the project committee. The official, archival copy of an honors project is stored in ValpoScholar.</p><p>During the semester or semesters of engagement in Honors Work, a student is not allowed to carry more than 12 credit hours in addition to Honors Work.</p><p>A student whose major requires completion of a senior project may register for Honors Work in lieu of the departmental senior project course, after securing permission from the department chair. The same procedures as outlined above must be followed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperative Education</head><p>Cooperative Education in the College of Arts and Sciences is a program in which students combine professional, paid, work experience with academic programs. Students may be employed in full-time (called alternating) or part-time (called parallel) placements. Normally, a semester of full-time employment will earn a maximum of 3 credit hours; a full-time summer employment, a maximum of 2 credit hours; and a part-time (parallel) placement requiring a minimum of fifteen hours per week, 1 credit hour. Parallel placements of fewer than fifteen hours per week may be given 0.5 credit hours. Students will normally complete a minimum of two alternating or four parallel work assignments. The program is available through various departments as well as through the general offerings of the college. The college's general program is intended both for undeclared majors who are able to use cooperative education on an exploratory basis and for declared majors who may wish to participate outside their major department on an elective basis.</p><p>The following policies govern Cooperative Education within the college:</p><p>1. The student works under the advisement of a faculty member who monitors the work experience, evaluates the required written reports by students, and assigns the course grade. 2. A student is eligible upon completion of two semesters of enrollment in residence with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.500. Co-op is open to students upon completion of the freshman year. 3. Placements require prior approval of the coordinator of cooperative education--retroactive credit will not be granted. 4. Course credits count as electives toward graduation or, in certain academic departments where specified, count toward the department's major or minor. 5. No more than a combined total of 12 credit hours earned through cooperative education, internship, field experience, or other work experiences may be applied toward the meeting of minimum graduation requirements. Exceptions may occur in certain departments due to professional certification requirements.</p><p>Additional restrictions may apply in departments where the cooperative education credits count toward major or minor requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GS 180</head><p>Civic Engagement 1-2 Cr. This course recognizes student volunteer service work for the community. Students earn the credit by completing a specific project, which may be initiated as part of a particular course, through a recognized University service organization, or independently. If students undertake the project through a service organization or independently, a professor must certify the project as appropriate, supervise its completion, and assign the grade. Students must file a proposal with the supervising professor and register for the credit.

Many scientific disciplines, our economy, and even our providers of streaming entertainment increasingly rely on data. According to the Data Science Association, components of the field of Data Science include "predictive/ prescriptive analytics, algorithm design and execution, applied machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization."</p><p>Because of the interdisciplinary nature of Data Science, a student wishing to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Data Science must take courses in Data Science and from the partner disciplines of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Additionally, students should explore an area of application through selection of one or more courses from an appropriate field, as described below. Students are strongly encouraged to take a minor or a second major in their applied field of interest. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geography</head><p>Geography studies the Earth and its diverse people and environments. It seeks to understand how humans perceive and transform places and landscapes around the world. Geographers also explore and analyze the spatial organization of natural and social phenomena by creating and analyzing maps with computerized geographic information systems (GIS). Geography students learn to integrate knowledge from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities in order to understand humanity's relationship with the Earth. Geography uniquely combines a strong liberal arts education with marketable professional skills.</p><p>The major integrates dynamic classroom instruction with field and professional experience to prepare students for a wide variety of careers. Students completing the major may go on to careers in environmental management, urban planning, geospatial technology, cartography, location planning, real estate, tourism, marketing, demography, natural disaster preparation and recovery, international business, emergency management, social studies education, or earth science education to name just a few areas. Combining geography with a second major or pursuing graduate study in geography can enhance a student's opportunities. Geography majors also pursue graduate study in other areas including urban planning, architecture, landscape architecture, environmental science, resource management, climatology, oceanography, geology, archaeology, anthropology, law, or medicine.</p><p>The Geography major at Valparaiso University emphasizes practical experience through field trips, field courses, internships, and opportunities to work with faculty on original research. Students taking physical geography courses regularly visit the nearby Indiana Dunes National Park to learn about dune formation and biodiversity. Students studying urban geography and planning take a short train ride into Chicago to experience the dynamism of the downtown Loop and to observe everyday life in its diverse neighborhoods. In field courses, students use the environment as their classroom; learning about glacial processes while hiking on a glacier in Alaska or about natural hazards by visiting volcanoes in Hawaii. Most geography students complete a paid or unpaid internship with national parks, urban planning agencies, Native American reservations, environmental organizations, non-profit organizations, and businesses. Many geography students may also complete one of Valparaiso University's study abroad programs. Motivated students may arrange to work with a faculty member on original research problems or work as a lab assistant for physical geography and GIS courses.</p><p>Outside the classroom, students share their love for geography through the Geography Club, which organizes professional and social activities, weekend field excursions, and guest speakers. Students who distinguish themselves by high scholarship may be elected to membership in Gamma Theta Upsilon, the international geography honor society. The Alpha Xi Chapter of Gamma Theta Upsilon was installed at Valparaiso University in 1950.</p><p>The geography program at Valparaiso University has access to state-of-the-art facilities including the F.P. Kallay Geographic Applications Laboratory, an extensive map library located in the Christopher Center, media-equipped classrooms in Kallay-Christopher Hall and an expanding collection of instrumentation in the physical geography lab.</p></div>

The science of meteorology draws heavily on the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science, and chemistry. As such, students should possess a strong mathematics and science background. The required major courses prepare every student in the foundations of atmospheric science. The elective courses reflect the diverse nature of the science, enrich each student's academic experience, and prepare them for post-graduate careers.</p><p>The job market in meteorology, like the field itself, is rich and diverse. Many graduates enter employment with airlines, private forecasting and environmental consulting firms, emergency management offices, or the National Weather Service. Others pursue professional opportunities with the U.S. Air Force through the University's Air Force ROTC program (see page 399). Still others pursue careers in research and academia, which require graduate training. Valparaiso University graduates have gone on to many of the finest meteorology graduate programs in the country.</p><p>Broadcast meteorology represents another promising career sector, and many meteorology graduates have achieved success in this field. There is considerable demand nationwide for trained professionals able to communicate meteorological information effectively and accurately, either through the broadcast media (cable, television, and radio) or in association with various consulting firms. Students prepare for this field through hands-on training and experience in broadcasting in the VUTV studios in Schnabel Hall and through internships at a variety of broadcast stations across the country, including WGN-TV in Chicago. Those interested in careers in broadcast meteorology should complete a Bachelor of Science degree in meteorology and a Digital Media Minor through the Department of Communication (see page 96).</p><p>Students interested in extracurricular learning opportunities are encouraged to participate in the student chapter of the American Meteorological Society/National Weather Association, with the Valparaiso University Storm Intercept Team (VUSIT), and avail themselves of the program's field course opportunities, including the Severe Convective Storms Field Study. The local chapter of Chi Epsilon Pi meteorology honor society promotes excellence and further training in meteorology. Internships and cooperative education experiences are also available to qualified students. The department maintains a high-tech weather center with individual work stations, access to UNIDATA and GEMPAK analysis tools and data retrieval, as well as to the department's instrumentation data sets for Valparaiso University's dual polarization Doppler radar, weather instrumentation tower, and radiosonde launching system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professors Ostoyich, Rittgers, Schaefer; Associate Professors Seguin (chair), Xia; Assistant Professor Suárez; Visiting Assistant Professor Schwartz Francisco.</head><p>One of the central disciplines of the traditional liberal arts, history is concerned with understanding the development of societies and cultures which produced the world as we know it. The historian operates under the assumption that the past is of fundamental importance in today's decision-making and in formulating tomorrow's dreams. History provides a solid major for those with career goals in law, teaching, journalism, government, and the ministry. Combining a history major with a Fundamentals of Business Minor has proved to be a popular alternative for those who have strong interests in history and who plan to pursue a business career. Since the history student integrates materials from the social and behavioral sciences, literature, philosophy, religion, and the arts, history is also a field for students who view the undergraduate years as a time to explore a variety of subjects.</p></div>

The International Studies Department offers five interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees listed below. A student's course of study, and therefore degree option, is designed to meet individual career objectives leading to employment in foreign service, international organizations, international business, non-governmental organizations, philanthropic organizations, communications, or education among others.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Studies</head><p>The world is truly a global village with the internet exemplifying how interconnected we are. Within nanoseconds financial transactions can be secured, news items broadcast, and pictures of human rights abuses shared between continents and, more importantly, between individuals. The imperative to gain understanding about the benefits of globalization as well as continued inequalities between peoples and nations has never been greater. The International Studies Department approaches cultures and identities transnationally, steering away from the dichotomy of the West versus the Rest. The department combines interdisciplinary approaches to area studies-East Asia, Latin America and Europe-as well as on thematic issues such as globalization, humanitarian aid and sustainable development, human rights and social justice, conflict and global security, migration and transnationalism, environmental issues, and poverty reduction. All the degree options offer training in theory and methods. The interdisciplinary nature of the majors involve classes in ethnology, cultural awareness, world language, history, political science, economics, and study abroad, all leading to a faculty-mentored senior research project.</p><p>The International Studies Department's degree conferral majors and minors are: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music</head><p>Learn more about the Department of Music at Valpo online. Graduates from the Department of Music pursue careers of varied kinds: teaching music in elementary and secondary schools, universities, and in private studios; professional music leadership in churches; performance; and positions in arts related businesses (arts management, recording, publishing, music retailing, music technology, and entertainment). The Music curriculum is also especially well designed to prepare students for graduate study in music leading to professions in higher education and performance. Mastery of performance, verbal, and critical thinking skills are expected in most music-related professions. Some fields, such as music education, music therapy, church music, and music business, require hands-on training through internship experiences. Ability to improvise, compose, arrange, and conduct increases the musician's chances for success. The Music curriculum is designed to meet these expectations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head><p>A performance audition and theory placement is required for entry into the music major or minor. Music majors must also meet all admissions requirements set by the University and by the College of Arts and Sciences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professor Preston; Associate Professors Geiman (chair); Assistant Professor Woodward; Visiting Assistant Professor M. Hatcher.</head><p>Philosophy is the oldest academic discipline, and the one broadest in scope and application. Courses in philosophy examine the big, foundational questions that have animated great thinkers in both Western and non-Western civilizations, such as the following: What is the right way to live? How should society be structured? What is the relationship between human beings and the rest of the natural world? What is ultimately real, and what is its nature? How is knowledge about these, as well as more mundane matters, to be obtained?</p><p>The study of philosophy tends to develop and sharpen students' analytical and critical thinking skills, not only in connection with topics traditionally deemed 'philosophical,' but in all areas. That's why philosophy majors tend to outperform all other humanities majors, and in many cases even STEM majors, on tests such as the GRE, LSAT, and GMAT. Philosophical training has proven to be a "secret weapon" for leaders in many other fields including business, law, government, the military, and ministry. Thus, philosophical coursework naturally accompanies and enhances study in virtually any other field. Philosophy can also help Christians and members of other faiths think critically about various issues relevant to their religious commitments.</p><p>VU philosophy majors have gone on to top law schools and graduate programs in business, medicine, linguistics, and, of course, philosophy. But even for those students who do not plan to pursue graduate study, a degree in philosophy is a prudent choice. Because of their exceptional critical thinking and communication skills, the employment rate of recent philosophy graduates exceeds those of any other humanities majors, and is comparable with that of graduates in business management, computer science, education, and chemistry. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHIL 125</head><p>The Good Life 3 Cr. An introduction to philosophical thought about the shape and substance of a good human life.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professor Lin; Associate Professors Atchison, Hora, G. Johnson (chair); Assistant Professors Fields, Old.</head><p>Historically, political science has occupied a central position in liberal arts. The study of politics focuses on the values that humans should seek and the particular legal and structural organizations that allow us to realize our desired values. Contemporary political science combines this concern for normative issues with an additional focus on scientific procedures and empirical and quantitative methodology.</p><p>The study of politics and international relations has never been more important than today. More so than ever before, events that occur across the globe and in remote places around the world impact our daily lives. As a result of revolutionary technological change, relations within and between states are being reconfigured almost daily. The majors in Political Science and International Relations at Valparaiso University give students the background, experience, and analytical tools to make sense of, and prepare for dealing with this dynamic and rapidly changing world. A major in political science may lead to careers in many fields including, but not limited to, law, criminal justice, business, education, government service at the state, national, local, and international level, politics, policy analysis, campaign management, and work for private interest groups. Many political science graduates eventually go on to law school and other graduate programs.</p><p>The department sponsors a series of informal events where a variety of topics are discussed. The department also recognizes outstanding student achievement through membership in the Beta Nu Chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha, the national political science honor society.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professor Ringenberg (chair); Clinical Associate Professor Crumpacker Niedner; Instructor Blaker.</head><p>The Department of Social Work offers the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. As sought after human service professionals, social workers seek to promote human and community wellbeing. Guided by a person in environment construct, a global perspective, respect for human diversity, and knowledge based on scientific inquiry, social work's purpose is actualized through its quest for social and economic justice, the prevention of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty, and the enhancement of the quality of life for all persons (Council on Social Work Education, Educational Policy Accreditation Standards).</p><p>Social Work is concerned with empowering people to develop capacities and strengths that will enhance social functioning. Our BSW graduates are prepared for generalist social work practice in a wide variety of settings. Alumni of our program are highly marketable and are employed in mental health services, schools, hospitals, elder care, churches, shelters, corrections, child welfare, and other social service agencies. Our graduates often pursue the Master of Social Work (MSW) degree within five years of earning their BSW and are eligible to apply for advanced standing in many MSW programs. Advanced standing typically offers students who have earned a BSW the opportunity to complete their graduate degree in two to three semesters, rather than the typical two years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accreditation</head><p>The Department of Social Work is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) which is recognized by the Council for Higher Education as the sole accrediting agency for baccalaureate-and masters-level social work education in the United States.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission</head><p>Valparaiso University's mission as a community of learning dedicated to excellence and grounded in the Lutheran tradition of scholarship, freedom, and faith, prepares students to lead and serve in both church and society (VU Mission). Our Social Work Department mission grows out of this University mission in that we provide a rigorous and stimulating educational environment characterized by a dynamic interchange between faculty and students that promotes critical thinking, conscious use of self, and active engagement in the learning process. Our vision is to foster the creation of coherent and integrated educational learning experiences that utilize an active learner model, valuing different ways of knowing, aimed at preparing students for generalist social work practice that will:</p><p>• address the whole person in the context of their environment; • be informed by an ecological/systems and strengths perspective; • be actively involved in advocacy, empowerment, and social change; • serve vulnerable and oppressed people; • implement culturally sensitive practice strategies; and • contribute meaningfully to society by valuing service, social and economic justice, the dignity and worth of each person, importance of human relationships, and integrity and competence in all areas of generalist practice.</p><p>As a values-based profession, it is critical that those who pursue an education and career in social work be aware of and ascribe to the core values of the profession as outlined above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>The purpose of the Department of Social Work is to educate and prepare students for ethical, effective, and culturally competent generalist social work practice for service in the world.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professor D. Bartusch (chair); Associate Professor Lavin-Loucks; Assistant Professors Blake, Raridon.</head><p>The Department of Sociology encompasses the disciplines of sociology, criminology, and anthropology, and seeks to provide a broad-based understanding of the organization and dynamics of human society and culture. Its subject matter ranges from intimate family life to the complex ways social institutions shape behavior, from crime to religion, from the divisions of social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture. Its primary focus is on social relationships and social structures in a wide variety of cultural and social settings.</p><p>The department's programs seek to help students achieve awareness of the world in which they live, and of the causes and consequences of human social behavior. Its basic objective is to help students understand themselves, the groups in which they participate, as well as the dynamics of everyday life. By expanding their knowledge of the field, its theories, concepts, and research methods, and by acquiring insights to their world from the study of different peoples and cultures, students develop skills in social analysis, enhance their capacity for self-evaluation, and grow in their ability to make informed judgments about key social issues in a multicultural society.</p><p>To achieve these objectives, the department has developed a curriculum grounded in the liberal arts tradition that is flexible and responsive to student needs. While all majors are required to enroll in a core of basic sociology courses, the curriculum provides coursework that prepares students for a range of intellectual, professional, and occupational interests. Students who major in sociology may elect to concentrate either in general sociology or criminology. The department also offers minors in both general sociology and criminology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Sociology Major</head><p>The general sociology major is intended for students interested in understanding society and social behavior. This major can lead to careers in administration in a variety of community, government, and social service agencies; market research; or other vocations that require an understanding of the dynamics of human relationships in a multicultural society. The general sociology major also prepares students for graduate study in sociology and/or law. Students who seek careers involving agency administration should consider the Fundamentals of Business Minor (page 385).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociology Major With Criminology Concentration</head><p>Students who are interested in the study of crime and criminal behavior are encouraged to concentrate in criminology. This concentration encourages students to think critically about crime, law, and justice. Students will complete coursework in subjects such as juvenile delinquency, criminological theory, policing and society, or the sociology of law. Students must complete at least one internship during their junior or senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Honor Societies</head><p>The department encourages qualifying students to join honor societies in sociology and the social sciences. Such organizations recognize outstanding scholarship and achievement. There are two international honor societies for which majors in the department may qualify. First, the department sponsors the NU Chapter of the international honor society in sociology, Alpha Kappa Delta. Second, the department, along with other social science disciplines at Valparaiso University, supports Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in social science. </p></div>

DeMaris, Duvick, Hoult-Saros, Miguel-Pueyo, Tomasik (chair); Associate Professors Ames, Malchow, Zamora-Breckenridge; Assistant Professors Fuchs, Karas, Kavanagh, Lien, López Martín, Simon; Clinical Assistant Professor Jennings; Lecturers Alagna, Berrier.</head><p>To study another language is to see the world through the eyes of another culture, and true understanding of a culture requires knowledge of its language. In our increasingly global community, such meaningful engagement with multiple cultures is essential. World language study is thus an important facet of any area of University study. The Department of World Languages and Cultures offers a diverse range of courses that not only teach students to express themselves in another language but also allow them to explore other cultural traditions, both past and present. By immersing themselves in these other traditions, students gain insight into their own languages and cultures while deepening their understanding of what it means to be human, a central concern of the liberal arts.</p><p>The department provides students with linguistic and cultural skills that can be effectively applied in their chosen professions. A major or minor in a world language thus prepares students for success in a variety of careers ranging from international business, education, law, engineering, and government service to social work, the ministry, translation, and medical professions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Objectives</head><p>Students pursuing study in world languages and cultures will work toward the following objectives:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Students will demonstrate a high level of communicative proficiency in the target language.</head><p>This proficiency encompasses interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational modes in the modern languages and, in Greek and Roman Studies, emphasizes the interpretive mode.</p><p>Interpersonal: Students will interact and negotiate meaning in spoken and written conversations to share information, reactions, feelings, and opinions.</p><p>Interpretive: Students will understand, interpret, and analyze what is heard, read, or viewed on a variety of topics.</p><p>Presentational: Students will present information, concepts, and ideas in both writing and speech to inform, explain, persuade, and narrate on a variety of topics for various audiences and in multiple genres (e.g., narration, argumentation, correspondence, analyses of cultural products, and reports on research).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Students will interpret a variety of cultural products in the target language from a critical perspective. 3. Students will use sources of information appropriately in the target language and in English.</head><p>Appropriately using sources involves students finding, evaluating, engaging with, and correctly citing them, mindful of how these sources support their own academic work. 4. Students will apply wide-ranging knowledge of culture (past and present) in speech and writing. 5. Students will engage in cross-cultural dialogue and experiences through participation in curricular, co-curricular, and/or study abroad programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>World Languages Across the University</head><p>In addition to language majors and minors, the University offers a variety of programs that incorporate the study of a world language: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad</head><p>Through University programs and affiliations, an opportunity to study abroad is afforded students of any of the world languages.

See Honors Work, page 62.</p><p>By developing an academic community that gathers outside as well as inside the classroom, Christ College promotes a particular set of educational virtues and ideals among its members. Among these are direct and personal relationships between students and faculty, a spirit of cooperation and mutual growth through free exchange of ideas, a willingness to challenge and scrutinize ideas and beliefs (including one's own), and a concern for the integration of academic learning into a responsible and meaningful life.</p><p>While stressing intellectual excellence and the fullest use of one's own mental gifts, the college also attempts to develop within its members the virtues of modesty and civility, a humble awareness of limitations and failures, and a sense that the more knowledge is gained, the more it is to be used wisely in the service of others. To the extent that these values are actually realized in its members, Christ College considers them prepared for responsible vocations in society and for leadership and service in their faith communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission and Membership in Christ College</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-year Admission</head><p>To be considered for membership in Christ College beginning in their first year, students must first be admitted to Valparaiso University. Admitted students with superior academic records, strong SAT or ACT scores, proven leadership in extracurricular activities, and a measure of curiosity and creativity are invited by the dean of Christ College to apply for the honors program. Approximately 90 first-year students are accepted into the Christ College Freshman Program each fall.</p><p>The Christ College Freshman Program includes a two-semester course in the great traditions of humankind with readings in history, literature, philosophy, and religion from the earliest recorded thought to the present day. Coursework emphasizes close reading, thoughtful discussion, and critical writing. Other activities include producing an original musical and participating in the Oxford debates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upper Class Admission</head><p>Students with superior records of academic achievement may be invited to join Christ College later than the start of the first year at the dean's discretion. For example, some sophomores are admitted to Christ College each fall. These students enroll in sophomore level Christ College courses and begin the pursuit of Christ College Scholar graduation distinction.</p><p>Still other students enroll in one or more courses offered by the college, but do not pursue honors program designations. Such enrollment is subject to the approval of the dean and limited only by class size.</p><p>Any Valparaiso University student--whether or not he or she is a member of Christ College--may pursue a complementary major or a minor in humanities through Christ College coursework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Admission</head><p>Christ College welcomes students transferring to Valparaiso University from other colleges and universities, especially if students have taken honors courses at their previous institutions, including at junior colleges. A transfer student should discuss interest in Christ College with the transfer admission coordinator and speak with the dean of Christ College.</p><p>The student must submit the Application to Christ College. If approved, an academic advisor from Christ College will determine, in consultation with the student and the major advisor, which Christ College courses would best fit the student's needs and interests.</p><p>Typically, a transfer student who has fulfilled the general education requirement of the two-semester Freshman Core, may earn Christ College Scholar honors by completing a minimum of 16 credit hours of CC courses numbered 200 and above, plus one additional 3 credit seminar (CC 300 or CC 325).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Membership in Christ College</head><p>A student formally admitted to Christ College, either as a first-year or upper class student, is designated a member of Christ College. Once admitted to membership, a student's status is regularly reviewed by the dean and faculty to determine whether the student is satisfying the standards appropriate to membership in the Honors College. These requirements include contribution to the common life of the college, satisfactory academic progress toward a degree in one of the undergraduate colleges, and continuing academic achievement consonant with the mission and standards of Christ College.</p><p>Even when students are not directly registered in Christ College courses during a given semester, they are expected to contribute to the College's common life. This includes attendance at the Christ College Symposium and regular consultation with a Christ College advisor.</p><p>Continuing academic achievement at the honors level includes 1) a cumulative grade point average of 3.300 in all coursework completed at the University and 2) a cumulative grade point average of 3.300 in all coursework completed in Christ College. Students who fall below these standards at the end of a semester or academic year will be notified by the dean and reminded that Christ College Scholar distinction requires a 3.300 cumulative average for work in both Christ College and Valparaiso University. In some cases students will be asked to meet with their advisor and/ or the dean to discuss their status, and may be counseled not to continue in Christ College.</p><p>However, continuing membership in Christ College is not determined solely by particular criteria such as cumulative grade point average or the student's academic record for a particular semester or year. The dean and faculty consider the complete circumstances and direction of each student's total academic career and role in Christ College, and retain the right to maintain or terminate a student's membership in Christ College in light of these conditions. The final approval for those who graduate with the designation of Christ College Scholar is made by the dean upon recommendation of the faculty.</p><p>The dean and faculty take an interest in the total program of every member of Christ College, and seek to enhance the quality of educational experience for each individual student.

Sisters Ethel and Merle McCall were the first women engineering graduates each receiving civil engineering degrees in 1915. Full four-year programs were established in 1920, with offerings in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. During World War II, with the shortage of male students, the program was temporarily reduced to two years at Valparaiso University followed by two years at Purdue University.</p><p>After the war, four-year engineering programs were reinstated on campus through the initiative of students who raised funds and then designed and built a new engineering laboratory building. The first post-World War II degrees were offered in 1951 in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering and have been accredited since 1958. The Indiana Delta Chapter of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society, was chartered in 1963.</p><p>In 1968, the College of Engineering moved to the newly-constructed Gellersen Engineering and Mathematics Center. This facility was provided through the generosity of the late William A. Gellersen of Oakland, California. The building, located on the southeastern edge of campus, contains faculty offices, classrooms, and laboratories for the College of Engineering, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences.</p><p>The optional cooperative education program was initiated in 1983 and the first group of cooperative education students graduated in 1986. In 2003, the Computer Engineering program was accredited. The college added a fifth program, Bioengineering, in the fall of 2017 and a sixth, Environmental Engineering, in the fall of 2019. Accreditation for these program will occur after the first graduating class of each.</p><p>With the beginning of the 2011-2012 academic year, the Donald V. Fites Engineering Innovation Center, a new state-of-the-art facility, was made available to College of Engineering students. It honors one of Valparaiso University's most prolific graduates for his contributions as CEO and Chairman of the Board for Caterpillar Incorporated. The Fites Center is an approximately 14,000 square foot high-performance building, which houses innovative laboratory, design, and meeting spaces that foster faculty-student interactions. In 2013, it was awarded LEED® Platinum established by the U.S. Green Building Council and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Educational Objectives</head><p>The Program Educational Objectives help to direct and measure the success of the civil engineering program in accomplishing its mission. They are broad statements that describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation and are based on the needs of the program's constituencies. The Civil Engineering Program Education Objectives state that within five to ten years of graduation, civil engineering alumni will have:</p><p>1. Attained a position within the civil engineering community through which they are able to make a positive contribution to the engineering profession and society as a whole. 2. Participated in continuing education activities, such as courses taken for advanced degrees, seminars, workshops, and conferences, demonstrating their commitment to lifelong learning; and 3. Advanced in their profession. Advancement may be demonstrated through achievements such as promotions and licensure.</p><p>"Civil engineering is the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and physical sciences gained by study, experience, and practice is applied with judgment to develop ways to utilize, economically, the materials and forces of nature for the progressive wellbeing of mankind in creating, improving, and protecting the environment, in providing facilities for community living, industry, transportation, and in providing structures for the use of mankind."</p><p>--American Society of Civil Engineers</p><p>The Civil Engineering Program is designed to prepare the graduate to enter the practice of engineering or to pursue graduate study. The program is broad in scope requiring students to complete course work in five major branches of civil engineering (i.e., environmental, geotechnical, structural, transportation, and water resources engineering). Additional depth in one or several branches can be obtained through appropriate electives. The program emphasizes the importance of effective communication (e.g., written and oral); the ability to work in teams; the importance of ethical and professional responsibility; the need to be lifelong learners; and the need to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.</p><p>Design is an important component of the Civil Engineering Program. This includes distinguishing between analysis and design, exposing students to various design methodologies, and requiring students to develop and evaluate (i.e., using economic, social, safety, and engineering criteria) alternative solutions to realistic engineering problems. The design experience (i.e., individually and in teams) is spread throughout the program and is incorporated into both classroom and laboratory exercises. In the sophomore year, students are introduced to fundamental aspects of the design process in the mechanics of materials and their introductory courses in structural and transportation engineering. In the junior year, additional aspects of the design process and the use of standards, specifications, and building codes are discussed in courses in environmental engineering, water resources engineering, soil and foundation engineering, structural engineering, and transportation engineering. In the senior year, students apply their design skills in their civil engineering electives and capstone design experience. The capstone courses include a major, comprehensive design project in which students work in teams to bring together their accumulated knowledge of civil engineering to solve engineering problems with realistic constraints.</p><p>Laboratory work is designed to develop written communication skills, ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, selfconfidence, and to aid in the interpretation and application of classroom theory. The majority of introductory courses in the five branches of civil engineering require a laboratory component. The civil engineering program has modern, well-equipped laboratories in materials engineering, fluid mechanics, soil mechanics, and environmental engineering.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Engineering</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Overview</head><p>Environmental engineers protect and improve the quality of life of people and society by applying their technical expertise to find sustainable solutions to global problems. In this role, environmental engineers are stewards of our natural resources and designers of our built environment. Population growth and the rising standard of living for societies worldwide result in additional environmental challenges. The global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in 2011 with an expected population reaching almost 10 billion by 2050. With this growth comes the increasing challenge of providing clean air and water to people worldwide. In addition, the rising standard of living results in increased consumption and higher energy and water needs. Environmental engineers working alongside other environmental professionals will be at the forefront of efforts to ensure adequate living conditions for everyone. While environmental engineers in the previous century focused mainly on waste water treatment, today their focus has expanded to develop solutions to all types of environmental problems surrounding the air, water and soil. They also investigate such diverse topics as the effects of climate change and the development of green infrastructure.</p><p>The environmental engineering program is interdisciplinary in nature with a strong link between the natural sciences and engineering. Courses are sequenced to build upon a firm foundation in mathematics, basic sciences, and engineering sciences. Courses progressively involve students in engineering design activities, and the courses culminate in a major interdisciplinary, capstone design experience during the final year of study. The program will be housed in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE). The Environmental Engineering (ENE) program shares a common first year with other CoE programs and a common second year with the civil engineering program. The ENE program offers a core that provides a broad foundation in environmental engineering while also providing elective concentrations in air, water or soil. Graduates of the Environmental Engineering Program at Valparaiso University are qualified to enter industry as practicing engineers or to pursue advanced degrees.</p></div>

There are four primary laboratory facilities within the department, and these facilities are home to the eight different laboratory experiences within the program. Personal computers with appropriate hardware and software are available in the laboratories for mechanical design, to acquire and analyze data, to control hardware, and to report results in graphic and tabular form. Additional laboratory facilities support senior design projects and computational assignments.</p><p>The Energy Systems Suite includes the Mechanical Measurements Laboratory, the Small Engines Laboratory, and the Engine Test Cell. This facility provides the opportunity to study the laws governing energy transformations due to energy transport as work and heat. The space also enables the students to learn the science of experimental methods by working with state-of-the-art measurement equipment, calibration techniques, and computer data acquisition. This facility includes laboratory equipment such as an internal combustion engine, a gas turbine, a supersonic nozzle, a solar collector, a heat pump, and a wind tunnel.</p><p>The Manufacturing Processes and Systems Laboratory supports instruction in methods and theory of metal working, automation, product design and development, and the design, operation, and control of production systems. In addition to metal cutting, forming, welding, grinding and inspection equipment, this laboratory contains Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools.</p><p>The Materials Science Laboratory contains equipment for conducting a variety of materials experiments including impact, tension, creep, cold working, hardness, and nondestructive testing. Special emphasis is placed upon modification of material properties by heat treatment. Metallurgical specimens are prepared and examined.</p><p>The Analog Circuits, Automatic Control, and Vibrations Laboratory supports instruction in the study of mechanical and electrical systems. For example, the facility is used to control experiments with simulated process systems and the associated instrumentation to control these processes. It also contains mechanical and electrical vibration excitation and measuring devices along with equipment to perform modal analysis and sound measurement.</p></div>

The focus of the minor will be on the following North American ethnic groups: African-American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, and Asian-American. The objectives of the minor have two complementary components. One, more narrowly academic, aims at helping students develop critical thinking using a multicultural perspective with reference to their own backgrounds and those of others, and with materials from within and without the traditional canon. The other, more social and experiential, involves becoming familiar with and appreciating diversity among students and the larger community. Both aim at providing knowledge and understanding which will help students reach across racial and cultural barriers and equip them to function effectively, both professionally and personally, in a multicultural and multiracial world. Additional courses for the minor will consist of topics courses and departmental seminars, each of which must be approved and will be publicized by the administrative committee. Students wishing to use a course not listed must have the course approved by the administrative committee prior to enrolling in the course.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The Human Aging minor offers an interdisciplinary perspective on the nature of the aging process and the needs of older adults. Aging involves a complex set of changes that involve biological, psychological, and spiritual dimensions, as well as the role of the older individual in society. It is the premise of the program that these changes are best understood and explored in an interdisciplinary context. As the average human life-span increases and the proportion of elderly people in our country increases, study in human aging will become very important to those seeking to understand and render service to our society. Individuals interested in careers in the social or biomedical sciences or theology will find this minor to be an essential part of their preparation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>An understanding of the mind is one of the most important and fascinating human quests. For those who want to join this important endeavor, the Neuroscience minor offers an interdisciplinary perspective on the structure and function of the human nervous system and the mental abilities that depend upon its operation.</p><p>Neuroscience is a central topic of contemporary scientific inquiry, with many large research initiatives underway in the US and international settings. It is an exciting field that attempts to study (1) the basic structure and characteristics of human mental processes, (2) the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> how mental and physical processes relate to each other. The field of neuroscience is both fascinating and complex, as it draws on insights from many different fields including bioengineering, cognitive science, computer science, experimental and clinical psychology, linguistics and philosophy.</p><p>Students entering many research and professional careers will find a background in neuroscience to the helpful or even essential in a number of fields such as artificial intelligence, clinical neuropsychology, medicine (especially neurology and psychiatry), neurolinguistics, and philosophy (especially philosophy of mind). Integral to the program is a set of learning objectives that orient faculty and students toward the acquisition of critical knowledge and skills necessary for understanding, appreciating and using the tools of modern neuroscience. Core classes should be completed during the sophomore or junior year if possible, while Electives may be taken at any time. The Capstone experience will normally be taken in the senior year. Prerequisite courses are required prior to registration in Core classes and are typically completed during the freshman or sophomore year of study. In addition, the core program courses require a significant background in the biological and psychological sciences to allow full engagement with the technical aspects of neuroscience. Students are encouraged to consult with a neuroscience advisor to assist in selecting courses that will support their professional goals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>There are currently over one million registered non-profit organizations in the United States. While each organization may attract individuals with particular interests and expertise, these agencies also need leaders with consistent abilities in oral and written communication, critical thinking, problem solving, organization, and public advocacy within the corporate and governmental spheres. The minor in Leadership and Service further develops these core competencies while introducing students to the range of issues facing our communities. Students working in the minor will demonstrate that they have gone beyond volunteering at local organizations to thinking about how they can best continue contributing to these organizations in a long-term and professional capacity. Finally, the minor gives students seeking degrees in other fields an opportunity to develop and to pursue their passion for service in a thoughtful and rigorous fashion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The Urban Studies Minor provides students with an interdisciplinary consideration of the diverse social, cultural, economic, political, and spatial issues confronting contemporary American cities. The goal of the minor is to enhance students' career opportunities in a variety of fields, including urban and regional planning, urban design, public administration, law, real estate, economic development, non-profit management, social work, social justice advocacy, and education. The minor also helps to equip students to contribute meaningfully to public life and discourse in cities. Courses that explore the societal context in which cities operate introduce students to urban studies and ensure that they have a grounding in social sciences. Courses focusing on urban places and processes help students understand how cities work, as well as their history and geography. Finally, students choose one or two elective courses to explore a specialized topic or to gain practical experience through an internship, research, or training in civic engagement. Several courses in the minor take advantage of Valparaiso's location on the fringe of the Chicago Region to provide first-hand experiences of urban places and processes through field trips to Chicago. </p></div>

The program does this through a combination of classroom instruction, leadership labs, and experiential learning opportunities focused on developing the mind, body, and spirit of participants. These opportunities are designed specifically to enhance character and leadership ability in the students/cadets and to allow them to practice the essential components of leadership: influencing, acting, and improving. Participants become members of the Fightin' Irish Cadet Battalion and complete a planned and managed sequence of classroom courses and practical exercises intended to develop each participant into what an officer must be -a leader of character, a leader with presence, and a leader of intelligence -to enable them to reach their full potential as an individual and as an effective leader of groups. The program affords students an excellent opportunity to serve and focuses on the role of Army officers in the preservation of peace and national security, with particular emphasis placed on ethical conduct and the officer's responsibility to society to lead, develop themselves and others, and achieve success.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dean Christina Hubbert, Ph.D.</head><p>A program of graduate studies was initiated by Valparaiso University in 1963 to serve a variety of educational needs, including those of Northwest Indiana and the Great Lakes region. Today, through the Graduate School, Valparaiso University offers graduate degrees and certificates in programs in nine departments in the College Arts and Sciences, as well as in the College of Nursing and Health Professions, and the College of Business. A number of degrees may be earned in conjunction with the J.D. degree from the Valparaiso University Law School.</p><p>With an emphasis on professional master's degree programs including accredited programs leading to licensure, Valpo graduate programs emphasize career and professional development and prepare graduates to lead and serve in a global society. Although most graduate students attend full time, a significant number attend the University while holding full-or part-time employment. Select graduate programs draw strong interest from international applicants such that international students comprise over a third of graduate students at Valpo; and, Valpo graduate alumni hail from over 40 countries. Current initiatives include strengthening pathways that integrate undergraduate and graduate programs, and expanding into online formats.</p><p>Details about all of the graduate programs and opportunities may be found in the GRADUATE CATALOG, which can be found online. Contact the Graduate School, Valparaiso University by phone (219.464.5313) or visit their website valpo.edu/grad for more information.</p><p>The graduate programs are under the general supervision of the provost and the faculty of the University. Its policies are defined by the Graduate Educational Policy Committee and are administered by the dean of the Graduate School.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Law School</head><p>Visit the Law School online. In the late 1870s, Valparaiso attorney and Civil War Colonel Mark L. DeMotte decided that the importance of formalized legal education warranted a new department for the study of law at the local college. Convincing the college president that such training was crucial to the quality of legal representation throughout the country, Colonel DeMotte founded in 1879 a program for legal study that would become the Valparaiso University Law School.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dean</head><p>From the beginning, the Law School graduated new lawyers able to effectively practice law as soon as they joined the bar. This remains true today. By immersing its students in a rigorous program, Valparaiso Law School produces graduates that are successful, respected, and prepared.</p><p>The Law School provides a range of course offerings recognized for its breadth, depth, and blend of legal theory and practice. The required curriculum provides a comprehensive and intensive study in the foundations of law, and a wealth of elective courses covering many substantive areas. Clinical programs, externships, and co-curricular organizations introduce students to advanced study in various areas of law and offer meaningful opportunities for innovation and specialization.</p><p>By limiting enrollment, the school provides a learning environment where the rigors of legal education can be experienced with the help of careful guidance and support by the extraordinarily accessible faculty. From the classroom to the courtroom to the boardroom, our graduates thrive on the ongoing support of faculty, staff, students, and alumni. The JD degree options include the traditional three-year, full-time program; a part-time, five-year program; and an accelerated two-and-one-half-year program. The Law School also offers and invitation-only Honors Program, designed to offer a special academic challenge to highly talented students.</p><p>The LLM degree is offered through a one-year, full-time program. This particular program is designed primarily for international lawyers who have a law degree from their home country and wish to enhance their understanding of the American legal system.</p><p>The dual degrees are four-year programs. Admission to a dual degree program requires separate applications to both the Law School and Graduate School.</p><p>Detailed program information about the Law School is available from the Law School (1.888.VALPOLAW, or valpo.edu/law). The Law School is not accepting applications at this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Sessions</head><p>The University offers one twelve-week and two six-week sessions. Although most courses are six weeks, within each six-week term usually a number of specialized courses are offered in shorter periods of time. These sessions are an integral part of the yearround program of course offerings for both graduate and undergraduate students. They are specifically designed to serve a variety of publics: traditional Valparaiso University students accelerating their study, in-service teachers desiring further professional education, visiting students from other colleges earning credit while on summer vacation, junior and senior high school students beginning their college careers early, and other interested persons who would like to take coursework toward degree objectives or simply for personal enrichment.</p><p>Undergraduate students may earn a maximum of seven credit hours in each six-week term, or 14 for the entire summer, which is nearly the equivalent of one semester's work. Graduate students may earn a maximum of six credit hours in each six-week term, or 12 for the entire summer. Each summer session features a variety of courses in the morning and evening to accommodate the student who wishes to take course work while employed full-or part-time. A selection of online courses offers maximum flexibility in scheduling and permits students to take coursework with minimal residency on campus. Also offered in the summer for academic credit are several one-week workshops and other abbreviated format courses.</p><p>Educational tours, both domestic and international, are regularly offered during the summer. Information regarding tours is normally included in the Summer Session schedule, as well as in special descriptive brochures.</p><p>Valparaiso University features the three-year baccalaureate program which offers students in selected programs the opportunity to complete their degree in three years by careful planning and the utilization of summer sessions. To complete their program as planned, students must apply for participation in the spring of their freshman year to make certain that they have the proper advising.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Credit Examination Program</head><p>During the orientation period that precedes each semester, placement tests are offered to incoming students (freshmen and transfers) in the areas listed below. These tests provide an opportunity for students to attain advanced placement, receive credit, or meet certain General Education Requirements at Valparaiso University. Advanced placement and/or credit are awarded in world languages, mathematics, and chemistry as explained in the listings for those departments.</p><p>In all of the cases, the credit awarded is entered on the student transcript, which is maintained by the Office of the Registrar. This credit can be applied toward required or elective courses.</p><p>Credit earned by examination may achieve advanced standing, meet General Education Requirements, and accelerate progress into advanced areas of study in an intended major or interdisciplinary program. Credit by examination may reduce the time required to earn an undergraduate degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the CEEB</head><p>The CLEP program provides an opportunity to gain college credit for those individuals who, through experience, independent study or enriched high school courses, have attained college-level knowledge in a particular field. It is not recommended that these examinations be taken only on the basis of normal high school courses. Information and test center locations can be obtained from College Entrance Examination Board, Box 1822, Princeton, NJ 08541. Valparaiso University awards credit for CLEP General Examinations in English, Humanities, Social Science-History, and Natural Science, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>1. The General Examinations must be taken before matriculation at Valparaiso University. 2. Credit for a CLEP General Examination may not be applied to a major nor to any specific course requirement except as listed below in items 4, 5, and 6. 3. Credit for a CLEP General Examination is valid only if no other credit by examination is awarded in courses applicable in the same area of general education. 4. A score of 50 or above on the Humanities General Examination entitles a student to three (3) credits in the area of Fine Arts or Fine Arts-Literature. 5. A score of 50 or above on the Social Science-History General Examination entitles the student to three (3) credits in the area of Social Science. 6. A score of 50 or above on the Natural Science General Examination entitles a student to three (3) credits in the area of Natural Science. Valparaiso University awards credit for CLEP Subject Area Examinations as indicated below. Credit for Subject Area examinations is awarded only if the examination is taken before the student enrolls in the specific college-level subject for which credit by examination is sought.</p><p>Credits earned more than fifteen years before application for admission are accepted toward graduation on a provisional basis, subject to validation by the first thirty semester hours completed in residence at Valparaiso University with a 2.000 (C) average. Advanced standing is the record of courses and credits accepted by Valparaiso University from another institution. The maximum number of advanced standing credits that may be applied toward a Valparaiso University degree is 94 credits (Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business or Nursing) or 102 credits <ref type="bibr">(College of Engineering)</ref>. The remaining advanced standing credits will be applied as elective credit only. See page 425 for residence requirements and restrictions related to majors and minors. Credit for workshops, institutes, or travel study ordinarily will be granted only for work taken at Valparaiso University. In cases of exception to this restriction, transfer credit for institutes or workshops usually will not exceed one credit per calendar week of instruction. Transfer credit for travel study programs usually will not exceed two credits per calendar week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Education</head><p>Students will receive a copy of a Transfer Credit Equivalency Report that lists the transfer credits accepted by Valparaiso University and the matching Valpo course equivalent. The Dean of the student's college will review the Transfer Credit Equivalency Report and prepare a Statement of Equivalency in regard to the General Education requirements for the respective degree. Transfer students with more than 75 credits of advanced standing need to complete one course (three credits) of theology at Valparaiso University. One course in theology must be taken in residence at Valparaiso University.</p><p>CORE 110 or CORE 115 credit may only be granted by transfer credit for courses taken prior to the student enrolling at Valparaiso University, and will only apply toward transfer students; freshmen will not be awarded CORE 110 or CORE 115 credit. Any credit transferred to Valparaiso University after the student has begun their career at Valparaiso University will not be considered as applicable toward fulfilling CORE 110 or CORE 115.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Mathematics Placement Information</head><p>Upon entry to Valparaiso University, all students who do yet not have college credit for mathematics are given a preliminary placement into appropriate mathematics classes through an evaluation process that includes any or all of ACT or SAT math scores, high school GPA, and math classes taken along with grades earned during senior year. If a student determines the preliminary placement level is suitable, there is no need to continue and take the math placement assessment. If a student wishes to improve the preliminary placement, then he or she should take the math placement assessment. The descriptions of the specific placement levels and the means for the preliminary determination follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Level 1</head><p>Students at this level are eligible to enroll in many quantitative analysis and natural science courses, including BIO 171, CHEM 121, and PSY 201. In mathematics specifically, students are eligible to enroll in MATH 111: Quantitative Reasoning II, MATH 120: Mathematics and Society, MATH 122: Applied Calculus, and STAT 140: General Statistics. Your choice of whether to take a mathematics/statistics class or a quantitative analysis course in another department should be made in consultation with your academic advisor. A student in this placement group should NOT take the math placement assessment unless direct entry into a course requiring a higher placement level is desired.</p><p>The minimum standards for preliminary placement at this level are:  PL 1: ACT MATH 25 -29 (SAT MATH 590 -280) and high school GPA below 3.500  PL 1: ACT MATH 20 -24 (SAT MATH 490 -580) and high school GPA of 3.500 or higher</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Level 0</head><p>Students in this group take MATH 110: Quantitative Reasoning I before proceeding to further college mathematics and statistics classes. Also, most quantitative analysis and natural science courses require completion of MATH 110 or placement higher than MATH 110 in order to enroll. Any student in this placement group is encouraged to take the math placement assessment.</p><p>The minimum standards for preliminary placement at this level are:  PL 0: ACT MATH 20 -24 (SAT MATH 490 -580) and high school GPA below 3.500  PL 0: ACT MATH 19 (SAT MATH 480) or below</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Level NP (No Placement)</head><p>Students for whom we do not have sufficient information to determine a placement level. Any student in this placement group is must provide the necessary information or take the math placement assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes:</head><p> It is very possible your preliminary placement is lower than you think it should be; sometimes we have incomplete information. In that event, you can act to supply the missing information, or take the math placement assessment.</p><p> Any prior college credit for mathematics or statistics courses (including credit achieved through AP exams and transfer credits) overrides everything in this preliminary placement system.</p><p> All placement activity takes place before a student enters the course stream. Once a student begins in the course stream, progression from course to course relies solely on the standard course pre-requisites. For example, someone who places into MATH 115: Trigonometry and Functions cannot get an F in that class but then proceed to Calculus I anyway by (re)taking the math placement assessment.</p><p>To take the math placement assessment, visit valpo.edu/mathematics-statistics/academics/ap-credit-and-math-placement. Note that more than one attempt at the placement assessment is possible, so a first try does not necessarily give a final placement result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration</head><p>Visit the Office of the Registrar online.</p><p>All students are expected to register on the official registration days of each semester. For students currently enrolled, a registration period is announced during each semester. (For the registration days and the calendar of the Law School, consult that School's bulletin.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Requirement</head><p>All students entering the University for the first time and all students who have not been registered at this University for a full semester (excluding summer) must submit to the University Health Center a report of their medical history, physical examination, and required immunizations from a licensed physician.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximum and Minimum Credit Hours</head><p>A full-time student is one who is registered for at least 12 semester credit hours. Maximum credit hours allowed per semester without a petition are given in the following Students who maintained a grade point average of 3.000 (B) or better during the previous semester may register for extra hours, provided that their formal petitions for such work are granted. This petition must be approved by the academic advisor and the dean of the appropriate college. Forms are available online through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. Freshmen are not allowed to carry extra hours during the first semester. Extra credit hours above 19 credits per semester will also incur an additional tuition charge (see page 427).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Prerequisites</head><p>Students are held responsible for meeting the prerequisites of all courses for which they enroll. In unusual cases, a student may petition to waive a prerequisite. Such a petition must be approved by the instructor of the course and/or the chair of the department in which the course is offered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change of Schedule</head><p>Students may change their registration in courses up to the time of the calendar deadlines published in the GENERAL CATALOG. Such changes are matters of serious consideration. Before deciding on such an action, students should obtain the counsel of their course instructor, academic advisor, and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Forms are available online through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. Any student-athlete who wishes to drop below 12 semester credit hours (full-time status) must obtain permission of the athletics compliance coordinator or designee.</p><p>Deadlines for course addition, course withdrawal, filing for S/U grade, and withdrawal from the University are published in the University Calendar. Once these deadlines have passed, students are held responsible for completion of courses under the terms of the registration they have selected. Changes in registration after these deadlines are allowed only in exceptional cases where students demonstrate that extreme contributory circumstances have rendered their registration in a course invalid. Serious physical disability, prolonged illness, or the death of a loved one: documented occurrences of this kind can be considered reasonable grounds for requesting an exception to the regular calendar deadlines. A petition for exception to a deadline may be addressed to the dean of the appropriate college; such a petition must be accompanied by supporting reasons for its presentation. Petition forms are available online through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. The integrity of the Valparaiso University transcript and ultimately of the University itself demand that special exceptions be permitted only when special circumstances prevail. Neither unsatisfactory academic performance, whether caused by inability or lack of application, nor lack of adequate evaluation of a student's performance in a course before the deadline are, in and of themselves, sufficient reason for petition.</p><p>Students may officially cancel enrollment in a course during the add/drop period noted on the Academic Calendar (see page 5) without reflection on their permanent record. All requests for adding a course during that timeframe remain at the discretion of the appropriate academic dean or department chair, if the course is full. From the end of the add/drop period until the published deadline, a student may officially withdraw from a course with a grade of W (withdrawal) on the student's permanent record. Students are not permitted, without an approved petition, to cancel enrollment in courses after the end of the ninth week of a semester. Not attending class does not constitute formal withdrawal from a course.</p><p>After the drop/add period and until the tenth week of a semester, the tuition fee is prorated for students withdrawing from the University. The refund schedule can be viewed online through the Student Financial Services: valpo.edu/student-financial-services. Courses dropped before the conclusion of the drop/add period will receive a 100% refund.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading System and Quality Points</head><p>For the Law School and the Graduate School, refer to the appropriate bulletin.</p><p>The course grades reported and recorded in the Office of the Registrar are as follows. The corresponding number of quality points per credit hour are also indicated. Unsatisfactory ---Grade Point Average is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded credits. GPA calculations are truncated to three decimal places and never rounded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade</head><p>Grades A through D-give credit toward graduation. A student who receives a grade of D-in a course is advised not to enroll in other courses for which the given course is a prerequisite. Candidates for graduation must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.000 or better in all their work at Valparaiso University.</p><p>The grade I (incomplete) may, at the discretion of the instructor, be given to a student under the following conditions:</p><p>1. The work completed in the course so far is passing. 2. The student has been unable to complete the remaining work in the course because of circumstances beyond his or her control. An I (incomplete) grade received in one semester or summer session must be removed by the last date of the term of the next succeeding semester, or it automatically becomes a grade of F. The student's deadline for submitting the outstanding work to the instructor shall be one week before that date. No Semester Honors will be given if the student received a grade of Incomplete at the official end of the semester concerned. Students who are not registered in the next term (Fall or Spring) who are finalizing work from an Incomplete grade will need to complete a Campus Affiliation request.</p><p>Authorized withdrawal from a course or from the University within the published deadlines gives the grade of W to each course withdrawn. This mark carries no credit.</p><p>The satisfactory grade, S, is given under the following conditions:</p><p>1. The course is designated in this catalog to be graded S/U, or the student officially opts or petitions to have the S/U grade in the course. 2. The student's work in the course is satisfactory, of a quality which is comparable to a grade of C-(1.700 quality points per credit hour) or better. Course credit hours with grades of S count toward graduation but are not counted in computing the student's grade point average.</p><p>The unsatisfactory grade, U, is given under the S/U grade option (condition 1 above) when the student's work does not meet the course objectives (condition 2 above). Course credit hours with grades of U do not count toward graduation and are not counted in computing the student's grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit Hours</head><p>A credit hour (abbreviated Cr. in lists of courses) represents one hour of recitation or lecture, or two or more hours of laboratory, each week for one semester. If time outside the laboratory is required to prepare laboratory notes or reports, two hours may be equivalent to one period of class work. Drawing, shop work, and other courses demanding no outside preparation require a minimum of three hours for one credit hour. See specific course descriptions for the exact number of hours required.</p><p>For short (seven weeks) courses, the time per week per credit hour is twice that for the semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repetition of Resident Courses for Credit</head><p>Unless repetition of a course for credit is permitted as shown in its catalog description, only the credits, grade, and quality points received the last time the course is taken by a student at Valparaiso University shall be used in determining credit for graduation and the cumulative grade point average. A grade of W shall be excluded from this policy. The student's transcript shall record all grades, original and repeat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standing of a Student</head><p>A student's academic standing is determined by the ratio of the total number of quality points to the total number of credit hours attempted in all work at Valparaiso University, except courses graded S/U. Thus, a student who makes an average mark of C (2.000 quality points per credit hour) throughout the course of 124 semester hours will have 248 quality points, 124 credit hours, and a standing of 2.000. The standing for a semester's work is understood to be the ratio of the number of quality points earned to the number of graded credit hours completed. Standing is also referred to as the grade point average. Both cumulative and semester GPA are factors in determining a student's academic standing. At least a 2.000 GPA is required for good academic standing. Criteria vary by college and program. Please refer to the applicable sections of the GENERAL CATALOG for details. Note the above exception regarding repetition of a course. For information regarding satisfactory academic progress, please see page 439 in the Financial Aid section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Deficiency</head><p>In the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, College of Engineering, and College of Nursing and Health Professions, students whose cumulative resident grade point average falls below the requirements of their college and program (at least 2.000) are considered academically deficient. Such students may be denied the privilege of continuing their studies at the University unless they succeed in improving the quality of their academic work to the satisfaction of the faculty during the following semester. The dean of each college establishes procedures to give students who are academically deficient timely warning of their being denied continuation of their studies.</p><p>The GPA requirement varies by college and program. Please refer to the applicable sections of the GENERAL CATALOG for details.</p><p>For regulations concerning academic deficiency in the Law School, see that School's bulletin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dismissal for Low Scholarship</head><p>Whenever, in the judgment of an academic dean, students who are academically deficient would benefit from an interruption of their work in a particular college of the University, the dean will notify the students in writing that they have been dismissed and will specify the period of time for which they have been dismissed and the conditions which they must satisfy in order to be readmitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Standing of a Student</head><p>An undergraduate student must have successfully completed 24 semester credits to be classified as a sophomore; 56 semester credits to be classified as a junior; and 88 semester credits to be classified as a senior.</p><p>A student in the Law School should consult that School's bulletin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of Courses</head><p>The courses offered by the University are classified as follows:</p><p> Lower division courses, numbered 100-299;  Upper division courses, numbered 300-499;  Graduate-undergraduate courses, numbered 500-599;  Graduate only courses, numbered 600 and above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leave of Absence -Undergraduate Students</head><p>At the end of a semester, a student who has completed at least one full semester of work in residence and who is in good academic standing may apply for a leave of absence. A leave of absence requires approval of the academic advisor and the academic dean. The necessary form may be obtained online through the Office of the Registrar.</p><p>All leaves must be requested before the beginning of the semester in which they are to take effect. An approved leave of absence cannot exceed 180 days in any 12-month period. Leaves are not granted to students who withdraw from the University during a semester.</p><p>Students on leave may return to Valparaiso University without formally applying for readmission, provided they resume attendance on or before the 180 days following the start of the leave of absence. Students who are unable to return from a leave may contact the Office of the Registrar for information on returning at a later date. The Office of the Registrar should be contacted for information pertaining to a military leave of absence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission of Former Students to Undergraduate and Professional Programs</head><p>Students who have fully matriculated at Valparaiso University and who have interrupted their studies for whatever reason must apply for readmission to the University. The request for readmission is to be sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Exceptions are students who took a formal leave of absence under the conditions specified above and students enrolled in the Diaconal Education and Formation Process, who usually spend one year in in-service training. Cooperative Program work semesters and off-campus special semesters are considered to be continuation of study, for which students have officially registered.</p><p>Application for readmission must be made at least one week before the start date of the term in which the student wishes to enroll. Applications will not be accepted after this date. The student being readmitted must present the necessary information such as records of attendance and grades at other colleges, and a new medical examination report if the student has been out of school during the previous sixteen month period, before action will be taken on the request to be readmitted.</p><p>Credit hours earned more than fifteen years before application for readmission (either at Valparaiso University or at another accredited institution) are subject to reevaluation and, if accepted by the appropriate University standing committee, may be subject to validation by the first year's work (30 semester credits) completed in residence with a 2.000 grade point average.</p><p>The case of each student applying for readmission is presented to the Office of Undergraduate Admission for consultation with the college of which the student is seeking readmission. The Office of Undergraduate Admission then notifies the student of the readmission decision. Students with outstanding financial obligations to the University are not considered for readmission until these obligations have been paid in full.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Standing-Resident Students</head><p>Any resident student who has taken academic course work at any other accredited educational institution must request the Registrar of that institution to send an official transcript to the Valparaiso University Office of the Registrar, where an evaluation is made for possible acceptance of transfer credits. Courses with grades of C-or above are accepted for transfer credit. Grades are not transferable; only credit transfers. CORE 110 or CORE 115 credit may only be granted by transfer credit for courses taken prior to the student enrolling at Valparaiso University. Any credit transferred to Valparaiso University after the student has begun their career at Valparaiso University will not be considered as applicable toward fulfilling CORE 110 or CORE 115 requirements.</p><p>Credit for workshops, institutes, or travel study ordinarily is granted only for work taken at Valparaiso University. In cases of exception to the preceding restriction, transfer credit for institutes or workshops will not exceed one credit per calendar week of instruction. Transfer credit for travel study programs will usually not exceed two credits per calendar week.</p><p>Resident students who wish to take courses at other approved schools concurrently with their Valparaiso work should refer to the appropriate paragraph under Residence Requirements on page 425.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change to Another Program</head><p>If a student transfers from one major or interdisciplinary program to another, all requirements of the new specialization must be met. Such a transfer subjects credits previously earned to a reevaluation. In certain cases the change of program may result in some loss of credit (e.g., if a course taken as a General Education Requirement is superseded by another course required for the new major). Therefore, such transfers may not be made without the written approval of the advisors and deans concerned. Necessary forms are available through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar.</p><p>In the case of transfer from one college to another, students should be sure to review the requirements for the degrees of the new college and note any restrictions on credit hours which may be transferred from the former college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examinations</head><p>Written tests and quizzes are given from time to time during the semester at the discretion of the instructor.</p><p>A final examination is required in all courses of 3 credit hours or more. Exceptions may be made for such courses as independent study, practica and internships, performance, studio, and activity courses. Final examinations are held at the close of each semester and, for courses of 3 credit hours or more, must be conducted according to a schedule published by the Office of the Registrar.</p><p>Final examinations in courses of less than three credits are conducted during regularly scheduled class periods.</p><p>In order to give students adequate opportunity to prepare for final examinations, no tests may be given in courses of 3 credit hours or more within seven days before the beginning of the examination period.</p><p>Exceptions to these policies require the written approval of the dean of the college in which the course is offered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absence from Class</head><p>All students are expected to attend every one of their classes unless their absence has been approved by the instructor concerned or the appropriate dean.

Valparaiso University is residential by design. Living on campus represents an integral component of the mission of the institution by providing living and learning experiences which lead to a student's growth and development, and an enhancement of one's total education at Valpo. Because the residential experience is such an important aspect of the overall Valpo experience, Valparaiso University has a three-year residency requirement. All undergraduate students are expected to reside in campus housing for six <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> semesters. Exceptions are made for veterans, those who will be 22 before September 1 of the academic year in question, those living with parents, spouse, or legal guardian (commuter students), and sophomore and junior fraternity men who live in recognized fraternity houses. All sophomore and junior students who return from their fall semester of international studies or other cooperative off-campus programs are required to live in University operated residence halls during the spring semester.</p><p>Graduate, and law students may apply to live in University residence halls, however, first priority is given to undergraduate students. The University reserves the right to deny housing to individuals who are not full-time undergraduate students.</p><p>The Office of Residential Life also maintains a listing of rooms in private homes, apartments and homes for sale or rent. Students desiring such accommodations should plan to visit the campus at least six weeks before the semester of enrollment to inspect the available listings and make arrangements with the individual landlords. Every landlord whose property is listed has signed a nondiscrimination statement. The University is not involved in arrangements between students and landlords, except in the event of racial discrimination.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal From All Classes</head><p>If, for whatever reason, a student needs to withdraw from Valparaiso University during the fall of spring semester, they may be eligible for a prorated refund of their tuition and room charges according to the following schedule for undergraduate and graduate (except MBA*) courses:</p><p>During the add/drop period 100% During the second week of classes 90% During the third week of classes 80% During the fourth week of classes 70% During the fifth week of classes 60% During the sixth week of classes 50% During the seventh week of classes 40% During the eighth week of classes 30% During the ninth week of classes 20% During the tenth week of classes 10% After tenth week of classes None *Because MBA courses are shorter in duration, there is a separate refund schedule for them.</p><p>The unused meal plan credit is refundable throughout the semester. The refund amount equals the balance of the unused contract less a ten percent administrative fee.</p><p>There will be no refund of general, special, and laboratory fees.</p><p>The date of withdrawal and basis for calculating all refunds will be the date on which the student notifies the Office of Student Affairs of their intent to withdraw from the University, provided the withdrawal form is completed and submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the end of the next working day. Each semester, a schedule of the applicable refund dates is available in the Finance Office, the Financial Aid Office, and the Office of the Registrar</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjustment of Financial Aid Due to Complete Withdrawal</head><p>The University and/or the student may be required to return some of the federal financial aid, if any, awarded to the student. If the student received financial aid from state, University, or private funds (other than family), a portion of the refund may also be returned to the grant, scholarship, or loan source from which it was received. The above refund schedule will be used to adjust institutional aid. The federal "Return of Title IV Funds" formula dictates the amount of Federal Title IV aid, other than Federal Work Study, that must be returned to the federal government by the school and the student. For students receiving Indiana State grants, if full time status is not maintained through the end of the fourth week of the semester, the University must return 100% of those funds to the state.</p><p>Federal "Return of Title IV Funds" Formula: If a student withdraws on or before the 60% point of the semester, the percentage of funds that must be returned to the federal government is equal to the number of calendar days remaining in the semester, divided by the number of calendar days in the semester. Scheduled breaks of more than four consecutive days are excluded. The calculation of the return of these funds may result in the student owing a balance to the University and/or the federal government.</p><p>Note: If funds are released to a student because of a credit balance on the student's account, then the student may be required to repay some of the federal grants if the student withdraws.</p><p>Students considering withdrawing from all classes should consult with the staff in the Student Accounts and/or Financial Aid Offices if they are concerned about the financial impact of withdrawing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropping Courses</head><p>Tuition charges will be reassessed at the end of the add/drop period. There will be no adjustments to tuition for courses dropped after the add/drop period. There will also be no refund of the special, laboratory, or general fees.</p><p>The financial aid award, if any, will be reviewed at the end of the add/drop period and, if needed, will be adjusted to reflect enrollment at that time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unofficial Withdrawals</head><p>If a student does not successfully complete any courses during a given semester, their federal aid may need to be adjusted. If the University cannot document that a student attended at least one course past the 60% point of the semester, federal aid will be adjusted according to the "Return of Title IV Funds" policy above. The date used in that calculation will be the mid-point of the given semester unless a later date can be documented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>Visit the Office of Financial Aid online.</p><p>The Office of Financial Aid at Valparaiso University is committed to providing resources necessary to help students complete their education. As such, we place primary emphasis on the student's academic achievement and financial need. Financial aid consists of scholarships, grants, loans, and campus employment, which may be offered to a student singly or in various combinations. The family of a student is expected to make a maximum effort to assist with college expenses. For more information about financial aid programs, contact the Office of Financial Aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method of Application</head><p>The following procedure should be followed by any student entering the University for the first time who wishes to apply for financial aid:</p><p>1. File an Application for Admission with the Office of Admission. No student will be considered for assistance until they are admitted to the University. 2. Submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA requires no fee and can be completed online at www.fafsa.ed.gov. All students should file the FAFSA before March 1 for priority consideration. (For Indiana residents, the FAFSA must be received by the federal processor by March 10 to be eligible for Indiana awards.) The filing of the FAFSA may be completed after October 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renewal</head><p>All need-based financial assistance requires the annual filing of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students should file by March 1 for priority consideration. Renewal depends on continued need, the availability of funds, and eligibility as described below, including meeting the requirements for satisfactory academic progress. The policy can be found on page 439.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Programs</head><p>Financial aid awards may include gift aid (grants and scholarships) and/or self-help (loans and employment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Eligibility</head><p>To be eligible for most federal, state, and Valparaiso University assistance, undergraduate students must be enrolled full-time (some federal and state assistance is available to part-time students) in a degree or certificate program with at least twelve credits per semester; maintain satisfactory academic progress; demonstrate financial need as determined by filing the FAFSA; be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen; not be in default on a federal loan or owe a refund or repayment on any federal or state program.</p><p>Graduate students also must meet the above requirements. However, they must be enrolled in a degree program with at least four and one half credits per semester.</p><p>Initial financial aid awards are based on the assumption that the recipient will be enrolled as a full-time student. Students who enroll for less than full time or who withdraw during a semester could have their financial aid award reduced or canceled. Enrollment status is determined at the beginning of each semester. For federal aid, enrollment status is determined when the aid is disbursed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scholarships and Special Awards</head><p>Valparaiso University makes available to new students a variety of scholarships and awards based on academic and other qualifications. Eligibility for all scholarships and awards is determined by the University Scholarship Committee whose decision is final. Scholarships and awards are offered in good faith by the University with the intent they will be renewed under the conditions specified. Specific renewal requirements for scholarships and awards are stated in the scholarship award letter sent to each recipient upon admission. Annual scholarships awarded for four years are to be evenly divided each year between fall and spring semesters. If a student recipient graduates after only seven semesters of enrollment, the eighth semester of the scholarship is no longer available. Some exceptions are possible for students who enroll in summer terms with the express purpose of graduating early. Students should contact the Financial Aid Office as soon as they begin to consider graduating in less than four years to review how their financial aid awards will be affected. If an award is not renewed because the cumulative grade point average falls below the standard, the award may be restored if the student's cumulative grade point average meets the standard at a later time. The student should contact the Financial Aid Office to request restoration of the award. The University does reserve the right to alter any scholarship or award should circumstances dictate. Some scholarships and awards may not be offered in combination with each other. Please refer to our website at valpo.edu/student-financialservices/planning for a list of scholarships and for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need-Based Aid Grant Programs</head><p>Valpo Fund Alumni Awards are institutional awards that are not repaid. All students who file the FAFSA will be considered. These scholarships are funded, in large part, by the endowed and donated scholarships listed on page 441.</p><p>Federal Pell Grants are available to all students who have demonstrated financial need according to a federal formula. The FAFSA is required. Award amounts vary based on federal guidelines; may be enrolled full-time or part-time.</p><p>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) are federal grants, awarded to Valparaiso University students with the greatest financial need with first preference to Federal Pell Grant recipients. Although by regulation the awards can range from $200 to $4,000, the actual awards determined by Valparaiso University are dependent upon the amount of funding provided by the federal government and the number of Pell Grant recipients. Recipients may be enrolled either full-time or part-time.</p><p>State Grants (Freedom of Choice Award and 21st Century Award) are for eligible Indiana residents and may be used at Valparaiso University. Non-Indiana residents should contact their state agencies for information and application procedures for any state grants for which they may be eligible. The FAFSA must be received by the federal processor by March 10 to be eligible for Indiana Awards. Awards are based on need, and are determined annually by state formula. Students must be enrolled full-time for the standard grant programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loan Programs</head><p>Need-based student loans feature subsidized interest and deferred payments. Students must be enrolled at least half-time. Repayment of these loans does not begin until six to nine months after graduation or after dropping below half-time status. Payments may be deferred for attending graduate school or for a variety of special circumstances. Repayments usually extend over a period of ten years although extended terms and income-based plans are also offered. There is no penalty in student loan programs for prepaying interest and principal. Many Valparaiso University students receive loans as part of their financial aid packages.</p><p>In addition to the loans listed below, there are other private lenders who specialize in educational loans that are not based upon financial need.</p><p>The following federal need-based educational loans are available through Valparaiso University. To be eligible, you must complete and submit the FAFSA. Valparaiso University notifies the student of eligibility via an Award Notification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct Subsidized Student Loans</head><p>Undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time who demonstrate financial need. Monies come from the federal government. The federal government pays interest while the borrower is in school. Repayment begins six (6) months after the borrower is no longer enrolled in college at least half-time. Students should complete and submit the FAFSA to apply, and all firsttime borrowers must complete entrance counseling and sign a promissory note online at studentloans.gov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans</head><p>These loans are available to students who are enrolled at least half-time and who are not eligible for or were partially eligible for the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan. Terms and limits are the same as Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, except the student is charged interest on the loan from the date funds are disbursed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct Loan Limits</head><p>• Freshmen = $5,500 ($3,500 max in a subsidized loan)</p><p>• Sophomore = $6,500 ($4,500 max in a subsidized loan)</p><p>• Junior = $7,500 ($5,500 max in a subsidized loan)</p><p>• Senior = $7,500 ($5,500 max in a subsidized loan) For independent undergraduates, the loan limits are higher than the Federal Direct Loan maximums. Freshmen/sophomore independent students may receive up to $6,000 in additional unsubsidized loans and juniors/seniors up to $7,000 more per academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Federal Direct Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)</head><p>These loans are for parents of dependent students enrolled in at least six semester hours. Monies come from the federal government. This loan is not based on financial need, but a credit check is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>The loan limits are up to the cost of education, less other aid, per student. Repayment of the principal and interest may begin 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed or the parent may request deferred repayment.</p><p>The filing of the FAFSA is required. Parents may apply for the Parent PLUS at studentloans.gov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative Loans</head><p>Available from a variety of private lenders. Principal and interest may be deferred while in school, and a co-signer is usually required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valparaiso University Loans</head><p>Limited, low interest loans are administered by Valparaiso University. The amounts vary. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> The Garland Loan Fund</head><p>Loans for students majoring in the sciences or mathematics. These will be non-interest bearing loans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Garman Loan Fund</head><p>A loan fund has been established by Benjamin L. Garman to help students who cannot qualify for a scholarship but who must have financial assistance or those with scholarships who need more help.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Nellie Winifred Cheney Overton Memorial Loan Fund</head><p>This fund was established by Mr. William J. Overton as a memorial to Mrs. Overton. The income from the fund is available for loans to students from Lake County, Indiana.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Schell Loan</head><p>This loan is funded by the Schell Foundation and is available to undergraduate students from select states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Henry Strong Educational Foundation</head><p>Provides loans to qualified full-time upper class students under thirty years of age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loan Repayment Terms</head><p>Each of the loan programs contains specific repayment terms and conditions which are a part of the promissory note the student signs upon receipt of the loan fund. Students are responsible for being aware of the various loan provisions and thus should review the terms of the repayment obligation prior to accepting funds under these loan programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loan Repayment Information</head><p>Sensible borrowing can not only help pay for college but also help establish a good credit history. Similarly, not making regular payments can result in a poor credit rating or even default status on student loans.</p><p>To estimate future repayment obligations, go to studentloans.gov and use their repayment calculators. For example monthly payment on $20,000 in Direct Loans at 6.8% interest will be $230.16 per month for ten years.</p><p>Federal Direct Loan borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer about repayment of loans. There are a variety of repayment options and options for deferring repayment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative Sources of Aid</head><p>The following sources are not based on financial need. Non-need based loans are limited to the cost of education less other financial aid, or the annual loan limits, whichever is less.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vocational Rehabilitation</head><p>Under the provision of Public Law 565, the federal government and the State of Indiana jointly provide funds for scholarship grants-in-aid to students who have a physical or mental impairment which constitutes a vocational handicap. The State Vocational Rehabilitation Division is responsible for the determination of the grants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Veterans' Programs</head><p>In addition to working with the Veterans' Administration (VA), military veterans should consult with the Financial Aid Office as soon as possible when preparing to enroll at Valparaiso University. The University does participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program under the Post 9/11 GI Bill, otherwise known as Chapter 33. The University awards the Patriot Award which in conjunction with the base Chapter 33 benefit and the additional Yellow Ribbon benefit will cover 100% of tuition and general fee for undergraduate students. Graduate and law students should refer to their schools' respective policies. The University does limit the number of Yellow Ribbon recipients it funds and priority goes to returning students already in the program and then on a first come, firstserved basis for new students. Veterans are asked to meet with Financial Aid Office staff to discuss their options before enrolling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROTC Programs</head><p>Students who participate in the Air Force or Army ROTC programs may receive scholarship assistance through ROTC. Army or Air Force ROTC students who receive full tuition scholarships along with ROTC living and book stipends will also be guaranteed additional scholarships/grants from the University such that the total of all aid will equal at least the tuition, general fees, on campus room and meal plans appropriate for the students' academic grade levels, and books. Air Force ROTC students who receive partial tuition scholarships through ROTC will also receive University scholarship/grants at least in the amount of on campus room and meal plans appropriate for the students' academic grade levels. A student must live in University-owned or controlled housing and be enrolled in a full-time meal plan in order to receive the additional University funding. If University scholarships/grants are part of the ROTC student's award, then total resources including ROTC scholarships and stipends may not exceed the student's cost of attendance as determined by the Financial Aid Office. ROTC students may elect to decline University scholarship/grant aid in order to utilize federal student loan assistance which allows the students to receive aid in excess of the cost of attendance. ROTC students are asked to meet with Financial Aid Office staff to discuss their options before enrolling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valparaiso University Lilly Community Award</head><p>Indiana students selected by their local Lilly Community Foundation to receive its full tuition and fees scholarship will also be guaranteed University scholarship/grant aid such that the total of all aid will cover tuition, general fee, on-campus room and meal plan appropriate to the student's grade level, and books.

Open positions are posted on Valparaiso University's "Handshake" web site at valpo.joinhandshake.com/login. Students should contact the individual departments with job openings to apply for positions. Students with demonstrated financial need may work under the Federal Work Study <ref type="bibr">Program (FWS)</ref>. FWS students may also apply for off-campus jobs in the Community Service component of the program. Students may work on campus under the Valparaiso University Work Study Program regardless of financial need.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment of Financial Aid</head><p>Most aid is divided and credited to student accounts in equal amounts for each semester. Most aid is ready to disburse at the beginning of each semester, although the actual date that funds are disbursed varies and no aid can be disbursed until all requested documentation has been submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid. Aid is credited regularly throughout the semester. Students must be enrolled for the sufficient number of credits (according to the requirements of each program) in a semester to receive financial aid.</p><p>Students whose financial aid exceeds the University charges for the semester, may request a refund from the Office of Student Accounts. It is each student's responsibility to verify semester charges, financial aid credits, and refunds for accuracy.</p><p>Students receive work-study awards as a direct deposit to their financial institution every two weeks for hours worked in the previous pay period, not as a credit on their student account.</p><p>Financial aid for students who withdraw from Valparaiso University will be adjusted based on the University's refund policy. Specific information may be found in the Refund Policy section of this catalog (beginning on page 434).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off-Campus Study</head><p>Students enrolled in an off-campus program, including study abroad programs, which are approved for credit by Valparaiso University, are eligible to apply for financial aid.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Refund Policy</head><p>If a student is due a refund under the Valparaiso University refund policy, and the student has received any financial aid other than Federal Work-Study, part of the refund must be returned to the sponsoring aid programs. The amount of refund is determined in accordance with the University refund policy listed in the catalog (see page 434). Policies for returning a portion of that refund to sponsoring aid programs are as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valparaiso University Awards and Scholarships</head><p>If a refund balance remains after funds have been returned to the federal programs, a prorated percentage of Valparaiso University funds will be refunded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Privately Funded Grants and Scholarships</head><p>Some students will be recipients of funds from private donors such as churches, civic groups, foundations, etc. Many of these organizations will provide specific instructions concerning disbursement of their funds to students who withdraw. In the absence of specific instructions, the full scholarship will be applied to one semester. Funds on deposit with the University that the donor designated for future terms of enrollment within the academic year will be returned to the donor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Title IV Programs (Federal)</head><p>Federal law determines the total amount of refund due, if any, when a student withdraws and how much of that refund must be returned to the federal programs. See page 434.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>State Grants and Scholarships</head><p>Refunding proration is done according to specific regulations of the sponsoring state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy</head><p>Financial Aid recipients must maintain minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress for receipt of federal, state, and most Valparaiso University aid programs. All students receiving financial assistance must maintain an active status in a degree program. Regulations require a maximum time frame for degree completion, a quantitative measurement (credits earned toward a degree), and a qualitative measurement (cumulative grade point average). These three criteria are checked at the end of each academic year in May to determine whether students are maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Graduate and Law students should refer to the Graduate and Law Bulletins for specific policy requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time Frame Measurement</head><p>Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the hours required for a bachelor's degree. The 150 percent cap is the maximum limit according to federal regulations. The actual credit hour limit may vary depending on the requirements of each degree program. Most programs require 124 hours: for those programs the maximum attempted hours allowed is 186. Other programs, including music, engineering, nursing, and business degrees require more than 124 hours; therefore the maximum number of attempted hours allowed would be greater.</p><p>All attempted hours at Valparaiso University, including regular semesters and summer sessions, as well as any credits transferred from other schools, will apply toward the 150 percent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Measurement</head><p>To comply with the 150 percent time frame requirement, students must complete at least two thirds (2/3) of all Valparaiso University hours attempted with a passing grade. At the end of each academic year, each student's Valparaiso University total hours completed will be compared to the Valparaiso University total hours attempted to determine whether they are meeting this requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Measurement</head><p>Minimum cumulative grade point average standards are as follows:</p><p>Freshmen (less than 24 hours completed) 1.650 Sophomores (24 to 55 hours completed) 1.750 Junior and above (56 or more hours completed) 2.000</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incompletes, Withdrawals, Repeated Courses, and Non-Credit Remedial Courses</head><p>Incompletes and withdrawals will count as hours attempted but not completed. If incompletes are later completed, they will be reflected when progress is again checked, or sooner if the student appeals. Repeated courses will add to total hours attempted and hours completed. The new grade will be included in the grade point average calculation, which will be considered when progress is again checked, or sooner if the student appeals. Valparaiso University does not offer noncredit remedial courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeals and Reinstatement</head><p>Students whose academic progress is not in compliance with these standards will be notified in writing after the spring semester that their eligibility for aid has been terminated. They will also be advised of the appeal and reinstatement policy at that time.</p><p>Students may appeal termination of their financial aid eligibility based on extenuating circumstances, which may include illness, death in the family, other circumstances beyond the student's control, or special academic circumstances. If the appeal is approved, the student will normally have one semester to attain grade point average and completed credit hour standards specified by the appeals committee. Students who do not appeal, or whose appeal is denied, will not regain financial aid eligibility until the semester after they have attained the appropriate grade point average and completed credit hour standards. The student should contact the Office of Financial Aid to initiate reinstatement.</p><p>Appeals should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid Appeals Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Considerations</head><p>Summer school credits may be considered in evaluating attainment of the academic progress standards on an appeal basis.</p><p>Certain aid programs have shorter timeframe limits, and different grade point average requirements. Recipients of Valparaiso University Scholarships and other merit awards should refer to their scholarship award letter for the terms and conditions for renewal. In addition, federal loan programs have cumulative limits that may be reached before the maximum time-frame limits are reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Financial Aid Responsibilities</head><p>Students have the following responsibilities regarding financial aid assistance:</p></div>

Students planning to transfer to Valparaiso University must apply for admission through the Office of Admissions at least three weeks before the official start day of the term for which they are applying and must present evidence of honorable dismissal from the institution last attended. Transfer students will not be admitted to Valparaiso University until official transcript(s) and other required credentials are on file in the Office of Admissions. After their records are evaluated, applicants will be notified regarding the courses which are found acceptable for transfer. Courses with grades of C-or above are accepted as transfer credit. Grades are not transferable; only credit transfers. For students in the College of Business, see page 296. For registered nurses in the degree completion program of the College of Nursing and Health Professions, see page 364.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Level 3</head><p>Students at this level are eligible for everything listed for Placement Group 2, as well as MATH 131: Calculus I. This is as high as our placement system goes; placement in mathematics to anything higher than Calculus I requires previous college credit for the appropriate pre-requisite classes (for example, students who have received AP credit for Calculus I may start in Calculus II). Any student in this placement group should NOT take the math placement assessment.</p><p>The minimum standards for preliminary placement at this level are:  PL 3: ACT MATH 30 -36 (SAT MATH 690 -800)  PL 3: ACT MATH 25 -29 (SAT MATH 590 -680), and high school GPA of 3.500 or higher, and having taken a course in Precalculus, Trigonometry, or Calculus during senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Level 2</head><p>Students at this level are eligible for everything listed for Placement Level 1, as well as MATH 115: Trigonometry and Functions and MATH 124: Finite Mathematics. Any student in this placement group should NOT take the math placement assessment unless direct entry into MATH 131: Calculus is desired.</p><p>The minimum standards for preliminary placement at this level are:  PL 2: ACT MATH 25 -29 (SAT MATH 590 -680), and high school GPA of 3.500 or higher, but NOT having taken a course in Precalculus, Trigonometry, or Calculus during senior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies</head><p>The failing grade, F, is given under any of the following circumstances:</p><p>1. Work done in a course is below a minimum standard required for passing. 2. A student fails to complete work to remove a grade of I (incomplete) before the deadline stated above. 3. A student stops attending a course without filing the necessary form and obtaining the necessary approval. 4. A student stops attending the University without giving official notification. F grades are given in all courses for that term.</p><p>To withdraw from a course students should submit the withdraw request on DataVU using the "Withdraw from Sections" link. After the withdraw deadline, students may submit the appropriate appeal to the Committee on Academic and Professional Standards. Withdrawal from the University requires notification to the Office of Student Affairs. The appropriate form is obtainable from that office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Courses on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Basis</head><p>Undergraduate students are encouraged to venture outside the areas of their concentration, investigate new disciplines, and discover new, perhaps unsuspected, interests. If a student chooses, the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading option may reduce the anxiety about electing a course in an area in which the student has had little or no prior experience. Students who are interested in conveying maximum information on their transcripts to professional and graduate school should speak to their advisors and the dean of their college prior to electing this option.</p><p>Certain courses normally result in the S/U grade, as noted in the catalog course descriptions. In addition to any of these courses, the student may take one course, normally letter graded (i.e., A to F), each semester on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis subject to the following conditions:</p><p>1. Such courses must not be selected from:</p><p>a. The student's major or minor field or fields; b. A repeated course, if not originally taken on the S/U basis; 2. Students in the professional colleges may choose the S/U basis for free electives (if not taken in the major or minor fields) and</p><p>for courses which fulfill their general education requirements in Core, Humanities, Social Science, Theology, World Language, Diversity, or Kinesiology. For further regulations regarding the S/U option for business students, please see page 297. 3. Such petition must be signed by the student's academic advisor; 4. A decision to elect a course on the S/U basis must be made by the deadline specified by the Office of the Registrar in the Important Dates document for the applicable term. After this deadline, the S/U grading basis may not be changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NOTE:</head><p>In selection of the S/U option, students are strongly advised to discuss the implications of that option with their advisor concerning entrance into professional schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to the Course Intensification Plan</head><p>Students may propose a special project for earning one extra credit in one liberal arts course in which they are enrolled in a given semester. In addition, students enrolled in the College of Business (see page 297) and the College of Nursing and Health Professions (see page 365) have specific criteria for course intensification of their courses. This opportunity is part of the University's course intensification plan. The following regulations pertain to this option for all students regardless of their college:</p><p>1. The course must be offered for three or more credits. Variable credit courses cannot be intensified. 2. The initiative and responsibility for developing a satisfactory proposal lie with the student. 3. Student must complete a Petition to Intensify a Course, available online through the Office of the Registrar. 4. The proposal must be approved by the student's advisor, the instructor of the course, the chair of the department, and the dean of the student's college. 5. Approved proposals must be filed in the Office of the Registrar during the period specified in the academic calendar.</p><p>The course intensification plan is a type of honors work, and under no circumstances should be considered a substitute for regular course work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Courses as an Auditor</head><p>A regularly classified student may register in a course as an auditor only with the permission of his or her advisor and the chair of the department which offers the course. Deadlines to apply to audit a course are published in the calendar at the front of this catalog. An auditor may not be admitted to the final examination and is never granted credit for the course audited. No additional fee is charged when the student pays full tuition up to 19 credit hours. Any credit hour over 19 will be subject to the overload fee as published. Once in a course as an auditor, the student cannot change the status of his or her enrollment to receive a regular grade in the course. This catalog has been produced using Microsoft Office software. The type font is Calibri. Editor: Nicholas Szymanski.</p></div>
