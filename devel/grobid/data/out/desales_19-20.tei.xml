<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MISSION</head><p>The mission of DeSales University is to provide men and women with quality higher education according to the philosophy of Christian humanism as developed by Saint Francis de Sales and his spiritual heirs. The University imparts knowledge about and develops talents for personal, familial, and societal living. DeSales University enriches the human community and enhances the dignity of the individual through its educational endeavors. In its work, the University fosters a vital and respectful dialogue between Roman Catholic faith and human culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CATHOLIC IDENTITY</head><p>The Catholic identity of DeSales University is central to our mission and the experience of learning for our students, faculty, and staff. We work to advance the Catholic faith in a way that respects its great tradition and honors the dignity and faith life of all in our community. The following includes key elements that comprise our efforts to advance a dynamic, life-giving expression of our tradition. This list is compiled from sources that include normative documents and statements of Popes John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis; the Congregation of Catholic Education; and the church's Code of Canon Law.</p><p>Most recently, the leadership of Pope Francis has energized the ministry of Catholic education. He has encouraged Catholic school leaders to form students to use their "head, hands, and hearts" to serve the world and build the Kingdom of God. Additionally, he said that educators must have one of their feet in the security of the tradition and the other in the zone of risk, for this leads to the freedom that is called for in education.</p><p>1. Access for the poor: Catholic college and universities provide necessary resources for students from poor families to attend their schools (Congregation for Catholic Education, 2017a). 2. Activities guided by the Catholic faith: "Catholic ideals, attitudes, and principles should appropriately penetrate and inform all university activities" <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 175</ref>). 3. Campus Ministry: The university "collaborates in ecumenical and interfaith efforts to care for the pastoral needs of students, faculty, and other university personnel who are not Catholic" <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 186</ref>). 4. Care for Creation: Pope Francis' call for integral ecology and his publication of Laudato Si, a papal encyclical raised this value to an essential element of the faith formation of the human person. 5. Cooperation and Catholicity: "As direct personal contact between faculty and students is a hallmark of U.S. Catholic education," pastoral relationships provide the foundation for the network of interactions among the school community <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 182)</ref>. "The university's learning atmosphere should encourage the proper befriending of students" <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 182</ref>). 6. Curriculum and the Catholic intellectual tradition: Catholic schools advance "an all-embracing vision that animates their intellectual life for comprehensive worldview grounded" in the Catholic educational tradition that unites faith and reason to serve the church and society <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 179)</ref>. 7. Dialogue with culture: The school is providing a context for current issues to be debated, discussed, and argued with the voice of the church accurately represented from the tradition and the voice of the culture respectfully listened to with appropriate regard for the students' development of their minds and attitudes (Congregation for Catholic Education, Educating for Fraternal Humanism, 2017). 8. Faculty selection: Finely academically prepared faculty "outstanding in their integrity of doctrine and probity of life" will be hired for mission <ref type="bibr">(Code of Canon Law, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr">, in Miller, 2007</ref>). 9. Hospitality and Inclusion: The ongoing vehemence, volume, and volubility of Pope Francis on welcoming and accompanying the stranger and those marginalized, especially migrants, calls for Catholic communities of all sorts, including those in Catholic higher education, to integrate hospitality in every context. Additionally, he has taken the heretofore curial responsibility of Care for Migrants into the personal office of the pope. In other words, the pope did not delegate this church matter. 10. Institutional commitment to Catholicity: The school is a "publicly recognizable institution whose activities of teaching, scholarship, and service 'are connected with and in harmony with the evangelizing mission of the Church" (John <ref type="bibr">Paul II, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">, as cited in Miller, 2007</ref>. 11. International solidarity: "A mark of a university's Catholicity is whether it tithes its own academic and financial resources so as to help build up systems of Catholic higher education in the local churches of developing countries. Two matters to consider with regard to international solidarity" include links to other schools, especially in the developing world, to promote the common good and making a priority the exchange of academic resources <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 184)</ref>. 12. Jesus: The Catholic school shows a primacy in its culture for the presence and place of Jesus in its culture <ref type="bibr">(O'Connell, 2012, p. 157</ref>). 13. Scholarship and research: All research from the Catholic institution must respect the norms and teaching of the church <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 178)</ref>. 14. Social Justice and Fraternal Humanism: The Church's Catholic Social Teaching, coupled with Educating for Fraternal Humanism, a document of the Congregation of Catholic Education which he authorized in April 2017, positions the education to place the person at the center of education with the host of accompanying values from the corpus of social teaching and this most recent Vatican statement on education. 15. Student life: The university hosts a "commitment to create a campus culture and environment that is expressive and supportive of a Catholic way of life, respects the religious liberty and freedom of conscience of all students, and strives to form graduates whose faith enlightens their everyday lives" <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 185</ref>). 16. Theology and Catholic identity: A Catholic university graduates "students with a suitable level of theological literacy" <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 180)</ref>. Here, it is important that "those teaching theology are in full communion with the Church <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 2007, p. 181)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE OBLATES OF ST. FRANCIS DE SALES</head><p>The Congregation of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales was founded to advance the Gospel through the spirit and teaching of its patron saint. A chief focus of St. Francis de Sales was the gentleness and humanity of Jesus. The gentleman saint took this from his favorite Gospel quote: "Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart" <ref type="bibr">(MT 11:29)</ref>. Working to "Live Jesus," DeSales sought for himself and implored others to integrate the very person and personality of the Savior into the character of the disciple. Consequently, "Live Jesus" grew to become a popular maxim for DeSales.</p><p>One of the foremost Christian humanists of his day, St. Francis de Sales developed a fascinating and engaging perspective of the human person. He said, "The person is the perfection of the universe, the mind is the perfection of the person, love is the perfection of the mind and charity is the perfection of love."</p><p>This unique conjunction, interpenetration, and interaction of intellectual and affective elements sees a person in his or her totality. In the Salesian view, with its attempt to harmonize and integrate the divine and human aspects, anthropology becomes inseparable from theology. Everything truly human comes under the study, care, and concern of the person. That is why Christian humanism engenders a universal openness and awareness.</p><p>Mother Mary Chappuis, a nun from the Order of the Visitation founded by St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane de Chantal, prevailed upon Father Louis Brisson to form a congregation of men committed to living and transmitting this ideal of Salesian humanism. In 1876, a small band of six men, led by Father Brisson, professed their first vows as Oblates of St. Francis de Sales and began to live the religious life in Troyes, France.</p><p>Despite humble beginnings, the order experienced a rapid growth. Oblate communities now exist in India, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, South America, South Africa, Namibia, Switzerland, and the United States.</p><p>The first foundation in the United States was Salesianum School, a high school for boys in <ref type="bibr">Wilmington, Del., in 1903.</ref> Although the first undertaking of the Oblates in the United States was the Christian education of youth, members devote themselves to many other varied apostolates to serve people's needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE SALESIAN CENTER FOR FAITH AND CULTURE</head><p>Begun in 2000, the Salesian Center for Faith and Culture serves DeSales University by promoting the interaction of faith and culture through academic initiatives that focus on the authentic integration of social concerns and gospel values in the tradition of Christian Humanism.</p><p>The activities of the Salesian Center are qualified by their attention to the legacy of St. Francis de Sales and his spiritual heirs. Programs sponsored by the Salesian Center focus on three interrelated areas of concern.</p><p>Educational initiatives investigate the Salesian spiritual tradition in light of various developments in the modern world. Select students may be admitted to the Faith and Reason Honors Program and/or the Ryan Leadership Institute.</p><p>Dialogue opportunities concern the impact of Salesian spirituality on various aspects of contemporary life. Students have the opportunity to participate in lectures, discussions, arts presentations, and other public events sponsored by the Salesian Center. Select students may win writing awards in the annual "Salesian Spirit" essay contest.</p><p>Partnership ventures link various sectors of the local community to the work of the University. Students have the opportunity to participate in public discussions sponsored by the Forum for Ethics in the Workplace.</p><p>Through these and other programs, the Salesian Center for Faith and Culture enables students and others to promote a culture of life, foster the engagement of faith and reason, form themselves as ethical leaders, and make a positive social impact in the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE CAMPUS</head><p>DeSales University is situated on a beautiful 600-acre campus containing 22 buildings constructed since the founding of the University, and a number of other smaller buildings which were renovated for University use. Dooling Hall, the main academic building, consists of four wings and a central area. Within the wings are housed administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, and a computer science center. The central portion contains the offices for graduate programs and a student lounge. Wills Hall is a combination residence for the Oblate faculty and a chapel.</p><p>Conmy <ref type="bibr">Hall, Tocik Hall, Aviat Hall, Annecy Hall, DeChantal Hall, and Donahue</ref> Hall are student residences, with facilities to accommodate 800 students. Chappuis Hall accommodates an additional 60, some of which have been converted in 2013 as designated singles. 160 students live in University Heights, a townhouse complex constructed <ref type="bibr">in 1984, 1986, and 1991</ref>. Recent renovations in 2013 have converted some of these areas into apartments that serve the needs of our growing graduate student population. Within that same year, Finnegan and Harvey, two new apartment style housing buildings, were completed and are currently housing 114 students. Another apartment style building, Guerin, was added in 2017. This area of housing is known as the University Village and primarily serves our upperclassmen population.</p><p>Billera Hall is an 85,000-square-foot physical education building, housing facilities for intercollegiate and intramural sports and fitness activities. It is surrounded by eight athletic fields. The Dorothy Day Student Union features the Commons, a large family room for student gatherings, which includes a variety of game tables, several large flat screen televisions, and a fireplace. It is located next to Sandella's Flatbread Café, an alternative eating venue for students. In addition, the Dorothy Day Student Union houses all of the student services offices which include the Health Center, student leadership, campus ministry, student development, residence life, counseling, international learning, and the service and social justice office.</p><p>The Labuda Center for the Performing Arts houses the performing and fine arts department facilities and serves as a campus convocation center.

Built in 1988, this 36,000-square-foot facility seats 300 and is designed to accommodate 160,000 volumes.</p><p>The current collection numbers more than 550,000 items, including 132,000 volumes and 40,000 electronic books, more than 12,000 electronic journals and newspapers, and 400,000 microfiche. The periodical collection includes 550 paper and microform subscriptions. Paper and computer indexes help students to access the collection.</p><p>The library staff, in consultation with the faculty, selects reference materials to meet curriculum requirements and general information needs. In the general collection, book selection is based primarily on the various majors offered at DeSales University. The library collections of the other five independent colleges of the Lehigh Valley, totaling more than one million volumes, are also available to DeSales University students through an interlibrary loan system. Students may access more than 35 million titles across Pennsylvania via the E-Z Borrow System for quick interlibrary loan. State-of-the-art computers and audiovisual equipment are available to faculty and students. The library is a member of PALINET (Pennsylvania Library Network) and is directly connected to the national bibliographic center, OCLC.</p><p>The library's on-line catalog and electronic resources are available within the library and from the library's web pagewww.desales.edu/library. Extensive information concerning library services is provided at the public service desk and on the library's web page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISTANCE EDUCATION AND INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY</head><p>All students enrolled at DeSales University have a personalized account in the Blackboard Learn learning management system. Blackboard provides access to resources such as syllabi, grades, and assignments in a digital format. These features and resources are hosted on the DeSales Blackboard site at the discretion of individual instructors and therefore may not be available for every traditional day course.</p><p>New students are encouraged to log in to Blackboard and complete the Distance Education Student Orientation course, in which they are automatically enrolled. This course serves to familiarize students with the Blackboard online learning environment and demonstrates how to best use it during their academic endeavors at DeSales. Students who need additional assistance with navigating or using the Blackboard system should reach out to the University's Help Desk either through e-mail at help-desk@desales.edu or by phone at 610.282.1100 ext. 4357. For information about our identity verification policy, please go to www.desales.edu/policies and click on Student Identity Verification in Distance and Correspondence Education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMPUTERS</head><p>The use of computing and network resources is encouraged in all courses offered at the University. The curricula emphasize the use of information technology as an integrated and interdisciplinary problem-solving tool, as a change agent, and as a vehicle for education.</p><p>The University maintains 10 well equipped computing laboratories or classrooms for research and course work.</p><p>The Academic Computing Center (ACC) located in Dooling Hall, contains approximately 30 PCs in its main area.</p><p>The ACC Computing Classroom houses approximately 12 PC systems reserved for demonstrations or class use. Six specialized Mac TV/Film workstations are housed in this room, for use by that program. Dooling Hall lower level contains the Psychology and Criminal Justice Digital Laboratory containing approximately 26 computers dedicated to program needs.</p><p>Dooling <ref type="bibr">Hall rooms 223,</ref><ref type="bibr">225,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 227</ref> are dedicated computing classrooms, each containing approximately 25 workstations.</p><p>Gambet Center room 221 is a dedicated computing classroom containing 32 workstations.</p><p>Trexler Technology Center (TTC) main area contains 40</p><p>PCs for public computing use and classroom support. Trexler Library PC2 lab contains 16 PCs and 4 Macs, also for both public and classroom use.</p><p>All computing labs and classrooms have broadcasting software available for group presentations, including instructor control and interaction with each client station. Also, each computing area is supported by at least one high volume laser printer. All systems in all computing areas have Microsoft Windows, are fully network ready with internet access, and contain a suite of both application and network software for personal use from file and application servers located in the ACC.</p><p>The University provides all students with campus e-mail addresses through Google mail (Gmail). These accounts are accessible in a variety of ways. The Gmail server is available to process e-mail via the web. The Trexler Library supports an on-line catalog system and databases for research and course support, as well as a variety of educational, business, scientific, and economic databases on CD-ROM through regularly updated subscription services. The University also provides the Blackboard Learn learning management system for course work in all disciplines and programs.</p><p>The TTC provide a variety of services for the entire University community, including newsletters (available on-line) and seminars. All computing labs are staffed by student end user consultants to provide help when assistance is required by their users. There is no additional charge for using any of the computing resources provided by the University in any public computing area. Although the University does not require the students to bring a personal computer to campus, it is advisable to do so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESIDENCE HALL NETWORK COMPUTING (RESNET)</head><p>The Residential Networking (RESNET) initiative is designed to provide students who live in the University's residence halls a high-speed connection to the Internet from their dormitory room using their own computing systems.</p><p>RESNET provides students a pathway to a variety of resources locally (on-campus information servers) and remote services and resources, through the University's high-speed Internet connection. To access this high-speed connection, a student can do so wirelessly or must obtain and correctly install a Network Interface Card (NIC), sometimes called an Ethernet adapter. Most computers purchased today have wireless capability and NIC already installed. All residence halls are completely wireless. Students who want to connect their systems via RESNET should connect to the DESALES wireless network. Entertainment systems (Smart TVs, game systems, and the like) may be connected to the DeSales Entertainment network via a Help Desk request.</p><p>Students must electronically sign a RESNET Acceptable If a student does not have access to e-mail. Students have the right to request that the University not communicate with them by e-mail, but instead use an alternative form of communication. A student who does not own a computer or have access to the Internet might request an alternative form of communication. To request this, the student must notify the registrar's office in writing that he or she wishes not to be communicated with by e-mail, and specify the form of communication and the location at which the student will receive that communication. Requesting and using an alternative form of communication does not absolve the student of the responsibility to frequently monitor and respond to University communications.</p><p>Privacy, security, and confidentiality. The University will make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and effective operation of its electronic mail systems, but users are advised that those systems should in no way be regarded as a secure medium for the communication of sensitive or confidential information. Because of the nature and technology of electronic communication, the University can assure neither the privacy of an individual's use of the University's electronic mail resources nor the confidentiality of particular messages that may be created, transmitted, received, or stored thereby.</p><p>The computer networks and e-mail servers that support members of the DeSales community at all locations are the property of the University. E-mails resident on University servers or hosted servers, whether personal or related to the business of the University, are the property of the University and not the property of the e-mail account holder, be they students, faculty, administrative staff, or consultants. Users should exercise extreme caution in using e-mail to communicate confidential or sensitive matters, and should not assume that e-mail is private and confidential. It is especially important that users are careful to send messages only to the intended recipient(s). Particular care should be taken when using the "reply" command during e-mail correspondence.</p><p>The University reserves the right to filter e-mail to reduce the quantity of spam. The University is not responsible for any e-mail that may not be received due to the filtering of e-mail.</p><p>Educational uses of e-mail. Faculty will determine how electronic forms of communication (e.g., e-mail) will be used in their classes. The DeSales University Student E-mail Policy will ensure that all students will be able to comply with e-mail-based course requirements specified by faculty. Faculty can therefore make the assumption that students' official DeSales University e-mail accounts are being accessed, and faculty can use e-mail for their classes accordingly.</p><p>Student Personal E-mail Use. University student e-mail may be used for incidental personal purposes provided that, in addition to the foregoing constraints and conditions, such use does not: 1) directly or indirectly interfere with the University operation of computing facilities of e-mail services, or 2) burden the University with noticeable incremental cost. E-mail records arising from such personal use may, however, be subject to the restrictions set forth above.</p><p>Prohibited Usage. Prohibited uses of electronic mail include, but are not limited to: • Personal use of the e-mail system that creates a direct cost for the University; • Use of the University's e-mail resources for personal monetary gain or for commercial purposes that are not directly related to University business; • Sending copies of documents in violation of copyright laws; • Inclusion of the work of others into electronic mail commu-nications in violation of copyright laws; • Capture and "opening" of electronic mail except as required for authorized employees to diagnose and correct delivery problems; • Use of electronic mail to harass or intimidate others or to interfere with the ability of others to conduct University business; • Use of electronic mail systems for any purpose restricted or prohibited by laws or University regulations; • "Spoofing," i.e., constructing an electronic mail communication so it appears to be from someone else; • Attempting unauthorized access to electronic mail or attempting to breach any security measures on any electronic mail system, or attempting to intercept any electronic mail transmissions without proper authorization; • Any offensive or disruptive messages, including any messages which contain sexual implications, racial slurs, genderspecific comments, or any other comment that offensively addresses someone's age, gender, religious or political beliefs, national origin, or disability; • Forwarding or sending viruses.</p><p>Disciplinary Action Students and non-student users who violate this policy in any way will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action based upon the facts and circumstances of each infraction.</p><p>of the member institutions provided that the appropriate approvals have been obtained from the home and host institution, and provided that such course, or courses, does not produce an overload on the student's schedule. Cross registration is permitted on a space available basis, as determined by the host institution.</p><p>Students are eligible to cross register under the terms of this policy only if they pay the full-time comprehensive fee of the home institution. All other students must cross register under the terms of the Supplemental Cross-Registration Policy. Normally, this program is to be used for courses that cannot be scheduled at the home institution; however, special circumstances may cause this requirement to be waived. Cross registration would enable the student to receive both course credit and grade for the course. However, the number of credits assigned to a given course is the responsibility of the home institution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Cross Registration For January Term, Summer Session, and Special Programs</head><p>Cross registration for LVAIC students is available for the January term, summer sessions, and special programs, but the student must pay the appropriate fees charged by the host institution rather than the tuition cost of the home institution (which is the normal cross registration procedure). All billing will be handled directly by the host institution and the individual student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Cross Registration Limitations For Experimental And Independent Coursework</head><p>Cross registration for LVAIC students is not available for the following types of instruction: independent study, tutorials, internships, practicum field experience, supervision of instructors and student teaching experiences, private music lessons, distance education, and online courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Cross Registration Procedures</head><p>When a student wishes to enroll for a course offered by one of the participating institutions, the student must review the course offerings available for cross registration and select a course to request.</p><p>After completing the Request for Cross Registration, the information is sent to the student's advisor who will approve or deny the request.</p><p>Advisor approved course requests will be sent to the student's home Registrar for any additional approvals.</p><p>If approved by the home Registrar, the information will be sent to the host Registrar for review.</p><p>Registration by the host school is dependent upon course availability and registration time lines. Students may not know the result of their request until the beginning of the semester. Students will be informed of the result of their request by the host Registrar.</p><p>At the end of the term, transcripts or certified grade reports will be forwarded automatically without charge from the Host Registrar to the Home Registrar for any cross registered students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Cross Registration Procedures -General Considerations</head><p>1. Students may review course offerings and college/university catalogs on the web sites of the institutions as well as on the LVAIC web site. 2. A limit of two courses per term or summer session may be taken using cross registration. Each institution will establish its own regulations concerning the number of courses a student may take during any degree program, or the use of any course as a substitute for any requirement in a major or minor program. 3. Students who register for courses at other LVAIC member institutions must assume responsibility for the costs and means of transportation and accept the inconvenience of different calendars. 4. A student who registers for an off-campus course will be subject to the academic policies of the home institution and the requirements of the off-campus course. The Academic Dean of the home institution will handle difficulties arising out of conflicts of policy. 5. Students ineligible for cross registration, or seeking to register for more than two courses per term, or who seek to have a prerequisite waived, must petition to do so at both the home and host institution. No ineligible student may attend class until both home and host institutions have approved the petition. The process for petitioning varies for each institution; details may be obtained at the Registrar's Office of the appropriate institution. 6. Pass/Fail Optional Grading System -Any student registering to take a course for which he/she has cross registered on a pass/fail basis should consult with the Registrar at the home institution for the correct procedures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The U.S. Department of Education (34 CFR Section 600.2) defines "credit hour" as:</p><p>"…an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:</p><p>(1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or,</p><p>(2) at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours."</p><p>The Pennsylvania Department of Education (22 Pa. Code Section 31.21) states that a "semester hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DeSales University Credit Hour Policy</head><p>The number of credits is included with each course description in the Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog. DeSales University complies with the above standards for the assignment of credit hours as established by the U.S. Department of Education and by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In addition, DeSales University is in compliance with policies set forth by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, using acceptable and consistent methods for assigning credit hours to all courses and programs of study and conforming to commonly accepted practice in higher education.</p><p>The number of credits is included with each course description in the Undergraduate Catalog and Graduate Catalog. Information about the number of credits, meeting dates and times, classroom location, and mode of delivery is published online and made available to students prior to registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unit of measurement</head><p>All DeSales University undergraduate and graduate courses are assigned credits as a unit of measurement for curricular material regardless of time frame or mode of delivery. A credit is the equivalent of one hour (50 minutes) of faceto-face classroom instruction per week for a semester of approximately 15 weeks. There is an expectation of two hours of outside study by the student for each hour of classroom instruction.</p><p>as hybrid or completely online and meet the same number of hours as equivalent full-semester courses by requiring more frequent meetings, longer meeting times, asynchronous/ synchronous online meetings, and/or utilizing instructional equivalencies (described below under online and hybrid courses).</p><p>The academic year for the DPT, MEd, and MSPAS programs consists of fall, spring, and summer sessions that are typically 14 to 16 weeks in length. The academic year for the MBA, MCJ, MSIS, MSN, and DNP programs consists of fall, winter, spring, and summer sessions. The fall, winter, and spring sessions are typically 12 weeks in length, and the summer session is 6 weeks in length. Regardless of whether the graduate programs consist of three or four sessions per year, courses meet the same number of hours as equivalent full-semester courses by requiring more frequent meetings, longer meeting times, asynchronous/synchronous online meetings, and/or utilizing instructional equivalencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Periodic Review</head><p>Assignment of credit hours for each course is determined by the program/major based on the amount of work required to achieve the course's student learning outcomes. Undergraduate and graduate students are provided with a course syllabus that conforms with the DeSales' "Credit Hour Policy." Faculty are required to submit to Division Heads all course syllabi prior to the start of the semester/session allowing time for review and approval. Final review and approval is made by the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate courses and the dean of graduate education for graduate courses. In addition, existing courses are evaluated for compliance with federal and state regulations during each program's five-year self-study and assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Course and Approvals</head><p>For the approval of a new course, the "Petition to Present a New Undergraduate (Graduate) Course" is completed by a faculty member and approved by the chair of the major (if applicable), department chair (if applicable), and division head, and is reviewed for compliance by the dean of undergraduate education for undergraduate courses and by the dean of graduate education for graduate courses. This petition must be accompanied by a syllabus which conforms to the "Instructions for Drafting a Course Syllabus" and to the "Credit Hour Policy." New courses that request inclusion within the core curriculum must receive additional approval from the General Education Core Curriculum Committee.</p><p>Below are the general guidelines for assigning credit hours to a particular method of instruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Face-to-Face Classroom Instruction</head><p>Face-to-face courses in the undergraduate and graduate programs utilize lectures, discussions, demonstrations, or other methods of instruction. DeSales University's traditional academic year consists of a fall and spring semester that are approximately 15 weeks in length with an additional week for final examinations. One credit is awarded for one hour (50 minutes) of classroom instruction per week for the semester with a minimum of 14 hours of instruction.</p><p>The table above displays the minimal amount of student activity per credit for face-to-face classroom instruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online and Hybrid Courses</head><p>Through a combination of in-class contact hours and online activities, online or hybrid courses must provide the "instructional equivalent" of the number of in-class contact hours delivered in a traditional classroom setting. In the case of a fully online class, all of the instructional hours are calculated through "instructional equivalencies." DeSales' formal policy (Documentation of Instructional Equivalency Hours for Online and Hybrid Courses) as well as guidance for instructors (Credit Hour Instructional Equivalency Calculation for Online and Hybrid Courses) are posted for the university community on the MyDSU portal under "Policies &amp; Procedures" in the "Distance Education and Instructional Technology" folder. Online and hybrid courses have the same quality, assessment, learning outcomes, requirements, etc. as courses offered face-to-face. Templates are used for consistency of syllabi across multiple versions of the same course and in the organization of content in Blackboard. A thorough review process is in place whereby the appropriate division head or department chair examines the course syllabus for each online or hybrid course to ensure that the content and rigor is equivalent to that of any classes with the same course number that are offered in the traditional face-toface classroom setting. Additionally, the Distance Education and Instructional Technology Department reviews each course for proper set-up and use of technology in Blackboard. Instructors are contacted to update or enhance course material as needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE CURRICULUM DEGREE REQUIREMENTS:</head><p>The minimum course load required for graduation is 40; the minimum credit hours, 120. In addition, 3 one-semester, onecredit courses in physical education are required. A course that is listed for fewer than three credit hours may not be counted as one of the 40 courses required for graduation unless the courses are part of an approved series (e.g. <ref type="bibr">TR 3611/3612/3613,</ref><ref type="bibr">DA 305/306)</ref> The maximum number of one-credit courses from the performing and fine arts that a student may take for credit and be applied toward the 40-course graduation requirement is 12.</p><p>To graduate, each student must also satisfy the following: 1. Achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 for all courses presented for the degree. 2. Achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 for courses required in his/her major and offered by the major. In the Business majors, the minimum average 2.00 GPA must also be attained in all concentration courses. Some majors, such as Education, Health Science, Medical Studies, and Nursing, require a higher GPA as a component of their progression policies and/or as a prerequisite to their professional phases. For more information about these requirements, please see the individual program's section below. 3. Ordinarily, complete a minimum of 15 courses at DeSales University. It is the student's responsibility to see that all of the graduation requirements are fulfilled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM</head><p>The undergraduate curriculum consists of three components:</p><p>I. General Education Core II. Major III. Electives or Minor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. GENERAL EDUCATION CORE</head><p>The General Education Core consists of a maximum of 16 courses (plus 3 one-credit physical education courses) and is designed to offer each student a broad appreciation for human life and learning. It is structured around four elements: A. Basic Requirements: 2 courses (Composition &amp; Rhetoric 1 and 2), offered by the English faculty, that develop foundational skills: thinking, reading, writing, speaking, and research; plus 3 physical education courses: PE 100 Foundations, that explores broad concepts of total fitness, and 2 other courses that teach specific sports for life-long activity. Note: PE 100 is a graded course. B. Cultural Literacy: 6 courses that develop sequentially an appreciation for human culture, especially our Western heritage, offered by the history, political science, foreign language, art, music, English, and philosophy faculty. C. Modes of Thinking: 5 courses that present the processes that professionals in broad domains of intellectual activity (literature, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and social science) use as they attempt to contribute to human learning. These courses explore issues like: What information is important? What questions are asked? How are data processed? What conclusions can be reached? What are the values and limitations of the discipline? D. Christian Values and Theology: 3 courses that encourage students to reflect upon the meaning and value of the Catholic faith, to live in a manner consistent with Catholic teaching and tradition, and, in light of that faith and teach-ing, to evaluate human action and decision, to make moral choices, and to accept responsibility for them. The Values Seminar is a capstone for the General Education Core. Under the General Education Core each student must complete: A. Basic Requirements:</p><p>1. English 103 and English 104 2. Physical Education 100 Foundations (Graded), plus 2 courses from those designated as "Activities Courses." (Any dance technique or movement-based course, as defined in the course description, may be substituted for an activities course requirement. One 3-credit dance course can satisfy both activities requirements.) (ACCESS students are exempt from the physical education requirement.) B. Cultural Literacy:</p><p>1. 2 courses studying a foreign language other than English, numbered consecutively within the same language (e.g., <ref type="bibr">SP 101,</ref><ref type="bibr">and SP 102;</ref><ref type="bibr">FR 102 and 201;</ref><ref type="bibr">etc.)</ref>. This requirement may also be fulfilled in one of the following ways: 1) study abroad, 2) two world cultures courses or one world cultures course and one approved course with an international travel component when the student completes the travel that is part of the course. The dean of undergraduate education will decide whether a particular course or experience satisfies the study abroad option. Please note: taking one foreign language course and one course with an international travel component, together, does not satisfy this requirement. Similarly, taking two separate language courses (e.g., SP 101 and FR 101) does not satisfy this requirement. Students who have earned a high school (or equivalent) degree from any school whose chief instructional language is not English will be awarded six credits and will be exempt from the foreign language/world cultures requirement. 2. A two-course sequence, Humanities I and II, offered by either the history or political science faculty: HI 201, HI 213 or PO 201 (Humanities I) and <ref type="bibr">HI 202,</ref><ref type="bibr">HI 214,</ref><ref type="bibr">HI 262,</ref><ref type="bibr">or PO 202 (Humanities II)</ref>. PO 201 is not open to students who have taken HI 201, and PO 202 is not open to students who have taken HI 202. 3. 1 course from those designated as "Humanities III: Great Works of Art or Music" offered by the art and music faculty: <ref type="bibr">FA 330,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 331,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 332,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 333,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 334,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 335,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 336,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 350,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 362,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 364,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 366,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 368,</ref><ref type="bibr">FA 370,</ref><ref type="bibr">HI 303,</ref><ref type="bibr">HI 340,</ref><ref type="bibr">SP 341 (Study Abroad Only)</ref>.</p><p>(Prerequisites: Humanities I and Humanities II) 4. 1 course from those designated as "Humanities IV: Great Works of Literature" offered by the English, foreign language, philosophy, and political science faculty: ED 313, <ref type="bibr">EN 250,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 255,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 260,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 265,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 285,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 345,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 350,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 358,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 359,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 365,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 370,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 372,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 375,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 376,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 377,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 380,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 382,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 384,</ref><ref type="bibr">EN 388,</ref><ref type="bibr">SP 441,</ref><ref type="bibr">SP 470,</ref><ref type="bibr">SP 471</ref>  Students who take a General Education Core course that fulfills more than one General Education Core requirement may only use the course to fulfill one General Education Core requirement. For example, if a world cultures course also fulfills a Humanities III requirement, the course may only be used to fulfill one General Education Core requirement-either the world cultures requirement or the Humanities III requirement, but not both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MAJOR</head><p>The major is designed to offer the student a thorough and systematic study of one subject area and to provide her/him with an integrated grasp of its content, methodology, and bibliography. The major ordinarily controls a maximum of 16 courses which may be in more than one discipline. Normally, no more than 12 of the 16 courses may be in the major discipline itself. The remaining courses taken as a part of the stipulated maximum of 16 in the major are considered major controlled electives and must be chosen from within or outside the major, at the discretion of the program's faculty. The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student's official acceptance to the major.</p><p>A student must complete five courses in the major at DeSales University. [There are several professional programs, e.g., nursing, physician assistant studies, and education, that may have additional requirements coming from their individual accreditation agencies. Please check with the chair or director of such programs.] Where personnel permits, departments offering majors provide various course sequences within the major designed to accommodate the student with differing or undetermined career interests. Each major provides a recommended matrix for the courses in its program of studies.</p><p>DeSales University offers majors in the disciplines listed above under "Degrees."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ELECTIVES OR MINOR</head><p>In fulfilling the 40-course graduation requirement, a student may select elective courses or complete a minor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electives</head><p>Electives are chosen by the student under the guidance of the academic advisor. Normally, electives provide opportunities Theatre 366.1, .2, .3 Three of the following, which must include at least one design course: <ref type="bibr">Theatre 341,</ref><ref type="bibr">342,</ref><ref type="bibr">343 or 344;</ref><ref type="bibr">Theatre 226,</ref><ref type="bibr">242,</ref><ref type="bibr">246,</ref><ref type="bibr">250,</ref><ref type="bibr">261,</ref><ref type="bibr">263,</ref><ref type="bibr">272,</ref><ref type="bibr">280</ref> Education 330 Education 405 One subject area methods course from the following: <ref type="bibr">Education 410,</ref><ref type="bibr">411,</ref><ref type="bibr">412,</ref><ref type="bibr">413,</ref><ref type="bibr">414,</ref><ref type="bibr">or</ref>  Note: If a student desires to take all three core courses, then to fulfill the minor, the student would have to complete three more courses from the two remaining content areas with the only condition that all three not be chosen from one area alone. Finance (Sponsored by the Division of Business. Students are encouraged to declare the minor as early as possible. If any of the requirements change, the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time of the division head's approval will apply. With the exceptions of economics and sport management majors, the finance minor is not available to students with a major in the Division of Business.)</p><p>Any six finance courses. Financial Accounting AB217 and/ or Principles of Macroeconomics EC209 may be taken in place of one or two of these courses. Economics or sport management majors must take at least four courses for this minor which are distinct from the courses used to meet the requirements of their major(s). History 307 History 330 A controlled elective approved by the department chair and/or division head *Up to 12 credits in the French studies minor may be earned, with prior approval, at a study abroad program. These credits would be applicable to the four courses in world culture/language. Health Communication (Sponsored by the humanities department)</p><p>Communication <ref type="formula">305</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE FAITH AND REASON HONORS PROGRAM</head><p>The Faith &amp; Reason Honors program establishes an arena for academically advanced students to explore questions and examine ways in which to integrate faith and culture. This highly selective and competitive program offers opportunities for challenging, reaching, and learning beyond the traditional curriculum. Through this program, students build strong, lasting, and meaningful relationships with senior faculty at DeSales University.</p><p>The four-year honors program includes three major components: Liberal Studies seminars, cultural experiences, and an Honors Thesis.</p><p>Liberal Studies seminars are one-credit learning experiences about fundamental questions that pervade human life, including conversations about the human person, God, the world, beauty, truth, and goodness. The seminars meet weekly and are hosted by one or more senior faculty members who select readings chosen from classical and contemporary texts that reflect a variety of academic disciplines. Students who participate in the seminars regularly and actively receive an "A" for the course and one credit for each seminar. Honors students complete six seminars, which fulfill two free elective requirements toward graduation. (Credits earned for these seminars do not fulfill any General Education requirements.)</p><p>Cultural experiences involve off-campus learning opportunities. Honors students are required to participate in at least one experience each semester of the program. These experiences include trips to museums, lectures, shows, historic sites, and other places of cultural interest.</p><p>The Honors Thesis is the culmination of the program. Under the direction of a faculty advisor, honors students research and write a 30-to 50-page paper. Students earn three credits for this work as an "independent study" course. Students present their work publicly during the annual Honors Colloquium. The best thesis each year, as judged by the Review Committee of the Salesian Center for Faith &amp; Culture, receives the annual "Faith &amp; Reason Award."</p><p>Participation in the honors program is by invitation and application only. Each fall semester, invitations to apply to the program are extended to members of the Freshman class who have received presidential or trustee scholarships. Applications require a letter of intent from the student and a recommendation from a faculty member or the student's academic advisor. Only 15 students are admitted to the program each year.</p><p>Honors students who complete all components of the program have their participation noted on their university transcripts and receive special recognition of their accomplishment at the Commencement exercises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIME-SHORTENED DEGREES</head><p>There are no rigid time requirements for the DeSales University degree. It is possible for a superior student to shorten the time ordinarily required to complete the undergraduate degree by as much as one year. This can be done by taking advantage of the various credit-by-examination procedures, the overload policy, and by attending college during the summer months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SECOND DEGREES</head><p>DeSales University will grant a second baccalaureate degree to students who have already received a baccalaureate degree from DeSales University or another accredited institution, and who wish to earn a degree in a different major field of study.</p><p>To be eligible for admission to this program, the student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 from the first institution. In addition, the department chair and/or division head of the new major must accept the student into the second degree program (some departments have specific limitations, e.g., business) and approve the student's program of study.</p><p>To graduate from this program, the student must satisfy the requirements of DeSales University's General Education Core and the requirements of the academic majors, in accordance with the DeSales course-transfer policy. The student must complete at least ten three-credit courses toward the second degree at DeSales University; at least five of these courses must be in the major field of study. Graduates of DeSales University must complete a minimum of ten three-credit courses beyond the conferral date of their most recent DeSales degree. The student also must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 both in the major field of study and in all courses taken at DeSales University. (Students who have graduated from DeSales University under the old curriculum will be seen as having completed the General Education Core for the purposes of this policy.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACCELERATED POST-BACCALAUREATE PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS</head><p>Accelerated post-baccalaureate professional programs grant professional degrees <ref type="bibr">(and/or certification)</ref> in preparation for professional licensure to individuals already holding undergraduate degrees. DeSales University offers an accelerated post-baccalaureate BSN program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM</head><p>Juniors and seniors whose cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or better may, if they choose, take one course per year of independent study. Each department regularly lists one 3-credit course, usually numbered 499, for independent study.</p><p>The student who wishes to matriculate in this course must develop an independent study project, secure a project advisor, who, for day students, must ordinarily be a full-time faculty member, and obtain the approval of the project advisor, the department chair, and/or the division head, and the dean of undergraduate education before registration for the term in which the student intends to complete the project. These approvals must be obtained on an official form available in the academic affairs office or online. Successful completion of the course will consist of fulfilling all requirements and satisfying the standard of evaluation previously agreed upon by the student and his or her project director. The course designation and number and the project title will be entered on the student's transcript when successful completion has been certified by the project advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUTORIALS</head><p>At times a student may wish to take a course which is listed in the Undergraduate Catalog but which is not scheduled to be offered in a given semester. The student may ask a full-time faculty member (usually the one who offers the course) if he/ she is willing to offer the course tutorially. If the faculty member agrees, the student completes the Application for Tutorial form available in the academic affairs office or online, obtains the appropriate signatures, and submits the form to the registrar at the time of registration. (A tutorial differs from an independent study project because a tutorial is simply a different mode of offering an already existing course, while an independent study project requires the student and the faculty member to design a new project.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC POLICY REGARDING INTERNSHIPS</head><p>Internships are elective, planned, and supervised learning experiences that take place outside the classroom, preferably at off-campus sites, for which academic credit is granted as an added dimension of the student's academic major. The program is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors who have completed course work that, in the judgment of the faculty supervisor, is required by the nature of the internship proposal. If a student's GPA falls below a 2.5, they are seeking more than 3 credits, or they will be put at a course overload, they will need additional signatures as designated on the application form. Students must be in good academic standing and not on academic probation to be approved for a credited internship. If their GPA falls within the 2.0-2.49 range, it is up to the discretion of the department chair/division head and the dean of undergraduate education to approve or not approve your internship for academic credit.</p><p>The Career Development Center staff and/or the student's faculty supervisor can assist the student in identifying possible internship sites. Assignments and duties of the student intern should constitute a new, meaningful, and challenging experience. Menial tasks must not comprise the major part of the internship. Questions should be referred to the coordinator of experiential learning or the student's faculty supervisor.</p><p>The coordinator of experiential learning administers the program's policies and procedures. The Career Development Center staff can provide assistance to the student in preparing a resume and in interviewing with the sponsoring employer. The faculty supervisor ensures that the internship is a worthwhile experience. This is done, in part, by carefully reviewing the student's learning contract containing the internship's objectives and methods for evaluating student performance. The employer supervisor at the work site develops a description of the student intern's job responsibilities and project assignments, provides orientation and job training for the student, supervises the student's work, and completes a final evaluation of the student's performance. An offer letter should be provided by the employer.</p><p>All students must attend a mandatory orientation where they will sign an agreement with the Career Development Center that states their understanding of program requirements and will receive a packet with the required paper work and due dates. All students must complete an internship application and submit a resume and offer letter/e-mail before they can be registered by the registrars office for an internship. In addition, students must be enrolled in the college's student accident insurance plan or have similar coverage under a family or personal accident insurance plan. All students must register for internships according to the registration deadlines posted in the Undergraduate Catalog (typically the last day for dropping and adding courses).</p><p>It is assumed that students are not paid for internships. In cases where salary may be provided to the student, the faculty supervisor and coordinator of experiential learning must concur that the learning objectives and nature of the internship are satisfied first rather than salary consideration.</p><p>Internships are ordinarily limited to three credits (one course) per semester, and a student may not register for the same internship in successive semesters. Internship proposals for more than three credits during the regular academic year must include additional complex job responsibilities and must be approved by the student's department chair and the dean of undergraduate education. Credits awarded are based on the following number of total hours worked during the internship and all internships are graded pass-fail:</p><p>3 credits (1 course) -135 to 150 hours total 6 credits (2 courses) -270 to 300 hours total 9 credits (3 courses) -405 to 450 hours total 12 credits (4 courses) -540 to 600 hours total ACCESS students may complete an internship with their current employer with the approval of the faculty supervisor, department chair/division head, and coordinator of experiential learning. In order for the internship to be approved, the following criteria must be met:</p><p>1) The proposed work experience must be different from his/her current day-to-day job 2) The student must be supervised by someone other than his/her current immediate supervisor Traditional students taking internships during the fall or spring semester will be charged the appropriate full-time or parttime rate. Traditional students taking internships during the fall or spring that preclude them from taking courses on campus (e.g., due to location or time frame) will still be charged the appropriate traditional day rate. Traditional students taking internships in the summer will be charged the ACCESS rate. ACCESS students taking internships during the fall, spring, or summer will be charged the ACCESS rate.</p><p>Students must provide their own transportation to internship sites.</p><p>Exceptions to any of the program's prerequisites and requirements are referred to the department chair/division head and the dean of undergraduate education for final determination and decision. Requests for exceptions must be made before the time of registration for an internship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DUAL MAJOR</head><p>A student who wishes to major in two areas is responsible for designing a program of studies which satisfies the degree requirements for each of these majors. The appropriate department chair or division head must approve the student's program of studies, designating one area as the official major, which determines the degree (BA or BS). The degree will be awarded only in the official major. Upon completion of all the graduation requirements of the other major, a notation will be made on the student's permanent record. DeSales University does not guarantee that the student can complete the dual major in four years, and its completion may require additional semesters. The student who takes advantage of this option will be assigned a separate academic advisor for each major. After degree conferral, a dual major may be added within one year. Students who seek to add a dual major after graduation, however, may not be eligible for additional financial aid.</p><p>If either major is within the Division of Business, at least five courses used to meet the requirements of the second major must be distinct from the courses used to meet the requirements of the official major. A triple major consisting of three Division of Business majors is not permitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERNATIONAL STUDY (STUDY ABROAD)</head><p>DeSales University encourages qualified students to study abroad. Currently, the University offers the opportunity to study in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, and Monaco. Detailed information about these and other programs are available from the Office of International Learning. Study abroad must be planned well in advance and receive the approval of the appropriate division head and the student's academic advisor, the director of financial aid, and the director of international learning.</p><p>Certain regulations governing the status of foreign institutions, the acceptance of creditable courses, the relevance to a student's objectives and major field of study, the student's academic record, foreign language competence at least at the intermediate level, and other factors must be thoroughly explored before permission for the year, semester, or summer session is given. Study abroad opportunities during the academic year are usually open to students who have at least sophomore or junior year status, and ordinarily a 2.75 cumulative GPA overall. Students interested in study abroad must plan early, review their plans with their academic advisor and the director of international learning, and observe the deadlines published by the Office of International Learning.</p><p>Information about financial aid procedures is available from the director of financial aid and through the Office of International Learning. Please note that DeSales University merit-based scholarships/grants that are non-need related are not applicable to the cost of study abroad for programs not offered by DeSales University, but need-based aid is applicable. Students who study abroad for a semester but enroll in a course at the University will be assessed a tuition charge at the part-time traditional undergraduate rate per credit hour.</p></div>

Detailed information about this program is available from the program coordinator, Professor Elizabeth Rosa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS</head><p>The programs listed below are offered as certificate programs. These are available to students who desire a systematic knowledge in one or several areas related to their current interests and plans. For complete details about the objectives and requirements of these certificate programs, students should contact the ACCESS office.</p><p>Business </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</head><p>DeSales University does not consider extracurricular activities as a body of exercises totally distinct from the academic program, but views them rather as an integral part of the liberal education which it offers. It sees and encourages participation in extracurricular activities as an opportunity for exercise in the skills and attitudes which it endeavors to impart to the student through its academic program. Viewed in this context, extracurricular activities form an integrated and significant element in the academic program of DeSales University. Student publications and debating provide opportunities for exercise in the skill of intelligent self-expression; intramural athletics furnish occasions for the exercise of skills learned in the physical training program; social events advance the development of the student's social personality; attendance at lectures supplements the general cultural training received; and religious activities provide the opportunity for the concrete expression of that total religious commitment which the theology program of DeSales University seeks to inspire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC RESOURCES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Advisement Program</head><p>Individual attention is one of the major benefits offered by DeSales University to its students. DeSales University's Student Advisement Program constitutes a major part of this benefit. The program's purpose, simply stated, is to help each student as an individual in every way possible to derive maximum benefit from the educational experience here. This means the advisor counsels the student in effective methods of learning and seeks to remove any known obstacle <ref type="bibr">(academic, disciplinary, psychological, personal)</ref> to the learning process by appropriate referrals.</p><p>Each advisee is assigned an advisor in his/her department. Students who have not declared a major are assigned to an advisor who works specifically with students in the exploratory studies program. Exploratory studies students remain with the same advisor until they declare a major. Efforts are made to provide continuity, vis., to keep the same group of advisees with the same advisor over their sophomore, junior, and senior years.</p><p>One of the advisor's major responsibilities is academic programming. While the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling all course requirements belongs to the student, students should always consult their advisors for guidance in academic matters. At a minimum, advisees must meet with their advisor once per semester to discuss course registration for the following semester and to receive registration clearance. However, students are encouraged to schedule additional appointments with their advisors as needed. The student advisement program is under the supervision of the director of the academic resource center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Resource Center</head><p>The Academic Resource Center (ARC) offers a wide variety of services to assist undergraduate students (traditional, ACCESS, and accelerated BSN) in achieving their academic goals. These services include peer or professional tutoring in specific subjects, and assistance with essays and research papers via the Writing Center. Assistance with general academic skills such as study techniques, reading comprehension, and time management is also available for traditional day students. The ARC also sponsors workshops for all students on methods of studying more effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Services-Gateway To Success</head><p>Gateway To Success (GTS) is a program designed to help underprepared students adjust to the academic rigors of university life. It provides support in areas such as academic advising, curriculum planning, goal setting, tutoring, and student development.</p><p>First-year students complete a summer program during which they are oriented to the campus and prepared for the University's academic requirements. These students participate in social events, academic workshops, and career programs. Staff members also help students to emerge as campus leaders and to graduate with marketable skills. Candidates for this program are identified during the admissions process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISABILITY SERVICES</head><p>In accordance with federal law, a "person with a disability" is defined as a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The Disability Services Office (DSO) works closely with students who self-identify as having learning disabilities, physical disabilities, psychological disabilities, temporary injuries, food allergies, and/or other medical conditions. Specifically, the DSO collaborates with students, faculty, and pertinent campus offices in order to ensure equal access to University programs, services, and activities.</p><p>Policies and procedures have been developed to provide students with as much independence as possible and to promote self-advocacy. We offer strategies and sessions in effectively transitioning into the higher education environment, executive functioning skills, time management and organizational skills, study skills, note taking skills, and appropriate coping strategies.</p><p>DeSales expects that students who plan to attend the University will have already acquired compensatory strategies. Students with disabilities, similar to their peers without disabilities, must be qualified based on all academic and non-academic criteria for admission to the University, continued enrollment, and graduation from the University.</p><p>The process begins with an interactive dialogue between the DSO and the student to determine appropriate and reasonable accommodations. Accommodations are not retroactive. The university does not provide, nor is financially responsible for personal care attendants.</p><p>All questions, documentation, and requests concerning academic, residential, or dining accommodations should be addressed with the Disability Services Office. For more information, please contact the DSO or visit www.desales.edu/disability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Grievance Procedure</head><p>DeSales University has an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and their implementing regulations.</p><p>Section 504 states that "no otherwise qualified individual in the United States, shall, solely by reason of his/her handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." <ref type="bibr">(PL 93-112, 2973)</ref> Complaints should be addressed to the Section 504 compliance officer who has been designated to coordinate ADA compliance efforts:</p><p>Mr 3. An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of complaint. The Section 504 compliance officer shall conduct the investigation. This investigation shall be an informal but thorough investigation, affording all interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relative to a complaint. 4. A written determination report as to the validity of the complaint and a description of the resolution, if any, shall be used by the Section 504 compliance officer and a copy of the report shall be forwarded to the complainant no later than 60 days after the complaint is filed. 5. The Section 504 compliance officer shall maintain the files and records of the DeSales University relating to the complaints filed. 6. The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for reconsideration should be submitted in writing within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the determination report to the provost of DeSales University. 7. The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed here under shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of an ADA complaint with the responsible federal department or agency. Use of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. 8. This procedure shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons to meet appropriate due process standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARS</head><p>The DeSales University High School Scholars Program enables high school students to take college courses for credit, tuition free, on the University campus. Highly talented and motivated students who are nominated by their high schools may take one day course during the regular fall and/or spring semester, on a space-available basis. This high school/university articulation program promotes communication and cooperation between basic and higher education while enriching and expanding the curriculum for students capable of completing college courses while still in high school.</p><p>Complete application information, including conditions and procedures, is sent to local high school guidance counselors each semester. Students are nominated by their high school guidance counselor, principal, or a screening committee designated at their school. Each participating school may nominate at most two students and two alternates per semester.</p><p>The chairs of the departments offering the requested courses review the applications and recommend acceptance or denial to the associate dean of academic life. A department chair may request a personal interview or telephone conversation with the student applicant. The department chair determines the student's placement on the basis of the student's course request, course enrollments, and the student's background. After reviewing the student's application and the chair's recommendation, the associate dean of academic life will notify the student and the nominator as to his decision. DeSales University will endeavor to accommodate qualified applicants, but it cannot guarantee admission to the requested courses. Ordinarily, the student will be limited to one course per semester.</p><p>The student will not be charged tuition but will be responsible for the cost of textbooks, laboratory fees, and other course materials, if applicable, and transportation. Participants will be expected to adhere to the attendance policy of the course and to the University calendar. The course must be taken for a letter grade, not for pass/fail or audit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIGH SCHOOL DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM</head><p>The DeSales University Dual Enrollment Program enables high school students, juniors or seniors, to take college courses for credit at a reduced rate. Available courses include both online and on-campus options. An online application, eligibility criteria, course offerings, and updated costs are all available at www. desales.edu/dualenrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS</head><p>A freshman is a regular student who has satisfactorily completed fewer than eight courses that carry a minimum of three credit hours each.</p><p>A sophomore is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least eight courses (3 or more credit hours each) but fewer than 18 courses and 54 credits.</p><p>A junior is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least 18 courses (3 or more credit hours each) but fewer than 29 courses and 87 credits.</p><p>A senior is a regular student who at the beginning of the fall or spring semester has satisfactorily completed at least 29 courses (3 or more credit hours each) and at least 87 credits.</p><p>A regular student is one who is matriculated in a degree program on either a full-time or part-time basis.</p><p>A full-time student is one who carries 12 or more credit hours in any given semester.</p><p>A part-time student is one who carries fewer than 12 credit hours in any given semester.</p><p>A special student is one who, whether full-time or parttime, is provisionally accepted and has previously attended college. A special student in the day program who desires to follow a degree program may be given a maximum of two semesters to earn status as an accepted student. The amount of time granted will be determined by the Admissions Committee at the time of the student's admission as a special student. A special student who fulfills the stipulations in his/her letter will be notified by the director of admissions that his/her status has been changed to accepted. If the student fails to achieve the minimum requirements outlined in the Admissions Special Student letter, the student will not be permitted to continue at the University. Once the student has been admitted as a regular student, the credits earned as a special student may be applied retroactively to the degree program.</p><p>A provisional student is one who is taking courses fulltime at the University but is provisionally accepted, and has had no previous college experience. Provisional students become accepted students after the successful completion of two semesters at the University, fulfilling the minimum requirements outlined in the Provisional Student letter. If these provisions are met, the student is notified by the director of admissions that his/ her status has been changed to accepted, and the courses already taken will be applied to the degree. If the student fails to achieve the minimum requirements after two semesters, the student will not be permitted to continue at the University.</p><p>A Continuing Education or ACCESS student has a different primary role from that of the traditional student. The circumstances that surround the life of the ACCESS student ordinarily demand involvement in primary life roles other than education and necessarily divide the student's energies. Usually, ACCESS students are beyond the traditional college age and/or have greater independence and more responsibilities outside of education than the traditional student. ACCESS students typically are homemakers, workers, or retirees, and do not live in the residence halls. They normally restrict their use of college services to the ACCESS Office, registrar's office, treasurer's office, classrooms, library, computer center, snack bar, and bookstore. Participation in the LVAIC cross-registration program is specified in the section entitled Interinstitutional Cooperation. Once students are accepted into ACCESS, they are ordinarily not permitted to take courses at other colleges for transfer purposes except as noted in the policy on Supplemental LVAIC Cross-Registration or unless special circumstances are noted and approved in writing by the executive director of ACCESS. However, courses from other colleges can be transferred into ACCESS at the time of admission providing the courses meet DeSales University criteria. The right to classify students (e.g., as regular day, special, or ACCESS) is reserved to DeSales University. Day students whose status has changed and who desire to be reclassified as Continuing Education or ACCESS students must submit a written request to the office of enrollment management. This request must usually be documented with a letter from the student's employer specifying that the student is employed full-time and receives a full benefit package, or tax returns showing that the student's parent(s) or guardian(s) do not claim the student as a dependent. A reclassification is not retroactive but takes effect at the beginning of the next semester or session that follows the letter of reclassification. Those who are classified as Continuing Education or ACCESS students qualify for the ACCESS tuition rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDENT RECORDS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Annual Notification of Rights Under FERPA</head><p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. They are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position; a person or company with whom the University has contracted; a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official in performing his or her responsibilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directory Information</head><p>The University may use its discretion to disclose directory information about students upon request unless specifically informed by the student in writing that this type of information should not be released. Written requests to withhold the release of directory information must be submitted to the Office of the registrar no later than September 15. This request will be honored for one year. Written notice must be received annually to renew this request.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE PASS-FAIL OPTION</head><p>Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take courses under the pass-fail option under the following conditions: 1. This option may be used for only one course per semester taken as a free elective, or for an internship. ACCESS sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take free elective courses under the pass-fail option. For ACCESS students, this option may be used for only one course per semester 2. The pass-fail option requires the approval of the student's academic advisor and of the course instructor (except for internships, as stated below). 3. Neither mark, PO (pass) or FO (fail), is computed in the student's grade point average. The mark of PO indicates that the student receives full credit for the course toward gradu-ation; the mark of FO indicates that he or she has failed the course and must repeat it, or an equivalent, under the usual procedures. 4. Students may not take any courses required for a minor under the pass-fail option. A student may switch from pass-fail to letter grade (or from letter grade to pass-fail) within one month of the first day of a given term with the permission of the instructor, the academic advisor, and the dean of undergraduate education. For courses in ACCESS sessions, deadlines for changing from credit to pass-fail (or pass-fail to credit) are indicated on the ACCESS calendar. Students taking these courses must adhere to the deadlines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AUDITING</head><p>An auditor is permitted to attend lectures and, with the permission of the instructor, to take part in class discussions. The auditing student does not, however, take examinations, receive grades, or earn credits. For full-time students, there is no additional tuition for auditing a course. For part-time students, the tuition is approximately one-half that charged per credit hour (applicable course fee will be charged at approximately half the normal fee). A course audited may not be used for credit or repeated for credit unless approved in writing by the associate dean of academic life. The approval of the instructor in the course to be audited and of the student's academic advisor must be secured for a student to audit any course. The instructor may request of the associate dean of academic life that an auditor be officially withdrawn from the course whenever it is clear that the student is not profiting from the course or that the auditor's presence in the class is interfering materially with the learning process of the other students. A student may switch from audit to credit (or from credit to audit) within one month of the first class day of a given term with the permission of the instructor and the academic advisor. For courses in ACCESS sessions, deadlines for changing from credit to audit (or audit to credit) are indicated on the ACCESS calendar. Students taking these courses must adhere to the deadlines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATTENDANCE POLICY</head><p>Students are expected to attend classes regularly. If absences do occur (for whatever reason), it is the student's responsibility to make up whatever work has been missed. Instructors are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent. Freshmen are limited to twice as many absences as credits are given for a particular course. An absence on class days preceding and following a holiday is counted as a double absence. In cases where classes meet twice per week for 75 minutes each, the first absence shall be counted as a single absence, the second as a double absence. If the class meets once per week for a three-hour period, a single absence is counted as three absences. ACCESS students should also refer to the attendance policy in Section 6 below.</p><p>Upperclassmen who are on academic probation automatically become subject to the attendance regulation for freshmen. Freshmen and upperclassmen on academic probation who are absent more than twice the number of credit hours in any subject in one semester may be barred from examinations and may forfeit credit in that subject at the discretion of the instructor.</p><p>Regular class attendance for sophomores, juniors, and seniors is encouraged, but not compulsory except as noted below. They are, of course, responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the courses they take. DeSales University presumes that upperclassmen will be mature and responsible enough to understand that voluntary regular attendance at classes is necessary if course requirements are to be fulfilled adequately.</p><p>Permission to make up missed examinations or laboratory exercises may be given at the discretion of the instructor. Students who miss an announced quiz or examination may be given an "F" for that quiz or examination at the discretion of the instructor. Faculty may stipulate, with the approval of their division head, their own absence policy for courses subscribed by upperclassmen. Faculty who set forth such a policy must publish it in writing to all the students whom it affects at the beginning of the course to which it applies. No such policy, however, may be more restrictive than that which is applicable to freshmen. An instructor may ask a student to justify excessive absences. Permission to make up laboratory assignments, studios, quizzes, announced tests, or examinations may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NO-SHOW POLICY</head><p>Students are required to attend class to confirm their enrollment at DeSales University. This includes logging in to Blackboard and attempting assignments for on-line classes prior to the drop/add deadline following the first week of class. Students reported as no-shows by their instructor will be dropped from class and are ineligible for financial aid funding for such courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE REPORTS</head><p>Instructors submit a progress report for each student to the registrar's office in the middle of each semester. Final reports are submitted at the end of a semester, and these final grades become part of a student's permanent record.</p><p>Midterm grades are issued only to traditional students and are not part of the student's permanent record. Final grade reports are issued to all traditional day students and ACCESS students on the dates indicated on the official Academic Semester Calendar. Final grades become part of a student's permanent record. Grade reports are posted on student WebAdvisor accounts and are not mailed. However, if a student wants a hard copy grade report mailed to his/her permanent address, the student must click the "Mail Grade Report Request" link under "Academic Profile" WebAdvisor by the drop/add deadline each semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA)</head><p>The student is required to maintain a specific grade point average to be in acceptable academic standing, to maintain financial aid eligibility, and to graduate. The grade point average is calculated in the following way:</p><p>The quality points per course are determined by multiplying the number of credit hours <ref type="bibr">(1, 2, 3, etc.)</ref> by the number of quality points assigned to the grade received (e.g., A = 4.0 quality points). The sum of the quality points received for all courses is then divided by the number of credit hours attempted.</p><p>Quality points per course = credit hours multiplied by quality points.</p><p>Grade Point Average = sum of the quality points of all courses divided by the number of credit hours attempted.</p><p>Only courses for which a letter grade is given are computed into the grade point average. Only the higher grade is counted for a repeated course. Courses accepted in transfer are awarded credits not grades or quality points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEAN'S LIST</head><p>The Dean's List is published each semester. To be eligible for this list, a day or ACCESS-by-day student must have taken no fewer than 12 credit hours (excluding pass/fail and audited courses) and attained a grade point average of 3.5 or better during the semester in question. A student with a grade of Incomplete for a given semester is not eligible for the Dean's List for that semester until the Incomplete has been removed. Special students are not eligible for Dean's List.</p><p>ACCESS evening students are recognized on an ACCESS Dean's List when they have earned 9 credit hours (excluding pass/fail and audited courses) and attained a grade point average of 3.5 in fall, spring, and summer semesters.</p></div>

Students with fewer than 24 credit hours attempted whose cumulative GPA is greater than or equal to 1.25 but under 1.50 will receive an academic warning.</p><p>In the case of transfer students, the number of courses and credit hours transferred will be added to the number of courses and credit hours attempted at DeSales University to determine the applicable minimum cumulative grade point average.</p><p>All students are expected to achieve acceptable academic standing. Students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing will be placed on Academic Probation and this will be noted on their transcripts at the end of the fall and/or spring semesters. Students who fail to achieve acceptable standing for two consecutive semesters are subject to review by the Academic Regulations Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS</head><p>Academic probation constitutes a formal warning to students that they are no longer in acceptable academic standing because their academic work has fallen below the standards set forth above or because they have received a grade point average below 1.00 in their last semester (fall or spring). Students who have either fallen below the standards set forth above for two consecutive semesters or have received a grade point average below 1.00 for one semester are liable for dismissal from the University. These students must appear before the Academic Regulations Committee, convince the committee that they would benefit from another semester at the University, and be approved for return by the dean of undergraduate education to continue their studies. Students who have either fallen below the standards set forth above for one semester or have been permitted to return to the University as a result of an appeal to the Academic Regulations Committee are given one additional probationary semester to achieve acceptable academic standing. If they fail to accomplish this, they are liable for dismissal. During this additional semester they are on academic probation. Probationary status for a completed fall or spring semester cannot be revoked or changed by subsequently using summer or winter coursework to alter a student's GPA. Students on academic probation are subject to the following regulations: 1. Students on academic probation are not eligible to participate on a DeSales University intercollegiate sports team. 2. Students will be strongly encouraged to reduce their course load to four courses during any probationary period. 3. Students on academic probation are strongly encouraged to consult with their academic advisor on a monthly basis during any period of probation. Failure to consult with the advisor will be a major criterion for determining grounds for dismissal. Advisors will review students' academic progress and at the same time provide assistance in academic or related matters to help students return to acceptable academic standing. 4. Probationary students will be restored to good academic standing if, at the end of the probationary semester or next summer session, they meet the standards indicated above. Such students may also take Summer Session courses at DeSales University and be restored to acceptable academic standing before the probationary semester begins if they meet the same standards. 5. If at the end of one probationary semester students have not achieved acceptable academic standing, but, in the opinion of the Academic Regulation Committee, they have a reasonable chance of attaining acceptable academic standing, one additional probationary semester will be allowed. 6. Students who have received a warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be liable to dismissal. 7. Upperclassmen who are on academic probation are subject to the same class attendance policy as freshmen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR ACCESS STUDENTS</head><p>All ACCESS students are expected to achieve acceptable academic standing as defined above. ACCESS students who fail to achieve acceptable academic standing will be placed on Academic Probation and this will be noted on their transcripts at the end of the fall and/or spring semesters. Students who have received a warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters will be liable to dismissal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OVERLOAD</head><p>An overload of one course (of three or more credits) per semester may be permitted, subject to the approval of a student's academic advisor, provided that the student has achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. An overload of two courses per semester may be permitted, subject to the approval of the advisor, provided that the student has achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or better. For the purposes of this policy, three one-credit courses taken during a semester will be considered an overload unless one of these is a P.E. course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COURSE WITHDRAWAL POLICY</head><p>A student may drop any course during the first week of each semester. In the event of such a drop, the course is not listed on his or her permanent record. Subsequent withdrawal (withdrawal with permission) requires the approval of the registrar's office for traditional day students, or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students. The last day for withdrawal with permission is the date published in the Academic Semester Calendar, which appears at the end of the Undergraduate Catalog. The last date for dropping or adding courses is also published in the Academic Semester Calendar.</p><p>If a student withdraws with permission, he/she will be given a grade of either W, WP or WF, at the instructor's discretion. The grade given in such instances will become part of the student's permanent record but will not be used in the computation of his or her grade point average. Withdrawal after the course withdrawal deadline results in a failure (F).</p><p>By withdrawing from a course, a student may put himself/ herself in jeopardy of losing financial aid or of not graduating on time. If withdrawing will result in a total course load of fewer than 12 credits or if the student has withdrawn from courses in the past, then it is strongly recommended that the student speak with a staff member in the financial aid office before submitting a withdrawal form. The student may also want to speak with his/her advisor about summer courses or overloading to graduate on time. A student is not officially withdrawn from a course until the student has submitted the signed Approval Form to the registrar's office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPEAT COURSE POLICY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Repeat of Failures</head><p>a. If a student fails a course and then repeats it with a passing grade (excluding pass/fail grades), both the original failure and the repeated grade appear on the transcript but only the higher grade is used in the calculation of the GPA. b. If a student fails a course which was failed before, only one failure is calculated on the transcript. Ordinarily a student may repeat a course only once, but in case a student twice fails a course required for graduation, the student may petition the advisor and the dean of undergraduate education to be allowed to take the course a third time. 2. Repeat of a course in which a "C-," "D" or "D+" was earned. Any course in which a "C-," "D" or "D+" was earned may be repeated once provided the student has permission of the academic advisor. Both grades will be recorded on the transcript but only the higher grade will be used in the calculation of the GPA. 3. A course in which a grade higher than a "C-" was earned may not be repeated (except in 4 below). 4. All nursing students are required to achieve a grade of C+ or higher in all nursing courses. Any nursing student who receives less than a C+ can repeat a maximum of only one nursing course one time throughout the BSN curriculum. All nursing courses must be repeated at DeSales University. Any nursing student who is eligible to repeat a required pre-requisite science, mathematics, psychology, or nursing course has the opportunity to do so in accordance with this "Repeat Course Policy" and the nursing progression policy, provided they have met the 2.75 cumulative GPA requirement at the end of the spring semester. 5. Grades earned in repeat courses completed at Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg and Lehigh through the LVAIC cross-registration policy may replace the previous grade in the calculation of GPA, though both grades will appear on the transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAKE-UP OF FAILURES</head><p>Failures of required courses must be made up by repeating the course with a passing grade at DeSales University or with a minimum grade of C-at another institution. Prior approval to take any course for transfer credit at another institution must be obtained from the associate dean of academic life, in accordance with the transfer course approval policy directly below. Grades earned in repeat courses completed at Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg and Lehigh through the LVAIC crossregistration policy may replace the previous grade in the calculation of GPA, though both grades will appear on the transcript. For courses repeated elsewhere, the transfer grade will not be computed in the student's GPA. DeSales University will not transfer course work completed at any institution unless the grade earned is at least a C-.</p><p>Make-up of Failures Received in Senior Year: An instructor may permit a student who has received a failure for a course taken in either semester of the senior year to take a re-examination in that course. Such re-examination must be completed no later than one week before Commencement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSFER COURSE APPROVAL</head><p>Prior approval for all transfer courses completed elsewhere must be secured from the associate dean of academic life if the student wishes to transfer the work to his/her program at DeSales, using the form available in the academic affairs office or via MyDSU. The approval column must be signed by a department chair or division head only in cases where a course is required for the major. The student completes this form, secures departmental or division signatures where applicable, and presents it for approval to the associate dean of academic life with a catalog description of the course to be taken. Individual courses will be evaluated in accordance with the undergraduate transfer policy, which can be found in Section 4 below. This procedure need not be followed for courses taken at DeSales University.</p><p>At the conclusion of the course, the student must request that an official transcript be sent from the other college or university to the DeSales registrar's office. Transfer credit is granted only for courses in which the student earned a grade of C-or better. The DeSales registrar's office validates the approval transfer of credit. Transfer of grades is allowed only if a student cross-registers at one of the LVAIC institutions (Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg, and Lehigh). For classes at those institutions, a student must complete a cross-registration form, available at the registrar's office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHANGE OF MAJOR</head><p>The change of major is a formal procedure. The student should obtain the signature of his/her present academic advisor and then take this form to the registrar's office. If the student plans to follow a specific track or concentration in the new major, the track or concentration must be listed. The registrar's office will circulate the form to the department chair or division head of the new major for his/her approval. The department chair or division head sends the form to the registrar's office. The student will receive a confirmation of the change of major via e-mail from the Academic Resource Center (ARC). The graduation requirements for the major are determined by the catalog year in effect at the time of the student's official acceptance to the major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREDIT BY EXAMINATION</head><p>Full-time and part-time undergraduate students who have acquired substantial knowledge in certain subject areas may apply for permission to verify this knowledge by examination, and consequently receive credit. Credit by examination may be earned for any course unless specifically excluded by the offering department (e.g., Education 101: Academic Literacy and Strategies; English 100: An Introduction to Academic Writing; Mathematics 107: Mathematics for Teachers I: MOT/ Mathematics, Mathematics 109: Survey of Mathematics, Mathematics 110: Finite Mathematics, and Mathematics 111: Probability and Statistics; and the 101-102 level of a foreign language). Students should check with individual departments and/or divisions concerning other courses not open to credit by examination. An examination is always required, but other forms of evaluation may also be required by a department and/or division, e.g., written, laboratory, studio, or other type of evidence as is normally required by students who are regularly enrolled in the course.</p><p>Interested students may obtain from the department and/ or division titles of books normally listed in the course syllabus or other information as to course content. Students who believe they have the necessary knowledge, preparation, or background to establish credit by examination shall make application to the appropriate department chair and/or division head no later than the end of the third week of the term. If, in the opinion of the appropriate department chair and/or division head, the student has a reasonable chance of establishing credit, the student, by no later than the close of the term, shall arrange for the examination together with satisfactory completion of all course assignments and requirements demanded by the department. The nature of the examination given shall be entirely the decision of the department chair and/or division head in consultation with members of the department.</p><p>No course in which the student has at any time previously been registered for either credit, auditing, or enrichment purposes may be challenged under this program. A student attempting credit by examination shall not be entitled to formal instruction in the subject matter of the course. Ordinarily, a student may attempt only one challenge examination per semester.</p><p>Before the examination the student will choose one of two methods of evaluation: 1. The student may request that the examination be assigned a specific letter grade. In this case the student may accept or decline the grade made. If the student accepts, the grade will be placed on the student's permanent record. If the student declines, the grade will not be recorded, but the student will forfeit any further credit by examination opportunity in the course and receive no credit. 2. The examination may be evaluated as Pass or Fail and recorded on the permanent record if passed. Failures will not be recorded on the student's permanent record, but the student will forfeit any further credit by examination opportunity in the course and receive no credit. A $75 administrative fee is required of all full-time traditional students. All other students, including ACCESS students, are required to pay 30% of the tuition to sit for the exam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP)</head><p>DeSales University offers a student the possibility of receiving credit by examination through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). A new or matriculated student may receive up to 75 credits (25 courses) for demonstrating college-level competency on these exams developed by the Educational Testing Service. Credits earned through CLEP are considered transfer credits (See Transfer Policy). By recognizing college-level achievement learned through employment experiences, purposeful private study, military-industrial-business training, or advanced work in high school, this program gives the student an opportunity to reduce the cost of a degree at DeSales University in terms of time and money. DeSales University has been designated as a CLEP Testing Center. CLEP examinations are computer-based and students obtain their scores immediately. Only scores sent directly from CLEP to DeSales University are considered official and will be accepted.</p><p>The CLEP examinations are of two types, the General Examinations and the Subject Examinations. Both types measure the knowledge and understanding of factual information, as well as the ability to see relationships and apply basic principles to new situations. These examinations are based on typical college courses offered across the country.</p><p>CLEP General Examinations. The five CLEP General Examinations measure material often covered in the first two years of college as part of a general liberal arts requirement. The examinations in humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and history are 90-minute multiple choice tests. It is important to realize that the CLEP General Examinations are analogous to end-of-the-year exams and require more than a cursory knowledge of the subject area. 1. A student is eligible to take any or all of the General Examinations if he or she has not taken or transferred more than one course in the specific areas covered by the exam or exams. 2. If the minimum acceptable score is received on a General Examination, the student will receive six credits. These credits fulfill General Education requirements, where applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLEP Subject Examinations:</head><p>The CLEP Subject Examinations measure the achievement of principles, concepts, and knowledge from specific college courses. All of the Subject Examinations are 90-minute multiple choice tests. Depending on the particular test and the score obtained, a student may earn credit for one or two courses. 1. A student may take any of the Subject Examinations anytime before graduation, provided the student has not taken that course for credit or audit. 2. Course credit earned from the Subject Examinations can be used to satisfy General Education requirements, where applicable. 3. A student must have the permission of his or her department chair and/or division head to test out of major requirements. CLEP Examinations may be repeated three months after the first administration. No CLEP Examination may be taken more than twice.</p><p>Students who are interested in the CLEP Examinations should inquire at the ACCESS Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVANCED PLACEMENT</head><p>Students seeking advanced placement must take the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examination(s) in the subject(s) involved. Only the results of the first administration of each examination can be considered as a basis for granting credit, i.e., students may not retake exams until they achieve a satisfactory score. In addition, all examination results to be considered for advanced placement and/or credit are to be submitted before the applicant's matriculation in DeSales University. Only scores sent directly to DeSales University from the College Board are considered official and will be accepted.</p><p>Students who achieve scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the Advanced Placement Economics: Macroeconomics Examination will receive 3 credits in place of EC 209; and those students who achieve scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the Economics: Microeconomics Examination will receive 3 credits in place of EC 210.</p><p>DeSales University abides by the following policy with regard to the Advanced Placement Examinations in English Language and Composition and Literature and Composition: a score 1, 2, or 3, no advanced placement or credit; a score of 4, the student is awarded 3 credits for EN 103 and is exempt from that course; a score of 5, the student is awarded 6 credits for EN 103 and EN 104 and is exempt from both courses.</p><p>Entering students who achieve a score of 3 on the World Language Advanced Placement Examination (e.g., French or Spanish) will receive 3 credits for 201 (Intermediate, one semester); they will be required to take one additional language course.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEPARATION FROM DE SALES UNIVERSITY</head><p>2) The registrar will determine the official withdrawal date and mark it on the form. d. Students not currently on campus should contact the registrar to request a Withdrawal Form. e. Withdrawal after the deadline will result in a failure <ref type="bibr">(F)</ref> for all courses registered in that semester. The official withdrawal deadline for each semester is listed in the academic calendar. f. Given that the last date of attendance before a withdrawal may impact a student's financial responsibilities, it is recommended that a student interested in a withdrawal speak directly with the Bursar's Office and/or Financial Aid Office for additional information about the implications for their tuition and financial aid. Students granted "honorable withdrawal" and who have not taken any courses at another institution during their separation from DeSales may return to DeSales University without further formal action by the Committee on Admissions. However, students must submit a written request for readmission to the registrar, or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students, no later than one month before the beginning of the term for which readmission is sought.</p><p>Students who have taken courses at another institution during their separation from DeSales must apply for admission through the admissions office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Withdrawal on Probation</head><p>Students who are on probation for academic reasons and who wish to withdraw from the institution should complete a Withdrawal Form available in the Registrar's Office, and designate "Withdrawal on Probation" as their reason for doing so. Students who wish to return to DeSales University after "withdrawal on probation" must apply to the Committee on Admissions. If students who left DeSales University while on academic probation are readmitted by the Committee on Admissions, they will be given the option of declaring one semester of "academic bankruptcy" at the time of their readmission. A note will be entered on the record to indicate that the student has declared "academic bankruptcy" for that semester. Total credits earned and cumulative grade point average will be recomputed excluding all effects of the "bankrupt" semester, and the student will renew academic work at DeSales University with this revised grade point average and total credits earned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Leave of Absence</head><p>Students who are not on probation and who must or wish to interrupt their education may apply to the associate dean of academic life or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students for a leave of absence. The application should contain the reasons for requesting the leave of absence and an estimate of its duration, usually not to exceed one year. Ordinarily, leaves are not approved after the withdrawal deadline. Moreover, students must fulfill conditions a, b, and c under No. 1 Honorable Withdrawal above. Students who are majoring in nursing and wish to apply for a leave of absence must also comply with the "Leave of Absence from the Nursing Program" policy detailed in Section 8 of the Undergraduate Catalog under the Nursing major heading.</p><p>Students granted a leave may return to DeSales University without further formal action by the Admissions Committee but must submit a written request for readmission to the associate dean of academic life no later than one month before the beginning of the term for which readmission is sought. If the authorized period for the leave of absence has expired without an approved request to extend the leave, the student must reapply for admission through the admissions office.</p><p>Given that the last date of attendance before a leave may impact a student's financial responsibilities, it is recommended that a student interested in a leave speak directly with the Bursar's Office and/or Financial Aid Office for additional information about the implications for their tuition and financial aid. Questions about housing should be addressed to the residence life office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Academic Dismissal</head><p>DeSales University reserves the right to dismiss a student for academic reasons whenever there is clear evidence that the student is no longer deriving benefit from its educational program. A student is always liable to dismissal: a. If the student has received the warning of academic probation for two consecutive semesters; b. If the student achieves a grade point average of less than 1.00 in any semester of any year, regardless of whether or not his or her cumulative grade point average is thereby brought below the minimum non-probationary standard. A list of students "liable to dismissal" is presented by the dean of undergraduate education or the assistant dean of lifelong learning for ACCESS students to the Committee on Academic Regulations at the end of each semester. The decision to dismiss rests with this committee, subject to the approval of the provost/vice president for academic affairs. The words "Academic Dismissal" appear on the official transcript of a student who is dismissed for academic reasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Reinstatement</head><p>Students who are required to withdraw for academic reasons are ordinarily not eligible for reinstatement until they have successfully completed 8 courses (24 credits) at an accredited institution of higher education. Reinstatement is not automatic; rather students must reapply to the college and submit all required application documents. Students will be evaluated by the Admissions Committee to determine if the student has met the qualifications to be reinstated at the institution. If readmitted, students may request one semester of "academic bankruptcy."</p><p>Before the student is reinstated to the University, the student's bursar account will be checked. If an outstanding balance exists, the student must clear the account before being permitted to return.</p><p>Before the student is reinstated to the University, the student's disciplinary record will be checked. Any violations of the student code of conduct will be taken into consideration as part of the admission's decision.</p><p>Financial aid eligibility will be determined based on demonstration of need, filing by the deadlines, and availability of funds. Additionally, students must meet financial aid satisfactory academic progress standards to be eligible for financial aid. For more information regarding academic progress, refer to section 4-A "Financial Aid" of this catalog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Suspension and Expulsion</head><p>Occasionally students are separated from the University for non-academic reasons. Usually the letter of suspension or expulsion clearly states the conditions of the action taken by the University and the possibilities for further association with the University. Please consult the Student Handbook for a fuller explanation of these types of separation from the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS IN FALL/SPRING ACCESS COURSES</head><p>If courses are not offered in the day session, limited seats may be available for traditional day students in hybrid ACCESS courses under unusual circumstances. The student must request an exception by submitting a completed Approval Form (available in MyDSU under the Forms and Documents heading as well as in the academic affairs office) to the dean of undergraduate education. If registration of an ACCESS course is allowed the following regulations apply: 1. Traditional day students may not take online ACCESS courses during the fall or spring semesters. 2. Normally, no more than five (5) seats will be available per hybrid class 3. Courses during Sessions 1 through 4 are considered as part of their five-course load. They may also overload courses, if they qualify, in these sessions on a space-available basis.</p><p>4. Registration for ACCESS courses must be completed by the date for changing or adding courses as indicated on the academic calendar for each day semester. Permission to withdraw from a day course and add an evening course after the date for changing and adding courses is granted by the dean of undergraduate education only by way of exception and for serious reasons, e.g., serious illness. The desire merely to improve one's GPA or to avoid a failure is not a good reason for granting this exception. 5. Permission to withdraw from evening credit courses must be obtained from the student's academic advisor and from the director of the academic resource center. Withdrawal from evening credit courses will follow the applicable deadlines for these courses, which are published on the ACCESS calendar, available online. 6. After the date for changing or adding courses, traditional day students are not permitted to withdraw from a day course and add an ACCESS evening or weekend course during Sessions 2 or 4. 7. Students enrolled in ACCESS courses must follow the ACCESS calendar for those courses in all respects. This is especially important for breaks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS IN SUMMER/ WINTER ACCESS COURSES</head><p>Traditional day students who want to take ACCESS summer and winter session courses must register for them in WebAdvisor and pay the appropriate tuition. The tuition for summer courses is due before the summer course begins and cannot be deferred until the fall semester. The tuition for winter courses is due before the winter course begins and cannot be deferred until the spring semester. These courses may not be considered part of a fall or spring course load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS IN GRADUATE COURSES</head><p>Ordinarily, full-time students who have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and have senior status may enroll in graduate courses while fulfilling the requirements for an undergraduate degree. Ordinarily, they may register for no more than two graduate courses at a time and may accumulate no more than nine graduate credits unless specifically required by the program. The students must have the permission of their division head (or his/her delegate), the appropriate graduate program director, the dean of undergraduate education, and the dean of graduate education. Departments which sponsor accelerated programs may establish criteria which are more stringent than those delineated above.</p><p>Ordinarily, students may not carry an overload course during a semester or session in which they are enrolled in a graduate course. Students may not take the graduate course(s) for a Pass/Fail grade. Registration is on a space-available basis. All prescribed course sequences and all prerequisites must be followed. Full-time undergraduate traditional day students who register for both undergraduate and graduate courses as part of their five course load pay no additional tuition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES FOR TRADITIONAL DAY STUDENTS</head><p>To prepare all students to engage in future online educational opportunities as a form of lifelong learning, DeSales University offers full-semester online courses specifically for traditional day students. Traditional day students, with the exception of first-semester freshmen, may register for as many as two of these online courses in any fall or spring semester, provided that they do not exceed a total of two such courses during the entirety of their undergraduate program.

Formal lecture notes incorporated into your work; 6. A computer solution developed by someone else</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cheating</head><p>Dishonest acts that give any student an unfair advantage are considered cheating. The following acts will be deemed acts of cheating, though the list is not exhaustive: 1. Using materials not specifically allowed by the instructor during the taking of an examination, test, or quiz; for example, a. Use of material written by another student either with or without his or her knowledge; or b. Use of crib notes, no matter by whom prepared; or, c. Use of texts and/or supplementary marginal notations in texts; or, d. Use of notes written on the surface of the desk at which examination is being taken; or, e.

Willfully aiding or abetting any act of cheating and/or plagiarism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Unacceptable Behaviors</head><p>A number of unacceptable behaviors cannot properly be termed either plagiarism or cheating, yet they are also prohibited. The following acts are considered acts of unacceptable behavior, though the list is not exhaustive. 1. Misuse or abuse of Trexler Library resources, including but not limited to: a. Unauthorized removal of library resources; b. Hiding library resource materials of any kind within the library; c. Defacement or mutilation of library resources (e.g., underlining, highlighting, or removing paragraphs or pages); 2. Copying right-protected print or non-print materials beyond accepted norms; 3. Falsifying the reason for an absence from class; 4. Misrepresenting yourself, or allowing yourself to be misrepresented, by means technological or otherwise; for example, a.

Logging in to an online learning environment (e.g., an online course or learning management system) using someone else's credentials, or allowing someone else to log in using your credentials; 5. Misrepresenting the number of hours completed and/or the tasks completed in a credit-bearing experience (e.g., internship, research, practicum, clinical rotation, etc.); 6. Withholding knowledge of an incident of cheating or plagiarism from the individual instructor to whom the work is submitted.</p><p>Procedures 1. The faculty member or, when appropriate, university professional staff member, who discovers or is made aware of a case of plagiarism, cheating, or unacceptable behavior will, on his/her own initiative and in a manner he or she deems appropriate, normally resolve the situation with the student in a private, one-on-one setting. The faculty/staff member may alternatively choose to resolve matters in consultation with the appropriate administrator (the dean of undergraduate education, in the case of undergraduate students; the dean of graduate education, in the case of graduate students).</p><p>2. When a faculty/staff member and student meet to resolve a case of plagiarism, cheating, or unacceptable behavior, the faculty/staff member, having previously determined that the case before him/her is beyond question a proven and unmistakable offense, will present his/her position, hear the student's position, and in the end, may determine that ignorance on the part of the student warrants only a warning to the student. If, however, he/she determines a degree of guilt on the part of the student, he/she is empowered to levy any one of the following sanctions: a. grade penalty for the individual assignment b. grade penalty for the course c. failure in the course.</p><p>In the case of library violations, temporary suspension or permanent loss of library privileges may be levied. 3. The faculty member will compose a letter stating the nature of the offense as well as the sanction imposed. The faculty/ staff member will send the letter to the student and will send a copy of the letter to the appropriate administrator to be kept on file. Should there be an appeal, any subsequent actions in regard to the incident will be duly recorded by the appropriate administrator. 4. Should it be determined that this is a second offense involving this student, the incident will then be resolved by the appropriate administrator in conjunction with the faculty/ staff member. In such cases, the appropriate administrator's decision for resolution may supersede the original decision of the faculty/staff member, when made without knowledge of the first offense. 5. In the case of a second offense, the administrator will solicit written statements from the faculty/staff member and the student in question. He/she may then meet with the student and/or faculty/staff member for any needed clarification. 6. On the occasion of a second offense, the vice president for academic affairs may impose the penalty of dismissal from the University. 7. In the event a faculty/staff member and appropriate administrator working in consultation determine that an egregious breach of academic ethics has been committed, the student may be liable for dismissal from a major, a program, or the University, even on the first offense. 8. When the appropriate administrator reaches a decision, he/ she will inform the student of that decision in writing and will also inform the student of his/her right to appeal the decision and/or the severity of the sanction before the full Academic Affairs Committee. The faculty/staff member involved also will have the right to appeal. The appropriate Academic Affairs Committee (undergraduate or graduate) will hear all appeals-undergraduate, graduate, ACCESS, and faculty. 9. The words "Academic Dismissal" appear on the official tran-script of a student who is dismissed for academic reasons.</p></div>

Senior citizens may enroll in courses for enrichment, audit, or credit; and must meet the necessary prerequisites.</p><p>All applicable academic regulations will be in effect for such students. Proof of age is required at the time of registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSFER STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATES</head><p>DeSales University has a tradition of serving transfer students and helping them to continue their academic program and complete their degree. Transfer students must complete 15 courses at DeSales University and 5 of those courses must be related to the major for a DeSales University degree to be transferred. For majors in the Division of Business, at least three of these five courses must be in the specific major and be at the 300-level or higher. In addition, sport management majors may only count one course (3 credits) of SS 450 toward this requirement.</p><p>To be eligible for general transfer admission to DeSales University, students should have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 (2.5 preferred) on a 4.0 scale. Certain programs, such as education and nursing, require a higher GPA for admissions. The theatre and dance programs require an audition. Transfer students interested in the physician assistant program or doctor of physical therapy (DPT) program must first complete a bachelor's degree at a regionally accredited institution. During or after their senior year, students can apply to DeSales' Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) program or the DPT program. Students must satisfy the prerequisite course work for the physician assistant program or DPT program during their undergraduate program.</p><p>Students who have registered for 24 or more credits at any post-secondary institution should apply for admission as transfer students. Students who have registered for fewer than 24 credits are considered freshmen with college work and should follow the traditional admissions procedures.</p><p>To apply for admission, it is necessary to: 1. Complete and submit the application form found at desales. edu/apply. 2. Ask the registrar's office at each post-secondary institution attended to forward a copy of the official transcript <ref type="formula">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNDERGRADUATE TRANSFER POLICY</head><p>The following regulations govern the transfer of credits into DeSales University. In all cases, transfer courses must be documented by an official transcript. In some cases, additional information, including syllabi, course descriptions, or other supporting materials may be required. 1) With the exception of internships, all 3-credit courses taken at institutions accredited by the following regional accrediting bodies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or by the U. DeSales, provided that the student achieved (a) a minimum cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average) of 2.0 for all courses presented for the DeSales degree and (b) a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 for courses required in and offered by the major at DSU. If the student has not satisfied both (a) and (b), the student's courses will be evaluated individually, and only courses in which a C-or higher has been earned will transfer into DeSales. 4) A student must complete at least 15 courses of three or more credits at DeSales to earn a degree from DeSales. A student can transfer a maximum of 25 courses of three or more credits into DeSales. A minimum of 40 courses of three or more credits are required to earn a DeSales degree. 5) A student must complete 5 courses in the major at DeSales.</p><p>(There are several professional programs, e.g., nursing and education, that have additional requirements imposed by their individual accreditation agencies. Please check with the chair or director of those DeSales programs.) 6) All nursing (NU) courses with a required laboratory or clinical component must be completed at DeSales. For additional information, refer to the Nursing heading in Section 8 of the Undergraduate Catalog. 7) Only credit is transferred. The grades for transfer courses are not calculated in the student's DeSales GPA. An exception is that grades earned at LVAIC institutions (Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges: Lehigh University and Cedar Crest, Lafayette, Moravian, and Muhlenberg Colleges) via the cross registration process are included in the calculation of the student's DeSales GPA. Once courses have been transferred, they become part of the student's permanent record and cannot be removed. 8) Courses not using traditional letter grades (A-F) will be considered for transfer only if additional documentation detailing successful completion of the courses is provided. 9) Courses taught online or in a hybrid format will be accepted assuming they meet the criteria above. 10) DeSales courses are assigned as credit hours. Courses evaluated for transfer from colleges and universities with different systems (e.g., quarter hours, units) are converted into credits. 11) The dean of undergraduate education is responsible for the final determination of the acceptance or denial of transfer credit. 12) Depending on status at the time of admittance, students will be exempt from certain parts of the University's general education core as noted below:</p><p>Transfer with 8 to 17 courses If students enter at the sophomore level (i.e., have transferred 8 to 17 courses of 3 or more credits each), they are exempt from: a) MOT (Modes of Thinking) Philosophy b) MOT Social Science c) Composition and Rhetoric I (EN103) d) Composition and Rhetoric II (EN104), provided they have transferred at least one three-credit English composition course which included the writing of a research paper. If they have not written an acceptable research paper, they must take Composition and Rhetoric II. e) World Cultures I f) World Cultures II g) PE 100 + two activities courses (traditional day students only)</p><p>Transfer with 18 to 25 courses If students enter at the junior level (i.e., have transferred 18 to 25 courses of 3 or more credits each), they are exempt from the general education courses typically required in the freshman and sophomore years, namely: a) MOT Philosophy b) MOT Social Science c) Composition and Rhetoric I (EN 103) d) Composition and Rhetoric II (EN 104), provided they have transferred at least one three-credit English composition course which included the writing of a research paper. If they have not written an acceptable research paper, they must take Composition and Rhetoric II. e) World Cultures I f) World Cultures II g) Humanities I h) Humanities II i) MOT Mathematics j) MOT Natural Science k) MOT Literature l) Introduction to Catholic Theology m) PE 100 + two activities courses (traditional day students only) 13) Traditional day and ACCESS students are required to fulfill (either at DeSales or through equivalent courses taken at another institution) the remaining general education requirements, namely: a) Humanities III -Great Works of Art and Music b) Humanities IV -Great Works of Literature c) Intermediate Theology d) Values Seminar 14) Core-to-Core Agreement -The DeSales University general education core will essentially be fulfilled by the core of affiliated community colleges with a core-to-core transfer agreement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The funding of a DeSales education is the primary responsibility of the student (and parent[s] of dependent students). Resources are available to assist the student in meeting costs of higher education from the federal and state governments, DeSales University, and outside resources. It is the student's responsibility to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) yearly for consideration of the various financial aid programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY</head><p>Filing the FAFSA allows the federal government to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Office of Financial Aid will use the EFC to develop a financial aid package, based upon the student's need and available resources. Need is determined by subtracting the EFC from the Total Cost of Attendance (tuition, fees, room, board, books, personal, commuting, and living expenses).</p><p>The financial aid package specifies the types and amounts of assistance, including non-federal aid a student will receive to cover his or her education related expenses. Government and University funds are limited and the amount awarded to a student may not meet all financial need. Parents may apply for Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) and students may apply for Alternative Loans to fully fund up to the Total Cost of Attendance.</p><p>All awards are subject to revisions. Factors affecting a student's eligibility include changes in residency status or enrollment, and adjustments as a result of the verification process. If an adjustment of an award is made, the student will be notified and advised to access their financial aid information through the student portal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCEDURES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prospective Undergraduate Students</head><p>• Gather end of the year income information and documentation to prepare tax returns. Retain copies of all documentation sent to the IRS (1040, W2's, required schedules, etc.)</p><p>• Complete the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.gov as soon as possible after October 1. DeSales University's Federal School Code is 003986.</p><p>• It takes approximately 1-2 weeks for the results of the online FAFSA to reach DeSales University.</p><p>• For maximum consideration for institutional assistance, the FAFSA should be completed before December 1.</p><p>NOTE: Students do not have to be accepted by the University to complete the FAFSA. Upon deposit, the Office of Financial Aid will send a packet of information that will include an official award letter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Returning Undergraduate Students</head><p>Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. Students who have received aid are required to reapply each year. For renewal of aid, the FAFSA should be filed by May 1 for the upcoming academic year. Funding may be limited for those who file after this date.</p><p>For state grant consideration, students must submit the FAFSA and the appropriate state grant applications by the published deadlines of their home state agencies. (Pennsylvania residents must file the FAFSA by May 1 for State grant consideration.)</p><p>After the FAFSA has been processed and the Student Aid Report (SAR) is received, the Office of Financial Aid will provide an official award letter provided verification has been finalized (if applicable).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACCESS Students</head><p>Students enrolled in ACCESS have financial aid opportunities through the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Loan Programs. ACCESS students who reside in Pennsylvania may also qualify for a Pennsylvania State Grant. To award federal and state financial aid to ACCESS students, the ACCESS sessions have been grouped as follows:</p><p>Fall semester: Fall Day, Session 1 and Session 2 Spring semester: Wintermester, Spring Day, Session 3 and Session 4 Summer semester: May term, Session 5, Summer Minimesters, and Session 6 With the exception of the Federal Pell Grant program, students must enroll in at least six credits per semester to be eligible for financial aid. Please note that for financial aid purposes, CLEP, Challenge Exams, and/or Portfolio Assessment credits do not count toward the semester enrollment.</p><p>ACCESS students who enroll in classes during the traditional day semester will be charged a fee for doing so.</p><p>ACCESS students applying for financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).</p><p>To participate in the Federal Direct loan program, students must complete a master promissory note and entrance counseling. These processes are done online from the U.S. Department of Education website at www.studentloans.gov.</p><p>Students must present payment for courses taken until a financial aid deferment is approved by the Office of Financial Aid and the Treasurer's Office. Only after students have completed all forms, are enrolled, and their file is complete in the Office of Financial Aid, will they be sent a notice of financial aid eligibility. Financial aid can then be viewed via the MyDSU student portal.</p><p>Financial aid may not completely cover tuition. Students are responsible for costs accrued after financial aid (grants and/ or loans) has been credited to their accounts. ACCESS students receiving any financial aid at DeSales University will be reviewed for satisfactory academic progress toward a degree at the end of each semester.</p><p>The maximum time frame to obtain a degree using federal aid programs is approximately six years (or 12 full-time semesters). Pennsylvania residents may be eligible for a maximum of 8 semesters of state grant funds. ACCESS students are not eligible for university aid due to the reduced costs of the ACCESS program. No federal loans can be awarded retroactively to pay for past due balances. All questions should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VERIFICATION PROCESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verification Policy</head><p>The U.S. Department of Education selects a portion of all FAFSA filers for a review process called "Verification." Additionally, during the process of reviewing financial aid information at any time during the academic year, the Office of Financial Aid is required to question any inconsistent information by selecting the application for verification. If the student is selected by the Department of Education or by the institution, DeSales University will be comparing information from the FAFSA application with requested documentation submitted to the Office of Financial Aid. If a student/family chooses not to provide this information, they are advised that the University will be unable to administer any forms of federal aid and institutional need-based awards. If there are differences between the student application information and financial documents, the Office of Financial Aid may need to process corrections on the FAFSA once the changes have been finalized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verification Documentation</head><p>Students selected for this process may be asked to submit one or more of the following:</p><p>• A verification worksheet • For dependent students: the student's and the parent(s)' financial documents (IRS tax transcripts, W-2 forms, etc.) • For independent students: the student's and the spouse's (if applicable) financial documents (IRS tax transcripts, W-2 forms, etc.) • An expense/resource worksheet (if applicable) All information must be completed in its entirety, all documents signed as required, and submitted by the specified deadlines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verification Deadline</head><p>The deadline for each applicant depends on when financial aid application information is received. Verification and Missing A. FINANCIAL AID Document request letters are sent to students every week, after financial aid (ISIR) information is received. These letters are sent five times over a ten-week period. The final request notifies the student that s/he will not receive any need-based federal or institutional funding if the requested documents are not received by the date listed in the letter. This date is generally one week from the date the letter is generated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notification of Award Changes due to Verification</head><p>The method by which DeSales University notifies applicants if the award changes because of the verification process is to send an "Official Award Letter." Initially, the Office of Financial Aid sends first year students an "Estimated Award Letter." On that particular award letter, it is stated:</p><p>An Official Award Letter will be sent to you after you deposit with the Office of Admissions and all required documentation has been received and processed. All needbased awards are subject to change if you are selected for verification and/or discrepancies are found with finalizing your Free Application for Federal Student Aid.</p><p>Continuing students do not receive an Estimated Award Letter, but Official Award Letters are not prepared until after verification is completed and corrections (if needed) have been processed. If any overpayments were to occur, they would be reported to the Department of Education by way of the Overpayment reporting option on the National Student Loan Database (NSLDS) system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS</head><p>To retain eligibility for federal and institutional financial aid, students must maintain satisfactory progress in their academic program, and they must be in good academic standing. Students are required to complete 40 three-credit courses and are expected to average 5 three-credit courses per semester. While ACCESS students do not have these enrollment requirements, they are required to meet the same Satisfactory Academic Progress standards as outlined below.</p><p>Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each term for traditional day and ACCESS students. Students will be ineligible for federal and institutional financial aid when their academic progress fails to meet the following qualitative and quantitative requirements:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Assessment</head><p>Attempted Credits 12-23 24-47 48-62 63+ Min. Cumulative GPA 1.5 1.6 1.8 2.0</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Assessment</head><p>Attempted Credits 12-23 24-47 48-62 63-180* Completion Rate 50% 54% 58% 67%</p><p>Any additional students who are placed on Academic Probation because of failure to meet the institution's Academic Standards based on a combination of attempted credits AND attempted courses will also be ineligible.</p><p>The completion rate is calculated as the number of passed courses (courses for which a student earned a passing grade) divided by the number of attempted courses (the total of earned courses, and courses for which a student has received a grade of W, F, FA, FO, WP, or WF). Courses dropped during the published 100% refund period and audited courses are not treated as attempted or earned courses. For courses that have been repeated, attempted and earned courses for all occurrences are included. For transferred courses, courses accepted will be included in attempted courses only for the purpose of determining placement in the charts above.</p><p>Regardless of cumulative GPA and completion rate attained at any time, students will be ineligible for federal and institutional financial aid when their total courses attempted exceed 150% of the credits required for their program (example: 120 x 150% = 180).</p><p>A degree audit is performed for any student who changes programs or pursues additional degrees. If a student has exceeded the maximum time frame based on total attempted courses, including transfer courses, additional time to attempt the remaining courses required for completion may be granted if courses already taken are not applicable to the new programs or if additional courses are needed to earn an additional degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Warning</head><p>Students not making satisfactory academic progress for the first time may receive one semester of financial aid on probation. The one time financial aid probation provides one term for a student to get back on track and regain eligibility. Students must attain satisfactory academic standing by the end of the semester for which they receive aid on probation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Probation</head><p>If a student finds himself or herself on academic probation or not making satisfactory academic progress in a subsequent semester, s/he may appeal to the Financial Aid Committee for one additional semester of financial aid on probation. In order for the financial aid committee to review a student's appeal the following information is needed:</p><p>• A written statement from the student explaining why s/ he was unable to achieve satisfactory academic standing; • A written plan outlining how he or she will achieve satisfactory academic standing that has been reviewed with an academic advisor; • One written letter of reference from the academic advisor or a SAP waiver request, on the student's behalf, from the dean of undergraduate studies.</p><p>Waivers may be granted due to serious illness, severe injury, or the death of a relative. The dean may grant an appeal one time under these circumstances only if it is possible for a student to mathematically meet the qualitative and quantitative program requirements within 150% of the published length of the program. While appeals are generally granted for only one semester, detailed multi-semester academic plans may be developed, on a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the dean of undergraduate education. If granted, academic plans are monitored each semester to ensure that the student meets all requirements. Students must meet all of the conditions of the academic plan in order to continue to receive financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Suspension</head><p>No appeal will be granted and other financial arrangements (such as an alternative loan and/or payment plan) must be used if a student finds himself or herself on academic probation and not making satisfactory academic progress in any subsequent semester after s/he has received a semester of aid on warning and a semester of aid on appeal or if s/he fails to meet the conditions of an academic plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progress for State Aid</head><p>Before crediting a State Grant to a recipient's account, the school must verify that, for the last academic year during which the student received state grant aid, the student completed the required minimum total number of credit hours for the terms to which grant aid was applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPEAL FOR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES</head><p>If a family's financial situation changes after the FAFSA has been filed due to the death of a custodial parent, separation, divorce, disability, or total loss of employment by one or both of the custodial parents, the student should write a letter of appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. The Office of Financial Aid will determine the appropriateness of the appeal and as deemed necessary request additional information throughout the process to have a complete assessment of the situation. Upon final review of the appeal, the family will be notified in writing of the outcome. Approved appeals may receive additional funds on a case-by-case basis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPECIAL PROGRAMS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Certification</head><p>Post baccalaureate students attending DeSales University and pursuing a teaching certification from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are eligible to apply for Federal Direct loans pending enrollment in 6 or more credits. Teacher certification is considered to be a fifth year undergraduate program and students who answer no to all the dependency status questions on the FAFSA will be considered dependent students. This means these students will be required to provide their parents' financial information on the FAFSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WITHDRAWAL AND REFUNDS</head><p>Students withdrawing from the institution must inform the registrar's office in writing. The official date of withdrawal for the purpose of a refund will be the last date of attendance as determined by the registrar.</p><p>Students withdrawing from the institution who are residence hall students and/or are on the University meal plan should consult the treasurer's office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RETURN OF FEDERAL STUDENT AID (TITLE IV) FUNDS POLICY</head><p>The Department of Education has established a policy determining the amount of Title IV program assistance that you can earn if you withdraw from school. The Title IV programs covered by this law include Federal Pell Grants, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, SEOG Grants, Direct and Perkins Loans, and Federal PLUS Loans.</p><p>When you withdraw during your payment period, the amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined by a specific formula. If you received (or your school or parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds. If you received more assistance than you earned, the excess funds must be returned by the school and/or you.</p><p>The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined on a pro rata basis. For example, if you completed 30% of your payment period of enrollment, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. Once you have completed more than 60% percent of the payment period, you earn all of the assistance that you were scheduled to receive for that period.</p><p>If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you may be due a post-withdrawal disbursement. If your post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, your school must get your permission before it can disburse them. You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds so that you don't incur additional debt. Your school may automatically use all or a portion of your post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition, fees, and room and board charges (as contracted with the school). The school needs your permission to use the postwithdrawal grant disbursement for all other school charges. If you do not give your permission (DSU asks for this when you enroll), you will be offered the funds. However, it may be in your best interest to allow the school to keep the funds to reduce your debt at the school.</p><p>There are some federal financial aid funds that you were scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because of other eligibility requirements. For example, if you are a first-time, first-year undergraduate student and you have not completed the first 30 days of your program before you withdraw, you will not receive any Direct loan funds that you would have received had you remained enrolled past the 30th day.</p><p>If you receive (or your school or parent receives on your behalf) excess Title IV program funds that must be returned, your school must return a portion of the excess equal to the lesser of:</p><p>• your institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of your funds, or • the entire amount of excess funds. The school must return this amount even if it didn't keep this amount of your Title IV program funds.</p><p>If your school is not required to return all of the excess funds, you must return the remaining amount. Any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a PLUS Loan) repay in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. That is, you make scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time.</p><p>Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is called an overpayment. The maximum amount of a grant overpayment that you must repay is half of the grant funds you received or were scheduled to receive. You do not have to repay a grant overpayment if the original amount of the overpayment is $50 or less. You must make arrangements with your school or the Department of Education to return the unearned grant funds.</p><p>The requirements for Title IV program funds when you withdraw are separate from any refund policy that your school may have. Therefore, you may still owe funds to the school to cover unpaid institutional charges. Your school may also charge you for any Title IV program funds that the school was required to return.</p><p>Withdrawal date for Title IV purposes is defined as the date the student began the institution's withdrawal process, the student's last date of recorded attendance, or the midpoint of the semester for a student who leaves without notifying the institution if the last date of attendance cannot be established.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention ACCESS students:</head><p>If an ACCESS student has a Pell Grant, the sessions not yet begun will be discounted, and the Pell Grant will be reduced to the lower enrollment status before calculating the aid to be returned. Student loans are contingent upon a student being enrolled at least half time (6 credits) per semester. If you enroll and later drop classes that you have never begun so that your enrollment status falls below 6 credits, you are not eligible for a student loan that semester. If a loan disbursement was made before you dropped below half-time, that disbursement can remain. However, subsequent disbursements must be cancelled.</p><p>For financial aid purposes, a student who stops attending (or officially withdraws) at any point in the ACCESS semester is considered to have withdrawn, even if one or more classes have been completed with a passing grade. In other words, a student is considered to have withdrawn if he/she does not complete all days scheduled to complete within the semester. If a student is enrolled simultaneously in two courses within a Session and stops attending only one of those, it is not considered a withdrawal.</p><p>If a student officially drops classes that he/she has never begun attending before his/her withdrawal from the institution, those classes are not counted in the "days scheduled to complete."</p><p>The school must document completion of all courses with a passing grade. If there is no passing grade in the last scheduled course, the school must demonstrate the student completed the period.</p><p>The following questions and examples may help clarify this: 1. Did the student cease to attend before completing or fail to begin attendance in a course scheduled to attend? If yes, go to question 2. If no, it is not a withdrawal. 2. When ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in an enrolled course, was the student attending other courses? If yes, not a withdrawal. If no, go to question 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Did student confirm in writing attendance in a later</head><p>Session in the term? If no, student is a withdrawal. If yes, not a withdrawal if attendance is resumed in the later Session and the resumption of attendance is within 45 days of the withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 1:</head><p>Student has two 8 week sessions within a semester with two classes each session.</p><p>The student begins attendance in both courses in the first session but stops attending both after a few weeks. No written confirmation of intent to attend session 2 is received.</p><p>This student is a withdrawal and a Return of Tittle IV funds calculation must be performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 2:</head><p>Same scenario as above, but student stops attending only one of the two courses in the first session. The student is not a withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 3:</head><p>Same scenario as above. During the first session, the student withdraws from both courses in the second session, and he/she completes both courses in the first session with a passing grade. The student has not ceased to attend a course he was scheduled to attend because the course was dropped within the first module and before they began. So the student is not a withdrawal. However, recalculation of a PELL grant is required because he/she was paid for two courses that he/she never attended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 4:</head><p>Same scenario as above. The student begins attendance in both courses in the first session but stops attending both after six weeks. However, he/she provides a written confirmation of intent to attend session 2. The student is not a withdrawal unless he/she fails to begin session 2. If he/she fails to begin session 2, the withdrawal date and days of attendance are determined as if the confirmation of future attendance was never provided.</p><p>When a Return of Title IV funds calculation is required, the total calendar days used in the calculation include all days in which the student is scheduled to attend but does not count days of courses officially dropped before complete cessation of attendance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSCRIPTS OF CREDITS</head><p>In 1977, the ACCESS Program was established to serve the educational and career needs of working adults. This accelerated program was the first of its kind in the Lehigh Valley. In keeping with the mission statement of DeSales University, the mission of ACCESS is to provide lifelong learners with a liberal arts education and professional training according to Christian Humanist tradition, emphasizing excellence, individual attention, and program flexibility.</p><p>ACCESS uses a variety of delivery systems to extend programs and services to audiences from government, business, industry, organized labor, other agencies, and the general public. Programs and services are provided at times and places convenient to the individuals and groups being served and encompasses a variety of degree, certificate, and non-credit programs and services.</p><p>The academic program in the ACCESS division at DeSales University has four objectives: 1. To provide adults with opportunities for personal enrichment and satisfaction through the stimulation of intellectual and cultural growth; 2. To provide adults with the skills, knowledge and insights required to update and improve their vocational and professional performance; 3. To provide adults with information and understanding needed to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens in society; 4. To be responsive to the needs of communities in the Lehigh Valley and the organizations and agencies (public and private) that are located in these communities. For a variety of reasons, increasing numbers of adults are enrolling in lifelong learning programs to achieve their educational objectives. As a response to this need for lifelong learning, DeSales University offers ACCESS, a program which provides opportunities for adults to further their education through evening and day degrees and certificate programs. Credit for experiential learning may also be awarded through prior learning assessment. Programs and services from ACCESS are available during the day, evening, and weekend on a year-round basis to all persons who can benefit from further education.</p><p>ACCESS offers adult learners the possibility of achieving their educational objectives in a convenient, flexible, and student centered environment. Students may select from the following variety of program options to earn a certificate or a bachelor's degree:</p><p>• Ten sessions starting throughout the year, face-to-face and online; • Evening classes meeting once per week;</p><p>• Fall and spring traditional day courses; • Two 6-week online summer minimesters; • One 3-week May term; • One 3-week online winter minimester; • One-credit workshops</p></div>

Admission into the ACCESS program is limited to students for whom education is no longer the major focus in their lives. Information about admission, registration procedures, and deadlines for the diverse programs and courses can be obtained directly from the ACCESS Office.</p><p>ACCESS students who desire to transfer credits for academic work done at other postsecondary institutions must have official copies of their transcripts sent to the ACCESS office as soon as possible.</p><p>Before applying, students should schedule an appointment with an advisor to develop an appropriate and individualized education plan.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BSN Program Student Learning Outcomes</head><p>Students who graduate from DeSales University with a major in nursing will be able to: 1. exemplify Christian humanism through valuing and facilitating full human development; 2. assist persons to make ethical and moral health care decisions; 3. integrate best evidence into clinical practice; 4. demonstrate intellectual curiosity, rational inquiry, problemsolving, and creativity when applying the nursing process to individuals, families, aggregates, communities, and populations with health needs; 5. advocate for changes in the practice of nursing and the delivery of health care that promote improved health outcomes; 6. coordinate and manage interdisciplinary and community resources to meet changing health needs of individuals, families, aggregates, communities, and populations; 7. demonstrate leadership and flexibility by assuming multiple roles in order to facilitate the competent delivery of health care; 8. safely and effectively integrate technological and scientific advances into cost-effective nursing care; 9. provide culturally competent nursing care to persons with diverse backgrounds and needs; 10. communicate effectively and therapeutically using a variety of media and methods.</p><p>Philosophically, the nursing program adheres to the University's belief that there is a Christian way of being human. Nursing as a caring, comforting and nurturing art and as a science based on inquiry and established principles reflects Christian beliefs. Nursing courses are rooted in the tenets of Salesian Christian humanism in which persons are viewed holistically and nursing action aims to foster each person's full physical, intellectual, moral, social, aesthetic, and spiritual/religious development. The goals of nursing include health promotion, maintenance, restoration, and palliation.</p><p>The undergraduate nursing major prepares the graduate for general practice at a beginning professional level in nursing and provides a knowledge base for graduate study and an awareness of the need for life-long learning. Upon successful completion of the undergraduate nursing program of study, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is granted. A four-year academic program is offered in a traditional day format and in an eveningweekend format. An Accelerated BSN Program is offered for students who have already completed a baccalaureate degree in a non-nursing major.</p><p>Academically qualified traditional students may be eligible for direct admission into one of the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) programs through the Nurse Scholars Program or Accelerated Direct Entry BSN + MSN Program (Accelerated BSN Plus). Traditional students must fulfill all requirements for the BSN degree before attaining status as graduate students. MSN programs prepare students to pursue advanced practice nursing specialties, including family nurse practitioner, psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, adult gerontology clinical nurse specialist, or adult gerontology acute care nurse practitioner. MSN degree options also include forensic nursing with certification in investigative forensics, nursing informatics with certification in healthcare information management, and nurse executive via the dual MSN/MBA program (students interested in the dual MSN/MBA program must apply separately to the MBA program for admission consideration; acceptance into the MBA program is not guaranteed).</p><p>The baccalaureate degree program in nursing, master's degree program in nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice program, and post-graduate APRN certificate programs at DeSales University are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://www.ccneaccreditation.org).</p><p>Admission into the nursing major from the freshman year assures placement in clinical nursing courses, provided that the student remains in "Acceptable Academic Standing" as outlined in Section 2 of the Undergraduate Catalog. This series must be completed before April of the freshman year. Completed health requirement forms must be submitted before starting courses in the sophomore year. Some documents may need to be updated on a yearly basis. Associated costs of examinations and immunizations are the responsibility of the student. Additionally, students must comply with all items included in the "BSN Clinical Requirements" section of the Undergraduate Catalog, as well as all items in the Pre-licensure BSN Student Handbook. 5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy Major Program</head><p>Liberal arts education has traditionally placed strong emphasis on the importance of philosophical reflection for the formation of the human person. The philosophy program at DeSales University recognizes this fact and strongly promotes it. This program seeks to encourage the development of the intellectual and moral virtues, helping students not only to think clearly about reality and to know the greatest truths, but also to understand how to conform their practical activity to this knowledge; philosophy at DeSales regards the entire person in his or her humanity. This program is designed to enable students to see philosophy as a dialogue among persons seeking truth, and to promote personal participation in that search. The philosophical insights that result from this search should help students to discriminate and relate the different kinds of knowledge that make up the sum of human learning, and hence enable them to interpret their study of the sciences and the humanities in their significance for the human race. This training takes place within the Christian intellectual tradition and DeSales University's dedication to Salesian spirituality and Christian Humanism.</p></div>
