<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accreditation and Affirmative Action Statement</head><p>Notre Dame College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission as a degree-granting institution. Other college accreditation, program approvals and affiliations include: Notre Dame College upholds the policy that there shall be no discrimination against any student, faculty or staff because of race, color, religion, national origin, age or disability. The fees, programs, and requirements contained in this catalog are necessarily subject to change without notice at the discretion of Notre Dame College. It is the student's responsibility to know and follow current requirements and procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission Statement</head><p>Notre Dame College, a Catholic institution in the tradition of the Sisters of Notre Dame, educates a diverse population in the liberal arts for personal, professional and global responsibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statements of Purpose</head><p>Notre Dame College engages students, staff and the wider community in the educational experience. Those who choose a Notre Dame education are encouraged to develop these values and skills:</p><p>• Thinking logically, analytically and creatively • Communicating effectively in speech and in writing • Demonstrating mastery of an academic discipline • Choosing wisely for health and well-being • Appreciating the fine arts • Integrating Judeo-Christian values into their lives • Pursuing their personal spiritual development • Sharing talents and gifts in the spirit of friendship and compassion • Engaging in the lifelong search for truth, beauty and justice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Catholic Identity Statement</head><p>Given the saving death and resurrection of Jesus, Notre Dame College sees itself as having a mission within the Church to extend Christ's loving, saving activity in the world. The Gospel serves as guide and goal.</p><p>• We live in a way that communicates that we are confident that life has meaning.</p><p>• We believe that in some way each of us is called to serve others and contribute to the "common good" in our immediate relationships and as a participant in the larger global community. • Each one of us is called in Christ to respond to the fullness of gifts we have been given in the Spirit.</p><p>• As we exercise the gifts of the Spirit, we recognize the responsibility to live an honest, ethical and moral life so that our daily circles of influence are consistently marked in sometimes subtle or dramatic ways by the Notre Dame College mission.</p><p>Notre Dame College understands the unique role a Catholic College plays in the 21st century American culture. Committed to our Catholic faith tradition of belief in God's creating, saving and sustaining love, we strive to daily live out the distinctive characteristics of a Catholic University identified by John Paul II. 1</p><p>We give evidence of Christian inspiration and commitment as individuals and as a college community by daily celebration of liturgy, active participation in Christian and ecumenical prayer and through our worship spaces, Christ the King and Regina Chapels.</p><p>In both formal and informal settings, faculty and students conduct their academic work and reflection in light of the Catholic faith "with due regard for academic freedom and the conscience of every individual." All undergraduates are required to take a scripture class, a social justice class and an ethics class in order to graduate. Students and faculty are committed to the ideals, principles and teachings of the Catholic Church. Students, staff and faculty are expected to develop and live a personal moral and ethical code that reflects the values of the Catholic tradition.</p><p>The mission of Notre Dame College calls faculty, staff and students to service of others through personal, professional and global responsibility. Students are involved in annual outreach including: Habitat for Humanity, immersion experiences and summer service projects. Both faculty and students make individual commitments to some local or national service project.</p><p>As a Catholic College, Notre Dame College was founded upon and continues to teach in light of our rich Catholic tradition and Catholic principles. Relying on our expansive intellectual heritage, Catholic intellectual life relies on a breath-taking body of works and treatise stretching "from Justin to Augustine to Lonergan, from Origen to Anselm to Teilhard, from Aquinas to Newman, to <ref type="bibr">Küng. 3</ref> Affirming the sacramental principle that the natural world as well as human culture can serve to mediate God's grace. This principle, as well as those that undergird our responsibility to educate for justice, reminds us of our call to participate in the transformation of the world in light of the human dignity of all persons.</p><p>Prizing pluralism. The Catholic faith consistently confirms its universality and catholicity as it embraces all people: young or old, believer or non-believer, from every nationality or social class with special gifts of specific challenges.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Notre Dame College</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Admission</head><p>To fulfill its mission, Notre Dame College encourages students of diverse religious, racial, educational and socioeconomic backgrounds to apply. Undergraduate admission decisions are based on a broad range of criteria. A prospective student may apply for admission up to a year prior to the semester or summer session for which admission is desired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission Requirements</head><p>Notre Dame College admits students who demonstrate potential for academic success. The credentials of each applicant are individually evaluated with consideration given to a combination of previous academic records, standardized test scores and evidence of potential to succeed in college. The College has a very fair and generous policy on the transfer of academic credit earned at regionally accredited colleges or universities. Course work completed more than five years ago at a regionally accredited college or university is evaluated on a course-bycourse basis. Notre Dame College reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant who does not meet its admission standards. Recognizing that the needs of a diverse student body are equally diverse, Notre Dame College has established alternative admission requirements for traditional, traditional transfer, adult and international degree-seeking and certificate-seeking students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Traditional Students</head><p>Traditional students are those students who have graduated from high school within four years of their first term of enrollment. A student planning to attend Notre Dame College should take the strongest possible college preparatory program available.</p><p>Notre Dame College requires the following credentials from each traditional student seeking admission:</p><p>• Application for Undergraduate Admission • Official high school transcript stating date of graduation, and • Official ACT or SAT I score report (optionalsee details below)</p><p>A test-optional policy is in place for applicable, first-time students. Any student with a 2.75 cumulative GPA and above at the end of his/her junior year, SAT and ACT scores are optional for admission to Notre Dame College. If the student chooses to submit his/her scores, we will consider them when reviewing the application.</p><p>Exceptions include homeschooled and international students. Athletes wishing to participate in a varsity sport must submit their SAT or ACT score to be considered for eligibility purposes. Also, if a student wishes to test out of entry-level English or Math, he/she must take the Accuplacer test or submit test scores.</p><p>The Admissions Office will implement a self-report admit strategy based on this new model. Self-reporting means that admit decisions are made on the basis of students' self-reported high school transcript and/or test score information, if applicable.</p><p>Academic transcripts must be submitted directly to the Office of Admissions by the issuing high school in order to be considered official. Upon receipt of all necessary credentials, one of the following admission decisions will be made:</p><p>Full Admission. Ordinarily, a student will be granted Full Admission when the following conditions have been met:</p><p>• 2.5 cumulative grade point average on a 4.0 scale, and • Minimum ACT score of 19/ SAT score of 900, or • Evidence of the potential for academic success as profiled on the academic transcripts and in a personal interview.</p><p>Provisional Admission. Traditional and international students will be granted Provisional Admission when the cumulative grade point average or standardized entrance examination performance falls below those standards necessary for Full Admission. A student admitted on a provisional basis will be limited to registering for no more than sixteen (16) credit hours during the first term of enrollment and will be required to use the services of the Dwyer Learning Center regularly. The student will meet with the Director of the Learning Center to develop an action plan in order to afford the greatest possibility for academic success. A student admitted provisionally is expected to achieve a 2.0 grade point average upon completion of the first term of enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Students</head><p>International students are those who legally reside in a country other than the United States. Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant F-1 Student Status, is issued by the Office of Admissions upon receipt of a signed Confirmation of Enrollment form. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) regulations require foreign students on a student visa to carry a full course of study during each term of enrollment at Notre Dame College in order to maintain F-1 student status while in the United States.</p><p>Notre Dame College requires the following credentials from each International Student seeking admission:</p><p>• Application for Undergraduate Admission for international students,</p><p>• Official academic transcript(s). (official translation required for any document in a language other than English), </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>Traditional Transfer Students are those who have graduated from high school within four years of their first term of enrollment and who have attended a regionally accredited institution of higher learning following high school graduation. Adult Transfer Students are those students 23 years of age and older who have graduated from high school five or more years prior to their first term of enrollment or who have earned a General Education Diploma (GED), and who have attended a regionally accredited institution of higher learning following either high school graduation or the completion of a GED.</p><p>• See page 40 for additional transfer policies Notre Dame College requires the following credentials from each transfer student seeking admission:</p><p>• Application for Undergraduate Admission • Official academic transcripts from each college or university previously attended and a • Personal interview with an Admissions Counselor • If you have completed less than 12 credit hours at a regionally accredited institution of higher learning than an official high school transcript is required Academic transcripts must be submitted directly to the Office of Admissions or The Finn Center for Adult, Graduate and Online Learning by the issuing high school and college(s) in order to be considered official. Upon receipt of all necessary credentials, one of the following admission decisions will be made:</p><p>Full Admission. Ordinarily, a transfer student will be granted Full Admission when the following conditions have been met:</p><p>• 2.5 cumulative grade point average on a 4.0 scale and • Evidence of scholarship and the potential for academic success as profiled on the academic transcript and in the personal interview.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Provisional Admission.</head><p>A transfer student will be granted Provisional Admission when his/her cumulative grade point average falls below those standards necessary for Full Admission. A student admitted on a provisional basis may be limited to registering for no more than sixteen (16) credit hours during the first term of enrollment. A student admitted provisionally will be expected to achieve a 2.0 grade point average upon completion of the first term of enrollment.</p><p>Denied Admission. A student may be Denied Admission when any requirement of admission is unmet and/or when there is a lack of evidence through evaluation of academic transcripts and/or a personal interview to support a student's ability to succeed in college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission</head><p>Students who have been absent from the College for one calendar year or longer must reapply for admission. For the purpose of readmission, one calendar year is defined as any consecutive combination of a Fall Semester, Spring Semester and Summer Session. The Dean of Admissions determines the official length of academic absence. Students seeking readmission are expected to follow the same admission process as those prospective students who will be attending Notre Dame College for the first time.</p><p>Students readmitted to the College must follow the Catalog requirements and academic policies in effect at the time of readmission regardless of the number of credits earned under a previous Catalog. Students who were on academic probation when they left the College will be on probation when they return. Students who were suspended for academic reasons must meet with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs before being allowed to return to Notre Dame College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Office for Professional Development Professional Development</head><p>The Finn Center Office of Professional Development at Notre Dame College offers flexibly scheduled face-toface and online courses covering a broad range of topics for those who want to attain or maintain certificates or licensure in a particular field, learn new job skills, or simply want personal enrichment.</p><p>Endorsement Programs 4 th /5 th Grade Endorsement Reading Endorsement Principle Licensure Endorsement Teacher Leader Endorsement (in cooperation with Instructional Delivery Services)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuing Education</head><p>Educators needing courses in graduate credit must seek approval from their Local Professional Development Committee (LPDC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Financial Aid</head><p>Financial assistance means freedom to choose a college based on academic programs rather than on cost. Notre Dame College believes in the philosophy that all qualified students should have the opportunity to attend regardless of personal financial situation. A student and his/her family, of course, are expected to contribute to the cost of education to the extent that they are able.</p><p>Notre Dame College's student financial assistance program is designed to help bridge the gap between direct cost and a student's ability to pay. We offer both need-based and merit-based aid to our students. All financial assistance is awarded according to the eligibility requirements set forth for each type of aid. Eligibility requirements vary considerably from fund to fund and are established by the funding agency or source.</p><p>All financial assistance can be divided into two broad groups: grants and scholarships or self-help. Grants and scholarships are forms of financial assistance that do not have to be repaid and that are generally based on need, academic achievement or other special attribute. Self-help aid must be either repaid with interest or earned through on-campus employment. Within the context of these two broad groups, Notre Dame College awards student financial assistance from three general sources: federal programs, state programs and private aid.</p><p>In order to receive federal or state aid, Notre Dame College requires students to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This need analysis report must be completed to determine a student's need as determined by the Department of Education. To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must be a United</p><p>States citizen or an eligible non-citizen (For more information, visit the Federal Student Aid website at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility/non-us-citizens). Additionally, a student must be enrolled in a degree seeking program and maintain satisfactory academic progress to receive financial aid, and be enrolled at least half-time to qualify for federal student loans. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources of Financial Aid</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy for Financial Aid</head><p>Federal regulations require that Notre Dame College establish and implement a policy to measure whether students applying for and/or receiving financial aid are making satisfactory academic progress (SAP) towards a degree. This regulation applies to all students applying for aid, whether or not financial aid has been previously received.</p><p>There are three measurements that are used to determine eligibility: (1) Grade Point Average, (2) Credit Hour Requirement, and (3) Maximum Time Frame. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements may result in loss of financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring of Academic Progress</head><p>Students' progress will be reviewed after grades are finalized for each semester and a determination of eligibility to receive financial aid for subsequent enrollment periods will be made. Although Notre Dame College will send notification to the student, the student is fully responsible for monitoring their own academic progress as it relates to financial aid eligibility. The student should review their grade report each semester and compare it to the standards set forth in this SAP policy to determine if they are meeting (or failing to meet) the established criteria.</p><p>Evaluations will be done in a timely manner; however the next semester may be in progress at the time the Financial Aid office is able to notify students of their ineligibility. Students who are concerned that they may not have met the requirements may contact the Financial Aid office during normal business hours.</p><p>Students will be notified via their Notre Dame e-mail account if they have failed one or more measurements. Students may complete an appeal process by following the directions located on the Notre Dame College website.</p><p>There are three (3) parts to the measurement:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Cumulative Grade Point Average Requirement: Reviewed Each Semester</head><p>Your cumulative grade point average (GPA) must be equal to, or higher than, the standard established by Notre Dame College. The specific requirements are as follows:</p><p>Undergraduate students 2.00 GPA 60 + hours attempted TEEL and RN to BSN students 2.00 GPA Throughout entire program; reviewed each semester Graduate students 3.00 GPA Throughout entire program; reviewed each semester</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Credit hour Requirement: Reviewed Each Semester</head><p>Undergraduates and TEEL Students: Students must successfully complete a minimum of 70% of the total number of hours for which they have attempted after the drop/add period (first week of the semester or subsession). First-time freshmen with less than 32 credit hours attempted need only complete 60% of their attempted credit hours. All courses for which the student is registered after the drop/add period of the semester are counted as an attempted course whether the student withdraws from, receives a failing grade for, or otherwise fails to complete the course. An accumulative (all attempted coursework) completion rate of 70% must also be maintained. To determine the number of credit hours required to successfully complete during the academic year or cumulatively to remain in compliance, multiply the number of hours for which the student is enrolled at the end of the drop/add period of the semester by 0.70 (70%) rounded down to the nearest whole credit hour. For example:</p><p>First-time freshmen with less than 32 attempted credit hours: Graduate/Professional Students: Students must successfully complete a minimum of 75% of the total number of hours for which they are enrolled after the first week of the semester and cumulatively.</p><p>Successful completion of a course for all students, for purposes of SAP calculations, are grades of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, P (Pass Credit or Developmental Courses). All other grades, including F, W (Withdrawal), I (Incomplete), R, (Repeated), and NC or CR (No credit or Pass no credit) will not be counted as a successful completion.</p><p>Incomplete (I) grades are counted as unsuccessful attempts. Only an incomplete that has been changed to an A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-or P can be added to the number of hours completed for the semester of the original registration. It is the students' responsibility to notify the Office of Financial Aid once an incomplete grade has been changed to a valid grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Maximum Time Frame for Eligibility: Reviewed Each Semester</head><p>Undergraduates: Students are required to complete their degree requirements within a specific time frame. This time frame is a period no longer the 150% of the published length of the program. At Notre Dame College that would mean 180 attempted credit hours. The maximum time frame allowance for completion of the program is intended to be long enough to allow for changes in major, loss of credit due to transfer, withdrawn coursework, minor, double majors, etc. Therefore, no extensions of the maximum time frame will be granted for those reasons.</p><p>Graduates and TEEL: Students have until they have attempted the number of credit hours required in their program. Additional courses unrelated to the student's major or licensure requirements will not be funded. A request for a list of remaining courses maybe requested when the student appears to be within a year of completion of the number of required courses as stated in the catalogue.</p><p>Transfer students: Transfer students are awarded aid first semester without regard to probation status at the prior post-secondary institution. Academic progress will be reviewed to determine the status of each student in relationship to her/his program's maximum time frame. Once transfer credits are posted, they will be considered in next SAP review. Transfer hours will be included in the cumulative number of hours earned and attempted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAP Probation and Appeal Process</head><p>Students who lose eligibility for financial aid may appeal the decision by following the procedures outlined below. Those wishing to utilize this process must indicate mitigating circumstances that occurred during the course of the semester in question that could not have been anticipated prior to that period, and that adversely affected their ability to successfully complete their required coursework. (Events such as the death of an immediate family member, extended illness suffered by the student, or other unforeseeable events that may have caused significant hardship for the student may be considered as examples of mitigating circumstances.)</p><p>Steps to Appeal: 1. Complete and submit an NDC SAP Appeal Form. The form is available on My.NDC and the College website. The appeal requires a signature from an advisor or the person indicated on the form. (Your appeal may be faxed, e-mailed, mailed, or submitted in person at the Student Services Office.) 2. The appeal must contain an explanation as to why you were not able to complete your course work, why your grades fell below the SAP requirement, or why you have not been able to complete your degree requirements in an acceptable timeframe. Please indicate what plans you have to change your academic performance in the future. Documentation should not only indicate the mitigating circumstance that caused you to have academic problems during the semester, but also must clearly indicate that the circumstances that caused the problems have been rectified so that you will be able to successful in future semesters.</p><p>3. In most cases, the SAP Appeals Committee will render a decision within two weeks of receipt of a fully completed appeal. All decisions of the SAP Appeals Committee are final. Notification of the decision will be sent via your Notre Dame e-mail account. 4. If the SAP appeal is approved, you will receive an Academic Plan Form, which must be signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid before financial aid may be awarded (or reinstated) for the next semester. You must meet the conditions of the Academic Plan (or SAP standards) in order to continue to receive financial aid in subsequent semesters. 5. If the SAP appeal is denied, financial aid will be cancelled. If you have been denied aid please review the section below (Regaining Financial Aid Edibility).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regaining Financial Aid Eligibility</head><p>Students denied financial aid after completing the appeal process or who fail to meet their Academic Plan can regain full eligibility for financial aid by:</p><p>Successfully completing coursework that will raise their cumulative GPA to meet or exceed the minimum required for their total attempted hours. Raising their overall cumulative completion rate for all coursework attempted to the 70% or 75% level as required by their program. Students who have reached their maximum time frame are not able to regain eligibility Students who are ineligible to receive financial aid may use one or more of the following payment options while attempting to regain eligibility: (1) student's own resources, (2) Notre Dame College Payment Plan, and/or (3) alternative/private educational loan.</p><p>Students who have taken the necessary measures to regain eligibility for financial aid must contact the Office of Financial Aid immediately upon doing so and apply for Reinstatement of Eligibility. Students' academic performance will then be reviewed, and if all required SAP criteria is met, full financial aid eligibility will be reinstated, effective the following semester.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Late Fees</head><p>Students making payments after the due date are subject to a late fee of $100 and 2% of the outstanding past due balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deposits</head><p>New, full-time students to Notre Dame College are required to make a confirmation deposit of $250.00 upon acceptance to the College. This deposit is NOT refundable after May 1, 2018. The deposit will be applied to the student's first term tuition balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment</head><p>It is the policy of Notre Dame College that tuition, room, board, and fees for a given term are to be paid in full OR acceptable arrangements made by August 1st for Fall Semester, January 2nd for Spring Semester, and by the first day of classes for Summer Semester. Acceptable arrangements are payment in full or signing up for the payment plan and making on-time payments. Students who register after the deadline are expected to make acceptable payment arrangements at the time of registration. Pending financial aid is not an acceptable payment arrangement.

An account is considered delinquent if the full payment is not received and posted to your account by 3pm on the payment due date listed on the statement. Please be advised that failure to read mail, email, or view online activity does not relieve a student of the responsibility to make on-time payments in the correct amount. If you have not made a scheduled payment by the time the next statement of the semester is mailed, you will be charged the $100 late fee and 2% interest plus you could be removed from your classes and/or the residence halls. Each semester's charges must be paid in full prior to registration for the next term.</p></div>

There is no enrollment fee to participate in the plan. The first installment must be paid in order to be considered an acceptable payment arrangement. NDC calculates equal monthly installment payments by taking the balance due after financial aid is posted and dividing it by five. All outstanding balances from the previous semester must be paid before participating in the payment plan for the new semester. Students must be current with payment plan prior to registration for the next term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment Options</head><p>Payments can be made in person or by mail using cash or check.

Tuition refunds are determined by the official date of withdrawal. Please refer to the semester course booklet for the correct dates and percentages.</p><p>Refunds on non-credit courses will be made on the percentage basis listed above. Refunds will be made approximately one month after the date of withdrawal.</p><p>A student who withdraws from a course must give written notification to the Registrar's office.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of the</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Curriculum Descriptions and Outcomes</head><p>Written Fluency. The strength of a liberal arts education depends on its ability to teach students how to translate critical and creative thinking into writing. Employers continue to stress clear communication skills, especially writing, as essential to a successful career.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Construct sustained, coherent argument or presentation in more than one medium for general and specific audiences. • Work in collaboration with others to address a social, personal, or ethical dilemmas.</p><p>• Demonstrate effective communication skills using conventions of Standard English for academic writing.</p><p>Oral Fluency. Students research topics, identify sources, and outline their work in order to deliver the types of informative and persuasive speeches critical to career success. Oral fluency and confidence ensure students to read audiences, engage in interpersonal communication, and present themselves appropriately.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Demonstrate basic competence in outlining, preparing and delivering informative and persuasive speeches.</p><p>Quantitative Fluency. A liberally educated student, irrespective of career choice, should have a demonstrated ability and comfort to reason and solve quantitative problems. Students will be given opportunities not only to use critical thinking skills in quantitative situations but also to communicate and justify their thinking through multiple representations in a cooperative environment.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Analyze and use critical thinking to solve mathematical applications.</p><p>• Solve problems with mathematical competency and a willingness to find multiple strategies.</p><p>• Communicate mathematical concepts clearly both orally and in written form.</p><p>• Use appropriate technology to solve mathematical problems.</p><p>Creative Inquiry. In a liberal arts college, students have the priceless opportunity to explore and hone their creative abilities. The study of music, art, theatre, or creative writing stimulates the mind and fortifies the spirit. Students learn about the elements, forms, and styles of different media. By doing so, they understand themselves and their engagement with others critically, thoughtfully, and meaningfully.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Develop both creative and analytical thinking through the exploration of the creative process.</p><p>• Define and apply the vocabulary related to the elements, forms and styles of the respective media.</p><p>Literary Inquiry. By examining literature, students learn not only different genres and forms of writing, but also the complexity and beauty of the English language, all while refining their inferential and critical reading skills.</p><p>Reading literature encourages us to enter new, and often challenging, modes of thinking that in turn help us understand ourselves and our relation to the global community.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Explore the depth and breadth of the human experience expressed in the literature of a variety of genres, times and places.</p><p>• Refine skills of inferential and critical reading.</p><p>• Engage in thoughtful and reasoned conversation, as well as analytical writing informed by research.</p><p>Philosophical Inquiry. Philosophical inquiry introduces students to philosophical and critical thinking by exploring timeless questions that are central to a liberal arts education. Students acquire an understanding of fundamental philosophical questions that remain central to living a life of personal, professional, and global responsibility. Students further acquire interpretive and evaluative skills necessary for assessing answers to these timeless questions, along with an appreciation for philosophical self-reflection.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Demonstrate knowledge of the traditional themes in the discipline of philosophy, especially those relating to the human person and the liberal arts tradition, e.g., ethics, social philosophy, aesthetics, critical thinking, epistemology, and metaphysics. • Demonstrate an ability to interpret and analyze philosophical questions and proposed answers to them carefully and critically, using historical context and logical reasoning. • Demonstrate critical thinking and analysis skills in reading philosophical texts and participate in activities that encourage students to develop an appreciation for philosophical self-reflection, e.g., Socratic class discussions, debates, journaling, reflective essays.</p><p>Scientific Inquiry. Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is also a process by which one can systematically gain knowledge of the natural world. Students will engage in methodology or the process of scientific inquiry and critical thinking, both in a classroom and laboratory.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Describe how science is a process to gain knowledge of natural phenomena (through the scientific method). • Demonstrate factual knowledge in a specific discipline (depending on the course).</p><p>• Explore the role of science in society.</p><p>• Critically evaluate the validity of scientific claims.</p><p>Theological Inquiry. Theological inquiry opens students to sources that have helped humans answer life's ultimate questions. Theology guides students to use sacred texts both from Christianity and other faith traditions, as well as use critical reasoning to examine the evidence of this world and the transcendent. Students will recognize their relationship with God, global communities and all God's creation.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Demonstrate skill in examining theological assumptions about themselves and the world.</p><p>• Assess some responses to timeless questions about God, morality, and the life hereafter.</p><p>• Compare their own beliefs with those of others to grow in clarity and depth.</p><p>• Apply values of social justice to critical global issues.</p><p>Engaged Responsibility. The virtue of responsibility has two meanings: first, to account for one's actions; and second, to perform one's part in a common undertaking. Responsibility is a quality of character demonstrated by a dedicated effort to respond to the needs of self and others. The Notre Dame College mission is to develop in all students both types in the personal, professional, and global realms of students' lives.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Demonstrate awareness of responsibility for self and for others • Analyze, interpret, and evaluate global issues • Develop an appreciation for cultures other than their own to better participate as responsible world citizens • Acquire and demonstrate use of the principles of living a purposeful and ethical life</p><p>The following are the courses that meet the Engaged Responsibility requirement:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Year Falcon (FYF)</head><p>1 cr. This course aims to develop in students their personal responsibility for being successful in college. It is the first of four Engaged Responsibility courses, required of all students* and flowing directly from the Notre Dame College mission. Topics in the course include the College's history and mission, academic literacy, and career exploration. The course builds upon Welcome Week activities and experiences.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will take part in activities and experiences in the course designed to help them:</p><p>• Demonstrate understanding of the history and mission of the College.</p><p>• Demonstrated personal responsibility for achieving academic success.</p><p>• Assess their interests, strengths, skills and values to support their academic and career goals.</p><p>Students transferring from another college with more than 12 credits, or a nontraditional student (defined as a student 23 years of age or older, or takes all courses online) will complete a Personal Responsibility and Growth course (see below).</p><p>Personal Responsibility and Growth course. We desire that our students develop a responsibility to self, in addition to responsibility to others. This requirement is to focus on responsibility to oneself, in health, finance, relationships, spirituality, etc. Outcomes will be specific to the choice of courses. In general, the course that fulfills this requirement shall have students complete a tangible experience that relates to their lives, e.g., personal budget or health assessment. See Courses Approved to Fulfill Core Requirements.</p><p>Global Learning Course. With enhanced communication technologies, our world has become smaller, and with that, we desire that our students have a sense of global responsibility, that is, to be good global citizens in this smaller world. See Courses Approved to Fulfill Core Requirements.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be exposed to experiences and activities in an effort to facilitate their ability to:</p><p>• Seek to become informed, open-minded, and responsible people who are attentive to cultural diversity, • Seek to understand how their actions affect both local and global communities.</p><p>• Consider how they might address world issues collaboratively and equitably Current Ethical Problems and Positions (PH480). The course critically examines the major approaches to ethics given to us by the history of philosophy. The contributions of Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, and Mill are studied first from a theoretical perspective. These theories are then applied to a variety of ethical issues which face us today. The student is introduced to the world of both the theory and practice of ethics. Junior status required; PH 180 recommended.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Recognize and critically analyze ethical problems • Resolve ethical conflicts using critical thinking skills • Explore ethical beliefs contrary to one's own philosophy • Demonstrate knowledge of classical and modern ethical theories • Argue an ethical position and critique opposing views Social Justice: Issues and Actions (TH450). Fulfilling the Notre Dame mission, "to educate for global responsibility," this course introduces students to the Christian principles of social justice and their biblical base. Students will apply these principles to issues such as world poverty, racism, sexism, and other justice issues.</p><p>Students will then seek out forms of action that are supported by faith-based principles. Junior status required.</p><p>Outcomes. Students will be able to:</p><p>• Gain factual knowledge in what constitutes social justice (terminology, classifications, and trends)</p><p>• Apply the principles of Catholic social teaching to current international, national, and local realities • Develop a clearer understanding of and commitment to personal values • Engage in theological reflection related to social justice and social responsibility • Demonstrate growing understanding of world realities, being able to articulate clear and informed positions about what they "see" and learn orally and in writing • Move towards a commitment to keep informed of the need for justice in the world and to work for justice in their own sphere as their lives unfold</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of the</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor Degree Programs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Fields of Study</head><p>The academic major deepens the student's knowledge in a particular field while meeting intellectual and career interests. Therefore, all Notre Dame College students must choose a major area of study.</p><p>Degree candidates are encouraged to choose a major by the end of the sophomore year. In order to fulfill all requirements in four years, some majors require enrollment in major courses during the freshman year. This situation is particularly true in the natural sciences, mathematics, accounting and education.</p><p>Some programs have both entrance and graduation requirements of a specific grade point average during the time of study. See specific programs for entrance and continuation GPA requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Completion Time Frames</head><p>Degree requirements must be completed within 10 years of the date from which the student first matriculated at Notre Dame College. Earned credits over 10 years old will only apply to a degree if the grade for that credit is C (2.0) or better and when accepted as applicable by the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs or Division Chair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minor Fields of Study</head><p>Notre Dame College provides a wide variety of disciplinary minors. Minors allow students to have a meaningful concentration of courses in areas that may be of value in support of the major. Carefully chosen minors can be an asset in obtaining employment and in facilitating career change.</p><p>Requirements for minors generally range from 18-24 credit hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Major</head><p>Some students may wish to complete two majors while at Notre Dame College. The student completes all the requirements in effect in the catalog for each major. A double major is only applicable if the two majors apply to the same degree. It is not permissible to pursue a second major that pertains to a different degree. In this situation, it is recommended the student add an applicable minor or second major which falls under the same degree. Only one degree will be granted to any student at the time of graduation.</p><p>The student must be aware that it may not be possible to complete two majors in only four years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Fee</head><p>A graduation fee is charged to all undergraduate degree applicants, and is payable prior to graduation. The fee is nonrefundable. This fee covers the cost of degree audits and evaluations, the diploma, diploma cover, and shipping supplies and expenses and the commencement ceremony.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs of Study</head><p>Majors, minors and areas of licensure are listed here. See the indicated discipline's section of the catalog for specific requirements.</p><p>A Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree is available with these majors:</p><p>• Accounting (Business Administration) </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• Biology • Chemistry • Communication • Education • English • Criminal</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individually Designed Majors (Bachelor of Arts degree) and Minors</head><p>The Individually Designed Major (IDM) or Minor is multi-disciplinary in nature and is available only to exceptional students (minimum 3.0 GPA) whose interests and career goals are not met by current majors or minors. A student wishing to design an IDM must work with the Office of Academic Affairs to develop a unique curriculum that does not duplicate substantial portions of existing programs. The IDM must be reviewed and approved by two faculty members. With faculty endorsement, the Office of Academic Affairs must grant final approval of the curriculum. Students interested in an IDM should inquire at the Office of Academic Affairs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Areas of the</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduate Programs</head><p>Graduate programs are offered in Education, Nursing Education, and in Security Policy Studies (Intelligence). For further information, contact The Finn Center for Adult, Graduate and Online Learning at NotreDameCollege.edu/admissions/graduate a copy of the graduate bulletin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative Methods of Learning Assessment</head><p>Notre Dame College acknowledges the fact that learning acquired outside the traditional classroom setting can be equivalent to college-level learning. Upon careful review, and appropriate documentation, the College may grant academic course credit.</p><p>The number of credits earned through alternate methods of learning assessment may not exceed 30 semester hours. Credits earned through this process must be requested before the beginning of the academic year in which the degree is to be granted. Credits granted in this manner will be listed as part of the student's official academic record only after all appropriate fees have been paid. All credits will be subject to the approval of the division chairperson and the Office of Academic Affairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiential Learning Credits</head><p>Those who have acquired academic knowledge or skills through direct experience, in-service training or non-credit classes may have it validated for college credit. Students apply for such credits through a process called portfolio assessment. Portfolio assessment may not be accepted for credit in certain disciplines or for certain courses. A student should contact the appropriate division chairperson for more information prior to preparing the portfolio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proficiency Examinations</head><p>Examinations to demonstrate subject matter competency may be taken for credit or non-credit validation for a small fee. Such examinations may not be used to raise an existing grade. A grade of "C" is the minimum acceptable level for credits earned through examination. A student should contact the appropriate division chairperson for more information. All credits received through the Proficiency Examination will appear as PASS on the transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College Level Examination Program (CLEP)</head><p>Nationally-normed CLEP examinations are accepted at Notre Dame College to validate knowledge of both general and specific subject areas. CLEP exams may not be taken in areas already successfully completed for course credits. A student should contact the Office of the Registrar for more information on courses accepted through CLEP testing and for minimal scores required for credit by NDC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study and Laboratory Research</head><p>To foster independent learning, Notre Dame College encourages talented students to pursue Independent Study Projects and Laboratory Research Projects.</p><p>A student with senior standing and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 both in general studies and in the major field of study may qualify for these options.</p><p>For Independent Study, a student works with a faculty member who helps define the project, and develop the learning objectives and the method of presentation for the project. A student who wishes to pursue a laboratory research project follows the same procedure and may choose to work with a faculty member who is carrying out a large research project.</p><p>The grade and credits earned for the project may be included in the academic major and general degree requirements for graduation. Such consideration must be addressed prior to enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Policies and Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of Students</head><p>A DEGREE-SEEKING STUDENT is one who follows a planned program of studies at Notre Dame College leading to a degree. Minimum credit requirements for class standing are as follows: Sophomores 30 semester credits Juniors 60 semester credits Seniors 90 semester credits A FULL-TIME STUDENT is one who carries twelve (12) or more credits per semester. A student with a high scholastic average may, with the permission of the Office of Academic Affairs, carry more than 19 credits during a given semester. Additional charges will apply after 19 credits.</p><p>A PART-TIME STUDENT is one who is registered for fewer than twelve (12) semester credits per semester.</p><p>AN AUDITOR is a student permitted to attend classes on a non-credit basis. Requirements to be met by auditors are set by individual instructors. See Advising Center staff for registration information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dishonesty</head><p>Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to the following: 1) the completion or attempted completion of any academic work by means other than those permitted; and 2) the alteration of a document relating to the grading process, including changing an instructor's grade book or changing answers on a test after the time to complete the test is over.</p><p>Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to: unauthorized collaboration; copying another student's answers; unauthorized aids on a test; using purchased or pre-made term papers; plagiarism; and destroying another student's work.</p><p>Plagiarism occurs when an individual presents the ideas, thoughts or words of another as his or her own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: using phrases, sentences or ideas from a published source, including the Internet, without citing that source; representing another's unpublished work as one's own; rewriting or paraphrasing the work of another without giving credit to that person by citation; and submitting a paper that has been copied, in whole or part, from another's work as one's own work.</p><p>Generally, the faculty decides upon sanctions for acts of Academic Dishonesty. Thus, Academic Dishonesty may carry specific penalties carried out by the faculty outside of the Judicial Procedure. Those penalties include but are not limited to: failure on the specific assignment, failure of the course, and/or a letter detailing the offense which is kept in the Office of Academic Affairs. Note that although deference is given to the faculty to handle matters of Academic Dishonesty, such action does not preclude further disciplinary action under the College Judicial Procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Students with Disabilities</head><p>Notre Dame College makes reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. A qualified student with a disability may request support services from the Dwyer Learning Center on a yearly basis. In order to receive services at Notre Dame College, students with disabilities must provide documentation such as a statement from a medical doctor or licensed psychologist which meets state and federal standards for indicating the presence of a disability. (See Student Disability Services.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Policies for Notre Dame College</head><p>All potential transfer students to Notre Dame College must submit an application to the College. Applications can be found on the College website: www.NotreDameCollege.edu.</p><p>Students applying for undergraduate or graduate programs whether on campus or online, work with the Admissions Office. Official transcripts must be sent directly from the educational institutions to Notre Dame College. If the applicant received a GED, an official copy of the certificate with the testing scores must be sent directly to NDC by the State Department of Education where the GED was earned.</p><p>Transfer students to Notre Dame College must submit the NDC application which can be found on the website, an official copy of the high school transcript or GED certificate, official transcripts from all colleges previously attended, form on felony convictions.</p><p>An appointment with an admissions counselor is highly recommended. At the appointment the counselor will do an unofficial evaluation of the transcript(s). Upon receipt of all official academic transcripts a formal evaluation of course equivalences and transcripts will be completed and provided to the student. Transfer credits will appear on the student's Notre Dame College transcript during the student's first semester of enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer policies:</head><p>• Only courses with a grade of "D" or better will be considered for transfer.</p><p>• Individual courses and credits transfer; grades, quality points, and cumulative grade point average do not transfer. • Courses considered remedial (below the 100 level) will not transfer.</p><p>• Credit will be given for those courses that are equivalent in content or rigor to core and major courses at NDC. Courses not considered equivalent to a core or major requirement at NDC will transfer in as electives. • Students may not earn credit for the same course twice. A course determined to be equivalent to a Notre Dame course does not need to be taken at NDC. The transfer evaluation will indicate all equivalencies. • Students must earn a minimum of 30 credits at NDC to graduate.</p><p>• Courses taken at a non-regionally accredited post-secondary institution will be considered for transfer only if the institution is accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and legally authorized to grant specialized associate degrees or higher. Courses with a B will be considered for transfer only after review by the department chair to determine that the content is in conformity to the Notre Dame College Curriculum. A maximum of 15 credits will apply. • Courses older than 10 years will be considered for transfer on an individual basis; some may transfer in only as electives but not count toward core requirements. Computer courses older than five years will not transfer. • Nursing and education students must undergo a major review prior to admission to the major.</p><p>• Students must complete 50% of their major course work at NDC. • Notre Dame College will transfer credits earned through advanced placement (AP) courses or the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) based on the scores earned. AP test scores of 3, 4, or 5 will be considered for transfer. To determine if credit will be granted, the College uses the scoring guidelines recommended by CLEP. Generally a score of 50 or above is required for credit. • No more than 30 credits earned through AP, CLEP, portfolio assessment, proficiency exams, independent study and research will be counted toward the 120 credits required for a bachelor's degree at Notre Dame College. • The official evaluation of coursework will determine whether transfer students may enroll in courses with prerequisites. • Notre Dame College will consider credits earned through or recommended by the military, ACE, DANTES and SMART (Sailor/Marine American Council on Education Registry Transcript) on an individual basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Policy with an Associate's Degree</head><p>Recognizing the system of preparation afforded by the completion of an Associate of Arts and Associate of Science (AA/AS) degree, and in accordance with the Ohio Articulation and Transfer policy, Notre Dame College will guarantee admission to the college and afford junior standing to all students who have earned an AA/AS degree from an accredited institution, provided their grade point average is at least 2.0 for all previous collegelevel courses, excluding Nursing. Notre Dame College's Nursing Program has separate admission requirements. If a student chooses to transfer before completing an Associate degree, all collegiate level courses completed at the Two-Year Institution with a "D" or better grade will be accepted toward the student's class standing at Notre Dame College.</p><p>Students completing an AA or AS will be considered to have met all lower biennium general education requirements. Transfer students are required to complete upper biennium general education requirements unless they already have courses similar to these which have been approved in the admission process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Registration</head><p>Full-time students can broaden the scope of their educational opportunities through a system of crossregistration. Each term or semester, students in good academic standing may enroll in one undergraduate course at any of the participating colleges and universities in Greater Cleveland. There is no additional tuition charge, but cross registrants are responsible for their own transportation and any laboratory or special course fees required for the host institution's course. Grades from courses taken through cross-registration are part of a student's Notre Dame College transcript. First-year students are not encouraged to cross-register. For further information, students should contact the Office of the Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progress Standards</head><p>Earning an undergraduate degree from NDC requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 both overall and in the courses of the major [note that some majors require higher cumulative GPA achievement]. In order to help students stay on track, academic progress is reviewed after every semester. The paragraphs below describe the academic status descriptions used at NDC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing</head><p>Cumulative: Above 2.0 Semester GPA: N/A Students who have maintained a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher or who have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher and have successfully completed any academic progress requirements as noted below are considered to be in good academic standing. All students enter in good academic standing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Standing -Academic Warning</head><p>Cumulative: Above 2.0 Semester GPA: Less than 2.0 in a single semester or any two consecutive semesters</p><p>The academic warning designation is used to identify students who, although their cumulative GPA is above 2.0, are deemed high risk. Students are placed on academic warning for one of two reasons. First, a student currently on academic probation who brings their cumulative GPA above 2.0 will be moved to academic warning status; second, earning a GPA of less than 2.0 in any one or two semesters. Maintaining a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher for two successive semesters will return the student to good academic standing.</p><p>• Limited to 16 credits for upcoming semester • Register with the Student Success Center</p><p>• If possible, repeat any failed courses • Meet your class attendance obligations • Earn a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher and demonstrate that you are making adequate progress toward earning a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 • Use the services of the Dwyer Learning Center to help you achieve a higher level of academic success.</p><p>Academic Probation (First semester students, below 1.75 GPA) Cumulative: Below 2.0 or 2 Consecutive Semesters on Academic Warning Semester GPA: N/A A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 is placed on academic probation. Unless the student gives evidence of scholastic improvement during the semester after being placed on probation, the student may be suspended from Notre Dame College. A student on academic probation who earns a semester GPA at or above 2.0 may be moved from academic probation to academic warning.</p><p>• Limited to 16 credits for upcoming semester • Register with the Student Success Center • If possible, repeat any failed courses • Meet your class attendance obligations • Earn a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher and demonstrate that you are making adequate progress toward earning a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 • Continue to use the services of the Dwyer Learning Center to help you achieve a higher level of academic success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>A student on who does not show evidence of academic progress or any student who does not pass the majority of his/her courses during any one semester is subject to suspension. A student may be dismissed or placed on academic suspension without having been placed on warning or probation the previous semester. A student may be placed on academic suspension if both the semester and cumulative grade point averages are significantly below a 2.0, but not low enough to meet dismissal criteria.</p><p>Students who have been suspended from the College for lack of academic progress may appeal the suspension immediately or apply for readmission after one semester. To appeal the suspension, a student must sign the Final Probation Agreement and fax or email the signed agreement to the Office of Academic Affairs before the deadline stated in the Suspension letter and email.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Probation after Appeal</head><p>A student readmitted after appeal of Academic Suspension must achieve the following criteria to be considered for Academic Probation:</p><p>• Register for no more than 16 credits. If you registered for more credits, you must change your schedule. Contact the Student Success Center or your academic advisor. • Repeat courses in which you earned a grade of F as soon as possible.</p><p>• Register with the Dwyer Learning Center (DLC) OR the Academic Support Center (ASC) the first week of the semester; follow all requirements set up by the DLC or the ASC. • Attend all class meetings; be on time for each class and stay the entire time.</p><p>• Establish a calendar listing all assignments including papers, projects, readings, presentations and quizzes and exams. Check the calendar every day to know what is coming up; look beyond one day/week. Turn in papers and projects on time. • Meet with a representative of the Office of Academic Affairs to discuss academic progress. • Prioritize your time.</p><p>• Earn a minimum term GPA of 2.000 with no Fs or Ws.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>Previously suspended students who have been granted readmission and who continue to make less than satisfactory academic progress will be dismissed from the College for no less than one academic year. Readmission after dismissal is most unusual and only for compelling reasons. A report of scholarship grades is available to all students on the NDC portal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status Review</head><p>A letter requesting an academic status review must be sent to the Office of Academic Affairs before the beginning of the semester in which the student seeks status review. Elements considered in evaluating scholastic improvement include the number of credits attempted and earned, and the semester GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Recipients</head><p>If a student does not achieve a 2.00 GPA, and if it is judged that the student should be permitted to continue to attend classes, the student may be eligible for certain portions of the financial aid package if the other conditions for financial aid eligibility have been met. The student must demonstrate steady improvement toward the 2.0 GPA.</p><p>Definitions of academic progress for the award of financial aid may differ from academic policies. Each student should work closely with the financial aid office to ensure that there is an understanding of those standards and their implications for financial aid eligibility. (See Financial Aid for more information)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Standards and Grades</head><p>Letter grades are used to indicate academic achievement in accord with the standards of scholarship maintained at Notre Dame College. The interpretation of each grade and its corresponding point values are specified below: If a student earns an "F" as a final grade in a required course, the course must be repeated. If a student repeats a course in which an "F" or "D" grade was received, and in so doing earns a higher grade, that higher grade will replace the former in computing the GPA. A course may be counted only once toward graduation requirements. No course may be repeated more than once unless permission is obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs.</p><p>CR/NC (Pass/Fail) are grades which may be earned in specific instances. CR (Pass) means that a student has achieved a grade of "C" or higher in a course; however, the grade is not computed into the student's grade point average. NC (Fail) means that a student has not earned academic credit. Ordinarily, a maximum of one course per semester may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis.</p><p>Change of registration from CR/NC to a letter grade or vice versa must be carried out through the Office of the Registrar during the first week of the semester.</p><p>Departments may declare which of their course offerings may be open for the Pass/Fail option, as well as the number of students who may be admitted on a Pass/Fail basis. The designation of "Incomplete" is not a grade. It denotes a limited period of time allotted for a student to complete a course after the end of the term because of extenuating circumstances. An Incomplete is granted only upon the student's request and with permission of the instructor.</p><p>If the "I" is not removed within six weeks after the last day of examinations for semester courses, the letter "I" will be converted to an "F." The deadline to convert I's to letter grades for online courses is four weeks after the end of the session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change of Grade</head><p>Grades received in courses are not changed except for special circumstances in which teacher error is apparent. Grade change requests based on simple reevaluation of the instructor's original judgment are not permitted.</p><p>Grade changes must be initiated within 45 days after the close of the term in which the grade was earned, with the exception of the spring term. Changes in the spring term must be initiated within 45 days after the fall term has begun. No grade changes may be made without the approval of the Office of Academic Affairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Grade Appeal Processes</head><p>Various protections are offered to students at the College to assure a fair and consistent treatment in academic matters. A student who wishes to contest a course grade must initiate the appeal process in writing no later than two weeks after the date the grade was issued. The form can be obtained in the Office of Academic Affairs.</p><p>The two items of an academic nature that follow have specific procedures to address concerns:</p><p>• Demonstrably arbitrary and unfair evaluation of student produced course work.</p><p>• Accusations of plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty.</p><p>The processes for each of these follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demonstrably Arbitrary and Unfair Evaluation of Student-Produced Course Work</head><p>Students have a right to expect fair and consistent issuance of course grades. The grading policy employed in each class, including the comparative weight of each component used to determine the final grade, is outlined in each course syllabus. It is the student's responsibility to read and understand the grading policy outlined in that syllabus.</p><p>Students who have questions about grades on projects, tests or final grades for the semester are encouraged to meet with the faculty member to review the grades. In the case of a final grade only, if the student still does not understand the basis for the grade or believes that the composition of the semester grade conflicts with the grading policy stated in the syllabus, the student may request an additional meeting with the instructor and the appropriate department/division chairperson. (If the appropriate department/division chairperson is the instructor in question, the concern should be directed to the Office of Academic Affairs.) This meeting must be requested within two weeks of receipt of the final grade, and must take place no later than 30 days after the beginning of the next semester.</p><p>At this meeting, the student will be asked to provide evidence to substantiate the claim that the grade was either arbitrary or unfair. The role of the appropriate department/division chairperson is to facilitate communication and clarify understandings. At the faculty member's sole prerogative, the final grade may be modified or the assigned grade may be sustained. No grade may be lowered as a result of these meetings. If the dispute is resolved, this meeting is the final step of the review process.</p><p>If the dispute is not resolved, one last step may be utilized. The student may appeal the dispute to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs within one week of the initial meeting. The Vice President will consult with the appropriate department/division chairperson and will establish an appeal committee of three faculty members, one of whom may be recommended by the student bringing the appeal. A committee chairperson will be appointed by the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. The committee chairperson will notify the faculty member of the appeal and the composition of the committee.</p><p>The appeal committee will hear the student's complaint, interview the faculty member and study the information provided by both parties. If necessary, the committee may interview other students or faculty members in its efforts to determine the facts.</p><p>The committee will make a report to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs in which it reviews the issues and recommends a solution. This report is to be made within thirty days of when the appeal was made to the VPASA. In most cases this will be a recommendation to uphold the grade awarded by the instructor or to alter the grade which the student received. In some cases the recommendation may be to present the student with other alternatives such as the completion of additional work before a final grade is determined.</p><p>The Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs after consultation with the President will inform the faculty member and the student of the recommendations of the appeal committee and will take the steps necessary to implement the recommendations.</p><p>The grade appeal process is not designed to address accusations of discrimination or harassment. If such concerns are the premise upon which the appeal is made, the student is directed to use the processes established by the College to resolve discrimination or harassment charges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accusations of Plagiarism or Other Forms of Academic Dishonesty</head><p>Plagiarism is offering work of another as one's own. Plagiarism is a serious offense and may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p>• Complete or partial copying directly from a written publication or unpublished source in any form of media without proper acknowledgment to the author. Making minor changes in wording or syntaxwithout acknowledgment to the author-is not sufficient to avoid plagiarism charges. • Paraphrasing the work of another without proper author acknowledgment.</p><p>• Submitting as one's own original work (however freely given or purchased), the original exam, research paper, manuscript, report, computer file, Internet information or other assignment that has been prepared by another individual.</p><p>The usual penalty for academic dishonesty is failure on the assignment for the first offense. All incidents of plagiarism are reported to the Office of Academic Affairs, and a letter citing the incident is included in the student's official file. Should a second incident of plagiarism occur during the student's pursuit of a degree, he/she will earn an "F" in that course, and a letter regarding the incident will be entered into the student's official file. Upon graduation, all relevant letters in the student's file will be destroyed. Should a third incident of plagiarism occur, the student will be dismissed from the College; her/his readmission is unlikely.</p><p>In all cases of alleged academic dishonesty (such as plagiarism, cheating, claiming work not done by the student or lying) where a faculty member observes or discovers the dishonesty, the faculty member may choose to confront the student and handle the matter between the faculty member and the student, or the faculty member may choose to refer the incident to the appropriate department/division chairperson. If the appropriate department/division chairperson is the instructor in question, the concern should be directed to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. If the faculty member chooses to confront the situation alone with the student and the matter is satisfactorily resolved, the faculty member and the student should submit a joint statement of the details to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs, which will be included in the student's file. If the situation is not satisfactorily resolved between the faculty member and the student, the matter may then be referred or appealed to the appropriate department/division chairperson.</p><p>In either case, the appropriate department/division chairperson may choose to 1) resolve the matter through a meeting with both the student and the faculty member, or 2) refer the matter to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. The findings, in either case, are final.</p><p>If alleged academic dishonesty is reported to a faculty member by a third party, then the faculty member will meet with the appropriate department/division chairperson to determine whether the evidence warrants an investigation, and how the investigation will be handled. It may also be decided that the faculty member will either confront the student or, assuming enough evidence is present to warrant action, turn the matter over to the appropriate department/division chairperson to either resolve or organize a hearing.</p><p>Please note: A more formalized step-by-step version of the Grade Appeal Policy is being developed and will take effect as soon as it is finalized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head><p>Regular attendance in classes is expected of all students; however, some College sponsored co-curricular and extra-curricular events may occasionally be scheduled during class hours. It is College policy that students who are participants in a College sponsored event are excused from a class for the specific event. (Exceptions to this policy: students fulfilling nursing clinicals and student teaching requirements.)</p><p>All students in all ON CAMPUS courses must attend the first class meeting of each course on their schedule. It is imperative that students attend classes and it is known they are present in class. Instructors will take attendance and report absences to the Office of Academic Affairs by the end of the first Friday of the semester. Any student whose name is marked "non-attend/absent" will be removed from the class list, freeing seats for other students during the "ADD" period.</p><p>We recognize that students may have a legitimate reason for not being in class. In such a case, you must contact the professor via email BEFORE THE START OF THE CLASS ON THE FIRST DAY and provide documentation upon your arrival in class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note:</head><p>1. Students are expected to attend each and every class meeting in its entirety. Faculty members shall maintain a record of classroom attendance throughout the semester. 2. Class absences are excused for medical reasons documented by medical personnel, and schoolsponsored activities. Other situations to be recognized as excused absences include but are not limited to: athletic events, academic competitions in which the student is a participant, military duties, and death in immediate family, medical emergencies, auto accidents, etc. Verification of such absences will be required by the instructor and the student is responsible for the make-up work as required by the instructor. Make-up work is granted without penalty when the absence is excused and the work is completed with the time frame determined by the professor, however the student must initiate the request to make up work.</p><p>Participants in College sponsored co-curricular and extra-curricular events:</p><p>• Are not excused for practice.</p><p>• Are expected to make-up all work they miss.</p><p>• Are not penalized by the instructor for their excused absence.</p><p>• Are expected to communicate with each faculty member before the date of the excused absence.</p><p>• Must meet individual faculty requirements to complete work due for each missed class.</p><p>College personnel who are responsible for the College sponsored co-curricular and extra-curricular events will inform faculty of the game/event schedules at the beginning of each semester. When weather is a factor in College sponsored events and games, an event or game may be cancelled and require rescheduling. It is the student's responsibility to inform the faculty of any change in the original schedule.</p><p>Student-athletes are subject to the additional rules and procedures of the NCAA, Notre Dame College's Department of Athletics and their individual coaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from Courses</head><p>Sometimes students may need to withdraw from Notre Dame College or from one or more courses. However, a student may drop a course and add another only during the "drop/add" period (typically the first week of classes.) A student may drop a full semester course after the first week of classes and up until the 10th week of classes with the designation of "W" with permission of the academic advisor, the Advising Center or the Office of Academic Affairs. Short term courses have different withdrawal deadline dates and refund policies. Withdrawals could result in tuition charges and/or loss of financial aid and loss of athletic eligibility.</p><p>Different guidelines exist for students in the on-line program and in shortened sessions; please consult those applicable policies for more information.</p><p>To be official all withdrawals must be in writing and submitted to the Registrar's Office for processing. The date the Registrar's Office receives the written notification determines any refund.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from the College</head><p>Students who wish to withdraw from Notre Dame College must meet with the Director of the Student Success Center to initiate the withdrawal process.</p><p>Any student who drops below full-time status may face eligibility issues for participation in intercollegiate athletics, living in the residence halls or participating in the Academic Support Center for Students with Learning Differences, as well as participation in anything that requires full time student status.</p><p>Students who withdraw from the College are subject to the refund policy established in the "refund" section of this catalogue and all other applicable financial policies. Students who voluntarily withdraw must follow the admission and re-admission standards in place at the time of re-enrollment. If a student withdraws from the College or is not enrolled for one academic year, he/she must follow catalog requirements and academic policies in effect at the time of the readmission or new registration.</p><p>Non-attendance and/or non-payment DO NOT constitute official withdrawal. If a student fails to withdraw officially, he/she will be responsible for all tuition and fee charges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors and Awards</head><p>Graduation with Honors. To be eligible for graduation with honors, "cum laude," a student must earn a grade point average of 3.50; for graduation "magna cum laude," he/she must earn an average of 3.75; for "summa cum laude," he/she must earn an average of 3.90. Furthermore, the student must have earned at least 120 semester credits, including 60 from Notre Dame College.</p><p>Honors Scholars Program. Students in the Honors Scholars Program will receive the designation of Honors Scholar on the final transcript if 21 credits of honors courses have been successfully completed and the cumulative GPA is 3.5 or better.</p><p>Dean's List. In recognition of academic excellence, a Dean's List is compiled each academic semester. To qualify, a student must have an average of 3.50 or greater and must have completed 12 or more hours of graded course work by the end of that semester. An incomplete grade (I) precludes such recognition.</p><p>President's List. In recognition of a superior level of academic achievement, a President's List is compiled each academic semester. To qualify, a student must have an average of 4.00 and must have completed 15 or more hours of graded course work by the end of that semester. An incomplete grade (I) precludes such recognition. Sr. Mary Agnes Bosche Award. The Sr. Mary Agnes Bosche Award is presented to a traditional undergraduate student. The recipient is chosen based on his or her embodiment of the qualities evident in the life and service of Sr. Mary Agnes Bosche, SND. The recipient must demonstrate honesty and trustworthiness, a commitment to excellence and selfless service to Notre Dame and the larger community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>St. Catherine of Alexandria</head><p>Sr. Mary LeRoy Finn Award. The Sr. Mary LeRoy Finn Award is conferred upon an adult student who has demonstrated academic excellence and leadership qualities in and out of the classroom. The recipient must have attained a minimum grade point average of 3.5. He or she must also embody the characteristics inscribed on the custom-made award presentation bowl: "Scholarly, Catalyst, Diligent, Spiritual, and Resilient."</p><p>Kappa Gamma Pi. The national Catholic college graduate honor society admits ten percent of the graduating class to its membership. The faculty selects students for the graduating class. Criteria for membership include qualification for graduation with academic honors, demonstrated leadership and service during the undergraduate years and strong indications that the students will assume leadership in the future in their Church or larger civic or professional community.</p><p>Mission Award. The Mission Award is presented to a well-rounded student or students who in special ways display dedication to global issues and sustainability, care for others, commitment to spiritual or religious traditions and demonstrated personal growth made possible through Notre Dame.</p><p>This graduate will exemplify the Notre Dame mission by living the ideals of personal, professional and global responsibility in his or her daily life, and will have persisted through uncommon circumstances and displayed personal maturity by means of his or her education at the College.</p><p>Departmental Academic Awards. A number of disciplines have special awards for high achievement:</p><p>Art Distinguished Faculty Award. Since 1981, the Distinguished Faculty Award has been presented annually to a full-time faculty member selected by a faculty committee from nominations made by students, alumni and faculty. The criteria include excellence in teaching, scholarship and College and community service.</p><p>Outstanding Teaching Award. In 1987, the Outstanding Teaching Award was instituted to recognize the excellent teaching done by part-time faculty who are a regular part of the teaching staff each year. Based on nominations from students, alumni and faculty, the criteria for selection include excellence in teaching, service, availability to students and a commitment to the mission of the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Finn Center Online Programs</head><p>Notre Dame College offers a variety of courses and, in some cases, entire degree programs in an online format. Online courses use the Learning Management System, Moodle, to deliver most, and often all, of the course to the student, increasing flexibility and removing geographic and time barriers that sometimes make it difficult for students to complete courses or programs. In fact, a recent study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education concluded "…on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction." Understanding that the delivery of education can greatly enhance the quality of learning at Notre Dame College (NDC), the college is expanding the opportunities for students to participate in online learning experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Academic Terms</head><p>Online courses at NDC are offered in eight week accelerated terms designated "D" terms. There are six "D" terms in an academic year. Within the fall semester, online courses are offered in terms D-1 and D-2 where D-1 courses run the first part of the semester and D-2 courses begin midway through the semester and run for the second half of the fall semester. Similarly, within the spring semester the D-3 term runs during the first half of the semester and D-4 begins midway through the spring semester and runs during the second half of the semester. Term D-5 and D-6 are summer online terms. Full semester online courses are denoted as AD or BD in the course section.</p><p>For students taking online courses along with traditional semester courses, it is important to bear in mind that if a D-2 or D-4 course is scheduled, the first part of the semester will seem relatively light since the online course will not begin until midway through the semester. Several weeks prior to the start of a D-2 or D-4 course, students will receive email reminding them of the upcoming course. Students should be prepared for the increased workload the online course will create during the remainder of that regular semester. To increase the probability of academic success, students are not permitted entry into accelerated online courses after the term has begun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Verification and Attendance in Online Courses</head><p>Regular attendance and participation are important contributors to student success in online courses. To comply with federal mandates for the college's management of financial aid, certain kinds of student activity may or may not count as participation sufficient to qualify as "attendance" in online courses. For a copy of the latest version of these federal mandates, please see the Federal Student Aid Handbook.</p><p>For verification of enrollment in online courses, students must log in during week 1 of each 8-week "D" term. All students who have not logged in to their class by the end of the 1st week of each 8-week "D" term will be automatically dropped from their course (effective on the last day of 100% refund) and billed a $150 cancellation fee.</p><p>Any student enrolled in an online course at Notre Dame College must complete one of the following academically-related activities within their online course in order to be marked as having attended and actively participated in the online course(s):</p><p>1. Post to a discussion board 2. Submit an assignment 3. Submit a quiz or exam 4. Submit some other assessment as assigned.</p><p>This means that simply logging into a course and navigating within the virtual classroom will not constitute participation; the student must complete one of the above academically-related activities.</p><p>All students who logged in to their course, but who have not participated academically by the end of the 2nd week of the "D" term will be automatically dropped from their course (effective on the last day of 100% refund) and billed a $150 cancellation fee.</p><p>Please note that there are a significant number of other academically-related activities required when taking online courses, such as reading discussion boards, reading course materials and lectures, and messaging instructors, but these activities are not considered as student participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is an Online Course Like at NDC?</head><p>Online courses at Notre Dame College are accelerated and intensive, covering in eight weeks the same material the course normally covers during a 15 week semester. Most students find online courses more challenging than regular classroom courses because of the accelerated nature of the online course. The same objectives and academic content are taught in the online course, but the time in which one completes the workload is accelerated.</p><p>Most online courses are designed and scheduled as eight (8) week term courses. A student can expect to engage in the course, online, a minimum of 1 ½ hours per credit hour that a course earns, per week. The average student should plan on spending a minimum of 8-10 hours per week of work (inside and outside of an online course) for a three credit course (not inclusive of field or lab work).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Engagement:</head><p>Online courses must engage students in as much contact time as equivalent face-to-face courses. An eight week online course must engage students for a minimum of 4.5 hours per week in Moodle, in addition to reading textbook material and crafting assignments for submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What counts toward course engagement?</head><p>• Time reading lesson lectures in the course outline.</p><p>• Time spent participating in surveys, quizzes and exams that are contained in the course • Time spent posting in forums • Time spent in synchronous activities such as live classrooms or chats • Group work that normally would be conducted in-class</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What does not count toward course engagement but is required activity of courses?</head><p>• Reading required materials (textbooks, articles, etc.)</p><p>• Composing written assignments • Work on projects • Group work that normally would be required outside of face-to-face class</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</head><p>Online courses that have activities requiring students to be logged into a course at a specific day and time are referred to as synchronous. Most commonly, the synchronous activity in NDC courses is a virtual classroom that allows real-time voice, text, and in some cases, video chat between instructors and students. Most online courses in the Division of Education contain synchronous activities and students should plan their schedules accordingly. In the course schedule booklets, courses with synchronous activities will list the days of the week and times students are expected to log into the online course.</p><p>Asynchronous courses are online courses where students do not have to log into the course at a specific time. Students still engage with the instructor and other students on a regular basis using activities such as forums (online threaded discussions) where, based on material in the lessons, students post an initial response to a question and then interact with the instructor and other classmates to develop their knowledge and ask questions. In course schedule booklets, asynchronous courses will list "NA" in columns for days and times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synchronous Classroom</head><p>A secondary external system that students may be using is one referred to as either the Live Classroom or Meeting Room. This is where students will go when the course is meeting in real time for class discussions, etc. All meeting rooms are linked within the course, and the instructor will provide additional information regarding the live meeting.</p><p>All Education program courses (ED) have a scheduled, live meeting each week during the online term.</p><p>Students are expected to login, attend and actively participate in all scheduled meetings. NOTE: Students will need to speak and hear the live instruction. Some computers have built in microphone function and some students choose to use a headset with a microphone. It is imperative that students are able to speak live in their course and hear the instructor. Use of a microphone is mandatory in synchronous online courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical Support for Online courses</head><p>There is a 24/7 help desk available for fully online courses. The technical support line for Online Moodle is 800-985-9781. Students can access all of the training without a login ID. At the left-hand side of the screen there is a hyperlink "Launch Help Center." When the link is clicked, a new screen will open. There are several links on this page. Go through each; they don't take long. Recommendation: begin with the link labeled "Browser Settings"; this helps set up the computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How do I know if I can succeed in an online course?</head><p>Succeeding in accelerated online courses is much different from succeeding in traditional classroom courses. A different set of skills and habits is required for students to be successful in any accelerated course, especially those that are taken online. Research conducted over the years has demonstrated that students who can identify with most of the characteristics listed below are likely to be successful in accelerated online courses:</p><p>• They are self-starters who do not procrastinate • They are good at meeting deadlines • They are motivated to read, write and participate in class activities • They have the ability to work independently and in teams • They are resourceful in solving routine technological problems • They are strong in reading, writing and English language grammar skills • They schedule specific time each week to participate in online courses • They don't delay in asking questions when they don't understand something • They have reliable and consistent access to the internet • They are proficient in basic computer and email skills • They are disciplined in managing their time and daily schedule</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What do I need to participate in an online course?</head><p>Taking online courses at NDC is rewarding and fulfilling; however, to succeed students must be highly organized and disciplined. Online faculty and the Finn Center monitor student engagement and participation in online courses. Students who do not log in their courses at the beginning of a term, may be administratively withdrawn.</p><p>Minimally students need the following: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• A desktop</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How do I register for an online course?</head><p>Depending on a student's status, the approval process required to register for an online course differs slightly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Traditional Students in Good Standing.</head><p>Traditional students with a good academic standing at NDC are permitted to register for one online course each online term. To enroll in an online course, traditional students must complete the Online Registration Request Form located on My NDC in the Registrar Forms area under the Academics Tab. The Office of the Registrar will enroll students in the online courses and communicate if there are any issues. There is an additional fee for online courses.</p><p>Traditional students wanting to take an online course from the Division of Education must also have approval from the Chair of the Division of Education.</p><p>All Other Students. Students not classified as traditional (i.e. TEEL®, Adult, Graduate, etc.) do not need approval from the Finn Center to register for online courses. It is strongly recommended that anyone new to online courses at NDC complete the training module entitled, "Is Online Learning for Me?" located at moodle.ndc.edu prior to registering for an online course.</p><p>After registering for an online course, students will receive a welcome letter prior to the start of the course. The welcome letter will contain detailed information about accessing and logging into the course(s) for which the student has registered. Students will also likely receive email from the course instructor with introductions and other information regarding the course. All information is sent to students using NDC email accounts. Students will NOT receive email from NDC at alternate email accounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Course Access</head><p>You will be able to access your online course(s) through MyNDC using your NDC issued network login. If you do not know how to login to MyNDC, please be sure to contact the 24/7 Help Desk at 800-985-9781 as the Online Educational Services office is not able to assist with this process.</p><p>Once logged into MyNDC, you will need to view your schedule to access the course. If you are viewing your schedule prior to the official start date, you will need to view "Future Courses". Once the term is launched, you can view "Current Courses". A listing of all registered courses will appear and the course number will be hyperlinked. Use this link to access the course content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Virtual Bookstore</head><p>Required textbooks for all semester and online courses can be purchased through the Notre Dame College Bookstore at NDC Virtual Bookstore. Students are expected to have the required materials PRIOR to the first day of all online courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enjoy your Online Course!</head><p>Online courses are a great alternative for many traditional and non-traditional students. Whether you are a working adult trying to juggle many life demands or a traditional student who needs flexibility for part of a term, online courses can provide the same quality educational experience in an accelerated and proven format. A great deal of technical and advising support is available to students taking online courses. Within each course is a link to a help center that provides immediate 24/7/365 access to assistance via phone, live chat or email. Online instructors are also experienced with most aspects of the course and can help students with many basic questions. The Finn Center is also available to assist students with any questions or concerns regarding online education at NDC.</p><p>For further information about online education at Notre Dame College, contact Admissions, at 877.NDC.OHIO or admissions@ndc.edu.</p></div>

Students may pursue programs leading to Ohio licensure in early childhood, middle childhood, special education, and adolescent/young adult. Those pursuing adolescent/young adult also pursue an academic major. The detailed organization of the teacher education program and its specific directives are outlined in the Teacher Candidate Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Education Unit Vision</head><p>The Division of Professional Education educates teacher candidates for personal, professional, and global responsibility so that in their role as teachers they are willing to take a stand for human rights and social justice. The willingness to take a stand is critical in local communities and in a world where the disparities in access to goods and resources can threaten human relationships. This aligns with the conceptual framework for the Division of Professional Education at Notre Dame College which is driven by the institutional mission statement of educating "a diverse population...for personal, professional and global responsibility" and the College motto, "Changing the world, one student at a time." Current theory and research, state and national standards, the standards of specialized professional associations, and the concerns of the division's P-12 partners have further aided the division in reshaping and redefining its conceptual framework of "changing the classroom, one teacher at a time." The major themes articulated by the conceptual framework guide candidate performance outcomes and the system by which the division, its programs, and its candidates are assessed.</p><p>While the Notre Dame College community embraces and lives out of a carefully articulated and well documented values list <ref type="bibr">(Notre Dame College, 2007)</ref>, four values stand out in the Notre Dame Education tradition for the Division of Professional Education. The dignity of the whole person and that individual's right to an education are fundamental to the Notre Dame College teacher preparation program. The Division values the range of diversity among our teacher candidates, in our partnership schools, and among the core and adjunct faculty. Collaboration is highly valued in the Division as we recognize the social nature of learning and work, and we acknowledge the importance of student voice in the education process. Fairness, honesty, respect, and ethical behavior are aspects of responsible professional engagement that the Education Faculty seeks to model for and cultivate in the teacher candidates.</p></div>

For this reason, one can argue that a philosophy minor is an invaluable compliment to any academic discipline. Careers that are especially dependent on philosophy and philosophical thinking include law, politics, the sciences, theology, journalism, communication, management and education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Learning Outcomes</head><p>Students completing a minor in philosophy will be able to:</p><p>• Identify, comprehend, analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments in oral and written discourse. • Understand, analyze, interpret and apply major works in the areas of the History of Philosophy, Ethics and contemporary topics. • Be able to develop and express philosophical positions using the insights of philosophers and other thinkers. A study of the history of western philosophy which chronicles the major thinkers and their key thoughts. The history of philosophy is understood as an ongoing conversation which continues in our own day.

The development of research and critical thinking skills used to form historical interpretations, question assumptions, think imaginatively and develop clear, well-reasoned assessments will be emphasized, along with a commitment to life-long learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Description</head><p>One of the most common questions History students are asked is: "Why are you majoring in History?" On the surface, this seems like a simple question, but once you think about it you may find that it isn't all that easy to answer. History is different things to different people, and even historians debate the meaning of historical events among themselves.</p><p>Ultimately, history is personal. History is a part of everyone's life, and it affects us in ways we may not always think about. We live in a society that is the result of generations of development. The decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, fears, hopes, and feelings of people who have come before us have brought about the world we live in today. Knowing about the past can help us both appreciate the present and understand how we as a people and a society have come to this point in time. Past experience, if carefully considered, may offer lessons for dealing with present-day situations. Some might even argue that the past may offer clues to the future.</p><p>But what can you do with a degree in History? The simple answer is anything you want to do. People in widely diverse careers attribute their success to studying history as undergraduates. For example, people with undergraduate degrees in History work as attorneys and paralegals, in business, as writers and journalists, government officials, intelligence analysts, researchers, policy analysts, politicians, broadcasters, museum curators and teachers. A list of career opportunities can be found here: http://www.historians.org/pubs/Free/careers/Index.htm History majors at Notre Dame College also have the opportunity to work in numerous internships related to these careers. NDC History majors have interned in law offices, courts, libraries and historical societies, banks, fusion centers, think tanks and foreign embassies. And many NDC students who complete their undergraduate degrees in History eventually go on to earn graduate degrees.</p><p>Students who complete a minimum of twelve credits in history with a minimum GPA of 3.1 and an overall GPA of 3.0 or better will qualify for induction into Phi Alpha Theta, the national history honor society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs Outcomes</head><p>Students completing a major in History will be able to:</p><p>• Demonstrate a command of key historical terms and distinctions.</p><p>• Use historical language in keeping with established professional usage.</p><p>• Apply key historical concepts effectively.</p><p>• Demonstrate the ability to use historical analogies effectively.</p><p>• Analyze historical questions and issues clearly and precisely.</p><p>• Formulate historical information accurately, recognize and evaluate key historical assumptions.</p><p>• Identify and discuss fundamental historical problems knowledgeably.</p><p>• Recognize and evaluate important historical implications and consequences.</p><p>• Identify and compare relevant competing historical points of view, evaluate them and argue effectively in support of a specific historical perspective or interpretation. • Demonstrate excellent historical reasoning and problem-solving.</p><p>• Produce clear, precise, and well-reasoned work.</p></div>
