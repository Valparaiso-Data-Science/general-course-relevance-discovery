<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Miscellaneous Fees</head><p>Auditing -no credits earned $550/credit Payment of Tuition and Fees. Charges for tuition, room, meal plan and fees are billed to students each term. There are three alternatives for paying these charges:</p><p>1. Full payment is due on or before August 30, 2019, and January 3, 2020, respectively, for the Fall and Winter terms.</p><p>2. A deferred payment option provides for payment of half the balance due (after financial aid credits have been applied), plus a $20 processing fee for the Fall Term that must be paid by August 30, 2019, with a deferred second payment for the remaining balance on or before October 11, 2019. The first payment for Winter Term, plus a $20 processing fee is due on or before January 3, 2020, and the deferred second payment on or before February 7, 2020. A signed Deferred Payment Agreement form must be received by the Financial Services Office by the due date of the first payment for each term, August 30, 2019 and January 3, 2020 respectively.</p><p>3. An educational financing plan that permits payment of the annual expense over the academic year is available through Cashnet. Information is available from the Financial Services Office website at https://www.alma.edu/offices/financial-services/ for-students/payment-options.</p><p>Advance billings are available to be viewed and/or downloaded from the student portal approximately one month before the start of each term. Payment must be received by the College prior to registration, or the student will have to make payment at the Financial Services Office during registration. Students are not permitted to attend class without making satisfactory financial arrangements.</p><p>Payment of tuition and fee charges can be made with cash, personal checks, bank drafts, or money orders by mail or in person at the Alma College Financial Services Office. Payments can also be made online with a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover card, or with an e-check at the Financial Services Office website: www.alma.edu/paymybill. A 2.5% convenience fee is charged for all credit and debit card payments. There is no fee to make an electronic check payment. If the amount of the payment is more than the amount due, students may request a refund or the amount will be credited to their account. Account Holds. A student's account is placed on a financial hold for the following reasons:</p><p>1. The student has withdrawn or graduated and has not paid their account balance in full. Until the account balance is paid in full, a student's transcript and/or diploma cannot be released.</p><p>2. The student is an active, current student with an account balance of $1,000 or higher. An active, current student is not able to register or be placed in (or retain) a housing assignment for a future term until the account is under $1,000. Default of the repayment plan may result in loss of the student's registration and housing assignment.</p><p>Late Payment Fees. Tuition and fees are due before classes start for each term. A late payment fee of $25 per month is assessed on student accounts with a past due balance.</p><p>Failure to Meet Financial Obligations. In accordance with standard practice at colleges and universities, students are required to make satisfactory arrangements with the Financial Services Office for the settlement of all financial obligations. These include student accounts, student loans, parking fines, library fines, music record rentals and other expenses.</p><p>When a student fails to meet financial obligations, Alma College reserves the right to withhold the issuance of grades, transcripts and diplomas, and to suspend a student until the obligations are met. Unpaid balances on inactive student accounts will be referred to a collection agency. The student has responsibility for all costs and fees associated with the collection of the debt. Financial Aid. Any financial aid other than a work-study grant awarded by the College for the entire year will be prorated; 50% to be available Fall Term and 50% to be available Winter Term. A work-study grant may not be deducted from charges because this aid represents funds to be earned during the year. Scholarships and grants awarded by organizations other than Alma College will not be credited until actually received. The Director of Financial Aid must be notified of any scholarship or grant awarded by organizations and agencies other than Alma College. You may review all financial aid policies at https://www.alma.edu/admissions/financialaid/policies/ as it is your responsibility to be familiar with situations that may affect your financial aid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refund of Federal Title IV Financial Aid. The Higher Education</head><p>Amendments of 1998 mandates the formula for calculating the amount of financial aid a student and school may retain when a student withdraws from all classes before completing 60% of the term. Under Title IV financial aid regulations, the withdrawal date is defined as the earlier of:</p><p>1. The date the student began the withdrawal process or officially notified the institution of the intent to withdraw, or 2. The student's last date of documented attendance at an academically-related activity. If a student stops attending and fails to officially withdraw from classes, the student is considered to be unofficially withdrawn.</p><p>Unofficial withdrawal dates are determined by an end-of-term report from the Registrar's Office to identify students who have no passing grades. Faculty are contacted to determine the last date of attendance or academic activity for a student and that date is used as the withdrawal date.</p><p>If there is no proof of attendance beyond 60% completion of the term, the student is considered unofficially withdrawn and a refund calculation is performed.</p><p>Section 484B (c) of the HEA states that it is the institution's responsibility to determine a student's withdrawal date. Therefore, the institution, not the student, must document a student's attendance at an academically related activity. A student's certification of attendance that is not supported by documentation by the institution would not be acceptable documentation of the student's attendance.</p><p>The percentage of Title IV assistance earned is determined by dividing the total number of calendar days in the semester into the number of calendar days completed as of the withdrawal date. Any unearned aid must be returned to the Title IV program(s). Funds are returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Subsidized Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, Pell Grant, SEOG and other Title IV programs. The student must either repay the federal overpayment in full or make satisfactory arrangements with either the Alma College Financial Services Office or the federal Department of Education. The payment or arrangement for payment must be made within 45 days of the date of notification of the federal overpayment or the student will lose further eligibility of federal Title IV aid until the debt is paid in full. Withdrawal from College. Students who wish to withdraw from Alma College must complete the withdrawal process by contacting the Center for Student Opportunity (CSO). If this process is not</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alma College Credit</head><p>Alma College defines its credit hour in the context of the 4-4-1 calendar, just as institutions using semester systems link their credits to that calendar. The credit value of Alma courses is measured by "the Alma College 4-4-1 Credit Hour," hereafter referred to as an "Alma credit." An Alma credit is equivalent to 120/136 -or, rounded to nearest tenth, .9 -of a semester credit hour. It is likewise equivalent to 136/108 -or, rounded, 1.3 -of a quarter credit hour. These equivalences are used when calculating compliance with the federal definition of the credit hour (34CFR 600.2):</p><p>A credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally-established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:</p><p>(1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or 10-12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other activities as established by an institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading toward the award of credit hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contact Hours</head><p>Sixty minutes a week of classroom or direct faculty instruction constitutes 1 contact hour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Declaration</head><p>Each student must declare a major field of study before the end of the sophomore year by completing the major declaration form found online and at the Registrar's Office. Students may select a Departmental Major (at least 36 credits as prescribed by the department), an Interdepartmental Major (56 credits in courses approved by two or more departments and the Educational Policy Committee), or a Program of Emphasis [POE] (56-68 credits in courses selected by the student to meet a specific educational goal as approved by the POE Committee no later than November 15 of the junior year).</p><p>Students are required to earn at least a 2.0 ("C") cumulative GPA in their chosen major field of study for the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Music degrees. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree requires a 2.5 cumulative GPA and a minimum 3.0 GPA in all nursing (NUR) courses. For the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, a 3.0 GPA in the major is required. For teacher certification purposes, a 2.75 GPA is required for all coursework. Additional certification and other requirements are found in the Education Department section of this catalog. To satisfy degree requirements, courses completed outside the major area must total a minimum of 68 credits. completed, students will forfeit their deposits and refunds. The College assumes that students beginning a term intend to complete it. Students who leave during a term without completing the withdrawal process may receive failing grades for course enrollments and will be responsible for any tuition, and room and meal plan charges for the term. If a student has registered for a future term and decides not to attend that term, the student must contact the CSO to formally withdraw and be removed from those classes. Failure to do so will result in the student being responsible to pay for tuition, fees, and room and meal plan for the term, in its entirety.</p><p>For students meeting the withdrawal requirements, tuition and the student activity fee are refunded according to the following table.</p></div>
