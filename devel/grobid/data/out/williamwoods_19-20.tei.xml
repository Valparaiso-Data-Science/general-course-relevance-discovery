<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mission and Vision Mission</head><p>An independent voice in higher education, William Woods University distinguishes itself as a studentcentered and professions-oriented university committed to the values of ethics, self-liberation, and lifelong education of students in the world community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beliefs</head><p>• The liberal arts is the foundation of our mission.</p><p>• Responsiveness to student needs is paramount for success for both the students we serve and the institution's viability. • An academic environment demonstrates and promotes creative, intellectual inquiry.</p><p>• Positive relationships among students, faculty, and staff enhance the learning experience.</p><p>• Education is inclusive and student-centered.</p><p>• The institution has a responsibility to demonstrate and promote ethical behavior.</p><p>• Total development of the individual prepares the individual for a constantly changing world.</p><p>• The culture of our university and communities is conducive to the positive development of relationships among students, faculty, and staff. • A quality educational environment directly impacts outstanding student achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recognition</head><p>William Woods University enjoys the best of both worlds when it comes to reputation -attracting students, faculty and partners nationally for signature programs, while making a significant impact locally and statewide in fields such as business and education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History: Roots of Compassion, Future of Growth</head><p>Our Beginnings Our educational mission began more than 140 years ago in the aftermath of the Civil War in the year 1870. The Christian Church of Missouri, as a work of compassion, founded a school for girls who had been orphaned by the conflict. The Female Orphan School of the Christian Church of Missouri, as it was called, eventually moved to Fulton, our present home, and grew to include other young women in addition to war orphans.</p><p>Finances were always a challenge for this labor of love. In 1900, the school was saved from insolvency by a successful Missouri entrepreneur named Dr. William Stone Woods. Together with his wife, Dr. Woods wrote a check that redeemed the school's entire debt. In gratitude, the University has borne his name ever since.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deeply Held Values</head><p>We became a college officially in 1914. Our focus for the next fifty years was on training teachers, a profession built on compassion and the personal commitment to help others grow -values that we have held onto since the beginning. You can still see these values, stronger than ever, at work among faculty and students today. Our Education graduates continue to be outstanding teachers and leaders in the Missouri school system and beyond.</p><p>As we grew, we broadened our focus to encompass more of the liberal arts and other elements of higher education. Highlights along the way include the growth of an internationally recognized equestrian program, which offered the nation's first baccalaureate in equestrian science in 1972. We entered intercollegiate sports in 1974, with teams in basketball, softball, track, tennis and swimming.</p><p>From College to University 1990 marked a significant milestone: the election of our first female president, Dr. Jahnae H. Barnett. Dr. Barnett's charter was to secure a 21st-century future for William Woods.</p><p>Within two years we began offering a wide variety of graduate-level degree programs, geared toward the working adult. We went coed. And we changed the name from William Woods College to William Woods University. With generous support from alumni, foundations and other benefactors, our campus, our programs, and our student body began to look like the William Woods University of today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accreditation</head><p>The country's most established colleges and universities routinely open their doors to peers for an accreditation process -a way of ensuring that students and families receive a quality return on their educational investment.</p></div>

Students seeking a quality education are called to act in an academically honorable manner. To do so compels them to engage in certain behaviors and reject others. Being honorable involves behaving ethically and making moral choices consistent with an individual's conscience. William Woods University depends on the personal integrity of each member of our community to help create and foster an environment that celebrates and embraces acting for the greater good of society. Students' work and conduct should reflect their decision to act honorably. When students engage in academically dishonest or dishonorable behavior, they diminish the quality of the education they receive, distort the results of assignments, and negatively affect the reputation of their classmates and the University as a whole. When students are found to have engaged in an academically dishonest or dishonorable manner by a faculty member, fellow student, or staff member, they will face repercussions. All instances of academically dishonest behavior will be dealt with per the Academic Integrity Policy and recorded by the University in the student's record. To this end, it is incumbent on each student to act in an honorable manner about his or her education at William Woods University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Integrity/Honesty</head><p>William Woods University, founded on the principle of honesty, has long endeavored to maintain an atmosphere of academic integrity. In all academic work, it is important that the ideas and contributions of others be appropriately acknowledged, and that work that is presented as original is, in fact, original.</p><p>Ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at William Woods University is a responsibility shared by the entire campus community.</p><p>Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of honesty in their behavior. The following are examples of dishonest behavior and violations of the principle of academic integrity. These are examples and do not exhaust all conduct that could constitute violations of this academic integrity policy. Students are expected to refrain from:</p></div>

Do not request, or have others request on your behalf, any academic benefit, including an extension of time, a better grade, or a recommendation from an instructor when the request is based on false information or deception. 7.</p><p>Do not engage in any other form of academic misconduct not covered here. If you are ever in doubt, ask your instructor for guidance.</p><p>Owing to the diversity of programs across the University, faculty retain the latitude to make their own determinations as to the severity of any act of academic dishonesty they may encounter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Faculty Responsibility</head><p>Faculty are required to report incidents of student academic dishonesty so that the incident may be handled in a consistent, fair manner, and so that substantiated charges of misconduct may be noted in the student's record.</p><p>Faculty procedures for filing a complaint based on a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy 1.

Students who fail to apply for graduation cannot expect a program audit, inclusion in the commencement program, or participation in graduation ceremony.</p><p>Cohort Candidates will be reviewed the semester prior to the final semester on the cohort calendar. Students who will not be completing the program as scheduled on the cohort calendar will need to submit an application for graduation.</p><p>Students who apply for graduation and who complete all degree requirements will be contacted regarding diplomas, academic regalia, and commencement. The graduation fee is added to the student's accounts receivable statement approximately one month prior to conferral date. Diplomas and official transcripts will not be released until this fee is paid.</p><p>Diplomas will be ordered with the information confirmed by the student. Should the student wish to have a name changed after the diplomas have been ordered, it will be at the expense of the student.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Withdrawal</head><p>William Woods University cares about the physical and mental health of its students. The University recognizes that at times a student may experience such extreme physical or psychological conditions that the ability to function successfully or safely in the role of a student is significantly impaired. Students are encouraged to prioritize their health and safety and take steps toward recovery, even if academic progress must be delayed.</p><p>Students are encouraged to request a medical withdrawal when they believe their physical or mental health is preventing them from successfully engaging in and completing coursework; when safety is in question; or when the demands of university life are interfering with the ability to recover or adjust to a significant physical or mental health challenge. This can occur anytime throughout the semester; however, it may be more difficult to gain approval for medical withdrawal during the final three weeks of the session or semester.</p><p>Students interested in considering or pursuing a medical withdrawal are encouraged to discuss this option with the Dean of Student Life (venita.mitchell@williamwoods.edu). In most cases, students will need to provide documentation from their licensed provider that indicates that due to a specific mental or physical health condition(s), the student is impaired such that they are unable to function successfully or safely in the role of a student.</p><p>In the interest of gaining a better understanding of the student's need for a medical withdrawal, the University may require appropriate documentation and/or request for the student to sign appropriate release forms allowing designated WWU staff to consult with the evaluating and/or treating clinician(s) supporting the student.</p><p>Once appropriate documentation has been provided and decisions have been made regarding a student's status, the Dean of Student Life will notify the registrar's office of the need for a medical withdrawal and/or ability to successfully return. The student will then complete the on-line withdrawal form found on Owlnet. For all approved medical withdrawals, the student receives a W (withdrawal) on their academic transcript, or is completely dropped from classes, without any notation on the transcript of having left for medical reasons. Thus, a medical withdrawal will not affect the student's grade point average.</p><p>Refunds for medical withdrawals shall follow the University withdrawal calculation process found in the on the website which may result in no refund.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Readmit Process</head><p>In addition to completing the University readmit process, the majority of students granted a medical withdrawal must also complete the following procedures before being allowed to return to the University. These steps are designed to ensure that a health emergency no longer exists and a treatment plan for continuing good health and safety is in place:</p><p>·The student must be assessed by an appropriate outside professional whose opinions will be advisory to the University. The professional, who is selected by the student, must be a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist if evaluating mental health concerns, and must be a licensed physician if the evaluation is regarding other medical concerns. Further, all providers must be unrelated to the student and must have specialty/credentials appropriate for the condition of concern.</p><p>· Documentation of the assessment (conducted within 15-30 days of re-entry) and documentation of required treatment completion must be provided to the Dean of Student Life two weeks prior to the beginning of classes for the applicable session or semester.</p><p>·To make an accurate assessment, before conducting the evaluation it may be necessary that the provider be given information relating to the precipitating events that led to the leave. This typically would involve the student signing a release allowing the University to share information regarding relevant incidents or concerns and, if applicable, recent hospital records. The outside mental health or medical professional, with the student's written permission, must provide an assessment of current functioning of the student and provide written recommendations regarding:</p><p>· the student's readiness to return to the demands of university life; · the student's readiness to live in on-campus residential housing, if applicable; · ongoing treatment or testing needs, if any; and · any conditions or restrictions that the University should impose.</p><p>· After the evaluation results and treatment documentation have been provided, the Dean of Student Life, or designee, will communicate with the student to discuss the documentation and the student's perception regarding readiness to return and any on-going needs. Additionally, consideration will be given to how the recommendations fit with the demands of university life.</p><p>·If a student was required to complete specific treatment, the student must provide documentation regarding the completion of this requirement.</p><p>·The University reserves the right to require the student to comply with a treatment plan recommended by the outside professional and/or the University health care/mental health professional as a condition of returning. Review and monitoring of the student's required treatment plan may be assigned to a University designee assigned by the Dean of Student Life.</p><p>·If a student was living on campus prior to the withdrawal, approval for return to the University usually includes approval to return to housing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 101 Dawn and Rebirth: A History of the World to 1500</head><p>History is not imposed on the world. It is the result of the consequences of an individual's decisions, and the study of history involves analyzing the reasons behind these choices.

They were all dependent on horses. Want to learn about how horses have altered history on virtually every continent? Well then…giddy up. This course will tell the story of the horse in the World from prehistory to the modern era. Looking at the dual development of horses and humans, and focusing on important events and themes from the cavalry to racing to the Pony Express, this course will seek to uncover how the horse has shaped human history and culture throughout the World. This course is not a history of the horse breeds, nor is it just a class for equestrians-it is for anyone who seeks to learn more about how history has been shaped by two different species interactions.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 215 Native America -H</head><p>At least 11,000 years before the first European reached the "New World," the Americas had already been settled. Originally traveling from Siberia, numerous groups of Native Americans established diverse cultures and civilizations across two continents.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 216 From Slavery to Freedom to Civil Rights: The African American Experience</head><p>Until the passage of the thirteenth amendment, the inherent hypocrisy of the Declaration of Independence's phrase "all men are created equal" and the sin of slavery haunted the nation. But freedom did not end the struggle. This course will trace the history of African Americans from their ancestral origins in Africa into the colonial era and through the modern day-exploring issues of race, culture, enslavement, freedom, rights, and discrimination. It will examine the condition of African American slaves and anti-slavery/pro-slavery politics and economics, and ultimately follow the experience of enslaved and free African Americans into the Civil </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 224 History of War -H</head><p>Countless generations have gone to war, and the world has been dramatically shaped on and off the battlefield. How and why were these wars fought? What resulted? This class is centered on the choices these generations made and their consequences on society. The old adage declares, "All's fair in love and war," but throughout history, there has been debate over how wars are fought and the behavior of officers and soldiers. Are all wartime actions justified? Is victory the ultimate goal, or is the manner in which the war was fought equally as important? This course will examine the tactics and ethics of war and society from a civilian and military perspective. This course will frame an inquiry into how civilian ethical codes (such as honor, virtue, morality, and humanity) shape military policy, and how ideological thought alters the conduct of a war from the ancient world to the modern battlefield.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>

Although often viewed in a more modern context, the quest for women's rights in America has existed since the nation's founding. This course will follow the lives of American women from pre-contact Native society through the modern day. It will explore a variety of themes connected to gender, race, and status by observing the lives of women within diverse societies. In doing so, students will learn to view the women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 70s against the foundations of the nineteenth and early twentieth century suffragists and the Revolutionary-era Daughters of Liberty and Republican Womanhood. From the witches of Salem to Susan B. Anthony to Gloria Steinem, this course overall aims to tell the story of women in America.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 311 Biography as History</head><p>History is a collection of stories of the lives of many people, but is the life of a single person history? But who tells our story? Who determines our history? Today, journalists, rather than historians, write most of the popular biographies. So is biography also history? Or is it something else? This course will follow the intersection of the individual story with that of society, asking several fundamental questions: Does history change if we view it from the perspective of one person? Is the individual representative of society? Why do people make certain choices? What is gained through using a narrow lens to view wider events? Focusing on rotating individuals, this course will explore a historical period through the eyes of a single person. Students will read multiple accounts of the life of one person, and write their own narrative on a selected person during a limited timeframe.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>

The British army has fired at American colonists in Lexington and Concord; do you join the Patriots or keep your oath of loyalty to the King? Civil War has broken out and your home state has succeeded from the Union, but you are an officer in the US Army. Do you join the Confederacy? It's August 1945, you're Harry Truman and Japan won't surrender. Do you drop the atomic bomb? History is full of turning points where the decisions of one person or a group of people have shaped the future. This course will explore these historical turning points and seek to understand why people made certain choices. Students will be asked to evaluate the mindset, ethics, and ideologies of historical individuals in order to evaluate decisions and consequencesultimately asking the question "What would I do?"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 324 American Revolution</head><p>The American Revolution is perhaps the single most important event in the history of the United States. This class will examine the ideological and intellectual framework that made this revolution possible. The war will be examined not only as a military conflict, but also an event with tangible political, social, economic, racial, and gendered applications. Using primary and secondary sources, this class will be centered on understanding the American mindset from the French and Indian War through the War of 1812. It will analyze how thought influenced action in America ranging from the war to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 332 Civil War</head><p>Throughout the American Revolution, patriots had cast British tyranny as reducing them to slavery. The Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution reaffirmed liberty to its citizens, but the inherent hypocrisy of the phrase "all men are created equal" when cast against Revolutionary ideology and the institution of slavery continued to haunt the nation. This course will trace the coming of the Civil War from early republican and antebellum debates on slavery to Manifest Destiny and through Southern secession. It will then examine how the Civil War represented differing definitions over the Revolutionary conception of liberty. From the floor of Congress to the battlefield of Gettysburg, students will explore the question of regional character, state's rights, pro/antislavery, and governmental authority. In addition to examining national questions, this course will also focus on the role of Missouri as a boarder states and the local history of the Kingdom of Callaway.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 338 The Atlantic World: Exploration, Colonization, and Globalization</head><p>For centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was a barrier. This formidable body of water represented a vast unknown. The discovery of the New World challenged many of the conceptions held by the Old World. The discovery of the Americas forced Europeans to re-evaluate both themselves and their understanding of the world intellectually, religiously, and geographically. Within a short time, the Atlantic Ocean became a bridge not a barrier. The Atlantic connected four continents (Europe, Africa, North America, and South America) in a network of trade, communication, language, culture, and migration. From the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries, the flow of goods, people, and ideas developed and shaped these coastal lands. Yet the Atlantic represented much more than simply an avenue for maritime trade. It was an entity that affected the daily life of much of the known world. This course will investigate topics ranging from the Enlightenment, exploration, empire, monarchy, slavery, piracy, revolutions, and seek to answer how far was the reach of the Atlantic?</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 341 Cold War</head><p>"An iron curtain has descended…," proclaimed former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. On <ref type="bibr">March 5, 1946</ref> in Fulton, MO, less than a mile from the William Woods' campus, Churchill created a lasting metaphor to describe the mounting crisis between the Soviet Union and the West that would come to dominate the globe for nearly the next half century. Not even a year after the Allied victory in World War II, the world was to be drawn into conflict again-a shadow war fought on both sides with ideology and fear. The Cold War was waged between Marxism and communism against democracy and capitalism. This course will explore the period from 1945-1991 from a global viewpoint, highlighting the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Covering topics ranging from James Bond to the Berlin Wall, students will explore the ways in which the struggle between communism and democracy influenced daily life, foreign policy, and global conflict.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>

Then this course is for you! But what is public history? Public history simply is presenting history for a general audience, not academics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIS 353 World War II</head><p>The Great War had been fought as "the war to end all wars," and twenty years later British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain still promised "peace in our time." But just six years later, nearly 80 million people were dead. Sparked by the rise of dictatorships, World War II was a clash of nations that represented a global conflict on a scale never before imagined. Exploring the perspectives of both the Allied and Axis powers, students will learn how the clash of ideologies and beliefs resulted in conquest, genocide, and, ultimately, liberation. Although traditionally understood as occurring from 1939-1945, this course will start from the war's origins-beginning with the end of World War I through the rise of the Nazi Party to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Far from just a military history of war in Europe and the Pacific, this course will examine topics including: the Holocaust, ideologies (democracy, communism, fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, etc.), the A-bomb, world leaders (FDR, Truman, Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, etc.), politics, propaganda, crime, the home front, and many more. Concluding with the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Trials and the start of the Cold War, the class will also examine the war's legacy and aftermath.</p><p>Credits: 3.00</p></div>

Quantitative (hours attempted and earned) and qualitative (cumulative GPA) SAP progress is measured. 3. Grades of I, CR, W, WP, and WF are counted toward hours attempted. 4. Changes in major may alter your SAP status, which is based upon the current degree level pursued; therefore, if you change your major, you may be permitted to go beyond the published length of completion. 5. Students meeting the standards listed above when calculated are in Title IV SAP good standing. If either the quantitative or qualitative measures are not meet, the student is not in good SAP standing 6. Rules are applied uniformly to all students for all periods of enrollment whether or not aid has been previously received. 7. Students who are on academic dismissal are not Title IV eligible. (See appeals and Reinstatement). Courses not successfully completed are considered hours attempted and not earned. Unsuccessfully completion of credit hours means earning grades of F or W. 4. All courses designated as repeated for grade improvement count as hours attempted, but only count once if passed as hours earned. 5. Courses attempted repetitively for credit count as both hours attempted and passed as hours earned. 6. Audit and no-credit classes are ineligible for financial aid and do not count in Title IV SAP calculations. 7.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_25"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Liberal Arts A.A. -61 CreditsThe Associate of Arts (A.A.) is a 61-hour degree rooted in the University's General Education curriculum. Program completion qualifies a student for admission into a degree completion program of the University and meets the institution's general education requirements.A maximum of 30 hours of transfer credit may be applied toward the Associate of Arts degree. Credits are accepted at full value provided that the transferring institution is accredited by an agency recognized by the USDE (U.S. Department of Education) and CHEA (Council for Higher Education Accreditation). Courses that are comparable to William Woods University course offering are accepted in transfer. Courses accepted in transfer must have a final grade earned of "C" or above.Transfer courses meeting general education objectives will be applied toward the degree.Students may participate in placement testing for the English Composition and Mathematics classes. Placement tests may be arranged with the student's academic advisor. Depending upon English placement, students will initially enroll in Introduction to College Writing (ENG099), English Composition I (ENG101) or English Composition II (ENG102). Depending upon math placement, each student's first mathematics course will be Introduction to Mathematics (MAT098), Basic Algebra (MAT099) or Survey of College Math (MAT112).ENG099, MAT098 and MAT099 count for institutional credit, but do not count towards degree requirements.Students who choose not to participate in the English placement testing will complete ENG099, ENG101 and ENG102. Students who choose not to participate in the mathematics placement testing will complete MAT098, MAT099, and MAT112.This program prepares graduates to assume leadership positions by immersing them in a leadership development program grounded in management and leadership theory. The skills inherent in leadership include resolving conflict, decision-making, adapting to change, and providing vision, motivating others and achieving organizational goals. These are critical and necessary skills for every type of organization. The program focuses on what students need to 'know' and what they need to 'do' in order to be effective leaders.</figDesc><table><row><cell>ITP 310 ART 230 ASL 105 HIS 215 BIO 125 PSY 101 MAT 314 MIS 125 BUS 315 ACC 319</cell><cell>Interpreting in Advanced Settings I Survey Of Western Art I -A American Sign Language I -D Native America -H Gen Bio II Lab General Psychology I -S Higher Geometry Productivity Tools Customer Service Taxation for Entrepreneurs</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 0.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Required Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Required Required Required Elective</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ITP 410 ART 231 ASL 120 HIS 314 CHM 115 PSY 102 MAT 324 BUS 332 ACC 343 Management Information Systems BS Interpreting in Advanced Setting II Survey of Western Art II -A Deaf Culture -D Teaching History -H General Chemistry I Lab General Psychology II -S Formal Logic Ethics Requirement -3 Credits Business Communications Cost and Managerial Accounting</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 0.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Required Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Required Required Elective</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ITP 450 ART 333 GEO 201 CHM 116 PSY 221 MAT 325 BUS 214 BUS 335 ACC 412 Management Information Systems -51 Credits Senior Capstone Women, Art &amp; Society -A Regions &amp; Nations of the World I -D Meaning -must complete at least 3 General Chemistry I Lab transfer st Educational Psychology -S Introduction to Numerical Analysis Business Ethics -E Business Law Advanced Productivity Tools</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 1.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Required Elective Elective Elective Elective Required Elective Required Elective</cell></row><row><cell>ITP 451 MUS 101 GEO 202 CHM 125 PSY 285 MAT 422 BUS 329 BUS 357 ACC 441</cell><cell>Field Practicum I Music Fundamentals -A Regions &amp; Nations of the World II -D Credits General Chemistry II Lab Psychology of Personality -S Modern Algebra Managerial Ethics -E Non-profit Management Auditing</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 0.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Required Elective Elective Elective Elective Required Elective Required Elective</cell></row><row><cell>ITP 452 MUS 103 HUM 237 ENG 201 PHY 202 SWK 203 MAT 423 BUS 307</cell><cell>Field Practicum II Music Appreciation -A Woods Around the World World Masterpieces I -L Physics I Lab Aging in America -A New Genertn Theory of Numbers Economics Requirement -3 Credits Retail Management</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 1.00 3.00 0.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Required Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Required Elective</cell></row><row><cell>MUS 111 HUM 240 ENG 202 PHY 203 SWK 215 ECN 251 BUS 309</cell><cell>Grammar/Rhetoric Elective -3 Credits Jazz, Pop and Rock -A Toward a Life of Service -D World Masterpieces II -L Physics I Lab for transfer students Social Welfare -S Macroeconomics -S Salesmanship</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 1.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ENG 222 MUS 171 PHL 102 ENG 205 PHY 213 SWK 273 ECN 252 Advertising &amp; Marketing Introduction to Rhetoric -L Music History I -A World Religions -D English Literature I -L Physics II Lab Crime Victimization in America Microeconomics -S BUS 428 Public Relations</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 0.00 3.00 3.00 3.00</cell><cell>Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ENG 301 MUS 271 SCA 353 ENG 206 SCI 131 Management and Leadership BS Grammar and Syntax Music History II -A Race and Ethnicity -D English Literature II -L Foundations of Science Lab Critical Thinking -must complete at least Advertising &amp; Marketing Concentration -15 Credits BUS 431 Advertising</cell><cell>3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 0.00 3.00</cell><cell>Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective Elective</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Social Service Elective -3 Credits Introduction to Theatre -A Elementary Spanish I -D Introduction to Film Studies -L What is Life?
