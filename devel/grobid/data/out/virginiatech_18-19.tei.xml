<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Eligibility Appeals</head><p>Students who are suspended due to academic eligibility at the end of fall or spring terms may appeal their suspension to the University Appeals Committee. The University Appeals Committee is comprised of the associate deans of undergraduate studies of the academic colleges and one faculty member appointed by the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Academic Affairs. A representative of the Dean of Students Office participates as a non-voting member of the committee to provide any information and background available through their advocacy services. The University Appeals Committee is an advisory committee to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Academic Affairs.</p><p>Any appeal for exceptions to the academic eligibility requirements must be based on clear extenuating circumstances beyond a student's control that negatively impacted academic performance. If an appeal is based on physical, psychiatric, or disability/learning disability reasons, the appeal must be reviewed by the Health Evaluating Committee. A recommendation letter from the appropriate office is required to complete an appeal petition.</p><p>Students must complete an academic appeals petition and submit all required documentation to the associate dean of their major college by the published college deadline. Failure to meet the published deadline results in the loss of opportunity to appeal for the term. Students have a right to appear in person at the appeals meeting. Students may not bring an outside advocate to an appeals meeting.</p><p>Full instructions and forms for academic appeals are available on each academic college website along with the dates of the academic appeals meetings. The associate dean of the student's major college may require a preliminary meeting to discuss the appeal. The associate dean also may establish an independent submission deadline prior to each University Appeals committee meeting.</p><p>If the University Appeals Committee denies an appeal, the student may request further consideration of the academic appeal by the provost's representative. The decision of the provost's representative is final and there is no further recourse. If completing more than one degree (not a second major) only courses for the primary degree will transfer. Students completing more than one degree (not a second major) must complete an extra 30 hours for their second degree in residence (at <ref type="bibr">Virginia Tech)</ref>. Authorization is denied if a student is on academic suspension while taking the course(s). Transfer credits do not affect GPA, but professional and graduate schools will typically review the grades on the original transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Requirements and Degree Conferrals</head><p>The approved requirements in effect for the year/term of application for degree apply. A student must complete all courses with at least a minimum 2.00 GPA for all hours attempted. In addition, a student must present an equally satisfactory record in courses attempted in the major and/or any minor. The number of credit hours required varies from one major to another. Virginia Tech reserves the right to modify requirements in the student's program if necessary. Degree r must be approved two years prior to their effective use. The approved graduation requirements (referenced as graduation checksheets) appear at the University Registrar website: https://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.</p><p>All students must earn 25% of credits required for their respective degree from <ref type="bibr">Virginia Tech.</ref> No more than fifty (50) percent of credit hours earned from a two year institution may be used to satisfy graduation requirements. Students who must enroll in foreign language courses to complete admission requirements may not use the credits toward completion of the degree.</p><p>Undergraduate students are permitted to complete a maximum of 18 of their last 45 hours in absentia and to transfer to complete their graduation requirements, so long as the request to transfer these credits meets all the current requirements in effect (transfer transcript is required and approval of the student's Academic Dean). In addition, the credits to be transferred may consist of required as well as elective credits as long as prior approval has been obtained from the student's Academic Dean to transfer any required credits. Undergraduate students studying away from campus during their last 45 hours may apply for an individual waiver of the requirement that a maximum of 18 of their last 45 hours may be earned in absentia. Approval of the request will be at the discretion of their academic dean. This does not preclude the requirement that at least 25% of all credits be earned in residence at Virginia Tech.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation with Distinction (Academic Policies Governing Enrollment Section)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Study Requirement</head><p>Students must meet a language study requirement either through middle and high school enrollment or prior to receipt of the undergraduate degree. The minimum requirement may be met in middle or high school by completing two units of a single foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. Some majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences may require 3 units of a single foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. Students completing the requirement at Virginia Tech may not count the hours toward degree completion. The requirement also may be met after admission by one of the following:</p><p>Earning six (6) semester hours of college-level foreign or classical language credit or American Sign Language. Such credits are in addition to that number normally required for graduation in a student's program of study.</p><p>Receiving credit by examination for a foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. The credit by examination option is available only to students who have gained knowledge of a foreign language without the benefit of formal training. This privilege is intended to recognize informal nonacademic learning experience and is not offered to a student who has had regular classroom instruction in that foreign language. Contact the Department of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures for more information.</p><p>For the student to be granted a re-examination, approval is required by the instructor, the student's department head, and the student's academic dean. In determining the validity of the student's request, consideration is given to class performance and completion of assigned work. The University Registrar provides verification of compliance with the requirements of this policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Appeal Procedure</head><p>As Per University policy, the assignment of a grade is the sole prerogative of the instructor of the class. It is incumbent on the instructor to establish the criteria for grading in the syllabus that is distributed at the beginning of the term. All grades are to be based on established grading criteria and not on personal conduct or opinions unrelated to academic standards. An individual student may not do extra work to raise his/her grade. If a student feels that a grade has been calculated incorrectly or has been assigned in a prejudiced or capricious manner, the student should discuss the matter with the instructor. If discussion between the instructor and the student cannot resolve the issue, the student should appeal to the department/division head. In the unusual circumstance that resolution does not occur at the departmental/divisional level, the student may appeal to the college dean who will attempt to reconcile the matter by whatever mechanism seems most appropriate for that college and for that case. A grade appeal must be made by the student as soon as possible but no later than the end of the student's subsequent term of enrollment after the grade in question has been assigned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades and Grade Points</head><p>The academic achievement of a student in a specific course is rated as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Letter Grade Grade Points for each hour</head><p>A grade of "I" (incomplete) may be given when the requirements of a course other than the final examination have not been completed due to illness or extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control. The "I" grade is the prerogative of the instructor. To remove an "I" grade, lecture course requirements must be satisfied during the student's first subsequent term of enrollment, and laboratory course requirements must be satisfied prior to the end of the first term during which the course is offered and the student is enrolled. Incomplete and "X" grades are automatically converted to "F" if requirements are not fully satisfied during the period of time allowed. An "NR" grade is assigned automatically by the system when a student is enrolled for a class and no other grade is assigned by the instructor. The "NG" is intended to be a grade distinguishable from those initially assigned by the instructor and thus to indicate clearly the origin of the grade. "W" Grade: Courses from which a student withdraws under the terms of the policy, will appear on their transcript with a "W" grade, but will not count in the GPA hours nor in any GPA calculations. The "W" signifies that this policy was invoked and does not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for use remain the student's purview. Grade Point Average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of quality credits earned by the total number of hours attempted at Virginia Tech, except courses passed on a Pass/Fail basis and courses with an "X" (Continuing Course). "NG" grades are computed as "F" grades in determining GPA. The GPA is unaffected by the "I" grade, unless or until the "I" is  <ref type="table">Course)</ref> ---converted to an "F" for failure to complete the course requirements within the allotted time. All courses repeated count in the calculation of the grade point average unless changed to Pass/Fail per policy. Repeated Courses: A student may not repeat courses in order to improve his or her grade average where a grade of "C or higher has been earned. An assigned grade of "A-D" for the second occurrence will be changed to a grade of "P" whenever a graduation analysis (DARS report) detects a repeated course with a "C" or better grade. Repeating a course where the course is "C-" or below, both instances of the graded course will be computed in the grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grades (Midterm)</head><p>Midterm grades are produced for freshmen and transfer students whose first term of enrollment is fall semester. Beginning Fall 1996, students whose first term of enrollment is summer will also receive a midterm grade report during fall semester. "Satisfactory" is given for work earning a grade of C or better and "unsatisfactory" is given for work earning a grade of C-or below. The midterm grade is not part of the student's permanent academic record and is only intended to be an early indication of the student's progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Requirements (Grade Hours Passed or Completed)</head><p>The "total credits" figure on the displayed grade report is not necessarily the same as the total hours (often referenced as hours passed) required for completion of the degree (not all credit hours are effective toward graduation requirements). Students are responsible for verifying required hours for completion by reviewing their degree analysis (DARS) with their advisor.</p><p>Listed below are a few examples of typical situations yielding "pass" hours which must be subtracted to determine the total credits useful toward graduation requirements:</p><p>Transfer and/or advanced placement credits that have been subsequently duplicated by courses at <ref type="bibr">Virginia Tech.</ref> Credits earned at Virginia Tech that have been duplicated by repeating courses or taking courses ruled to have duplicating credit. Transfer credits allowed from a two-year college that are in excess of one-half of the total credit hour requirement for the curriculum. Credits for Physical Education Service Activities courses (now listed under HNFE), which exceed a total of two, the maximum allowed toward a bachelor's degree. Credits for military science that exceed the total specified by the college for the student's curriculum. Credits on the pass/fail grading system that exceed 12 credit hours allowable exclusive of pass/fall only courses. Credits for courses that do not count towards the degree, (e.g. UNIV 1004 College Success Strategies)..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission (International Applicants)</head><p>International applicants for undergraduate admission are generally considered out-of-state students for tuition purposes and should apply using the Application for International Admission. International student applicants must complete the following courses: 3 units of math (includes algebra, geometry, and algebra II), 2 units of laboratory science (choose from biology, chemistry, or physics), and additional academic units (foreign language is highly recommended).</p><p>International freshman applicants are not required to submit SAT or ACT scores. In addition, international students whose native language is not English must document proficiency in the English language by submitting a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score. Official copies of all scores must be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.</p><p>The TOEFL or IELTS is required of all applicants who are not native speakers of English, in addition to all foreign students with visas, except those raised or schooled in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, or other countries in which English is the language of instruction. A TOEFL score of at least 80 (with no subscore below 20) on the Internet-based test is expected. Students taking the IELTS are expected to obtain a score of at least 6.5 to be considered for admission to Virginia Tech. Achieving these scores is no guarantee of admission. Transfer applicants who have completed two semesters or terms of a non-ESL English composition course with above-average grades at an accredited U.S.-based college or university are not required to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores.&lt; Non-English transcripts and documents must be submitted in their original form, accompanied by a certified English translation. Unofficial documents and documents without accompanying English translations will not be accepted.</p><p>All university-level work completed outside the United States must be evaluated by a professional educational credential evaluation service. (A listing of credential evaluators is linked on the online international application.) No financial aid is available for international students at the undergraduate level. All undergraduate international applicants must certify that they have sufficient funds to pay for their education at Virginia Tech prior to being issued an I-20 or IAP-66.</p><p>All international students holding F-1 and J-1 visas must purchase health and accident insurance.</p><p>The Cranwell International Center provides a full range of services to international students at Virginia Tech. Such services include an orientation program especially designed to meet the needs of new international students, as well as immigration counseling and counseling for personal and financial problems. The center also coordinates a variety of cross-cultural programs designed to facilitate interaction between American and international students.</p><p>http://www.schev.edu/index/tuition-aid/in-state-residency for additional information.</p><p>Residence or physical presence in Virginia primarily to attend the University does not entitle students to instate tuition rates.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our Mission</head><p>The mission of the Virginia Tech Honors College is to inspire and facilitate an extraordinary undergraduate education for students of exceptional motivation and ability who seek to be active learners and who will apply their knowledge and skills to critical real-world problems. To this end, the Honors College provides opportunities and challenges founded on meaningful and sustained relationships with faculty, independent learning, undergraduate research, place-based and problem-focused experiences, and intellectual engagement in global contexts. Our requirements are designed to maximize the disciplinary depth, transdisciplinary capabilities, and purpose-driven engagement that are the hallmarks of the VT-Shaped student experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admissions</head><p>The freshman and transfer applications to Virginia Tech automatically include consideration for admission to the Honors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships. The Honors College does not consider minimum test scores. We look holistically at an applicant's experiences and consider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, self-awareness and reflection on involvement, and authenticity. Transfer students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.60 or better at their previous institution. Currently enrolled Virginia Tech students will receive an invitation to apply to the Honors College at the end of each fall or spring semester provided they have achieved a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA and have at least four (4) semesters remaining at Virginia Tech before they graduate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Laureate Diploma</head><p>Virginia Tech Honors College students work toward an Honors Laureate Diploma. This diploma offers two options: the first is self-directed by the student, the second maintains that flexibility, but focuses the honors credit options around a particular curricular area established in advance by the Honors College in collaboration with disciplinary departments. An honors diploma appears on the Virginia Tech diploma as a special designation and is not a separate document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Academic Requirements The Course of Study Planner &amp; GPA</head><p>The Course of Study Planner (COSP) To demonstrate potential to earn an Honors Laureate Diploma, the Honors College expects that students receive approval on their COSP by the end of their first semester in Honors. GPA To demonstrate that students can meet the level of academic achievement we expect in Honors, students are required to achieve a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA after two traditional semesters in Honors. A 3.6 or better cumulative GPA from the semester at Virginia Tech immediately previous to entering the Honors College may count toward this requirement. GPA Flex Period Once students accomplish the above goals, they may enter the GPA Flex Period. The GPA Flex Period is a time in which the Honors College no longer monitors GPA. This gives students the freedom to take academic risks that can become some of their most educational experiences. Graduation Requirement Students in the GPA Flex Period must achieve a cumulative 3.30 or better GPA and complete honors diploma requirements. (Students who never receive COSP approval and never enter the GPA Flex Period are required to maintain a 3.60 cumulative GPA after every semester until the planner is approved or upon graduation.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Diploma Progress</head><p>Complete at least thirty honors credits. Elements Two, Three, and Four each require at least six honors credits. Earn honors credit at least once every twelve months and complete the yearly Progress Survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading Scale</head><p>Take courses as A-F unless P/F is the only option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Advising</head><p>A primary function of the Honors College is to support student efforts to individualize their education through a self-designed honors diploma that complements their departmental degree(s). Students can find support in the Honors Peer Advising Center and with the honors staff.</p><p>The Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors Peer Advisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors Peer Advising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students.</p><p>The Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors Peer Advisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors Peer Advising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students.</p><p>The honors staff also welcomes student appointments and walk-in visits. Each staff member has a distinct specialization with which they can assist students.</p><p>Furthermore, advising for major national scholarships, such as Rhodes and Marshall, is available through the Honors College for all Virginia Tech students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors Residential Communities</head><p>Honors College students have two Honors residential community options: the Hillcrest Community of about 100 students in Hillcrest Hall and the Honors Residential Commons of about 320 students in East Ambler Johnston Hall. Both communities are multigenerational and multidisciplinary, housing first-year students to fifth-year seniors from all seven colleges at Virginia Tech.</p><p>Honors students are not required to live in an Honors residential community. Many students live off-campus or in other living-learning communities or residence halls. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduate Course Descriptions (UH)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Academic Advising Center</head><p>The University Academic Advising Center serves the university community in several ways. First, it administers the University Studies and Explore Technology programs for new undergraduate students who want to explore a variety of degree programs before they commit to one particular major. Students who enter Virginia Tech as University Studies or Explore Technology are not limited to pursuing a specific major in their first year. With the guidance of a professional academic advisor, students research the full range of degree programs related to their interests and design programs of study that meet graduation requirements while providing the academic flexibility to pursue whichever degree program they ultimately choose. Second, the Advising Center assists new students who intend to reapply to competitive admission majors. Advisors work with these students in developing programs of study that meet the established criteria for admission into their chosen major. For both of these student populations, the University Academic Advising Center serves as both the college and department, providing administrative services, dean's office services, and academic advising until the students enter a specific major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Studies</head><p>University Studies is a major but it is not a degree-granting program. University Studies offers a structured advising program that provides students with the necessary support and strategies to investigate and compare academic disciplines so that they can make informed decisions about the degree programs they will pursue. Students can explore any major available at the university while completing course requirements toward a baccalaureate degree. To ensure that students graduate in a timely manner, University Studies requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the time they have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or have attempted 72 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explore Technology (XT)</head><p>XT is a major but it is not a degree granting program. XT allows students to explore majors that are related to technology and adds technological skills to other existing majors. All students in XT will take the Exploring Technology Pathways to Success course. This course will allow you to explore different majors that fit your skills and interests while preparing you for success at Virginia Tech. The course is part of the First Year Experience program and, best of all, will be taught by your academic advisor. To ensure that students graduate in a timely manner, XT requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the time they have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or have attempted 72 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restricted Majors</head><p>University Studies and Explore Technology students can pursue any major offered at the university; however, students should be aware that some majors are competitive for internal transfer. These programs have established specific criteria and application procedures that students must fulfill in order to be considered for internal transfer into the major. In general, these criteria require students to demonstrate proficiency in designated core courses and, for some programs, in introductory major courses before they are eligible to apply. University Studies and Explore Technology students enter and graduate from these restricted programs each year; however, since there is no guarantee of acceptance to these programs, students are encouraged to investigate alternative majors even as they prepare to enter a restricted program. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restricted Programs for Internal Transfers</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>College of Engineering All majors</head><p>Academic advisors in the University Academic Advising Center are familiar with the internal transfer criteria and procedures for all restricted programs and will assist students in fulfilling these requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pathways to General Education</head><p>All undergraduate students at the university, regardless of their majors, are required to fulfill general education course requirements in English, mathematics, science, social science, humanities, etc. There is a standard set of these courses, Pathways to General Education, which all degree programs incorporate in their graduation requirements.</p><p>In general, General Education requirements are completed in the freshman and sophomore years. Some majors are flexible with regard to which General Education courses can be used to fulfill degree requirements; other majors designate specific General Education course selections. Academic advisors assist University Studies and Explore Technology students in selecting courses that apply toward as many of the majors a student is considering as possible. Thus, students fulfill degree requirements for graduation while they are exploring majors and are usually able to graduate on time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examples of Accomplishments at the National Level</head><p>Over the past two years, Marc Edwards, professor of civil and environmental engineering, and his team of students and research scientists uncovered widespread lead-in-water contamination in Flint, Michigan. The team collected samples from locations across Flint and found extremely high levels of lead and other contaminants in the city's drinking water. In March 2016, the Virginia Tech team of students returned to Flint on spring break, working alongside citizen volunteers in Flint collecting water samples for another round of lead testing. Results from the second round of testing showed Flint water is still not safe to drink, but should continue to be used, flushing lead from the system and allowing it to heal. Edwards, a leading expert in safe drinking water and the deterioration of the water delivery infrastructure in America's largest cities, has worked to seek solutions to the crisis. He serves on Michigan Gov. Snyder's advisory group and has testified multiple times before Congress on the crisis. Edwards was named on Time's top 100 list of influential world leaders in 2016.</p><p>The Hyperloop at Virginia Tech team scored big in Texas during design weekend and in the first competition round in California with two fourth place finishes and a Technical Excellence Award against more than 120 teams representing many of the top universities in the world. The Hyperloop competition pitted teams designing systems for the Hyperloop transportation system, a project initiated by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk. The Hyperloop is a high-speed transportation system using a nearvacuum tube to propel a passenger-carrying pod at speeds potentially in excess of 700 miles per hour. The Virginia Tech team's design incorporates magnets not only to levitate the pod, but also to provide braking power. The team will be one of more than 20 that move on to build a prototype to be tested at a An aerospace and ocean engineering student team won first place in the NASA-sponsored University Aeronautics Engineering Design Challenge competition with its concept of a twin-fuselage unmanned aircraft fueled by liquid hydrogen. The winning concept was dubbed "Gobble Hawk" by the team. The competition is not meant to create aircraft that will be built and flown, but to spur design skills among college engineering students. Team members were Jordan Ambers, Bennett Coffey, Katie Hettmann, Kyle Johnson, Brian Petrosky, Tristan Pietrzak, Matt Schmit, Cory Reed, and Sarah Woodward.</p></div>

Because the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of spaces in entering classes, only those who demonstrate such qualifications to a high degree will be selected. Most entering students will have completed three or more years at an accredited university by the time of matriculation; however, applications will be accepted from students who have completed at least 60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours of university credit by the end of the spring term of the year for which application is being made, and who have a grade point average of at least 2.8 on a four-point scale. Exceptional students with the minimum university course work are encouraged to apply.</p><p>A number of college courses, with laboratory classes, are required for entry into the DVM program including biological sciences, organic chemistry, and physics. An 8-semester-hour or 12-quarter-hour sequence is required for each of these subjects. A one-semester course (3 semester hours) in biochemistry will meet the minimum requirement for entry.</p><p>Further courses required include 6 semester hours or 9 quarter hours of college-level courses in English, mathematics, and humanities/social sciences. In addition, many courses contributing to a well-rounded liberal education are of direct value and, although proficiency in the sciences is essential to the understanding of veterinary medicine, concentration on the sciences at the undergraduate level is not essential. Those students who elect to major in disciplines other than the biological sciences, chemistry, or physics may find less difficulty in coping with the basic sciences in veterinary medical school if they have, in addition to the above mentioned required courses, some work in either advanced biology or advanced chemistry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Program -Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Years</head><p>The Professional Program employs design theory and processes to study the design of buildings. Students conduct an interactive investigation of architectural space, environmental forces, and building technology. Foundations of discipline-specific knowledge are progressively introduced, discussed, and examined as they contribute to the complex totality of a work of architecture. Students explore natural and cultural forces as they relate to architecture through means of representation specific to the discipline. With architecture at the core, the program examines interdisciplinary sources such as art, science, and philosophy for the purpose of establishing the content the discipline shares with other forms of knowledge.</p><p>Concepts in the Professional Program are communicated through both traditional drawings and models, as well as through modern virtual tools and digital production. All coursework seeks to develop the ability to conduct a professional written and verbal discourse. Further emphasis is placed on intellectual discipline, constructive dialogue, assertion of interest, and a self-motivated search for critical issues.</p><p>The second year is characterized by an increase in the complexity of design exercises to foster a better understanding of the interplay between situation, time and desired spatial definition. Architectural constructs of smaller scales build on knowledge of basic design principles studied in the first year. The laboratory discourse focuses on principal elements of architecture and their compositional and material role in space. Architecture as the art of building is conveyed through the detailed study of exemplary built works.</p><p>The third year provides for study of fundamental design principles, technical concepts and their applications, including measures of quality in architecture. The instructional content of this year articulates and communicates to students the unique nature of architecture through the study of interrelationships of material, construction systems, site, and building programs. The Architecture III design laboratory guides the student's growing experience with practical design problems and provides order to the gradual exploration and learning of the nature and means of achieving architecture. Associated with Architecture Ill are lectures, presentations, and workshops intended to challenge students toward sensible integration of necessary systems and legal responsibilities in the design and construction of buildings.</p><p>The fourth year builds on the increased comprehension of building systems acquired during the third year. On-campus or off-campus, the aim of the various program options is to promote an in-depth understanding of the relationship between architectural idea and physical building form. On-campus students are offered studio courses with various focus topics. Off-campus options include several VT and non-VT Study Abroad Programs, the Extern Program, the Washington-Alexandria Center, or the Chicago Studio.</p><p>Off-campus programs directed by the Virginia Tech School of Architecture + Design include:</p><p>The Europe Study Abroad Fall Travel Program studies seminal European historic and contemporary architectural works and urban spaces, which are visited and documented with analytical drawings, sketches, and photographs, supplemented by on-site lectures by architects and professionals. Documented research before and after the program leads students to greater depth of understanding of the issues surrounding the architecture. The Steger Center Residency Program: Each semester, 16 architecture students take part in this program at Virginia Tech's European Steger Center for International Scholarship in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland. An 18th century villa and its gardens on the southern tip of Lake Lugano provide residence and dining facilities for Architecture + Design students, as well as 30 Virginia Tech students from other academic disciplines. Studio work, courses, research, and travel are directed to advance first-hand knowledge of the architecture, geography, and culture of Europe. The Chicago Studio: Hosted by significant architecture firms in downtown Chicago, this 4th-year offcampus semester seeks to integrate education and practice in a direct way. Its distinctive structure and curriculum is centered around urban focused studio and course work, with direct input from the profession. Site visits in the Chicago metropolitan area and the lectures and events of the active architecture culture of Chicago contribute significantly to this program. Professional Extern Program allows students to spend one semester in an approved professional setting and receive up to 12 hours of academic credit. This program provides a valuable link between the academic environment and architectural practices, discipline-related government agencies, and other design offices throughout the world. The Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center affords students from the School of Architecture + Design and from related College disciplines the opportunity to study with students and faculty from a national and international consortium of schools in the historic urban context of Old Town Alexandria. The Center complex offers studio space, classrooms, exhibition and review spaces, shops, and computer labs for the students and faculty of the consortium. The University also offers a limited number of apartments for students studying at the Center.</p><p>In the fifth year, students conduct a yearlong advanced study with individual faculty advisors. The indepth engagement with research, theory, and design is intended to broaden a student's expertise in a particular area within the field of architecture. Fifth-year students are expected to formulate and accomplish advanced high-level work in the form of a terminal project. Working with their advisors, students develop and discuss their research and design progress, and have periodic formal peer reviews throughout the year. Students are required to leave the project documentation of their 5th-year work with the school upon graduation.</p><p>The In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</p><p>Next accreditation visit for all programs: 2018</p><p>The four-year, pre-professional degree is not offered at Virginia Tech.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why We Have It</head><p>As a vital component of undergraduate education at Virginia Tech, the Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE)--required of all undergraduates--empowers our students with a broad base of knowledge and transferable skills. Liberal Education provides students the opportunity for rigorous intellectual encounters with enduring human challenges and important contemporary problems, through wide-ranging exposure to multiple disciplines and ways of knowing.</p><p>Through the study of the Sciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Histories, Languages and the Arts, the CLE is designed to foster and develop intellectual curiosity and critical thinking; strong analytic, communication, quantitative, and information literacy skills; the capacity for collaboration and creative problem solving; the ability to synthesize and transfer knowledge; intercultural knowledge and understanding; and ethical reasoning and action. The CLE seeks to create the conditions for growing creative and intellectual engagement; civic, personal, and social responsibility; and lifelong learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What Students Will Gain</head><p>A liberal education offers 21st century students the foundations of what they need to live and thrive as citizens in a globally engaged democracy, a knowledge-intensive economy, and a society where new ideas and understandings are essential to progress. The success of today's college students in their communities, workplaces, and across their lifetimes depends upon a complex and transferable set of skills and capacities. In their lives and in their careers, our students must be prepared to grasp complex problems, develop a global perspective on the diversity of human experience and knowledge, respond to changing demands, and articulate innovative responses and solutions. Today's students are very likely to change jobs and even careers several times over the course of their lives; and certainly, their roles and responsibilities in their families and communities will change and evolve over their lifetimes as well.</p><p>The breadth of a rigorous liberal education combined with the depth of specialized study in the student's primary academic discipline(s)--and evidenced in a demonstrated capacity to adapt and transfer knowledge, skills, and responsibilities to new settings and questions--is essential to the education of the whole student</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and Academic Policies</head><p>Menu and sets the stage for a lifetime of learning and growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE) Areas of Study</head><p>Because the Curriculum for Liberal Education is a "living curriculum," there will be some changes from year to year. Courses added to the CLE offerings are generally available to students immediately after being approved. Some requirements of the CLE are phased in over a multi-year period. Thus, it is essential that students continue to consult with their advisors. Please visit the CLE homepage at http://www.cle.prov.vt.edu/ for more information, and for the Curriculum for Liberal Education Guides. Area 1 requirements reflect the centrality of discourse in the larger intellectual community. Our first-year writing courses introduce students to the interrelated and shared modes of verbal communication that are distinctive to college life -argument, interpretation, analysis, and metaphor -and whose various usages substantially delineate what it means to become broadly educated. These beginning courses should be thought of as the springboard for further writing and discourse throughout the undergraduate curriculum, especially in the disciplinary concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Areas of Study</head><p>In order to enable students to meet the aims of both liberal education and of professional preparation, we include writing in many courses throughout the university, even if it may not be the main intellectual capacity emphasized in the course. Students are encouraged to seek out courses that offer frequent opportunities for writing and related forms of discourse, both for the enhanced learning these courses can offer and for their bene t in terms of professional preparation. Many courses in the Curriculum for Liberal Education build upon the writing and oral skills that are the direct goal of Area 1 by including a significant writing component and by encouraging the achievement of excellence in communicating ideas and knowledge.</p><p>Formerly, the CLE required writing-intensive (WI) courses to support the development of students' writing skills across the undergraduate career. To better facilitate and broaden this goal, the requirement evolved into a departmental requirement for Visual, Spoken and Written Expression (ViEWS). Development of these competencies may be fostered through specific courses in the major, courses outside the major, and/or previously designated WI courses.</p><p>Students may meet the first-year writing requirement in one of three ways: Every student should be introduced to some of the ideas, cultural traditions, and values that have shaped the human world we now inhabit. An educated person sees the present in connection with the past, and understands that presently prevailing values and meanings derive from the creative thought and action of men and women who have preceded us. A study of in uential texts, ideas, representative works of art and technology, and the development of cultural traditions begins to free the student from the super cial fads of the moment and from narrow provincialisms. By examining some of the enduring ideas about human nature and achievement past and present, the individual gains a greater degree of self-knowledge and is better able to formulate worthwhile aims and commitments.</p><p>Courses in this curricular area take the human condition and human values as their main focus, while dealing with a range of subject matters: philosophy, literature and communication, history, religion, the arts, and technology. Most of these courses deal with some aspect of Western cultural experience in its numerous varieties. Relatively neglected dimensions of this experience such as the experience of women and minorities will be acknowledged and dealt with, both as an integral aspect of many existing courses and in separate courses which focus directly upon these dimensions. The foreign language courses approved for Area 2 explore the literatures of other countries in their cultural contexts. Moreover, since we are living in an increasingly global cultural context, courses are included that introduce the student to formative non-Western ideas, arts, and traditions as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 3: Society and Human Behavior</head><p>6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses.</p><p>Human beings are not only participants in the world of human culture; we are also observers of it. The cultivation of systematic approaches to the study of humanity is one of the great achievements of the human intellect. Every student should therefore be introduced to the sciences of society and human behavior, a goal that can be accomplished through several avenues: through the study of psychology; through the study of social structures such as government, family, community, or economy; or through more wide-ranging examination of social patterns and processes. Such studies may examine past as well as present, non-Western as well as Western societies.</p><p>Courses in this curricular area are best characterized by their methods of study and theoretical frameworks. They look for regularities in human behavior rather than giving primary attention to the unique or nonrepeatable aspects of life. When varied human values and allegiances nevertheless make their appearance within these disciplines, they do so more as objects to be investigated than as commitments to be honored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery</head><p>6 credit hours (2 courses) of lecture selected from approved CLE courses. Some majors require 2 credit hours of related laboratory (2 labs).</p><p>For many students at Virginia Tech, acquiring detailed knowledge of one or more of the natural sciences is essential. But for all students, a liberal education involves the study of what science is, of how it can be conducted, of what it can and cannot tell us about the world. Without scientific study and the experience offered by a laboratory, students perceive only vaguely how and why science functions as a crucial standard for knowledge and inquiry in modern life. The study of a science engages the student in analysis and deduction as well as empirical experimentation -that is, in scientific reasoning and discovery.</p><p>The impact of the natural sciences and technology on our globally interdependent world is one of the most important realities we face as we enter the 21st century. The science courses in the CLE have a special role in educating students about the critical relevance of scientific knowledge to the potentialities and dilemmas of our natural and social environments.</p><p>Area 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning 6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses Like writing, mathematics is essential to intellectual inquiry in many areas. It is a basic language of the natural and social sciences and has become a useful tool for research in the humanities. The technological uses of mathematics and related forms of symbolic analysis are of tremendous significance to human society. Furthermore, the history of quantitative and symbolic reasoning as an intellectual discipline is linked with philosophy, the arts, and other aspects of human culture. Thus, a broad education must include these forms of reasoning, both as skills and as central modes of thought. Mathematics, statistics, and certain areas of computer science and philosophy can all contribute to broadening a student's knowledge of quantitative and symbolic reasoning.</p><p>A diagnostic formula and testing procedure has been derived to predict readiness for Engineering/Science Calculus at Virginia Tech. A purpose of MATH 1015 is to serve those students who need further preparation.</p><p>You can obtain information about the math diagnostic test from your advisor.</p><p>Many departments throughout the university have specific math sequence requirements. Be sure to check with your advisor about the requirements for your program. The arts contribute significantly both to the experience and the interpretation of human life. Creativity and aesthetic response criss-cross the boundaries among intellectual ideas, the imagination, and actual design. Moreover, the arts are always intimately linked with the material culture of a society -its modes of production and design -as well as with its values and ideas. Thus, the arts can be studied and experienced in a variety of ways: as "high culture," as a means of tracing the history and ideas of particular societies, and as an active process of creative design and expression in many different physical forms. The metaphorical and intuitive thought processes that are essential to making and experiencing works of art are woven into many other human cultural and creative activities. Thus, the arts have an important role to play in broadening our aesthetic and intellectual sensibilities. Most artistic media include a highly public dimension -concerts, exhibitions, performances, publications, public installations, and the built environment -in which the creative works of artists, designers, and their collaborators are accepted or contested as meaningful elements of the larger social fabric. A guided exposure to the arts can provide a valuable framework for continued appreciation of, and participation in, the arts beyond college.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context</head><p>3 credit hours (1 course) selected from approved CLE courses.</p><p>Global interdependence is a powerful fact of life as we enter the 21st century. The dilemmas and possibilities humankind faces cannot be effectively addressed by any single culture or group of people acting alone. An awareness of critical issues of the day is thus an essential extension of liberal education and prepares students to respond thoughtfully to the complex world in which they live. As a state institution of higher education, Virginia Tech has a responsibility to prepare students to react creatively and constructively to the social, international, intercultural, and environmental challenges that confront the Commonwealth and the world.</p><p>The university requires that undergraduates take at least one course that deals in a substantial way with major issues of critical importance for the larger global society. Courses that satisfy this requirement can be taken in any area of the curriculum, including the major, the Curriculum for Liberal Education, or electives. Students may select from a wide range of courses that focus on major international and intercultural issues in contemporary world affairs, including such areas as politics, the management of con ict, the roles of economic competition and cooperation, demographic issues, and the emerging world order. Many science courses in Area 7 examine global issues associated with environmental decline and restoration. Some engineering courses study the role of technology as a major force in shaping the cultural and economic conditions of human societies. Other courses include comparative or cross-disciplinary examinations of cultures, societies, and belief systems, including those of developing countries. Other courses examine the social and personal implications of cultural, racial, and gender-based differences. Whatever the topical focus of the course, all Area 7 courses utilize interdisciplinary approaches in which a number of relevant factors -historical, ethical, technological, cultural, and/or scientific -are brought to bear on the issues being studied. In a contemporary world where every educated person must have some knowledge of computing, the Department of Computer Science offers courses to meet a variety of needs. The department offers a bachelor of science program to prepare specialists in the area of computer science itself, a minor in computer science, and individual courses directed to the needs of non-majors who will be using computers as tools in their chosen careers. The department also offers the M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science (see Graduate Catalog).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Mechanics is a fundamental area of science and engineering. It is an exciting, expanding field of learning with its roots grounded in the laws of motion formulated by Newton and the principles governing the behavior of solids and fluids, branching out in modern times into interdisciplinary fields such as new engineering materials (adhesives, composites, polymers, light metals), biomechanics, transportation, wind engineering, and vehicular structures. Although the problems to which they are applied may change, the basic principles of mechanics remain current and relevant.</p><p>Engineering Science and Mechanics has a rich tradition for providing an interdisciplinary engineering education. We strive to prepare our graduates to succeed in advanced graduate or professional study, industry, and government. In these activities, our alumni will:</p><p>Apply fundamentals of engineering mechanics and related areas of applied science to define, model, and solve a wide range of engineering problems. Apply fundamental mathematical and scientific principles, as well as computational and experimental techniques, to the demands of engineering and scientific practice. Function on and lead teams that engage in new areas of research and development in engineering, particularly those that cross the boundaries of traditional disciplines. Maintain high productivity and high ethical standards. Continually enhance their knowledge throughout their careers. Communicate effectively to a broad range of audiences.</p><p>These educational objectives are supported by a curriculum that provides its graduates with:</p><p>an ability to apply fundamental knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering an ability to design and conduct mechanics experiments an ability to analyze and interpret experimental and computational mechanics data an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs by synergistically combining mechanics of materials, fluid mechanics, and dynamics, when necessary an ability to effectively function as the leader, or member, of a multi-disciplinary team an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems involving mechanics of materials, fluid mechanics, and/or dynamics an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility an ability to communicate effectively orally, graphically, and in writing the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions on society and the environment a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in, life-long learning and accomplishment a knowledge of contemporary issues (e.g., social, political, technical, economic, etc.) a fundamental understanding that will enable the appropriate use and development of the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice a recognition of the importance of safety in phases of engineering design and practice A total of 12 credit hours of technical electives and 6 credit hours of senior design give the student freedom to develop individually tailored programs of concentrated study. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Finance is a specialty that works with the development, allocation and use of monetary resources within established legal and ethical frameworks, while understanding and mitigating the associated risks. Money is a critical component of the economic system and its flow is the sustaining force of the U.S. and global economy. Therefore, in working with how governments, corporations, intermediaries, and households utilize their financial assets finance professionals are an integral part of how the economy perpetuates the standard of living that we enjoy.</p><p>Traditionally there are three separate but related fields within finance: 1) corporate financial management or "business finance" which focuses on the internal decisions of companies to raise funds and invest in corporate assets; 2) investment management which focuses on the purchase and sale of stocks and bonds or their derivatives by individuals and institutions; and 3) financial services management, which focuses on the management and regulation of institutions and the role that financial institutions play in the economy.</p><p>The undergraduate program in Finance meets the requirements of students who desire specialized careers in financial management. Students gain expertise in both accounting and finance, essential for success as a financial professional. The case-oriented focus of coursework requires students to apply their knowledge and strengthen their oral and written communication skills. The department offers specializations in (i) Corporate Financial Management, (ii) Investment Management and CFA© (Chartered Financial Analyst), based on the CFA© curriculum as recognized and approved by the CFA Institute, (iii) Banking and Financial Institutions Management, (iv) Financial Accounting, and (v) CFP© Certification Education with approval of CFP Board of Standards. Students also have the opportunity to participate in student management funds focused on investments in bonds (BASIS) and in stocks (SEED).</p><p>The curriculum offers courses in finance, insurance, and business law, but a major only in finance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Honors</head><p>The Nutrition, foods, and exercise science is a unique field of study that builds on the biological and physical sciences. Human nutrition is directed toward helping people choose food that meets their physiological needs and is consistent with their lifestyles and cultural preferences. Changes in lifestyle and food consumption patterns have created consumer demand for new food products that are shelf stable, require little or no preparation, and are appropriate in nutrition content. These trends have increased the need for food professionals who wish to apply their science background to exploring the nutrient content and chemical and physical properties of foods and food ingredients. Increasing interest in physical fitness and wellness has brought about new professional opportunities in assisting people who want to develop appropriate exercise patterns and make healthy changes in their lifestyle.</p><p>Many contemporary health issues including obesity, heart disease, and cancer have been associated with a person's food intake and level of exercise. This has led to increasing emphasis on health promotion and disease intervention, and the nutrition and exercise professionals are integral members of the health care team. Expanding research by private and government agencies focusing on the role of nutrition and physical activity in health, growth, and aging has created a demand for graduates at the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. levels who have a background and interest in laboratory and experimental methods in nutrition, foods and exercise science. The current interest in physical performance in our society has broadened the opportunities for combining expertise in nutrition with exercise and fitness for those with skills in counseling and entrepreneurship. Individuals with a background in food and nutrition are needed to help solve the problems of world hunger and food shortages, and the accompanying loss of human potential.</p><p>There are two options from which an undergraduate student majoring in human nutrition, foods and exercise may choose: Dietetics or Science of Food, Nutrition and Exercise.</p><p>The department participates in the University's Honors Program (see "Academics" in this catalog). </p></div>

With a curriculum that equally respects the importance of creative skill, history, building technology, ethics, innovation, and business practice, our graduates have the ability and confidence needed to immediately contribute to the profession.</p><p>Students in the interior program begin their studies in the foundation design laboratory during the first two semesters with architecture, landscape architecture and industrial design students. From the beginning, both an independent and team approach to design solutions is encouraged.</p><p>In their professional studies students are challenged to think critically in their design of space and to develop solutions that not only enhance quality of life, but also protect the health, safety, and welfare of users as prescribed in the various codes and regulations that govern the work of interior designers. This philosophy is the core of our program. It establishes a foundation upon which each student graduates</p><p>Mathematics is essential to a clear and complete understanding of virtually all phenomena. Its precision, depth, and generality support the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The study of mathematics provides the ability to describe applied problems quantitatively and to analyze these problems in a precise and logical manner. This is a principal reason behind the strong demand for mathematicians in government and industry. Essentially all complex problems, whether physical, social, or economic, are solved by designing a mathematical model, analyzing the model, and determining computational algorithms for an efficient and accurate approximation of a solution. Each of these phases is mathematical in nature. For example, if a problem deviates from a standard form, a mathematician should be able to adjust the usual mathematical treatment of the problem to accommodate the deviation. In this case mathematical training provides a practical preparation for a career in today's changing world. Moreover, it is especially valuable because it is an education that equips one to continue to adapt to new situations.</p><p>Mathematicians typically are employed as applied mathematicians in their specialty areas. Our recent mathematics graduates have been approximately equally divided among government and industry, graduate school, and teaching. There are four different paths or options that a student may follow towards a B.S. in Mathematics: 1) the Traditional Option; 2) the Applied Computational Mathematics Option (ACM); 3) the Applied Discrete Mathematics Option (ADM); and 4) the Mathematics Education Option (MSTR).</p><p>The Traditional Option, as its name implies, yields a broad and flexible background in mathematics. The other three options are more specialized. The ACM option is designed for students primarily interested in computational mathematics and its applications to engineering and the natural and social sciences. The ADM option is designed for students primarily interested in areas of applied mathematics closely associated with computer science. The Mathematics Education Option is designed for students who want to be certified to teach secondary mathematics.</p><p>Often students will begin their studies in the Traditional Option and later change to one of the other three options when they become more sure of the path they wish to pursue. One, however, can acquire many aspects of the three specialized options within the Traditional Option, because it also requires some degree of specialization in an applications area and provides career development features. The Cooperative Education Program is also available to qualified candidates, and students wishing to mix practical experience with their formal course studies are encouraged to investigate this option. For more information, contact Career Services at Virginia Tech.</p><p>The Mathematics Department firmly believes that mathematics is not only useful and beautiful, but also fun. The minor is designed to provide recognition for those students who take a program of study in mathematics above the normal requirements of their disciplines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employment Opportunities</head><p>Because of the diversity and breadth of the mechanical engineering profession, ME graduates find employment in a wide variety of industries, laboratories, and consulting firms. This results in a relatively stable job market that is not dependent upon a single particular industry. The textile, petroleum, chemical, electronic, automotive, aerospace, power generation, HVAC, and manufacturing industries hire large numbers of mechanical engineering graduates and the starting salaries for ME's are very competitive with the other engineering disciplines.</p><p>Because of the wide diversity of specialties and job functions any two mechanical engineers might have significantly different day-to-day activities and responsibilities. Some may be concerned with very large engineering systems while others are working with small and even microscale devices and components; some work might call for highly analytical or mathematical approaches while other work might be more amenable to experimental or empirical approaches. Mechanical engineers may be involved in the operation of processing plants, or the design of engines, prosthetic devices, steam and gas turbines or compressors and pumps, alternative fuel devices, and many other devices and systems. At Virginia Tech there is a close association between the ME departments research and design project activities with industry. This enhances the opportunities for student interaction with industry representatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanical Engineering Program Educational Objectives</head><p>Within a few years after graduating from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Virginia Tech, the graduates will attain:</p><p>Positions where they utilize fundamental technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and engineering to analyze and solve problems, and apply these abilities to generate new knowledge, ideas or products in academia, industry or government. Practical experience and organizational skills, enabling them to interact and communicate effectively www.me.vt.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-program/current-students/courseselection/#requiredcourses</p><p>The ME curriculum provides a strong foundation in the basic physical and chemical sciences and in mathematics. These are followed by a sequence of courses that provide a broad background in design methodology, computer programming, electronics, solid and fluid mechanics, manufacturing processes, system modeling, machine design, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, statistics and materials. Courses in English and in the humanities and social sciences are included to broaden the individual. This background is strengthened and unified through a sequence of engineering design and laboratory courses. Instructional laboratories in the junior and senior years provide opportunities for students to learn measurement and instrumentation techniques. Students apply these skills to the acquisition and analysis of data from various engineering systems.</p><p>In all professional endeavors the mechanical engineer must consider ecological effects as well as the economic and social needs of people. The mechanical engineer must consider the conservation of natural resources and the environmental impact in the design of systems. These considerations are included in a number of ME courses and technical elective classes.

It resides in, and is organized as a division of, the College of Science's Academy of Integrated Science. Nanoscience, the fundamental study of materials and structures whose size is on the nanometer scale, lies at the very foundation of our world. A nanometer is simply a billionth of a meter, and a typical atom is about 1/10th of a nanometer in size. At this length scale, atoms and molecules follow the laws of quantum physics, and the processes of life (for example, DNA and proteins are naturally-occurring nanoscale materials) and the properties of materials emerge from them. Due to a combination of profound theoretical insights, advances in scientific instrumentation, and massive computing power, we are now capable of imaging and steering single atoms with unprecedented precision, opening a window toward a world in which materials, chemical compounds, devices, and even small organisms can be built atom by</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Landscape Architecture encompasses the design, analysis, planning, management, and stewardship of sustainable environments. Landscape architects design across a wide spectrum of projects: parks and gardens, community design, urban design and planning, green infrastructure, and regional planning, as well as at the scale of watersheds and natural systems. The work of the profession is grounded in the natural and social sciences, draws inspiration from nature and the arts, and is implemented through innovative design, site engineering, construction, land management, and environmental technologies. The Landscape Architecture Program guides students as they address some of the most important challenges of our time: climate change; healthy living and empathetic design; urbanization; re-imagining water, food, energy and transportation; green infrastructure; remediation of spoiled and disturbed sites; and preserving critical natural resources. We believe the work of the profession, at the critical intersection of natural and cultural systems, will be the most consequential of the design arts in the 21st century.</p><p>The core of the academic program is a rigorous sequence of design studios that allows students to explore a broad range of landscape architectural issues, contexts, and project types. Studios are accompanied by discussion, lecture, and laboratory courses that provide systematic and comprehensive coverage of the emerging body of knowledge related to technology, design theory, landscape ecology, and human/environment interaction. Off-campus options include a summer travel studio, study at the Washington Alexandria Architecture Center, and exchange programs with Tongji University in Shanghai, or University College, Dublin, Ireland, as well as an independent semester abroad and professional internships.</p><p>The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (B.L.A.) is a five year first-professional degree program fully accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Graduates have a wide range of employment and professional opportunities including work in private practice, multidisciplinary firms, public agencies and municipalities, non-government organizations and non-profits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Students choosing the Management Major are guided by world-class faculty to prepare for careers in the worlds' most successful organizations. Our courses build strong foundations in the fundamental management processes of planning, organizing, leading and controlling. To this we add advanced skill building in critical thinking, innovative problem solving, data analytics, ethical reasoning, persuasive communication, and interpersonal and team effectiveness. These skills position Management graduates for future success in a wide variety of high paying careers or as entrepreneurs.</p><p>Management majors add considerable value to the organizations that employ them. Great managers in any business act as force multipliers, increasing the output generated by the people they work with and the resources available to them. Management majors, their teams and their organizations do this by finding ways to help organizations work smarter. Our core curriculum helps students develop the awareness needed to identify new entrepreneurial opportunities, improve organizational processes, use analytics to support evidence-based decisions, and effectively manage projects in support of organizational change, but more importantly improvement.</p><p>Management majors take courses in one of three career centered options: Management Consulting and Analytics (MCA), Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Technology Management (EIT) or Human Resources Management (HRM). In addition, many Management majors choose to minor in Entrepreneurship, Leadership or International Business. They also participate in paid and for-credit internships, careerfocused clubs and student-led extracurricular activities. An emphasis on developing employable skills is further supported by course-based and one-on-one strategic career planning.</p></div>

Accordingly, our program serves as a vital conduit for university-tribal relations, the recruitment and retention of American Indian students and faculty, and Service-Learning initiatives in indigenous communities. Although our program has a regional focus, we offer a wide spectrum of courses--ranging from American Indian Literatures, American Indian Spirituality, and American Indian Arts, to native Peoples of the Southeast, American Indians in Film, and Global indigenous Rights--reflecting the impressive and diverse expertise of our faculty.</p><p>In short, we embrace a holistic, collaborative approach to American Indian Studies in which university faculty and students develop and maintain meaningful partnerships.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>The Systems Biology program is a joint effort of the departments of Biological Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science. The program resides in, and is organized as a division of, the College of Science's Academy of Integrated Science.</p><p>A "systems approach" to biology involves the study of the biological, chemical, and physical processes within living organisms as they interact in complex ways to produce life-supporting behaviors. The Virginia Tech program in Systems Biology focuses on the powerful, emerging paradigm of molecular systems biology, i.e., on computational, systems-level approaches that connect the biochemical and genetic properties of individual macromolecules (DNA, RNA, protein, lipids, polysaccharides) with the physiological behavior of living cells and tissues. These levels of biological organization, which comprise the gap between interacting macromolecules and cell physiology, embody an active area of research producing technological and biomedical innovations. The Systems Biology program bridges the molecular/cell divide, training students for employment or graduate education in this burgeoning field. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bachelor of Science in Systems Biology</head><p>All Systems Biology majors are required to own specified personal computers and software. Consult the division for details.</p><p>A special brochure describing the division and the B.S. program in Systems Biology is available from the division's webpage or upon request.</p></div>

Working in groups, students interact with local officials, consultants, developers, environmental groups to explore the processes of environmental management, regulation and mitigation, applying techniques and skills frequently used by environmental planners and policy-makers. Senior status required and 9 credit hours, 3000-level or above, in the Environmental Policy and Planning major or minor; Pre: 3354, 3224. (2H,5L,4C) 4364: SEMINAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND PLANNING Critical examination of the social, political, economic, legal, scientific, and technological contexts underlying processes of environmental change, problems, and solutions, as seen from various conceptual and disciplinary perspectives. Senior status required and 9 credit hours, 3000-level or above, in the Environmental Policy and Planning major or minor. <ref type="bibr">Pre: 3354,</ref><ref type="bibr">3224</ref> Course examines the interdependences among the elements of the built environment of the city and those between the elements of the built environment and the policy/planning structure of the city. Considered are those elements associated with the primary urban activities (residential, commercial, industrial) as well as the urban form-giving infrastructure facilities that support those land uses (water supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal, transportation, education, recreation, health, and safety). <ref type="bibr">Pre: 4754.
