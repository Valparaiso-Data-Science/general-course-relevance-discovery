<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About Saint Xavier University</head><p>Saint Xavier University was founded in Chicago by the Sisters of Mercy in 1846, holding the distinctions of being Chicago's first Catholic university as well as the first Mercy institution of higher learning in the United States. Initially serving as a higher education institution for women and the poor, today the four-year, private Catholic institution serves a diverse population of men and women who seek a Mercy education that prepares them to become successful, productive and compassionate members of society.</p><p>To learn a little more about the University, check out the catalog pages below: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">â€¢</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vision of Our Catholic and Mercy Identity</head><p>Saint Xavier University, founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, extends the teaching ministry of Jesus Christ to those seeking higher education. As an officially recognized ministry of the Catholic Church*, the University grounds its core activities of teaching, learning, scholarship, and service in Catholic theological principles that affirm the goodness and value of all creation and posit a view of human persons as created in the image of God and thus free, rational, relational and endowed with inherent dignity.</p><p>As a Catholic university, Saint Xavier University challenges all the members of its community to search for truth, especially religious truth, and to engage in a dialogue between faith and reason that ultimately leads toward the contemplation of God's creation and social action for the common good. This search for truth demands careful observation, critical analysis, vigorous debate, personal and communal theological reflection, and ethical and engaged decision-making leading toward a life that respects both the inherent dignity of another and the worth of all creation. Setting the context for the search for truth, the University encourages its community, especially its students, to become familiar with the richness of the Catholic intellectual tradition and the imperatives of Catholic social teaching. Respecting academic freedom, the University strives to be a place where the vigorous discussion of ideas can occur, especially as they relate to its mission as a Catholic university. In the spirit of respectful and critical discourse, the University welcomes the breadth of the Catholic tradition as well as the voices of other religious and non-religious communities.</p><p>As a Mercy university, Saint Xavier University challenges its community members to teach, learn, research, and act not only for themselves but also for others. Thus, a seminal characteristic of the University is its commitment to service. Ideally, such service, whether direct or through the University's efforts to understand and remediate unjust systems, reflects the spirituality of Catherine McAuley, the founder of the Sisters of Mercy. This spirituality is grounded in the theology of the Incarnation, animated by the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, and expressed through acts of compassion that embody the spiritual and corporal works of mercy**. In particular, the University community expresses special concern for those who are economically poor, especially women and children. In so doing, the University goes beyond simply passive expressions of heartfelt concern, and even willingness to stand with those who suffer. It seeks to right what is wrong and restore what is broken, thereby promoting human dignity, justice and the common good. Saint Xavier University signifies and celebrates its Catholic and Mercy heritage in its symbolic, sacramental and liturgical expressions, and in its communal and collegial ethos. The University offers many opportunities to reflect, pray, worship and access the sacraments. It symbolizes its rich faith tradition through the appropriate placement of religious symbols and artwork. Further, it observes liturgical seasons and feasts central to its Catholic and Mercy heritage, and provides orientation and mentoring programs that educate the community about this identity.</p><p>Recognizing that the search for God and the celebration of God's presence is ubiquitous, the University provides opportunities for those of other faith traditions and those on a personal journey of faith to study, to express, to worship, to celebrate and to discuss their religious beliefs in a climate that is respectful, hospitable and open to all.</p><p>To summarize, offering the opportunity for higher education within a Catholic and Mercy context, Saint Xavier University honors Jesus Christ whom it recognizes as "the Way, the Truth and the Life," the motto of the University inscribed on its coat of arms.</p><p>Approvedby the Board of <ref type="bibr">Trustees -March 30, 2008</ref>. Reaffirmed by the Board of <ref type="bibr">Trustees -September 11, 2017.</ref> *Inits governance, Saint Xavier University is a Catholic and Mercy institution because its sponsors, the Sisters of Mercy, hold certain "reserved powers" consonant with their canonical (Church) and civil responsibilities for the University. These "reserved powers" are outlined in the University's articles and bylaws, and with limited exceptions, are exercised on behalf of the Sisters of Mercy by the Conference for Mercy Higher Education. It is through this governance relationship with the Sisters of Mercy that Saint Xavier University is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as a Catholic institution and ministry.</p><p>**Based largely on the gospel of Matthew, chapter 25, the works of mercy are as follows: Spiritual Works of Mercy: Instruct the ignorant. Counsel the doubtful. Comfort the sorrowful. Admonish the sinner. Bear wrongs patiently. Forgive all injuries. Pray for the living and the dead. Corporal Works of Mercy: Feed the hungry. Give drink to the thirsty. Clothe the naked. Shelter the homeless. Visit the sick. Visit the imprisoned. Bury the dead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Seal</head><p>From its earliest design honoring the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the Coat of Arms seal of today, the seal of Saint Xavier University, symbolizes a proud history of Catholic education in Chicago. This seal, designed by former art department chairperson and faculty member Sister Mary Solina Hicks, R.S.M., includes a black and white checkerboard and diagonal gold bars from the family coat of arms of Saint Francis Xavier; red and gold bars and a white Jerusalem cross taken from the shield of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas; an open book to represent education; and the Scripture verse, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life." <ref type="bibr">(John 14:6)</ref>.</p><p>Saint Xavier University continues to use this seal as a symbol of its heritage and mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNIVERSITY SEAL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SXU Philosophy Statement</head><p>Saint Xavier University continues to build upon the ideals of its founders and sponsors, the Sisters of Mercy, who in 1846, inspired by their Catholic faith and its mandate of union and charity, established an academy defined by intellectual rigor in the tradition of the liberal arts, the encouragement of religious faith, and action in solidarity with the economically poor of the world, especially women and children.</p><p>Consistent with this tradition, the University offers challenging undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, characterized by a collegial alliance of faculty, students, staff, administration and community members who are committed to providing coursework, resources, activities and instructional facilities that support excellence in teaching and learning. While chiefly concerned with students' intellectual development, the University also supports their moral and spiritual growth, and enhances their capacity for leadership through co-curricular programs.</p><p>At the heart of the academic mission is the University's commitment to a strong general education program that introduces students to college life and learning, broadens their knowledge in the arts and sciences, helps them integrate learning and community concerns, and prepares them for success in their major fields of study and life after graduation. In all programs of study, the University encourages the examination of fundamental questions of human concern, respectful dialogue in the context of diverse points of view and experience, as well as the search for truth and justice.</p><p>In an atmosphere of intellectual rigor made possible by academic freedom, University faculty develop and teach courses in their areas of advanced study, extend research in their disciplines, produce scholarly and creative work and serve the University and community. Faculty are also responsible for academic policies and the design and content of the University curriculum. In teaching, scholarship and service, faculty represent one of the most visible examples of the intellectual life of the University.</p><p>Students at Saint Xavier encounter a wide range of coursework, co-curricular activities, community experiences and support services designed to enhance their learning at all levels, and to help them develop more fully as confident, contributing citizen leaders of an ever-increasingly complex and global community. The University seeks students of diverse talents, experiences, knowledge, interests and cultures who are willing and prepared to learn and to seek excellence in themselves and others.</p><p>Vital to the success of teaching and learning are the dedicated members of variously skilled academic support services and the administrative leadership charged with fostering strategic planning, institutional assessment and effective stewardship and deployment of University resources.</p><p>The enduring fellowship of alumni, emeriti faculty, Sisters of Mercy sponsors, trustees and other friends and contributors in the community at large demonstrates their continuing faith in the central mission of Saint Xavier through various acts of giving, prayer and support.</p><p>Infusing this community of shared concern are the distinctive qualities and values of Saint Xavier University, including the belief that faith and reason can interact in mutually fruitful ways. Therefore, the University membership encourages a full search for truth, including religious truth, while respecting freedom of personal expression. It also promotes a vigorous and compassionate dialogue among the various faith traditions, and between them and the academic disciplines. At its foundation, teaching and learning at Saint Xavier are premised upon and committed to the fundamental dignity and unique worth of each human person.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies and Procedures</head><p>Below are the academic policies and procedures that all students must follow while attending Saint Xavier University, as well as other additional academic information. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Advising</head><p>All matriculated undergraduate students are assigned an academic advisor through the Office of Records and Registration. Staff members of the Office of Records of Registration advise pre-clinical nursing majors, liberal studies majors and students who have not declared a major. All other students are assigned faculty advisors within the department of their major. Changes of major or staff advisor are arranged through the Office of Records and Registration. In order to request a change of an advisor who is a faculty member, the student must make the request of the department chair of their current major.</p><p>All undergraduate students must have their advisor's approval to register for fall and spring classes. All students in the Education Department, both graduate and undergraduate, must have their advisor's approval to register for all terms and semesters. Advisors provide information about core and departmental requirements, transfer credit, academic status, academic policies, articulation agreements, procedures and University services. Students are encouraged to make regular contact with their advisors on matters of academic planning and progress. Students should regularly check their program evaluation in Self-Service and Academic Planning for accuracy and progress towards graduation. The ultimate responsibility for making decisions about educational plans consistent with policies of the University rests with the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Catalog Policy</head><p>Part-time and full-time students enrolled in a continuous program must adhere to the program requirements stated in the catalog at the time of their matriculation into the University. The only exception to this practice occurs when state-certified programs, such as education, change requirements and require a definite time for implementation.</p><p>Student's who leave the University for more than two consecutive semesters must adhere to the program requirements in effect at the time they are readmitted to the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACADEMIC CATALOG POLICY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dismissal</head><p>The academic records of students who have earned a grade point average below 2.0 are reviewed at the end of the fall, spring and summer terms. A determination is made if the student is dismissed or allowed to continue for another semester on strict academic probation. Each dismissed student will receive official notification via U.S. mail and through his/her SXU email account. All future registrations will be removed and/or blocked. Academic dismissal will be noted on the student's official transcript and will be part of the student's record.</p><p>A dismissed student may appeal the dismissal to the associate provost during the period of time specified in the dismissal letter. The appeal, stating the reasons for which the student considers the review justified, must be submitted via SXU email to the associate provost. The development of an academic plan in consultation with an academic advisor is required as part of the dismissal appeal process. The appeal will be reviewed by the associate provost in consultation with the dean, associate dean and program director. If the appeal is granted, notice will include the terms and conditions of continued study, and the student's status will be changed to strict academic probation. If the appeal is not granted, notice will include recommendations if the student plans to apply for readmission at a later date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Integrity</head><p>A commitment to academic integrity is at the heart of Saint Xavier's mission as an intellectual community, dedicated, in the words of the University Philosophy Statement, to the examination of fundamental questions of human concern, respectful dialogue in the context of diverse points of view and experience, as well as the search for truth and justice. For faculty and students alike, the scholarly enterprise requires clear and rigorous argument, acknowledging the sources of our ideas, the quality of the evidence that supports them and taking responsibility for the errors we have made.</p><p>The efforts of students to cultivate these academic skills and intellectual virtues in turn requires formative evaluation, accurately and justly assessing student progress. In order to achieve this, instructors must be certain that students' work is their own and that all records of accomplishment are authentic and reliable. In this context, when students misrepresent their knowledge or abilities, they are more than simply breaking the rules of academic conduct. Such behavior undermines not only the student's own academic progress, but the integrity of academic evaluation itself. For that reason, it may result in failure for the assignment, failure for the course, suspension from the University or permanent dismissal from the University.</p><p>The principles of academic integrity should govern all forms of academic work, from the content of papers, projects and presentations to one's conduct before and during examinations. These principles --and thus the very possibility of honest evaluation --can be jeopardized by a number of actions, including but not limited to:</p><p>â€¢ Cheating on an examination, including but not limited to, using cheat sheets or unauthorized materials, copying from peers or obtaining copies of tests through unauthorized means; â€¢ Unauthorized collaboration with one's peers on assignments, exams, projects or presentations; â€¢ Plagiarizing, which may include:</p><p>â€¢ copying phrases or sentences word for word from a source without enclosing the copied words in quotation marks and indicating the actual source; â€¢ changing the wording of a source slightly, but still incorporating all the ideas of the source without indicating the source; â€¢ altering the wording significantly but still incorporating the main ideas from other sources without indicating, through standard forms of documentation, which sources have been used, thereby implying that the ideas are one's own; â€¢ Unacknowledged and unauthorized resubmission of work completed in other courses; â€¢ Using unauthorized or falsified instruments of identification with the intent of academic fraud; supplying false academic records (transcripts, grade reports, etc.) to any official of the University; forging, altering or making unauthorized use of University records or documents; â€¢ Hindering one's peers by removing, misplacing or defacing library or other instructional materials.</p><p>Faculty and administrators who discover such violations should compile evidence sufficient to document the incident and may impose penalties appropriate to their purview. When the offense and proposed penalty entail suspension or dismissal from the University, the violation must be addressed in consultation with the appropriate dean and the provost.</p><p>Students who believe they have been wrongly accused and penalized may initiate a Course Grade Grievance, as described in the Course Grade Grievance Procedure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Misconduct</head><p>Students are expected to conduct themselves in compliance with the Code of Student Conduct. Because "determination of whether a student is being disruptive in class is left to the sole discretion of the faculty member leading the class" (Student Handbook), faculty have the right to dismiss a disruptive student from a particular class meeting without prior notification. In cases of repeated disruptive behavior on the part of the same student, a faculty member may recommend to the program director, chair or school dean, in writing, that the student be removed from the course for the remainder of the current semester. The chair, program director or school dean will attempt to mediate the situation between the student and faculty member.</p><p>In the College of Arts and Sciences, if the program director or chair agrees with the faculty member's recommendation that the student be removed from the course, he or she will notify the dean of the school. The dean will attempt to mediate the situation between the student and faculty member within a reasonable period. In all schools, if the dean affirms the recommendation to remove the student from the course, the dean should forward the recommendation and a summary of the reasons to the provost. The provost should attempt to resolve the matter through discussion with the concerned persons. The provost will notify the student by traceable mail either of his/her removal from the class, and the reasons, or the conditions under which he/she may remain in class. Should the determination be removal from class, the provost will notify the director of records and registration services, director of financial aid, dean of students and the student's academic advisor.</p><p>The student may appeal this decision in the following manner:</p><p>1.The student may submit a written grievance to the provost within five days. 2.The provost then constitutes a Student Academic Grievance Committee (SAGC). The SAGC is composed of three members: two faculty members and a student. One faculty member will be serving on and selected by the academic policies committee, another will be appointed by the provost and the student will be selected by the dean of students, from among the members of the Saint Xavier Council (formerly Student Government). The academic policies committee representative will serve as chair of this committee. 3.The provost then forwards the grievance, and the SAGC must notify the faculty member and the student and hold a hearing. The SAGC must submit its written recommendations to the provost within 15 working days after its formation. 4.Within five days after the provost has received the decision of the committee, the provost must announce the decision to the student and faculty member.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Probation</head><p>The academic records of all enrolled undergraduate students are reviewed at the end of each semester and summer term. The University reserves the right to dismiss any student whose cumulative grade point average (GPA) falls below 2.0. Any continued student whose cumulative GPA is less than 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. Secondsemester freshmen who have a GPA below 2.0 and who have been allowed to continue for the spring semester must attend the rebound workshop that focuses on academic recovery, during the spring.</p><p>A student on probation must achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.0 within the next term of enrollment at the University. If, during the probationary period, the 2.0 cumulative GPA is approached but not reached, a student may be placed on strict academic probation for one semester. A student who has not reached the 2.0 GPA standard at the end of the strict probation period is subject to the dismissal policies of the University. (See section on academic dismissals.) Any student on probation may be required to carry a reduced course load. Probationary status is removed at the end of any grading period, provided the student has achieved a 2.0 cumulative GPA.</p><p>Completion of coursework for which a grade of Incomplete has been given will not result in recalculation of cumulative GPA during that term. Any change of academic status will not take place until the end of the semester or summer during which the work has been completed, unless the potential GPA is less than 2.0.</p></div>

Diplomas and transcripts with degree posted will be available approximately 6 weeks after the degree date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Grade Grievance Procedure</head><p>An eligible course grade grievance results from an allegation of improper academic evaluation.</p><p>Improper academic evaluation includes evidence of instructor error in calculating or reporting a final grade; evidence that the evaluation criteria noted in the syllabus were not followed; evidence that the evaluation criteria noted in the syllabus were not followed consistently when grading students in the same class.</p><p>Academic evaluation that is not eligible includes dissatisfaction with the evaluation criteria noted in the syllabus; dissatisfaction with the level of difficulty or work load associated with the course; objections regarding the style or quality of the instructor's teaching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 1: Resolution at the School Level</head><p>A student who wishes to question a final course grade is expected to discuss the matter first with the course instructor within the first 20 business days of the term subsequent to the term in which the disputed course grade was awarded. This discussion can take place in person, in writing or via University email account. It is anticipated that, in most cases, this discussion will suffice and the matter will not need to be carried further. Schools and colleges that have departmental chairs (e.g., Arts and Sciences) will require students to meet with the chair of the department prior to Step 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 2: Mediation</head><p>If the student grievance is not resolved through discussion with the instructor, the student may submit a Course Grade Grievance Form (hereinafter referred to as the "grievance form"), along with any documents that the student believes support the grievance. The grievance form and supporting documents must be submitted to the dean's office. The grievance should be filed in the school, in the office of the dean in which the course is being offered within the first 20 business days after the completion of Step 1.</p><p>Note:The grievance forms will be housed in the dean's office of the School of Nursing and Health Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences and the Graham School of Management.</p><p>Once the grievance form is received by the dean, the formal course grade grievance process begins and the dean sends the paperwork to a mediator, selected by the dean for the case (a mediator may serve more than once). The mediator has 15 business days from receipt of the grievance form in which to complete Step 2.</p><p>If the mediator determines that a student grievance is not eligible to be resolved under this course grade grievance policy, the mediator indicates "Ineligible" on the grievance form, completes the rationale section and distributes copies of the form to the student, the faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the dean.</p><p>The student can provide a written appeal of the mediator's decision to the dean if applicable. The dean will either uphold the mediator's decision or grant the appeal and begin Step 3. The dean will send official notification of the decision to the student, the faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the mediator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligible Course Grade Grievance</head><p>If the student submits a grievance that is eligible to be resolved under this course grade grievance policy, the mediator should inform the student of the course grade grievance process.</p><p>The mediator sends a copy of the student's grievance form and the supporting documents to the faculty member, so that the faculty member can respond to the grievance. The mediator is expected and encouraged to converse with the student, the faculty member and any other individual that might need to be included to help resolve the grievance. The mediator is encouraged to bring those specifically involved in the grievance together when the mediator believes such a meeting will help resolve the issue. The mediator has the latitude to request documentation and set deadlines for receipt of such documentation, as deemed necessary.</p><p>If the grievance is resolved, the mediator describes the resolution on the grievance form and distributes copies of the completed form to the student, faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the dean.</p><p>If the grievance is not resolved, the mediator indicates "not resolved: requires an Ad Hoc Committee review" on the grievance form and copies the student, faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the dean. At that point, the mediator is no longer involved. As a courtesy, the mediator would be notified of the outcome at the conclusion of the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 3: Ad Hoc Course Grade Grievance Committee</head><p>The role of the Ad Hoc Course Grade Grievance Committee is to make a final decision on all course grade grievances that are not successfully resolved at the mediation level. The Ad Hoc Course Grade Grievance Committee will hereinafter be referred to as the Ad Hoc Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of the Ad Hoc Committee</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formation of the Ad Hoc Committee</head><p>The dean will form an Ad Hoc Committee (only after step 2 has been completed) within 10 business days of receiving the grievance form. Within these 10 business days, the dean will send the provost a notice of the committee formation and will send each committee member the following:</p><p>â€¢ written notice of the committee formation, date of the formal charge, date by which the committee should have its recommendation formulated, names and contact information of committee members; â€¢ a copy of the grievance file that was established at the mediation level; â€¢ written description of the Ad Hoc Committee function, timeline and process, as excerpted from the faculty and student handbooks.</p><p>Upon confirmation of willingness to serve by the three ad hoc committee members, the dean will formally charge the committee with the task of reviewing the case and coming to a conclusion. The conclusion must be decided within 25 business days of the formal charge of the committee. The dean will inform the student, faculty member and faculty member's immediate administrative superior in writing about the committee formation and timeline.</p><p>The Ad Hoc Committee will consist of three tenured or tenure-track full-time faculty members whose primary responsibility is teaching and who have no conflicts of interest with the case at hand (at least one member of the committee must be a tenured faculty member). These full-time faculty members need to be within the discipline of the course grade being grieved, or in programs where there are few or no full-time, tenure-track or tenured faculty, the dean will select faculty from within a closely allied field or within the school in which the grade is being grieved. One of the three members must be within the discipline or a closely allied field. The chair of the Ad Hoc Committee must be a tenured faculty member and will be designated as chair by the dean.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operation of the Ad Hoc Committee</head><p>The Ad Hoc Committee chair will convene the committee as soon as possible after each member receives the charge and grievance file. Committee members will review the file and meet to discuss the merits of the matter. The chair of the committee will appoint someone with the sole responsibility of keeping minutes of meetings, and such minutes will become part of the grievance file. The committee will deliberate and achieve a simple majority decision as to its recommendation regarding the course grade in question.</p><p>The Ad Hoc Committee may or may not permit new information from those specifically involved in the grievance. Those specifically involved in the case may also request permission to submit new information pertinent to the case. The Ad Hoc Committee responds to the party as to whether or not the committee will allow the new information to be sent. If allowed, the Ad Hoc Committee may set deadlines for receipt of new information. All communication between the committee and the parties involved will be in writing.</p><p>Decisions of the Ad Hoc Committee are to be determined by simple majority.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome of the Ad Hoc Committee Ad Hoc Committee Confirms Grade</head><p>Within 25 business days of receiving the charge, the chair of the Ad Hoc Committee must submit a letter to the student, faculty member, faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the dean. The letter must include:</p><p>â€¢ date of the report â€¢ validation of adherence to timeline â€¢ facts of the case as considered â€¢ rationale for keeping the original grade COURSE GRADE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE â€¢ names of committee members and each member's original signature on the letter If a simple majority of the Ad Hoc Committee has determined that the grade stands, the process ends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ad Hoc Committee Requests Grade Change</head><p>Within 25 business days of receiving the charge, the chair of the Ad Hoc Committee must submit a letter to the faculty member, faculty member's immediate administrative superior, and the dean. The letter must include:</p><p>â€¢ date of the report â€¢ validation of adherence to timeline â€¢ facts of the case as considered â€¢ rationale for recommendation for grade change â€¢ names of committee members and each member's original signature on letter â€¢ the recommendation of the committee If the faculty member agrees with the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee to change the grade, the faculty member will communicate in writing his/her agreement to the ad hoc committee chair, his/her immediate administrative superior and the student within five business days of receipt of the letter. Within these same five days, the faculty member will initiate the grade change following the established procedure. The Ad Hoc Committee chair will contact the dean and the Ad Hoc Committee members regarding the grade change.</p><p>If the faculty member does not follow the recommendation to change the grade, the instructor's administrative superior and/or the chair of the Ad Hoc Committee will provide the dean with the rationale to change the grade and forward all documents in the grievance file to the dean for the dean's review. After reviewing the file, the dean will notify in writing the student, faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior, the registrar, the Ad Hoc Committee members and the provost of his/her final and binding decision and rationale for either changing or not changing the grade.</p><p>If the dean decides a grade change is warranted, the dean will be noted as the individual assigning the grade. The dean will follow appropriate internal procedures to change the grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upon conclusion of this process:</head><p>â€¢ All copies of grievance files should be given to the dean.</p><p>â€¢ Approved meeting minutes should be included in the file.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Timeline Guidelines</head><p>If at any point during the process the student does not adhere to the established deadlines, the grievance shall be considered denied.</p><p>The mediator, dean or chair of the ad hoc committee can request additional time due to unforeseen circumstances (for example: the chair of the ad hoc committee may encounter difficulty coordinating the schedules of the committee members). The necessity for such flexibility is solely intended for the purpose of providing a fair and equitable process. The dean must approve any deviations in timeline, and those specifically involved in the grievance must be notified in writing of the timeline adjustment and the rationale.</p><p>Deviations from policy: special circumstances may require deviations from the provisions and guidelines of the course grade grievance policy. In such cases, the dean should determine adjustments necessary to best ensure a just outcome and one that follows as closely as possible to the spirit of expeditious and thorough implementation of the established policy.</p></div>

Most minimum acceptable scores are a 50, but there are some tests that a higher score is required before credit is allowed. No partial credit will be awarded for a score less than the minimum accepted score. Acceptable CLEP credit is reflected on the academic transcript. Students may not use CLEP credit to replace or raise a grade in any course in which the student has been previously enrolled. Students may not earn CLEP credit for courses below the level in which they have been placed or have completed. CLEP credit transferred from another institution is subject to the minimum standards required by the University. A maximum of 27 credit hours may by earned through CLEP. Students may repeat a CLEP examination three months after the examination was last taken. We follow the American College of Education (ACE) scoring guidelines, but we reserve the right to require a higher score. Students should contact the Office of Records and Registration for information about credit granted, acceptable score levels, eligibility for specific examinations and test registration. 3.Illinois Seal of Biliteracy is accepted by Saint Xavier University as equivalent to two (2) years or twelve (12) semester hours of credit for foreign language taken during high school. Credit will be given for the completion of introductory (101-104) coursework. The high school transcript must indicate the student will be receiving or has received the State Seal of Biliteracy. Students who have received a State Seal of Biliteracy must request course credit for their seal within three (3) academic years after graduating form high school. (HB4446, Rule 3-9a).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading Policy Grade Reports</head><p>Students may access term grades as part of the academic record on Self-Service. Students who are not making satisfactory progress are informed periodically by the instructors.</p><p>Formal grade reports are available at the end of each grading period and are mailed to the student's home upon request. Please contact the Office of Records and Registration if you wish to have a formal grade report sent to your home.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Grading System</head><p>The amount of work accomplished by a student is expressed in credit hours. In general, one credit hour represents one hour of class or two to four hours of laboratory work a week for a semester. Variations from this general plan of equivalence are typical in such instructional modes as seminars, independent study and credit-by-examination. The quality of work is indicated by grade points: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/Fail Grading</head><p>Students who have established and maintained a 2.0 grade-point average after completion of 15 hours at Saint Xavier University may take their elective credit hours on pass/fail grading. It is understood that instructors will allow a student to take any course that is an elective in the student's individual program on a pass/fail basis.</p><p>Pass/fail grading may not be taken in:</p><p>â€¢ any course fulfilling General Education requirements â€¢ any course in the major field â€¢ any course specified as required in a major program, even if that course is in a department other than the major</p><p>The P grade does not carry any grade points; therefore it does not affect the cumulative grade-point average.</p><p>The F grade does affect the cumulative grade-point average.</p><p>The responsibility for finding out whether a course is required in an individual student's program rests with the student, not with the instructor of the course. Students should review their program evaluation on Self-Service to ensure that courses apply totheir program.</p><p>A student wishing to elect courses on a pass/fail basis should acquire a form from the Office of Records and Registration (A-203), secure the signature of the instructor and submit it to the Office of Records and Registration no later than Monday of mid-term week of the section.</p><p>A student who chooses pass/fail grading may not revert to regular grading after pass/fail has been elected. Courses taken as pass/fail may not be used to count toward graduation honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Grades</head><p>A student may request an incomplete grade from an instructor if there is a legitimate reason acceptable to the instructor and the student is making satisfactory progress at the time. The student and instructor agree on requirements and time limit for completion of the course. The agreed upon date is then entered by the instructor during the grading process.</p><p>Requirements must be completed no later than the 10th week of the following semester (fall or spring). Failure to meet the stated requirements will result in an automatic grade of F. If a student carries more than one incomplete grade into the following semester, his/her course load should be reduced. Evaluation of academic standing is made from the grade reports at the end of each grading period and will not be deferred until work is completed on courses in which there was an incomplete.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Honors</head><p>To be eligible for graduation honors, students must have completed at least fifty <ref type="formula">(50)</ref>  The cumulative GPA is based exclusively on credits earned at Saint Xavier and is the higher of (a) the GPA for all credits earned at Saint Xavier, or (b) the last 50 hours earned prior to graduation. If the student reaches and exceeds 50 hours in a term, then all courses earned that term are counted in the GPA for the "last 50 hours." The student is not allowed to pick the courses to equal exactly 50 hours. Graduation honors are recognized for undergraduate degrees only.</p><p>Honors announced during the commencement ceremonies are anticipated honors based upon grades posted to the student record, excluding the current active semester. The honors posted on the transcript, as part of the student's official record, are based upon grades earned through the final semester. The posted honors may differ from the announced honors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placement Testing and First Year Requirements</head><p>Placement in English, math, and chemistry courses is determined using multiple measures, including standardized test scores, such as ACT and SAT, high school coursework, high school grades, and AP/IB/Honors classes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeated Courses</head><p>When a course is repeated, only the higher grade is computed in the grade point average. In most instances, credit may be earned only once for a given course; a repeated course will be designated as such on the transcript. When a course is repeated at another institution, the original SXU grade remains on the transcript and will continue to be calculated into the GPA.</p><p>A course in which a grade of D or F was earned may be repeated only once. A course in which a W (withdrawal) was assigned may be repeated only once. The School of Nursing and Health Sciences repeat policy differs from the general policy. Consult the School of Nursing and Health Sciences section of the catalog.</p><p>A student who wishes to appeal this repeat policy and take a course for the third time should direct a petition in writing to the manager of academic coaching and support at tjohnson@sxu.edu, who will forward the petition to the chairperson of the department of the repeated course. In the written appeal, the student needs to include the reasons why the student was not successful on their first two attempts and also what specific actions the student will take to be successful in this final attempt. The department chairperson makes the final decision. This decision will be communicated to the student via their SXU email.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>University Curriculum</head><p>The curriculum expresses the University's commitment to the values of a liberal education while providing flexibility and diversity. Liberal education at Saint Xavier University has two main components:</p><p>â€¢ general education, emphasizing breadth and generality â€¢ major or professional program, emphasizing depth and specificity</p><p>The general education curriculum is designed to be both foundational and exploratory, developing the critical skills of writing, speaking, reading and thinking as well as an understanding of the methods, findings, approaches and thought processes of the liberal arts disciplines. The latter component, the major or professional program, is designed to prepare students for careers or for advanced study in graduate school by providing thorough exposure to the origins, structures, contents and purposes of the diverse academic disciplines and professional programs.</p><p>A liberal education at Saint Xavier University leads students to precise expression, analytic thought, systematic inquiry, clear judgment, effective decision making, personal integrity, ethical responsibility, aesthetic sensitivity, informed citizenship and an active posture toward the examined life. These characteristics of a liberal education are the integrative goals for both the entire baccalaureate experience and for the conduct of every course in the Saint Xavier University curriculum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Note on Class Listings</head><p>The number of class hours each week is generally the same as the number of credit hours shown following the course title, except for those courses that offer independent study or that combine lecture and laboratory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Candidate Disposition Assessment</head><p>In an effort to better serve teacher candidates, the P-12 school children and the community the Education Department has implemented a Disposition Support Model. The professional dispositions of candidates are a critical component of development for emerging educators. Candidates are required to maintain appropriate professional dispositions on campus as well as during the field or practical experiences. Faculty and staff utilize evaluation tools, which are aligned with NCATE/SOE selected requirements for dispositions to assess candidate dispositions and develop supportive interventions. An individual disposition status-level system is in place for each Education Department candidate; this system indicates the level at which a candidate stands based on faculty and professional staff evaluation.</p><p>The Education Department Disposition Support Model includes five levels. Faculty and staff work closely with candidates in levels two and three to correct potential or observed disposition concerns. If candidates reach the fourth status level, they are considered to have demonstrated unsatisfactory dispositions and may be placed on probation by a disposition EDUCATION DEPARTMENT review team. Candidates, whose demonstrations of inappropriate dispositions reach the fifth status level, may be recommended for dismissal from the program by a review team; the department chair determines whether or not the candidate is dismissed from the program. For additional information, refer to the program specific Disposition Support Model Handbook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grievance Policy/Procedures for Disposition Decisions</head><p>Candidates who believe that they have been unfairly assigned to level four or level five may initiate a grievance. A candidate may submit a grievance and participate in mediation by following the steps below.</p><p>Step 1: Initiation of Grievance The candidate must submit a disposition status grievance form (herein after referred to as the "disposition grievance form") along with any supporting documents to the dean's office. The disposition grievance forms are housed in the office of the Department Chair of the Education Department.</p><p>Once the dean receives the grievance form, the formal disposition grievance process begins, and the dean sends the paperwork to a mediator, selected by the dean for the case (a mediator may serve on more than one case).</p><p>Step 2: Mediation The mediator has 10 business days from receipt of the disposition grievance form to initiate mediation. The role of the mediator is to be informed of the needs of both parties and to work with both parties to identify potential solutions. The mediator will submit a report to the department chair that includes an overview of the process and a recommendation. If the mediation is not successful, the mediator will provide a written report to the department chair. The candidate can provide a written appeal to the mediator's recommendation to the dean. The department chair will either uphold the mediator's recommendation or uphold the appeal. For additional information, refer to the Disposition Support Model Handbook for Initial Licensure Programs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field Experiences</head><p>Programs offered through the Education Department provide opportunities for candidates to apply the knowledge, skills and dispositions required for effective professional practice through planned, sequenced and assessed field experiences. The transfer of pedagogical knowledge and skill to professional practice is accomplished through pre-student-teaching field experiences and clinical practice (student teaching) at the initial licensure level and through internship and practicum experiences at the advanced licensure levels.</p><p>Field experiences are intended to provide candidates with opportunities to broaden and deepen their understanding of educational theory and integrate this theory with educational practice. Therefore, these experiences:</p><p>1.Connect candidates with the community and provide them with learning experiences in a variety of educational environments with exposure to diverse cultures and encouraging candidates to celebrate the diversity of students in American schools 2.Connect with professional courses and are designed to sequentially complement and expand upon University course content 3.Are assigned by the Coordinator of Field Experiences and take place in selected educational settings that have written contracts with the University, which serve to establish a professional development relationship 4.Typically take place during daytime school hours 5.Recognize NCATE, ISBE and institutional standards and follow the state of Illinois and Saint Xavier University Education Department policies</p><p>The field experiences associated with each program are noted as part of the course descriptions.

It is the responsibility of the candidate to refer to the Illinois School Code and/or seek legal counsel if it is suspected that his/her criminal history may bar licensure or employment in a school district or agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Education Department Fingerprinting Policy Field Experience</head><p>It is the responsibility of the SXU Education Department to verify to our school partners that teacher candidates assigned to school sites for field experiences and/or student teaching (clinical practice) have not been convicted of any illegal activity. To ensure the accuracy and current nature of this information, all Education Department candidates must complete the Chicago Public Schools fingerprinting/background investigation process through Accurate Biometrics prior to any course related field experiences.</p><p>Accurate Biometrics is the fingerprinting vendor for the Chicago Public School (CPS) system. If the CPS fingerprinting process is followed and the appropriate CPS fingerprinting form is used at an Accurate Biometrics location, the fingerprinting process produces both an FBI and an Illinois State Police background check report. The fingerprints are checked against the databases of both agencies (FBI and Illinois state police). Once processed by both agencies, the background check results are generated directly to CPS. If any subsequent convictions occur (HIT) after the initial fingerprinting, CPS would receive the report and notify the SXU Education Department accordingly, if any action is necessary.</p><p>Other fingerprinting agencies do not share updated reports with the SXU Education Department. SXU Education Department candidates pursuing licensure in Illinois must complete the Accurate Biometrics CPS fingerprinting process to ensure that all of our candidates are currently free of any convictions each time they enter our partner schools.</p><p>Exceptions:</p><p>â€¢ Education Department candidates currently employed as licensed teachers, substitutes or paraprofessionals in the Chicago Public School (CPS) system. If CPS currently employs a candidate, the candidate needs to notify the Education Department; we then verify their employment with our CPS liaison. â€¢ Students-at-large (e.g., licensed student teaching mentor teachers taking a free course) if they are enrolled in a course requiring field experiences and those field experiences will be completed in the school/school district in which they are currently employed. However, if field experiences are to be completed in a setting other than the current school/district of employment of the student-at-large, the Accurate Biometrics CPS fingerprinting process must be completed. â€¢ Education Department candidates seeking LBS I endorsement, currently employed as certified teachers and planning to complete all required field experiences in the school/school district in which they are currently employed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programs of Study</head><p>The History and Political Science Department offers a range of programs and courses geared toward the needs of majors, general education students, and candidates for teacher licensure. Most department courses satisfy University general education requirements in history and/or social sciences. Some courses fulfill general education requirements in foreign cultures, diversity or global studies. The department offers majors in history, political science, political communication and advocacy, leadership and public administration, social sciences education and international studies. It offers minors in history, political science, international studies, digital humanities and public administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Education Students</head><p>The History and Political Sciences Department has designed its programs to align with the Illinois Content Area Standards for Educators established by the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), and the Standards of the National Council for Social Sciences (NCSS). Students who wish to become high school history teachers must seek licensure in the area of social sciences with a disciplinary specialization in history. They must pass the content examination which covers a wide range of concepts from history and the social sciences. The department offers a Social Sciences Education (SOCSC) major intended to prepare students for licensure under these policies. This program satisfies the Illinois Content Area Standards and leads to licensure in social sciences with a history specialization. The Social Sciences Education major provides a strong grounding in history but also allows students to develop a breadth across the social sciences. Interested students should discuss the program with advisors in the department. Students seeking secondary licensure must also be admitted to the Education Department, which requires maintaining an SXU grade-point average of 3.0 and meeting the basic skills requirement. Students in the SOCSC Education major must achieve an overall SXU grade-point average of 3.0 and complete all major courses, all general education courses, and all professional education courses with a minimum grade of C to be admitted to student teaching. Students considering this major should be aware that they might face a competitive job market as prospective secondary social science teachers. Success depends upon strong mastery of the content area as demonstrated by superior grades in coursework as well as the development of professional dispositions appropriate to teachers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Admission to Department</head><p>For admission as a major in one of the department's programs, a student must have completed at least six (6) credit hours in the intended major with a grade-point average of 2.5. The student must also have an overall grade-point average of 2.5. Interested students should apply for admission to the department chairperson. Once admitted to the department, students will be assigned an advisor with whom they should consult each semester about their course of study.

Courses in which a student earns a grade of D will not count toward the fulfillment of department program requirements except by written permission from the department chair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History Majors</head><p>The immediate objective in studying history is to gain an understanding of what happened in the past. Such an understanding is essential for comprehending how society has evolved, and for critically reflecting upon both the accomplishments and limitations of today's world. The study of history involves acquisition of knowledge and understanding, cultivation of perspective, and development of communication and critical-thinking skills. Learning to assess the credibility of evidence and to formulate interpretations based on evidence are central concerns in the study of history. Historical skills are useful in preparing for many professions. Majoring in history can help students prepare themselves for careers in secondary teaching and for graduate study. The major provides excellent preparation for students planning careers in law, government service and journalism. History students also find career opportunities HISTORY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT in museums, libraries, archives, tourism and travel, historical preservation, business research and marketing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Political Science Major</head><p>The study of politics is, at base, the study of how social values are defined and distributed. Who can vote? Who makes policy decisions? Will we go to war? Have universal health coverage? Subsidize loans for college students? These are all distributional, and hence political, questions. As Harold Laswell put it, politics is about "Who gets what, when and how?" Political science focuses on both institutions and behaviors to explain how social power is distributed, and how that power is used to distribute other goods.</p><p>The study of political science is vital to a liberal arts education. Through a critical encounter with political structures and processes, we learn to think critically, to develop and evaluate arguments and to remain open to new ideas. Through reflection on significant events, ideas, movements and passions that have shaped the political world, we come to understand better our own values, to refine our beliefs.</p><p>Majoring in political science prepares students for careers in public administration, politics, journalism, education, nongovernmental organizations, public relations and business. It is an excellent major for those considering law school.</p><p>The political science program offers students a well-rounded undergraduate education within the discipline. Courses are offered in all the major sub fields of the discipline: U.S. government, international relations, comparative politics and political philosophy. Students gain practical experience and professional skills to complement their coursework through a required internship.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language and Literature Department</head><p>The Language and Literature Department offers a number of academic paths for intellectual discovery and future success in the fields of literature, language, rhetoric, and education. The faculty in the Language and Literature Department is committed to exploring the inextricable links that exist between language, literature and rhetoric in the contexts most relevant to students, and they work closely with their majors to offer courses that deliver a rigorous and purposeful learning experience. The department offers four majors for students to choose from, two with alternate concentrations:</p><p>â€¢ An English major with a choice of two concentrations:</p><p>â€¢ Global literatures â€¢ Rhetoric and writing â€¢ An English Secondary Education major for students preparing to teach grades 9-12 â€¢ A Spanish major with a choice of two concentrations:</p><p>â€¢ Spanish language, Literature and Civilization â€¢ Spanish for the Professions â€¢ A Spanish Education major for students preparing to teach grades K-12</p><p>In addition, the department offers minors in English, writing, Spanish and Latino/Latin American Studies.</p><p>When students engage in the study of language and literature, they encounter the very expression of human experience and humane values and gain insights into what it means to be a citizen of the world. Throughout their undergraduate career, our students learn about the significant cultural, historical, political, and sociological forces that drive the creation and evolution of language and literature over time; indeed, they come to understand language and literature as products of the society that creates them rather than a monolithic expression of the individual. In essence, the Language and Literature Department provides its majors with the tools needed to succeed in a world in which information proliferates endlessly, a world in which knowing how to interpret and evaluate the words, images, and texts that abound will help them to navigate the society in which they live. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English and English Secondary Education</head><p>English, like every language, is more than a means of communication. It is both a way of thinking about the world and a world in itself, a place where the imagination and intellect combine to teach us about the most important subject of all: ourselves as human beings. The study of English in both majors of the department promotes study, reflection, and appreciation of language, literature, and rhetoric in this larger sense. How do the words, the thoughts, the persuasions, and the stories of our cultural heritage lend insight into what it means to be human?</p><p>Over the years, majoring in English has been a route to rewarding careers in business, publishing, education, law, and government. The reason for this success is simple: employers have come to realize that English majors have learned to be innovative, articulate critical thinkers. They also realize that as society continues to grow more technical and complex, key personnel will be needed to help people communicate with each other. As long as we depend upon language to make ourselves understood and to get things done, majoring in English will always be practical.</p><p>The English secondary education major integrates a full professional program with the department's linguistic, literary and rhetorical foundations. The best teachers of English are also scholars of English --and the most empowered teachers are those who can navigate the mandates of the profession from the perspectives of a scholarly formation while also understanding the art of teaching young adults.</p><p>Majoring in English also leads to a wide variety of professional graduate programs. Master's and doctoral programs in English accept students who want to prepare for college teaching and research. Historically, law schools have drawn their students from both political science and English. MBA programs and medical schools have also begun turning to majors from the liberal arts, such as English, for students. The English major at Saint Xavier University is flexible enough to allow for the addition of those basic courses in business or science needed for admission into professional programs.</p><p>All English and English secondary education majors at Saint Xavier University begin their course of study by taking introductory coursework in literary and rhetorical theory and practice. This common set of core course provides students the opportunity either (1) to delay their choice of a major (English or English Secondary Education) or a concentration within the English major (Global Literatures or Rhetoric and Writing) or (2) to switch concentrations or majors at a later date without losing credit for introductory coursework.</p><p>Sigma Tau Delta, the International English Honor Society, has a chapter on campus, Alpha Epsilon Xi. The chapter, moderated by a faculty member, sponsors literary activities and, by encouraging student participation in regional and national conferences, promotes literary research and creativity among its members.</p></div>

Latin American studies specifically examines the part of the globe called Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean with an emphasis on that region's history, literature, economy and politics. The Latino/Latin American studies program at Saint Xavier University thus provides a well-rounded overview of the Latino/Latin American experiences in U.S./global contexts.</p><p>The program offers a minor in Latino/Latin American studies. The minor is a source of professional development that complements areas of study related to Latinos/Latin America such as education, nursing, communications, business and any of the social sciences. Many courses are augmented with activities such as films, field trips and community service projects. Students are especially encouraged to participate in study abroad courses and independent research initiatives with faculty.</p><p>The Latino/Latin American studies minor requires 18 credit hours. Students are required to take LS 101: Introduction to Latino/Latin Studies and one course in the Spanish language at any level. The remaining 12 credit hours should be drawn from the following range of disciplines: Art/Humanities/Music/Literature; History; Social Sciences; Foreign Languages and Study Abroad Programs. These courses will satisfy requirements for the University's General Education Program, in addition to many major requirements. While there is no prescribed course of study, students must take courses in at least two of the disciplines mentioned above.</p><p>As it is the intent of this program to be truly interdisciplinary in scope, other courses may be approved in consultation with the program director. It is recommended, though not required, that Introduction to Latino Studies be taken prior to or in conjunction with other Latino/Latin American studies courses. Consult Self-Service using the course type "Latino/Latin American Studies" to identify course sections approved for the minor.</p></div>

It recommends courses to better prepare students for the Law School Aptitude Test (LSATs) and provides advising, mentoring, various activities and resources to support academic and career planning efforts.</p><p>Saint Xavier University provides a Pre-Law Handbook (PDF) for students considering the legal profession, or legal study, and for candidates applying to law school. This handbook (PDF) is designed to help students at every stage of their undergraduate studies at SXU.</p><p>A legal career can be a rewarding profession. At its best, legal practice challenges the intellect, demanding the exercise of reason and judgment. The ethics of the profession requires attorneys to promote justice, fairness and morality; thus, legal careers can bring particular satisfaction to those who seek to work to promote social justice within the law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommended Courses for Pre-Law Students</head><p>According to the American Bar Association, there are no recommended undergraduate majors or groups of courses designated as "pre-law" education. Students are admitted to law school from almost every academic discipline. However, undergraduate students who consider entering a law school and pursuing a legal career are encouraged to take an area of study that interests and challenges them, while taking advantage of opportunities to develop their research and writing skills. An excellent way to prepare for a legal education is to take a broad range of difficult courses. These courses include those which cultivate and enhance basic skills of analytic problem solving, critical reading, writing, oral communication, general research, and task organization and management. Also strongly recommended are those that offer a broad understanding of history and the development of American society, a fundamental grasp of political thought and the contemporary American political system, some familiarity with mathematics for financial and evidentiary analysis, a basic understanding of human behavior and social interaction, and fundamental knowledge of international institutions, world events, and globalization.</p><p>Thefollowing courses are highly recommended; many of them may be taken as part of general education course work. </p></div>

Students also take elective courses of their choice, and in their senior year choose a capstone course, to study an area of interest in depth.</p><p>A degree in psychology provides the foundation for a variety of career paths. With a bachelor's degree in psychology, the student might expect to find work in such fields as education, sales, marketing, social work, social services, real estate, data analysis, public relations, administration and many more.</p><p>Earning a bachelor's degree in psychology also may position students for further study at the graduate level. For instance, by earning a master's degree, students may pursue employment in community counseling, school counseling, marriage and family therapy, management, and other occupations in public and private industry. Many graduate programs in psychology require students to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) for admission. Students considering graduate training are therefore encouraged to take courses in skill areas emphasized by the GRE. These skill areas include language/verbal skills, mathematical skills and analytic skills.</p></div>

Other areas which employ people with bachelor's degrees in sociology include law, community planning, social research and government agencies. Students may also wish to pursue graduate education, either at the master's or doctoral levels.</p><p>Majors in other disciplines will find sociology courses to be useful background for careers in business, education, nursing, psychology, criminal justice, mass communications and religious studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CPA Preparation</head><p>Students pursuing a career in accounting should strongly consider the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation. The CPA exam is the gold-standard certification in the accounting industry. To be eligible to take the CPA exam, students must have 150 credit hours of undergraduate or higher education and meet certain course requirements. Saint Xavier University's undergraduate degree in Accounting meets all of the requirements to sit for the CPA exam except the 150 credit hour requirement (students typically complete their undergraduate degree with 120 credit hours). Students wishing to earn the additional 30 credit hours typically follow one of the following paths:</p><p>1) Earn a M.S. in Accounting. Saint Xavier University offers a 4+1 program where undergraduates in good standing are granted admission to the M.S. in Accounting program while finishing their undergraduate degree. This 10 course (30 credit hour) degree is designed to provide future accountants with the skills and knowledge to be high-quality accounting professionals. With flexible hybrid and online courses, students typically finish the M.S. in Accounting in approximately a year while working full-time.</p><p>2) Earn a Masters in Business Administration in any field. Saint Xavier University offers expedited admission to undergraduate students. This 13 course (39 credit hour) degree offers a variety of concentrations. Pursuing an M.B.A. allows students to complete the 150-credit hour requirement to sit for the CPA exam while broadening their educational background.</p><p>3) Pursue undergraduate or graduate educational interests. Other than those course requirements met in the undergraduate accounting curriculum, there are no specific course requirements. Students are encouraged to pursue additional coursework in areas which interest them and which align with their career goals. Some recommendations would be finance, management, computer science, and data analytics.</p></div>
