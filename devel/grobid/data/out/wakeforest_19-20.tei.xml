<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Home Wake Forest College and the School of Business of Wake Forest University</head><p>Announcements for 2019/2020 www.wfu.edu (http://www.wfu.edu)</p><p>The course offerings and requirements of the undergraduate schools are continually under examination, and revisions are expected. This Bulletin presents the offerings and requirements in effect at the time of publication and in no way guarantees that the offerings and requirements will remain the same.</p><p>Every effort is made to provide advance information of any changes.</p><p>Beginning as early as 1894, Wake Forest accepted an obligation to provide professional training in a number of fields, as a complement to its primary mission of liberal arts education. This responsibility is fulfilled in the conviction that the humane values embodied in the liberal arts are also centrally relevant to the professions. Professional education at Wake Forest is characterized by a commitment to ethical and other professional ideals that transcend technical skills. Like the Graduate School, the professional schools are dedicated to the advancement of learning in their fields. In addition, they are specifically committed to the application of knowledge to solving concrete problems of human beings. They are strengthened by values and goals which they share with the College and Graduate School, and the professional schools enhance the work of these schools and the University as a whole by serving as models of service to humanity. Wake Forest was founded by private initiative, and ultimate decisionmaking authority lies in a privately appointed Board of Trustees rather than in a public body. Funded to a large extent from private sources of support, it is determined to chart its own course in the pursuit of its goals. As a co-educational institution it seeks to "educate together" persons of both sexes and from a wide range of backgrounds--racial, ethnic, religious, geographical, socio-economic and cultural. Its residential features are conducive to learning and to the pursuit of a wide range of co-curricular activities. It has made a conscious choice to remain small in overall size; it takes pride in being able to function as a community rather than a conglomerate. Its location in the Piedmont area of North Carolina engenders an ethos that is distinctively Southern, and more specifically North Carolinian. As it seeks further to broaden its constituency and to receive national recognition, it is also finding ways to maintain the ethos associated with its regional roots.</p><p>Wake Forest is proud of its Baptist and Christian heritage. For more than a century and a half, it has provided the University an indispensable basis for its mission and purpose, enabling Wake Forest to educate thousands of ministers and lay people for enlightened leadership in their churches and communities. Far from being exclusive and parochial, this religious tradition gives the University roots that ensure its lasting identity and branches that provide a supportive environment for a wide variety of faiths. The Baptist insistence on both the separation of church and state and local autonomy has helped to protect the University from interference and domination by outside interests, whether these be commercial, governmental, or ecclesiastical. The Baptist stress upon an uncoerced conscience in matters of religious belief has been translated into a concern for academic freedom. The Baptist emphasis upon revealed truth enables a strong religious critique of human reason, even as the claims of revelation are put under the scrutiny of reason. The character of intellectual life at Wake Forest encourages open and frank dialogue and provides assurance that the University will be ecumenical and not provincial in scope, and that it must encompass perspectives other than the Christian. Wake Forest thus seeks to maintain and invigorate what is noblest in its religious heritage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Complaints</head><p>Services, and the Judicial Council. Complete details are available at the Offices of the Dean of the College and the Dean of Students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Complaints</head><p>Situations may arise in which a student believes that he or she has not received fair treatment by a representative of the University or has a complaint about the performance, actions, or inaction of the staff or faculty affecting a student. There are mechanisms in place for the reporting and resolution of complaints regarding specific types of concern (student conduct, honor system, bias, grade dispute, harassment and discrimination, for instance), and these should be fully used where appropriate. Students are encouraged to seek assistance from faculty advisers, deans' offices in the College or Business School, or the Office of the Dean of Students when evaluating the nature of their complaints and deciding on an appropriate course of action.</p><p>The complaint process outlined below is meant to answer and resolve issues arising between individual students and the University and its various offices when a mechanism for reporting and resolution of the specific type of concern is not already in place. A complaint cannot be filed on behalf of another person. A complaint should first be directed as soon as possible to the person or persons whose actions or inactions have given rise to the problem-not later than three months after the event.</p><p>For complaints in the academic (i.e., classroom) setting, the student should talk personally with or send a written complaint explaining the concern directly to the instructor. Should the student and instructor be unable to resolve the conflict, the student may then turn to the chair of the involved department (in the Wake Forest School of Business, this would be the dean) for assistance. The chair (or dean) will communicate with both parties, seek to understand their individual perspectives, and within a reasonable time, reach a conclusion and share it with both parties. If the student's complaint is not resolved by these procedures he/ she should consult with the Office of Academic Advising for assistance. Finally, a student may appeal to the Committee on Academic Affairs which will study the matter, taking input from all parties, and reach a final decision concerning resolution.</p><p>For complaints outside the academic setting, the student should talk personally with or send a written complaint explaining the concern directly to the individual involved. Should the student and individual be unable to resolve the concern, the student may then turn to the appropriate administrative channel for assistance, which may be an immediate supervisor, department head, or Dean. The immediate supervisor, department head, or dean will meet or communicate with both parties, seek to understand their individual perspectives, and within a reasonable time, reach a conclusion and share it with both parties. Finally, a student may appeal to the vice president with administrative responsibility for the issue that is the subject of the concern. The vice president will study the matter, work with the parties, and reach a final resolution. Students uncertain about the proper channels are encouraged to seek advice from faculty advisers, deans' offices, or the Office of the Dean of Students.</p><p>Use of campus resources is restricted to authorized users. For the purposes of this policy, an "authorized user" is defined as an individual who has been assigned a login ID and authentication credentials such as a password for use of computing resources. Authorized users are responsible for the proper use of the accounts assigned to them under their login ID and authentication credentials. Users are also responsible for reporting any activities which they believe to be in violation of this policy, just as students are responsible for reporting Honor Code violations.</p><p>Use of these resources must be done:</p><p>• In a manner consistent with the terms under which they were granted access</p><p>• In a way that respects the rights and privacy of other users; so as not to interfere with or violate the normal, appropriate use of these resources; and</p><p>• In a responsible manner and consistent with University policies and the workplace and educational environment.</p><p>For faculty, staff, vendors, contractors, and other non-students, limited personal use of University issued computing resources is authorized so long as it does not impact University computers, network, or interfere with work related activities and is not prohibited by this or other policies.</p><p>administrative procedures, The Honor and Ethics Council, the Graduate Council, Dean's office, or Human Resources.</p><p>Violation of this policy may result in one or more of the following, in addition to any other actions deemed appropriate by the applicable authority:</p><p>• Suspension of one's ability to perform interactive logins on relevant machines on campus.</p><p>• Suspension of one's ability to use the University's computing resources.</p><p>• Suspension of one's ability to send or receive email.</p><p>• Increased monitoring of further computer activity (beyond normal systems monitoring).</p><p>Locating Computing Policy Information and Policy Updates.

These policies may be updated, shortened, or expanded from time to time.</p><p>Full policies can be reviewed online: https://is.wfu.edu/services/policiesand-standards/</p><p>The admission application requires records and recommendations directly from secondary school officials. Submission of standardized test scores is optional. If submitting scores, they should be sent directly to the University by the official testing service. A nonrefundable $65 fee to cover the cost of processing must accompany an application. It cannot be applied to later charges for accepted students or refunded for others. The University reserves the right to reject any application without explanation.</p><p>A $500 nonrefundable admission deposit is required of all regularly admitted students and must be sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions no later than May 1 following notice of acceptance. It is credited toward first semester fees and is nonrefundable. Students notified of acceptance after May 1 for the fall semester or November 1 for the spring semester should make a nonrefundable admission deposit within two weeks of notification. Failure to make the admission deposit is taken as cancellation of application by the student. No deposit is required for summer session enrollment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Decision</head><p>Wake Forest has two binding early decision plans for students who have decided conclusively that Wake Forest is their first college choice. While early decision applicants may submit regular decision applications to other institutions, Wake Forest must be the applicant's first choice and only early decision application. Students, parents, and school counselors must sign the Early Decision Agreement stating that the applicant will enroll if admitted and will withdraw all applications to other colleges upon acceptance to Wake Forest.</p><p>Early Decision I (ED I) students may apply after completion of the junior year but no later than November 15. ED I applicants are notified on a rolling basis, typically six to eight weeks after the application is completed.</p><p>Early Decision II (ED II) applicants must follow the same exclusivity guidelines as required for ED I. The ED II application deadline is January 1. ED II is not rolling; decisions are released in mid-February.</p><p>A $500 enrollment deposit is due within two weeks of acceptance notification for both ED I and ED II.</p><p>country that guarantees housing to students in good standing for eight semesters. Students are required to live in campus housing their first three years unless they live with a parent or guardian in the Winston-Salem area. Students who study abroad during the fall or spring semesters are given credit for that time toward their residency requirement; summer sessions do NOT count toward residency requirements. Transfer students are expected to fulfill the six-semester residency requirement. However, transfer students who have lived on campus at another institution are given credit for that time toward their residency requirement. See "Housing" for more information.</p><p>1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refunds</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Refund of Charges Policy and Return of Financial Aid Funds Policies</head><p>A student who officially withdraws or officially is granted continuous enrollment status during a semester may be entitled to a refund of certain charges as outlined in the Tuition and Fees Refund <ref type="bibr">Policy (below)</ref>. A withdrawal, official or otherwise, or grant of continuous enrollment status also affects financial aid eligibility, as outlined in the federal Return of Title IV Program Funds Policy and the Return of Non-Title IV Program Funds Policy. A student using scholarships, grants, or loans to pay educational expenses, whose account was paid-in-full prior to withdrawal or grant of continuous enrollment status, is likely to owe the University after withdrawal or grant of continuous enrollment status. Procedures for such changes of status are coordinated by the Office of Academic Advising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition and Fees Refund Policy</head><p>A student who officially withdraws or officially is granted continuous enrollment status during a semester may be entitled to an adjustment to tuition and housing depending on the date of withdrawal or grant of continuous enrollment status. If a tuition adjustment results in a credit balance, the student can elect to receive a refund of the credit balance or leave the balance on the account for future terms. Any adjustment of room rent is based on when the student has checked out of his/her residence hall after withdrawing or beginning continuous enrollment status. Unused meal plan funds are refunded on a weekly pro-rata basis. There is no adjustment for mandatory fees after the first day of class. Fees for individual music instruction courses are refunded on the same basis as tuition. Parking registration fees are not refundable if the decal has been placed on the vehicle. Tuition, fees, housing, and related charges are not automatically refunded for findings of responsibility within the undergraduate student judicial review process but are refunded at the same rate listed below. Return of Title IV funds are handled in accordance with federal law.</p></div>

Nonpayment for classes for which a student is registered or non-attendance in a registered class does not release the student from financial obligation and will not drop the student from the class. Student Financial Services calculates the refund of charges and will apply the amount of tuition refunded in the schedule of adjustment timelines listed above. Student Financial Services has available an example of the application of the University Refund of Charges Policy. If charges originally paid by financial aid funds are no longer covered after financial aid funds are returned to the programs, the student is responsible for the remaining balance. If charges originally paid and adjusted leave a credit balance on the account, the student is responsible for completing an online student refund request at finance.wfu.edu/sfs/student-refund (http://finance.wfu.edu/sfs/student-refund).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Return of Title IV Program Funds Policy</head><p>The <ref type="formula">1998</ref>  Title IV aid is awarded and paid on a payment period basis. For students enrolled in a single session or module of a payment period (such a summer), the single session or module is the payment period. For students who are awarded Title IV aid based on a reported registration in multiple sessions or modules of a payment period, the payment period is the beginning (start date) of the first session or module through the end (last day of exams) of the last session or module. Students who do not complete a payment period upon which Title IV aid was awarded, are considered to be withdrawn from the payment period and are subject to the Return of Title IV Program Funds Policy.</p><p>The percentage of the payment period completed is determined by dividing the total number of calendar days comprising the payment period (excluding breaks of five or more consecutive days) into the number of calendar days completed. The percentage of Title IV grant and loan funds earned is:</p><p>1. up through the 60% point in time, the percentage of the payment period completed, 2. after the 60% point in time, 100%. The amount of Title IV grant and loan funds unearned is the complement of the percentage of earned Title IV funds applied to the total amount of Title IV funds disbursed (including funds that were not disbursed but could have been disbursed, i.e., post-withdrawal or post-grant of continuous enrollment status disbursements). If the amount earned is less than the amount disbursed, the difference is returned to the Title IV programs. If the amount earned is greater than the amount disbursed, the difference is treated as a late disbursement in accordance with the federal rules for late disbursements.</p><p>Institutional charges (costs) include tuition and required fees, on-campus room rental, and on-campus meal plan. The federal Return of Title IV Funds policy requires that federal aid be considered as first applied toward institutional charges, regardless of other non-federal aid received.</p><p>Unearned funds, up to the amount of total institutional charges multiplied by the unearned percentage of funds, are returned by the University; the return of Title IV Program funds may be rounded to the nearest dollar for each aid source. The student returns any portion of unearned funds not returned by the University. A student (or parent for PLUS loans) repays the calculated amount attributable to a Title IV loan program according to the loan's terms. If repayment of grant funds by the student is required, only 50% of the unearned amount must be repaid. A student repays a Title IV grant program subject to repayment arrangements satisfactory to the University or the Secretary of Education's overpayment collection procedures.</p><p>Funds returned are credited in the following order: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Return of Non-Title IV Program Funds Policy</head><p>A student who drops to less-than-full-time enrollment within the timeframe to drop courses as published in the academic calendar loses eligibility for all institutional aid for the entire term. For financial aid purposes, full-time enrollment is defined as twelve or more hours each semester.</p><p>The Office of Student Financial Aid calculates the amount of non-Title IV program funds to be returned to the various programs when a recipient withdraws or is granted continuous enrollment status. The return of non-Title IV Program funds may be rounded to the nearest dollar for each aid source.</p><p>Return of funds to various state and private aid programs is determined by specific program rules. If rules allow, state and private loan funds are returned before gift funds. State and private funds may be retained in amounts necessary to satisfy the student's remaining University charges or adjusted need, whichever is larger.</p><p>Awards from institutional funds for which all disbursement requirements have not been met by the student prior to withdrawal or change to continuous enrollment status are canceled and no disbursements are made.</p><p>Upon withdrawal or change to continuous enrollment status, an adjusted estimated cost of attendance (COA) is established in two parts. For an on-campus student, the first part equals the adjusted tuition and room rental charges (not to exceed the standard allowance, and not including charges that result from a student remaining in his/her room after the date of withdrawal) and the standard allowance for books and supplies; the second part equals pro-rated estimates (by weeks) of meal, transportation, and personal living expenses. For an off-campus student, the first part equals the adjusted tuition charge and the standard allowance for books and supplies; the second part equals pro-rated estimates (by weeks) of room, meal, transportation, and personal living expenses.</p><p>If the adjusted COA is greater than the full semester expected family contribution (EFC), the student retains institutional aid (in the same mix of initially-awarded gift and loan), up to the amount required to meet the adjusted need and not exceeding the initial amount(s). The EFC represents a best estimate of a family's capacity (relative to other families) to absorb, over time, the costs of education. For a student withdrawing or changing to continuous enrollment status, the full EFC is expected to support educational expenses incurred, prior to any support from aid programs. For purposes of this calculation, a student who receives only merit-based institutional gift is considered to have an EFC equal to the full semester COA minus the amount of that gift. The order in which each institutional fund is reduced is determined on a case-by-case basis by the aid office, with the guiding principle being the return of funds to University accounts most likely to be needed by other students.</p><p>A student who withdraws or changes to continuous enrollment status after receiving a cash disbursement must repay Wake Forest scholarship funds up to the amount of Title IV funds that the University must return.</p><p>Fines and other incidental charges not included in the financial aid COA are solely the responsibility of the student. Required returns of funds to all financial aid programs are made prior to the refund to the student.</p><p>Housing permits are limited and sold on a first-come first-serve basis), off campus (Winston-Salem First and the designated lot in Reynolda Village) or the UCC lot. A waitlist will be available, if/when on-campus or Winston Salem First/Reynolda Village commuter permits sell out. If we determine space is available in either of these areas at a later time, we will honor the waitlist. You are encouraged to register for a permit, even if on the waitlist. There is no guarantee the waitlist will be honored.</p><p>• The UCC parking permit is available to those who ride the shuttle to campus from apartment complexes or students who otherwise reside in off-campus housing and walk or bike to campus between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday-Friday.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Housing</head><p>Wake Forest has a six-semester (typically three-year) residency requirement and is one of the few universities in the country that guarantees housing to students in good standing for eight semesters.</p><p>Students are required to live in campus housing their first three years unless they live with a parent or guardian in the Winston-Salem area. Students who study abroad during the fall or spring semesters are given credit for that time toward their residency requirement; summer sessions do NOT count toward residency requirements.</p><p>Transfer students are expected to fulfill the six-semester residency requirement. However, transfer students who have lived on campus at another institution are given credit for that time toward their residency requirement.</p><p>Eight semesters of on-campus housing are guaranteed for residential students who pay their tuition deposit by the published deadline each semester. Students who lose housing eligibility due to disciplinary or academic deficiency are no longer eligible for the housing guarantee. Additionally, students who successfully petition to live off campus or have fulfilled their residency requirement and do not select housing during the room selection process are also no longer guaranteed housing on campus.</p><p>For more information about the Office of Residence Life and Housing or their processes and policies, please visit their website at rlh.wfu.edu (https://rlh.wfu.edu).</p><p>Students currently residing, or desiring to move, off-campus must register their address each year to comply with the policy and to ensure individual records are updated. Though a student has registered to reside offcampus, the application submitted is purely a request, and it should not be inferred that approval has been received. Students whose applications are approved will receive written notification. Once a student has been approved to reside off-campus, the local address provided is valid for one academic year only. Additionally, if a student changes location of residency, they must re-register their address and check to make sure that the location of residency is approved.</p><p>Continuing enrolled students who do not re-register to reside off-campus (prior to the expiration of the original approved local address) will have a hold placed on future class registration processes (or may risk having their registration canceled) until approval is received.</p><p>Students who previously lost, or lose during the current academic term, campus housing due to judicial sanctions also need to register to reside off-campus. Other populations of students who need to register upon acceptance to the University include transfer or any student classified with non-resident student status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising and Registration Orientation and Advising</head><p>For new students in the College, a required orientation program and a required meeting with the student's lower-division academic adviser precede the beginning of classes and the drop/add period. Some required orientation programs also occur during fall semester of the first year. The lower-division academic adviser provides guidance during and between registration periods until the student declares a major.</p><p>During orientation, advisers meet with students both individually and in small groups. A face-to-face meeting with the adviser is required before all subsequent registration periods. Students are encouraged to take the initiative in arranging additional meetings at any time to seek advice or other assistance. The lower-division adviser works with the student until the student declares a major, typically during the fourth semester. Then, an adviser in the student's major department is assigned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advising and Registration</head><p>• Sophomore-completion of no fewer than 25 hours toward a degree;</p><p>• Junior-completion of no fewer than 55 hours toward a degree;</p><p>• Senior-completion of no fewer than 87 hours toward a degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Load</head><p>Most courses in the College and the School of Business undergraduate program have a value of 3 credit hours, but they may vary from one-half hour to five hours. The normal load for a full-time undergraduate student is 15 credit hours per semester. The maximum credit hours allowed in the College without permission is 17, and the maximum allowed in the School of Business is 18. A student who feels that he or she has valid and compelling reasons to register for more than the maximum hours in a semester must seek permission starting each semester after the second round of registration appointments. Only if the adviser, the appropriate staff of the Office of Academic Advising, and the Committee on Academic Affairs agree that the proposed course load is in the best interest of the student will permission be granted. Non-business or non-accounting majors wishing to take courses in the School of Business must have met the specific courses' prerequisites and have permission of the instructor. Enrollment in the course is subject to space availability.</p><p>Twelve hours per semester constitute minimum full-time enrollment for undergraduates at the University. Recipients of Wake Forest scholarships and loans, as well as some types of federal aid, must be enrolled for at least 12 hours. Recipients of veterans' benefits, grants from state government, and other governmental aid must meet the guidelines of the appropriate agencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part-time Students</head><p>A student may not register for part-time status (i.e., fewer than 12 hours in a single semester) without specific permission from the Office of Academic Advising by the last day to add a class. Approval for part-time status requires that students pay for such work on a per hour basis. Petitions for part-time status after the last day to add a class will be denied, except in the case of special circumstances, and the student will be required to pay full tuition. Part-time students may be ineligible for campus housing unless an exception is made by the Office of Residence Life and Housing. For information regarding the consequences of part-time status on tuition, students should visit the office of Student Financial Services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head><p>The responsibility for class attendance lies with the student, who is expected to attend classes regularly and punctually. A vital aspect of the residential college experience is attendance in the classroom; its value cannot be measured by testing procedures alone. Students are considered sufficiently mature to appreciate the necessity of regular attendance, to accept this personal responsibility, to demonstrate the self-discipline essential for such performance, and to recognize and accept the consequences of failure to attend. Students who cause their work or that of the class to suffer because of absence or lateness may be referred by the instructor to the appropriate dean in the Office of Academic Advising for suitable action. Any student who does not attend classes regularly or who demonstrates other evidence of academic irresponsibility is subject to such disciplinary action as the Committee on Academic Affairs may prescribe, including immediate suspension from the College or from the School of Business.</p><p>Students who miss class while acting as duly authorized representatives of the University at events and times approved by the appropriate dean are considered excused. The undergraduate faculties are sensitive to the religious practices of members of the student body. At the beginning of the semester, students who will be absent from class for religious observances should confer with the instructor(s) about the date of the absence. The disposition of missed assignments will be arranged between instructor and student. Students anticipating many excused absences should consult the instructor before enrolling in classes in which attendance and class participation count heavily toward the final grade. For policies pertaining to absences resulting from illness or other extenuating circumstances please see the statement under the Student Health Service section in this Undergraduate Bulletin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auditing Courses</head><p>When space is available after the registration of degree-seeking students, others may request permission of the instructor to enter a class as auditors. No additional charge is made to full-time students in the College or the School of Business; for others the fee is $75 per hour. Permission of the instructor is required. An auditor is subject to attendance regulations and to other conditions imposed by the instructor.</p><p>Although an auditor receives no credit, a notation of audit is made on the final grade report and entered on the academic record of students who have met the instructor's requirements. An audit may not be changed to a credit course or a credit course changed to an audit after the first official day of classes for each semester or term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropping a Course</head><p>Students may drop full term courses through the 26th class day. The last day in each term for dropping a class is listed on the Academic Calendar available at https://registrar.wfu.edu/calendars/. A student who wishes to drop any course on or before this date must follow the procedure prescribed by the registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study, Individual Study, Directed Reading and Internships</head><p>Such work is ordinarily reserved for junior and senior students in the undergraduate schools. Any student requesting approval for such a course must possess a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in Wake Forest courses. All such course requests must be approved by the appropriate department. The academic requirements must be completed during the semester in which a student is enrolled.</p><p>The number of credit hours the student registers for in an independent study, individual study, directed reading, or internship course may not be changed during the add period unless approved by the sponsoring faculty member.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Undergraduates in Graduate Courses</head><p>In exceptional circumstances, undergraduate students may enroll in Wake Forest graduate-level courses. Such students must have junior or senior status and must obtain written permission from the course instructor, the student's adviser, and the associate dean for academic advising. Typically, undergraduate students will not be allowed to take 600-level classes for credit if the related 300-level class is available; undergraduate students who wish to take a cross-listed course at the graduate level must follow the procedure described above. Graduate programs have no obligation to admit undergraduate students to their courses and do so at their own discretion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examinations and Grading Examinations</head><p>Final examinations for each class are scheduled at specific periods during the six final examination days at the end of the term. All examinations are conducted in accordance with the Honor and Ethics System adopted by the student body and approved by the faculty. Students should have no more than two final exams in a 24-hour period. They should be allowed to reschedule exams in excess of two in a 24-hour period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading</head><p>For most courses carrying undergraduate credit, there are twelve final grades: A (exceptionally high achievement), A-, B+, B (superior), B-, C+, C (satisfactory), C-, D+, D, D-(passing but unsatisfactory), and F (failure).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Policies and Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dean's List</head><p>The Dean's List is issued after the end of the fall and spring semesters. It includes all full-time, degree-seeking students in the College and the School of Business who have a grade point average of 3.4 or better for a full-time course load in the semester and who have earned no grade below C during the semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation Distinctions</head><p>Graduation distinctions are determined by the grade-point average system and are based entirely on grades earned in Wake Forest courses. A degree candidate with a cumulative average of not less than 3.8 for all courses attempted is graduated with the distinction summa cum laude. A candidate with a cumulative average of not less than 3.6 for all courses attempted is graduated with the distinction magna cum laude. A candidate with a cumulative average of not less than 3.4 for all courses attempted is graduated with the distinction cum laude. Details are available in the Office of the University Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repetition of Courses</head><p>A Wake Forest course can be repeated at Wake Forest if the grade earned is C-or lower. In this case, all grades received will appear on the transcript, but the course will be counted only one time for credit. If a student fails a course previously passed, the hours originally earned will not be forfeited. For purposes of determining the cumulative grade point average, a course will be considered as attempted only once, and the grade points assigned will reflect the highest grade received. A grade of irreplaceable F received in a class as a consequence of an honor violation does not prevent a student from repeating the class, but if the repeat successfully earns credit for the class, both the repeat grade and the irreplaceable F will be included in the cumulative grade point average. Students seeking to repeat WRI 105 must petition the English department.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrollment Policies and Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuous Enrollment Status</head><p>An undergraduate student who needs to interrupt his/her full-or parttime status for personal or medical reasons may petition for continuous enrollment status with the Office of Academic Advising. This status can be approved for one or two semesters. When students approved for continuous enrollment status wish to resume full-or part-time status, they must submit a notification to this effect to the Office of Academic Advising and any other information required by the Committee on Academic Affairs. See Resumption of Full-or Part-time Status for more details.</p><p>In the case of change to continuous enrollment status granted during an academic term for medical reasons, the student may request that no grades be recorded for that semester. Such requests require the formal support of either the Student Health Service or the University Counseling Center, and the student's standing in courses at the time of departure may be taken into consideration. The Committee on Academic Affairs has final authority on such requests.</p><p>Residence hall keys (if applicable), mailbox keys, the Wake Forest University ID card, along with any other pertinent University property items, must be returned to the appropriate offices. The student retains active enrollment status with the University, and retains email and registration privileges, and all applicable University policies will continue to apply. Wake Forest University's policy on Continuous Enrollment Status does not exempt any student from the requirements of the Return of Title IV Funds policy; nor does it extend federal student loan deferment benefits.</p><p>A continuous enrollment fee will be assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal</head><p>A student who intends to interrupt full-or part-time status for more than two semesters on a voluntary or medical basis and is not granted continuous enrollment status (see above), or any student who is suspended for academic or judicial reasons, is deemed to have withdrawn from the University.</p><p>A student who initially requests continuous enrollment status but who has been in that status for more than two semesters (or one year), is reclassified as withdrawn, will no longer have registration privileges and an email account, and must return all university property to the appropriate office(s). In addition, any student who discontinues class attendance or does not properly resume full-or part-time status, but who has not properly requested continuous enrollment status in advance, will also be deemed to have withdrawn.</p><p>A student who discontinues class attendance during an academic term from the College or the School of Business without officially applying for continuous enrollment status or withdrawal is assigned failing grades in all current courses, and is deemed to have withdrawn. All university property must be returned to the appropriate offices. Holds may be placed on the record of a student who does not return university property or those who have outstanding financial obligations to the university.</p><p>Withdrawn students do not retain email and registration privileges. Tuition, fees, room rent, and related charges will not be refunded for findings of responsibility within the undergraduate student judicial review process. Return of Title IV funds will be handled in accordance with federal law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probation/Suspension</head><p>Any student who is placed on probation because of honor code or conduct code violations may be placed on such special academic probation as determined by the Committee on Academic Affairs. The Committee on Academic Affairs may at any time suspend or place on probation any student who has given evidence of academic irresponsibility, such as failing to attend class regularly, failing to complete papers, examinations, or other work on time, failure to earn more than six grade points in any semester, or failing to maintain a minimum GPA (see Requirements for Continuation).</p><p>If poor academic performance is attributable to circumstances over which the student clearly had no control (e.g., serious injury or illness), the student may, after consultation with an academic counselor or dean in the Office of Academic Advising, petition the Committee on Academic Affairs for further consideration of his or her status.</p><p>In deciding whether to permit exceptions to the foregoing eligibility requirements, the Committee on Academic Affairs will take into account such factors as convictions for violations of the College honor code or social conduct code, violations of the law, and any other behavior demonstrating disrespect for the rights of others.</p><p>Any student convicted of violating the honor code and, as a result, suspended from the University or assigned the penalty of "activities suspension" is ineligible to represent the University in any way until the period of suspension is completed and the student is returned to good standing. Such students also may not be initiated into any fraternity or sorority during the time of the sanction.</p><p>No student suspended from Wake Forest may take coursework at another institution and have that work transferred to Wake Forest for credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Continuation</head><p>A student's academic eligibility to continue is determined by the number of hours passed and the grade point average. The number of hours passed is the sum of the hours transferred from other institutions and the hours earned in the undergraduate schools of the University. The grade point average is computed only on work attempted in the undergraduate schools of the University and excludes both non-credit and pass/fail courses.</p><p>Students are expected to make reasonable and systematic progress toward the accomplishment of their degree programs. To be eligible to continue in the College, students must maintain:</p><p>For Hours Passed A Minimum Cumulative GPA of fewer than 30 1.60 at least 30, fewer than 60 1.70 at least 60, fewer than 90 1.80 90 and above 1.90</p><p>Students are responsible for knowing their academic standing at all times. Any student whose GPA falls below the required minimum will have a grace period of one semester to raise the average to the required level. Students also have the option of attending summer school at Wake Forest in an effort to raise the average.</p><p>The Committee on Academic Affairs will suspend students who earn six or fewer grade points in any given semester in courses other than CNS 353; military science courses; MUS 111-MUS 129 (ensemble courses); DCE 128; and elective 100-level courses in health and exercise science. In cases where failure was due to circumstances beyond the student's control, he or she may appeal to the Committee for an exception.</p><p>Any student who is in academic difficulty is urged to seek advice and counsel from his or her academic adviser, from the Office of Academic Advising, from the Learning Assistance Center, and from the University Counseling Center.</p><p>A student who has or develops a health problem which, in the judgment of the director of the Student Health Service, creates a danger to the safety and well-being of the student or others may be required to withdraw or convert to continuous enrollment status until the problem is resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resumption of Full-or Part-Time Status</head><p>The Committee on Academic Affairs oversees matters affecting students who have been granted continuous enrollment status. A student who has been granted continuous enrollment status for medical or psychological reasons must submit documentation from his or her physician or therapist to either the director of the Student Health Service or the director of the University Counseling Center attesting to his or her readiness to resume a full academic program. The physician or therapist should also provide professional guidance to these directors as to the nature of the student's ongoing care once a resumption of full-or parttime status has been approved.</p><p>For students whose change to continuous enrollment status is based upon mental health needs, it will be understood that a resumption of full-or part-time status generally can be accomplished only after an appropriate recovery period. In all such instances, the student's resumption of full-or part-time status is contingent upon a statement from appropriate medical authorities that the medical condition has been sufficiently addressed so that normal study can be resumed.</p><p>Any student who has been granted continuous enrollment status and who hopes to receive transfer consideration for work done elsewhere must provide the University with a properly documented statement attesting to his or her good standing at the institution from which the transfer credit would come. (See Transfer Credit rules.) Additionally, an official copy of the student's transcript must be made available to the Office of the University Registrar.</p><p>Should a student, upon interruption of full-or part-time status, fail to comply with procedures for a change to withdrawn or continuous enrollment status, "holds" may be placed upon his or her record that will prevent consideration of readmission or resumption of full-or parttime status. Although a resumption of full-or part-time status can normally be approved (subject to medical or psychological approvals as described here), any request for resumption of full-or part-time status to the University may be denied if a student has violated any laws or regulations or has engaged in conduct or exhibited behaviors that have demonstrated a disregard for the rights of others. Notification forms required for resumption of full-or part-time status and deadlines for submission are posted on the Office of Academic Advising website at http://advising.wfu.edu.</p><p>Deadlines for the receipt of all necessary information are as follows:</p><p>• Fall Resumption -August 1</p><p>• Spring Resumption -December 1</p><p>• Summer Resumption -April 15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission</head><p>The Committee on Academic Affairs oversees the readmission of students who have withdrawn-voluntarily, for medical or psychological reasons, due to academic or judicial suspension, or otherwise. In making a decision on whether to readmit, the Committee considers both the academic and non-academic records of the student. A student who has withdrawn from the University for medical or psychological reasons must submit documentation from his or her physician or therapist to either the director of the Student Health Service or the director of the University Counseling Center attesting to his or her readiness to resume a full academic program. The physician or therapist should also provide professional guidance to these directors as to the nature of the student's ongoing care once readmission has been approved.</p><p>Any student who has withdrawn and who hopes to receive transfer consideration for work done elsewhere must provide the University with a properly documented statement attesting to his or her good standing at the institution from which the transfer credit would come. (See Transfer Credit rules.) Additionally, an official copy of the student's transcript must be made available to the Office of the University Registrar.</p><p>No student on judicial or academic probation or suspension from the University may take coursework at another institution and have that work transferred to the University for credit. Students whose withdrawals from the University were as the result of an honor or judicial conviction must Transfer Credit satisfy fully any sanctions placed upon them prior to being considered for readmission.</p><p>Students who have been ineligible to continue for academic reasons must present to the Committee on Academic Affairs an intentional plan to raise their academic standing to acceptable standards. Should a student, upon withdrawal or granting of continuous enrollment status, fail to comply with proper withdrawal or continuous enrollment procedures, "holds" may be placed upon his or her record that will prevent consideration of readmission or resumption of full-or part-time status until such matters are resolved.</p><p>Any request for readmission to the University may be denied if a student has violated any laws or regulations or has engaged in conduct or exhibited behaviors that have demonstrated a disregard for the rights of others. Readmission forms and deadlines are posted on the Office of Academic Advising website at http://advising.wfu.edu.</p><p>Deadlines for the receipt of all necessary information are as follows:</p><p>Fall Readmission -August 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spring Readmission -December 1</head><p>Summer Readmission -April 15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summer Study</head><p>In addition to regular courses, a number of special summer programs for credit are described in the bulletin of the summer session.</p><p>Courses taken outside the U.S. require, in addition, prior approval from the Center for Global <ref type="bibr">Programs and Studies.</ref> Students must obtain program approval and course approval through the Center for Global Programs and Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and CLEP Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate credit for college level work done in high school is available on the basis of the Advanced Placement Examination of The College Board and International Baccalaureate (IB) subject tests. Students are not allowed to exempt divisional core requirements through the Advanced Placement Examination, the College Level Examination, or the International Baccalaureate subject tests. Although students who successfully complete AP or IB exams earn credit towards the 120 hours needed for graduation, such credit courses do not satisfy the divisional requirements as the student must complete the required divisional courses while enrolled at Wake Forest. Students are permitted to take courses at Wake Forest for which they have received Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credit. Students must contact the Registrar's Office in order to be allowed to do so. When this happens, students lose the AP or IB credit but the notation remains on the transcript. Once such credit has been forfeited it cannot be reinstated.</p><p>Under certain conditions, especially well-prepared applicants may be granted limited college credit through the subject tests of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the Educational Testing Service. Such credit may be assigned with the approval of the department concerned or the dean of business.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit</head><p>All work attempted in other colleges and universities must be reported to the Office of the University Registrar. Students wishing to receive transfer credit for work to be undertaken elsewhere must have a cumulative grade point average of no less than 2.0, must not be on academic probation or suspension of any kind from Wake Forest, and must obtain departmental approval following the prescribed process overseen by the Office of the University Registrar. For entering transfer students, credit may be accepted from accredited colleges and universities, including two-year colleges. For enrolled Wake Forest students and students readmitted to Wake Forest, transfer credit is accepted only from approved fouryear institutions. For transfer hours to be accepted, the grade in any course must be C or better. Courses completed at other colleges or universities with the grade of C-or lower are not awarded transfer hours in Wake Forest. Of the 120 credit hours required for the baccalaureate, the minimum number of credit hours that must be earned in Wake Forest programs depends on whether the transferred courses were taken before or after enrolling at Wake Forest. (Refer to the Requirements for Degrees section of this Bulletin for more details.) Courses being considered for transfer that are not based on semester hour credits will not receive a higher conversion value than the value of the Wake Forest course.</p><p>After a student enrolls at Wake Forest, courses in anthropology, art, biology, chemistry, computer science, English, German, history, mathematics, philosophy, physics, Russian, or sociology cannot transfer in to satisfy divisional requirements.</p><p>Applications for transfer credit from online and distance learning courses are evaluated on an individual basis. No more than 15 credit hours earned through fully online courses may be applied toward graduation; of these, no more than six credit hours may be transferred from another institution. It is the responsibility of the student to disclose to the Office of the University Registrar whether a class is an online or distance learning class. Undergraduate students in the College may not enroll in any online course for credit during their first two semesters at Wake Forest.</p><p>Dual enrollment courses, college level courses taken at institutions other than Wake Forest, are treated as transfer credit if the given course meets the University's standard criteria for transfer credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINANCIAL AID</head><p>By regulation of the Board of Trustees, all financial aid must be approved by the Committee on Scholarships and Student Aid.</p><p>Financial aid programs include institutional, state, and federal scholarship, loan, and work funds. Financial need is a factor in the awarding of most aid. The annual calculation of need, and therefore award amounts, may vary from year to year. Additional information is provided at http://financialaid.wfu.edu/helpful-resources/info-undergradaid-recipients/. IRS Publication 970 describes the possible taxability of scholarship assistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy on Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility Federal Financial Aid</head><p>Evaluation of students' satisfactory academic progress for purposes of federal financial aid eligibility is made at the end of each term <ref type="bibr">(fall, spring, summer)</ref>, to determine eligibility for the following term. Evaluation is also made upon students' readmittance and/or return to active status following a period of continuous enrollment status. The Higher Education Act mandates that institutions of higher education establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress for students receiving federal aid.</p><p>Wake Forest University makes these minimum standards applicable to all aid programs funded by the federal government, and applicable to all coursework taken by a student that is applicable to a bachelor's degree (regardless of the timing of the student's declaration of a major or change in major), all coursework accepted or credited toward a bachelor's degree (transfer hours, Advanced Placement hours, International Baccalaureate hours, College Level Examination Program hours, etc.), and all other coursework (repeated courses, graduate-level coursework, etc.) taken at Wake Forest while enrolled as an undergraduate student. Certain federal aid programs have higher academic and/or other requirements, which are communicated to recipients. The minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress for federal aid also apply to certain state aid programs, including the Need Based Scholarship for North Carolina residents. To maintain academic eligibility for federal aid, a student must:</p><p>Complete the requirements for a bachelor's degree within a maximum number of hours attempted of 180 (including repeated courses, transfer hours, Advanced Placement hours, International Baccalaureate hours, College Level Examination Program hours, etc.). During a semester in which a student drops courses or withdraws or begins continuous enrollment status, the maximum number of hours attempted includes those hours attempted as of the earlier of 1. the withdrawal or continuous enrollment status effective date, or 2. the last day to drop a second part-of-term course without penalty (as published in the academic calendar).</p><p>Pass at least two-thirds of those hours attempted in the undergraduate schools of the University (including repeated courses, transfer hours, pass/fail courses, and hours attempted as a visiting or unclassified student). Incompletes count as hours attempted, unless from a non-credit course.</p><p>Audited classes do not count as hours attempted. During a semester in which a student drops courses or withdraws, hours attempted includes those hours attempted as of the earlier of 1. the withdrawal or continuous enrollment status effective date, or 2. the last day to drop a second part-of-term course without penalty (as published in the academic calendar).</p><p>Maintain the following minimum cumulative Wake Forest University grade point average on all graded hours attempted in the undergraduate schools of the University (including courses with a grade of incomplete):</p><p>For Hours Attempted of A Minimum Cumulative GPA of fewer than 30 1.60 at least 30, fewer than 60 1.70 at least 60, fewer than 90 1.80 90 and above 1.90</p><p>The Wake Forest University grade point average calculation excludes pass/fail courses. In cases where a student repeats a course for which he or she received a grade of C-or lower, the cumulative grade point average is calculated by considering the course as attempted only once, with the grade points assigned reflecting the highest grade received. However, this provision does not apply to any course for which the student has received the grade of an irreplaceable F. During a semester in which a student drops courses or withdraws, all hours attempted in the undergraduate schools of the University includes those hours attempted as of the earlier of 1. the withdrawal or continuous enrollment effective date, or 2. the last day to drop a second part-of-term course without penalty (as published in the academic calendar).</p><p>To maintain academic eligibility for federal student aid, a student must also must avoid academic suspension by the Committee on Academic Affairs, by earning more than six grade points in any given semester as described in the "Requirements for Continuation" section of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</p><p>The policy on satisfactory academic progress applies only to the general eligibility for aid consideration. There are other federally-mandated requirements a student must meet to receive federal aid. For instance, certain federal loan programs also require either the passage of a period of time or the advancing of a grade level between annual maximum borrowing, regardless of general eligibility for aid. Other general student eligibility requirements for a student to receive federal financial aid are listed at www.ed.gov (http://www.ed.gov).</p><p>A student not meeting the minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress for purposes of federal financial aid eligibility when evaluation is done at the end of each term <ref type="bibr">(fall, spring, summer)</ref>, is placed in financial aid warning status for the following term of enrollment. The financial aid warning status lasts for one term of enrollment, during which the student may continue to receive federal student aid funds. A student still not meeting the minimum standards after a term in financial aid warning status loses eligibility for the next term of enrollment, unless the student successfully appeals and is placed on financial aid probation, which may include the approval of an academic plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Institutional Financial Aid</head><p>Any enrolled student who is meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards for federal financial aid eligibility also meets the satisfactory academic progress standard for institutionally-controlled need-based Financial Aid aid. Students pursuing a first bachelor's degree in the undergraduate schools of the University are considered for institutionally-controlled aid programs. Evaluation of students' satisfactory academic progress for purposes of institutionally-controlled financial aid eligibility is made at the end of each term <ref type="bibr">(fall, spring, summer)</ref>, to determine eligibility for the following term. Evaluation is also made upon students' readmittance and/or return to active status following a period of continuous enrollment status. Certain institutional aid programs (including some meritbased and talent-based scholarships) have higher academic and/or other requirements that are communicated to recipients. If a student demonstrates financial need as determined by Wake Forest, as the result of losing eligibility for a merit/talent-based scholarship, (s)he then receives need-based aid programs under the same policies as other students not receiving merit/talent-based scholarships. The receipt of athletic aid is governed by NCAA rules. Institutional aid generally is not available for summer sessions.</p><p>Wake Forest University makes these minimum standards applicable to all institutionally-controlled aid programs except for certain institutional aid programs (including some merit-based and talent-based scholarships) that have higher academic and/or other requirements that are communicated to recipients; and applicable to all coursework taken by a student that is applicable to a bachelor's degree (regardless of the timing of the student's declaration of a major or change in major), all coursework accepted or credited toward a bachelor's degree (transfer hours, Advanced Placement hours, International Baccalaureate hours, College Level Examination Program hours, etc.), and all other coursework (repeated courses, graduate-level coursework, etc.) taken at Wake Forest while enrolled as an undergraduate student. To maintain academic eligibility for institutionally-controlled aid, a student must:</p><p>Complete the requirements for a bachelor's degree within a maximum number of hours attempted of 180 (including repeated courses, transfer hours, Advanced Placement hours, International Baccalaureate hours, College Level Examination Program hours, etc.). During a semester in which a student drops courses or withdraws or begins continuous enrollment status, the maximum number of hours attempted includes those hours attempted as of the earlier of 1. the withdrawal or continuous enrollment status effective date, or 2. the last day to drop a second part-of-term course without penalty (as published in the academic calendar).</p><p>Pass at least two-thirds of those hours attempted in the undergraduate schools of the University (including repeated courses, transfer hours, pass/fail courses, and hours attempted as a visiting or unclassified student).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal Procedure</head><p>Denial of aid under the policies for institutional and federal aid may be appealed in writing to the Committee on Scholarships and Student Aid and mailed to: P.O. Box 7246 <ref type="bibr">Winston-Salem, NC 27109-7246</ref> or delivered to the Office of Student Financial Aid, Reynolda Hall Room 4. A student's request must include information regarding why the student failed to maintain satisfactory academic progress, and what factors have changed that would allow him/her to demonstrate satisfactory academic progress at the next evaluation.</p><p>The Committee may grant a probationary reinstatement to any student, upon demonstration of extenuating circumstances documented in writing to the satisfaction of the Committee. Examples of extenuating circumstances and appropriate documentation include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: injury or illness of the student or immediate family members-statement from physician that injury or illness interfered with opportunity for satisfactory progress; death in family-statement of student or minister; temporary or permanent disability-statement from physician. During a probationary period, students may continue to receive aid. Reinstatement after probation can be made only after the student has received credit for the appropriate percentage of work attempted with the required cumulative grade point average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scholarships</head><p>Scholarships and loans are awarded from funds provided by generous gifts to the University from individuals and organizations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Aid Programs</head><p>Student employment is possible for part-time, on-campus and off-campus work, for a recommended maximum of 20 hours per week for fulltime students. Summer employment may also be available. Interested students should contact the student financial aid office. Federal funding assists Wake Forest in its job location and development activities for students.</p><p>Veterans' education benefits are administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the Federal Building at 251 North Main Street in Winston-Salem. Records of progress are kept by Wake Forest University on veteran and non-veteran students alike. Progress records are furnished to the students, veterans, and non-veterans alike, at the end of each scheduled school term. Additional information is provided at http:// financialaid.wfu.edu/helpful-resources/veterans/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outside Assistance</head><p>Wake Forest encourages students to apply for outside assistance for which they may be eligible. Students must advise the financial aid office if they receive any assistance from outside organizations, including any local, state, and national scholarship and loan programs. Outside scholarships count as student resources, becoming part of the package of financial aid. When need calculated under the federal methodology (FM need) is greater than the offered aid package, outside scholarships are allowed to meet that difference. Once the offered aid package equals FM need, any portion of outside scholarship exceeding FM need results in a reduction of need-based student loans and work-study funds. In no case may aid exceed the estimated cost of attendance.</p><p>Outside scholarship donors should include on the check the recipient's name and the term(s) for which the scholarship is intended. Checks should be payable to Wake Forest University (or co-payable to Wake Forest University and the student) and sent to:</p><p>Office of Student Financial Aid P.O. Box 7246 <ref type="bibr">Winston-Salem, NC 27109-7246</ref> Checks delivered by donors to the student should be forwarded to the aid office. By submitting, or allowing donors to submit, checks to Wake Forest, a student gives permission for Wake Forest to write the Wake Forest University student identification number on the face of the check.</p><p>If funds are not received by Wake Forest in a timely manner from an outside scholarship donor, the student becomes responsible for payment of charges previously deferred by the anticipated receipt of funds from the donor.</p></div>

The Committee on Open Curriculum selects a limited number of students based on their previous record of achievement, high aspirations, ability in one or more areas of study, strength of self-expression, and other special talents. The course of study for the core requirements is designed by the student and his or her Open Curriculum adviser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study at Salem College</head><p>For full-time students in the fall and spring semesters, Wake Forest and Salem College share a program of exchange credits for courses taken at one institution because they are not offered in the curriculum of the other. An application for the Salem/Wake Forest Exchange Credit program must be approved by the academic adviser and the Office of Academic Advising or the dean of the School of Business. Please visit the Office of Academic Advising to begin the application process. Except in courses of private instruction, there is no additional cost to the student. Grades and grade points earned at Salem College under the Exchange Credit program are evaluated as if they were earned at Wake Forest.</p><p>Courses that are in the Wake Forest curriculum generally cannot be taken at Salem through this program. In very unusual circumstances, a student may wish to seek assistance in appealing to the Committee on Academic Affairs.</p></div>

Students who entered under the bulletins of previous years may make use of new alternative basic and divisional courses announced in this bulletin while still following their original contract for the required totals thereof. Except for HES 100 and HES 101, only courses of 3 or more semester hours count towards satisfying basic and divisional requirements.</p><p>All students must complete:</p><p>1. the core requirements (unless accepted for the Open Curriculum),</p><p>2. a course of study approved by the department or departments of the major, and 3. elective courses, for a total of 120 hours.</p><p>In general, no more than 12 hours toward graduation may be earned from among all of the following courses: MUS 111-MUS 121 and MUS 128-MUS 129 (ensemble courses); DCE 128; and elective 100-level courses in health and exercise science. However, majors in music in liberal arts and music performance may count up to 16 hours in these courses toward graduation. A cross-listed course may be taken one time for hours toward graduation, unless otherwise specified by the course description, and no more than three hours in LIB courses may count toward graduation.</p><p>All students must earn a minimum cumulative 2.0 grade point average in Wake Forest College and the School of Business. Once enrolled at Wake Forest, a student may subsequently count, at most, 30 hours of credit from sources other than Wake Forest programs toward the graduation requirement of 120 hours. Students who transfer into Wake Forest must subsequently earn at least 60 hours in Wake Forest programs. Except for combined degree curricula, the work of the senior year must consist of courses in Wake Forest programs. Any exceptions must be approved by the Committee on Academic Affairs. No more than 15 credit hours earned through fully online courses may be applied towards graduation; of these no more than 6 credit hours may be transferred from another institution.</p><p>Transfer credits will not be used in calculating a student's GPA. This includes affiliate study abroad programs (approved non-Wake Forest programs). However, work from other institutions accepted in transfer, along with the grade(s) earned, will be recorded on the transcript. Graduation distinctions will be based solely on the Wake Forest GPA.</p><p>A student graduates under the requirements of the bulletin of the year in which he or she enters. However, when a student declares a major or a minor, the requirements for the major or minor that are in effect at the time of declaration will apply. Such requirements might not be congruent with those stated in a given bulletin. Newly admitted majors to the School of Business, will be assigned a catalog year that will reflect their first full academic year as a major in the School. If coursework is not completed within 6 years of entrance, the student must fulfill the requirements for the class in which he or she graduates.</p><p>The University issues degrees in August, December, and May. All requirements must be completed and certified before a student will be issued a degree and/or can participate in the commencement exercises. However, students may petition for permission to participate in the commencement exercises if all three of the following conditions are met:</p><p>1. The student will have completed at least 112 hours by the end of the spring semester preceding commencement.</p><p>2. The student will have a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA and a minimum 2.0 GPA in the major(s).</p><p>3. The student has no outstanding judicial sanctions (unpaid fines, owed community service hours, etc.).</p><p>Commencement is a celebration of graduation, but not required for graduation. Participation in commencement is at the discretion of the appropriate Dean. The University reserves the right to refuse participation in commencement in certain circumstances (e.g., unfulfilled sanctions for judicial or honor violations).</p><p>No further entries or alterations may be made toward the undergraduate degree once a student has been graduated.</p><p>To become a degree candidate, a student must submit an online application for graduation that will prompt a review of the student's academic record to assure that all degree requirements have been met. The application for graduation is available online in WIN. Students who are not enrolled in the term prior to their desired graduation date must contact the Office of the University Registrar before the application deadline. The application deadlines for each graduation date are as follows:</p><p>• </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Requirements (Basic and Divisional combined)</head><p>The core requirements are intended to introduce the student to various fields of knowledge and to lay the foundation for concentration in a major subject and related fields during the junior and senior years. For these reasons, as many of the requirements as feasible should be taken in the first two years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Requirements</head><p>All students must complete five required basic courses (unless exempted through procedures established by the departments concerned): </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign Language Placements</head><p>All students new to Wake Forest who have studied a foreign language in high school must complete a foreign language placement test in the language(s) studied. Students will not receive credit for a class at a lower level than the level of their placement on the placement exam, unless they:</p><p>1. register for the class in which they placed;</p><p>2. attend a few class meetings;</p><p>3. consult with their professor; and 4. successfully appeal their placement to the language placement appeals officers of the department and be reassigned to a lower level course.</p><p>Students may satisfy the requirement with a foreign language they have not previously studied, and may start at the beginning level (111 or 101, depending on the language) offered at Wake Forest.</p><p>Students whose primary language (the language of instruction in the student's prior schooling) is other than English are exempt from the basic requirement in foreign language.</p><p>Students whose schooling has been in English but who are fluent in a language not taught at Wake Forest must present the equivalent of a 200level college course or proficiency in reading and writing in the second language to be exempt from the requirement. Such students should contact the Office of the Dean of the College. Each case will be referred to a person qualified to make the appropriate determination. If the second language is taught at Wake Forest, the relevant department decides whether the student may complete the requirement in that language or may be regarded as having fulfilled the requirement already. Elective courses in the language or literature of a student's heritage or country of origin are at the discretion of the department offering the course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Divisional Requirements</head><p>All students must complete courses in each of the five divisions of the undergraduate curriculum (unless exempted through procedures established by the departments concerned or by participation in the Open Curriculum). Together with the basic requirements these courses form the core of Wake Forest's undergraduate liberal arts education. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Division</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Restrictions</head><p>• In divisions requiring more than one course, students may not choose two courses from within the same department.</p><p>• One course cannot satisfy the requirements of two divisions. A crosslisted course satisfies a requirement in one division only.</p><p>• Language courses at the 200-level do not fulfill the Division II literature requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements</head><p>To prepare students for the demands of technology and globalization, Wake Forest guides undergraduate course selections with two further requirements:</p><p>Cultural Diversity Requirement. All students must complete at least one course that educates them regarding cultural diversity. This course may be taken at the basic, divisional, or major/minor level, or as an elective.</p><p>Courses qualified to meet this requirement are designated (CD) after their descriptions in this bulletin.</p><p>Quantitative Reasoning Requirement. All students must complete at least one course that requires quantitative reasoning, either as a qualifying course in Division V, as an elective, or as a major or minor course requirement. All courses meeting the requirement are designated (QR) after their descriptions in this bulletin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirement in Health and Exercise Science</head><p>Students must complete HES 100 and HES 101 before beginning additional health and exercise science elective courses, and in any case, before the end of the second year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Majors and Minors</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Declaring a Major</head><p>Students may declare a major after completing 40 hours. Most students declare a major in the spring of their sophomore year. Students declare a major through a procedure established between the academic departments and the Office of the University Registrar. Information about this process is distributed prior to the designated declaration period.</p><p>If the student is accepted into the major, the department provides an adviser who assists the student in planning a course of study for the junior and senior years. A department that rejects a student as a major must notify the Office of the University Registrar and file a written statement indicating the reason(s) for the rejection with the Dean of the College.</p><p>Students who need to delay the declaration due to insufficient earned hours or other circumstances should consult the Office of the University Registrar.</p><p>A student wishing to major in accountancy, business and enterprise management, finance, mathematical business, or the master of science in accountancy should apply to the School of Business. (See the School of Business requirements in this Bulletin.)</p><p>The undergraduate schools try to provide ample space in the various major fields to accommodate the interests of students. It must be understood, however, that the undergraduate schools cannot guarantee the availability of space in a given major field or a given course, since the preferences of students change and there are limits to both faculty and facilities.</p><p>After the initial declaration, a student may not change from one major to another without the written approval of the departments concerned. The student's course of study for the junior and senior years includes the minimum requirements for the departmental major, with other courses selected by the student and approved by the adviser. At least half of the major must be completed at Wake Forest University.</p><p>Please Note. For credit in the major, courses taken in many programs of study abroad are not automatically equivalent to courses completed at Wake Forest. If a student wishes to take more than half of his or her courses for the major in study abroad programs, he or she must gain prior approval from the chair of the department. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximum Number of Courses in a Department</head><p>Within the College, a maximum of 50 hours in a major is allowed within the 120 hours required for graduation. All courses taken within a major or minor department count toward the major or minor GPA. For a student majoring in a department with two or more majors, 6 additional hours in the department but outside the student's major are also allowed.</p><p>These stipulations exclude required related courses from other departments. For students majoring in English, WRI 111 is excluded. For students majoring in a foreign language, elementary courses in that language are also excluded. These limits may be exceeded in unusual circumstances only by action of the Committee on Academic Affairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Options for Meeting Major Requirements</head><p>To satisfy graduation requirements, a student must select one, and only one, of the following options, which will receive official recognition on the student's permanent record: In order to qualify for options four or six, students must offer a minimum of 135 hours for graduation.</p><p>In addition to these options, a student may complete the requirements of one or more foreign area studies programs and/or any of the Romance languages certificates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Double Majors</head><p>A student may major in two departments in the College with the written permission of the chair of each of the departments and on condition that the student meets all requirements for the major in both departments. A student may not use the same course to meet requirements in both of the majors. The student must designate one of the two fields as the primary major, which appears first on the student's record and determines the degree to be awarded. Only one undergraduate degree will be awarded, even if the student completes two majors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minors</head><p>A minor is not required. Students may declare a minor only after declaring at least one major. According to the guidelines listed under Options for Meeting Major Requirements, students choosing either a single or a double major may also choose one or more minors from among the following or from the listing of interdisciplinary minors: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary Major</head><p>Highly qualified students may design an interdisciplinary major, focused on a topic not available as a regular major. The interdisciplinary major consists of courses offered by two or more departments, for a minimum of 42 hours. Students submit a proposal outlining the nature of the major, a list of courses to be included, evidence of a comparable major at another university, if available, and letters from at least two relevant faculty members supporting the proposal, one of whom must agree to be the student's primary adviser. The interdisciplinary major may be declared after the student completes 40 hours, however planning for the major should begin as early as possible. A second major may not be declared. A minor may be declared; however, courses used in the interdisciplinary major may not also meet requirements in the minor. Students are required to complete an independent senior project, approved and reviewed by the adviser and readers from participating departments. Proposals are reviewed by the Open Curriculum Committee. Visit the interdisciplinary major website for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary Minors</head><p>Interdisciplinary minors are listed alphabetically under Courses of Instruction in this bulletin. The following programs are offered: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign Area Studies</head><p>The foreign area studies programs enable students to choose an interdisciplinary concentration in the language and culture of a foreign area. An area studies concentration may include courses in the major and also in the minor field, if a minor is chosen. Foreign area studies programs do not replace majors or minors; they may supplement either or both. A faculty adviser coordinates each foreign area studies program and advises students. Students who wish to participate in one of these programs must consult with the program coordinator, preferably in their sophomore year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Italian Studies and Spanish</head><p>Studies are offered as foreign area studies programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Testing</head><p>All seniors may be required to participate in a testing program designed to provide objective evidence of educational development.</p><p>If the Committee on Academic Affairs decides to conduct such a program, its purpose would be to assist the University in assessing the effectiveness of its programs. The program does not supplant the regular administration of the Graduate Record Examination for students applying for admission to graduate school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degrees in Engineering</head><p>The College cooperates with engineering schools in offering a broad course of study in the arts and sciences combined with specialized training in engineering. A program for outstanding students covers five years of study, including three years in the College and approximately two years in one of the schools of engineering accredited by ABET Inc., the engineering organization responsible for accrediting engineering degree programs in the United States. (Depending upon the field chosen, it may be advisable for a student to attend the summer session in the engineering school after transfer.) Admission to Wake Forest does not guarantee admission to the engineering school. Those decisions are based on the student's transcript, performance, and status at the time of application. For most programs, upon successful completion of the five years of study, the student receives the bachelor of science degree in engineering from the University and the bachelor of science degree in a specialized engineering field from the engineering school. For Wake Forest's 3-2 program with Vanderbilt University, the bachelor of science degree from Wake Forest is awarded upon successful completion of the first year of study at Vanderbilt.</p><p>The curriculum for the first three years must include all the core requirements and additional courses in science and mathematics which will prepare the student for the study of engineering, such as: </p></div>

ACE courses align with the Carnegie Foundation's classification of community engagement as "the collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity." ACE courses are approved by the ACE Advisory Council based on criteria that include, but are not limited to: reciprocity with community partners; demonstration of relevant and meaningful community engagement; clear articulation of intended student learning outcomes and community goals; methods of assessment of student outcomes and of community outcomes; and evidence of integration of academic and engagement goals. Faculty teaching ACE courses employ a variety of methods to engage the community.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemistry (CHM)</head><p>The department offers programs leading to the BA and BS degrees in chemistry. The BS degrees are certified by the American Chemical Society. A minimum GPA of 2.0 in the first two years of chemistry is required of students who elect to major in the department. Admission to any class is contingent upon satisfactory grades in prerequisite courses, and registration for advanced courses must be approved by the department. Candidates for either the BA or BS degree with a major in chemistry must have a minimum GPA of 2.0 in their chemistry courses numbered 200 or above. Unless otherwise stated, all chemistry courses are open to chemistry majors and minors on a letter-grade basis only (even those courses not required for the major or minor). Majors are required to complete on a letter-grade basis the required physics, biology, and mathematics courses. The BS programs are designed for those students who plan a career in chemistry at the bachelor or advanced degree level. The BA program is designed for those students who do not plan to do graduate work in the physical sciences but desire a stronger background in chemistry than is provided by the chemistry minor program.</p><p>The department will accept transfer courses completed at four-year colleges and universities but will not award transfer credit towards the chemistry major and minor except from schools offering a major in chemistry. These courses must be equivalent in content and level to courses offered at Wake Forest (as judged by the department). Transfer credit will not be awarded for online lab classes nor for online lecture courses that have co-requisite labs on our campus. Courses taken in summer school elsewhere, or in study abroad programs, must meet these same criteria and receive pre-approval. Advanced courses, 300level and above, are typically not transferable. Students enrolled at Wake Forest may not take courses in chemistry at other institutions to satisfy divisional requirements.</p><p>The Health Professions Program at Wake Forest recommends that students take the following chemistry courses and their associated labs before the end of the third year: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>German and Russian (GER/RUS)</head><p>The Department's aim is to guide students to proficiency in the traditional four skills of language acquisition (speaking, aural comprehension, reading and writing), and to introduce them to the broad arena of culture, including literature, arts, history, and politics. Our strong proficiency based methods of teaching in tandem with the exceptional opportunities for study abroad enable our students to achieve a higher than average level of sophistication in all of these areas.</p><p>An integral part of the mission of this department is to encourage as many majors, minors, and other interested students as possible to study abroad. We believe that study abroad in concert with their on-campus exposure to German and Russian studies assists them in thinking more objectively about American culture and language from a distanced perspective and consequently enables them to examine their own attitudes and beliefs more objectively.</p><p>In addition, the university's goal of preparing its students for their professional life is certainly enhanced by familiarity with, and close scrutiny of, foreign cultures, attitudes, languages, and economies in light of contemporary emphasis on global understanding and interaction.</p></div>

The minor, therefore, is trans-regional/national and thereby links disparate fields of study that are usually examined separately. Jews and Judaism are studied within the broader context of world civilizations and the spectrum of the arts, humanities, and social sciences. In this regard, the minor complements already existing areas of interest in a number of majors and disciplines, (such as American Ethnic Studies, History, International Studies, Medieval Studies, Politics and International Affairs, and Religious Studies).</p><p>The interdisciplinary approach of the minor exposes students to a wide range of disciplines and, like other established interdisciplinary minors, gives students the opportunity for synthesizing and critically reflecting on their course of study. The Jewish Studies minor provides interested students a grounding for graduate study in the humanities, religion, and social sciences.</p><p>Additional elective courses may have been approved since publication of this bulletin.

The minor was established in 1993 by faculty from the departments of Anthropology, Classics, Communication, Education, English, French Studies, German-Russian, Humanities, and Spanish and Italian. The minor is currently directed by Professor Jerid Francom who is assisted by a core group of faculty members drawn from various departments across campus.</p><p>By nature and approach, linguistics is integrated tightly with the core mission of the University. Linguistics encourages students to analyze data and to "ask why, " to evaluate evidence of various kinds that bears on issues of language acquisition and use, and to see multiple perspectives on problems and evaluate them critically. It is inherently interdisciplinary and stimulates an interconnected perspective, drawing on social sciences, liberal arts, and even physical sciences, as in phonetics (acoustics) and psycholinguistics (neuroscience, imaging techniques); and it is oriented towards the many cultural heritages of the world. It investigates language in all its forms (oral, written, signed) as a distinctive and universal trait of what makes us human -arguably, the field that is most "Pro-Humanitate" of all. And it emphasizes both the diversity of an estimated 6,000 languages and their common core in human cognition and sociocultural functions.</p></div>

The program integrates practices of thinking across periods, cultures, territories, and disciplines, even as Medieval Studies at Wake Forest continues to emphasize the importance of intensive training in disciplinary knowledge and practice. One of the greatest values of our program is that it is one of the central places at Wake Forest University where students experience interdisciplinarity. In fact, this program has been an inspiration to and model for other developing programs.Among areas of study in the humanities, medieval and early modern cultures are perhaps most naturally cross-disciplinary.</p><p>What we think of as modern culture and modern institutions were founded in the Middle Ages. The study of the Middle Ages offers us the opportunity to examine the formation of western civilization and literature in the aftermath of the fall of Rome. Early Modern studies enables us to trace the transformation of late medieval society and culture into an entirely new epoch, the Renaissance, which was an extremely innovative period that reconfigured all the disciplines and set the stage for developments in modern science, politics, economics, social organization, and the arts.. This program brings medieval and early modern studies into an ever more complex, inter-dependent, and internationalized twenty-first century, emphasizing the interrelationship of culture, ideas, technologies, religions, and movements across periods of time and geography.</p></div>

Neuroscientists study how we learn, process and remember information from the molecular to the philosophical level, and examine subjects ranging from the molecular pharmacology of brain function to the mind-body problem. Note that many of these courses have prerequisites, in some cases including introductory biology, psychology, or chemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Philosophy (PHI)</head><p>Philosophy examines such topics as consciousness, knowledge, justice, free will, good and evil, and the nature of religious experience and belief. Engagement with the central questions of philosophy is valuable in itself; it is also valuable as a means of developing analytical, critical, and imaginative skills useful in the study of most other subjects, in the pursuit of careers as varied as law, business, medicine, science, education, and the arts, and in effective participation in civic life. A liberal arts education should introduce students to rigorous thinking and writing about philosophical issues and to the reading of great philosophical texts. We help to realize this goal through the courses we offer, through one-on-one discussion with students, and by presenting lectures, colloquia, and debates open to the University and the public.</p><p>Any 3-hour philosophy course numbered PHI 220 or lower counts towards satisfying the Division I requirement. Courses taken elsewhere after a student has enrolled at Wake Forest University will not count towards satisfying the Division I requirement in philosophy.

If this sequence is followed, the physics major may be completed with considerable flexibility in exercising various options, such as the five-year BS/MS program. If physics is not taken in the first year, the degree requirements in physics may still be completed by the end of the senior year if a beginning course is taken in the sophomore year. A candidate for the 3-2 engineering program would also complete three years of the bachelor of science physics major program prior to transfer. (Consult the chair of the department for additional information on these five-year programs.)</p><p>No student may be a candidate for a degree with a major in physics with a grade less than C in General Physics without special permission of the department.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychology (PSY)</head><p>The psychology department's goal is to provide majors with broad exposure to basic areas of psychology, along with an in-depth understanding of the methods by which psychological research is conducted. Regardless of whether your ultimate career goal is to become an applied psychologist (e.g., clinical psychologist, counselor, social worker, or consultant), to conduct behavioral research, to become a college professor, or to enter another profession altogether (e.g., law, business, medicine), a psychology major can be useful. This is because it provides in-depth knowledge about human thought, emotion, and behavior, which is • relevant to any career; and</p><p>• through learning how psychologists research human thought, emotion, and behavior,</p><p>• students develop intellectual skills that allow them to generate and evaluate knowledge in many areas, including but not limited to psychology.</p><p>Thus, the Wake Forest psychology department aims to provide a rigorous and stimulating undergraduate education in both content and methods of psychology. Our department, like most undergraduate liberal arts departments, emphasizes research over applied work and research is a central component of many courses. A research emphasis in an undergraduate program provides the best preparation for applied graduate work as well as a strong foundation for a wide array of jobs.</p><p>PSY 151 is a prerequisite to all courses of a higher number. Courses numbered below 151 do not count toward Division IV requirements or toward the major in psychology. PSY 310, PSY 311, PSY 312, or special permission of the instructor is prerequisite for some 300-level courses. See individual course descriptions for specific information. A minimum GPA of 2.0 or higher in psychology courses is required to graduate with a major or minor in psychology.</p></div>

It involves the study of both specific religious traditions and the general nature of religion as a phenomenon of human life. Using cross-cultural and interdisciplinary approaches, religious studies investigates and interprets systems of religious belief, the history of religious traditions, the function of religion in society, and forms of religious expression such as ritual, symbols, sacred narrative, scripture, practices, theological and philosophical reflection. Students of religious studies, whether adherents of a religion or of no religion, gain tools to understand, compare, and engage the phenomenon of religion and its role in human life and culture. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociology (SOC)</head><p>The Department of Sociology at Wake Forest University is a thriving community of teacher-scholars and students devoted to the scientific study and improvement of society. We provide students with an understanding of how communities have dynamic properties that exist independently of, and that structure the beliefs and actions of, any particular individuals. The basic idea behind this perspective is that the larger social context in which we live influences our social institutions, the social groups of which we are apart, our educational and occupational opportunities as well as our most private and personal experiences. Studying sociology is a critical part of a liberal arts education that prepares students for careers in law, medicine, education, public health, social work, business, criminal justice, non-profit organizations, and many other fields.</p><p>Our faculty conduct research and teach courses on a range of compelling topics, including the sociology of business, criminal justice, culture, education, emotions, family, gender, health, immigration, law, politics, race and ethnicity, religion, sport, and work. Our courses offer students the opportunity to examine the complex causes and consequences of stratification by socioeconomic status, gender, race, and sexual orientation. Students can earn certification for concentrations in three areas: crime and criminal justice; business and society; the social determinants of health and well-being.</p><p>Study abroad and transfer credit that can be applied to the sociology major/minor are limited to two courses (6h). For both study abroad and transfer credit, there is a bias against approval of theory, methods, and statistics courses, but these courses will be evaluated on a case-bycase basis. Where students take sociology courses abroad, they must be in Wake Forest approved programs and/or must have been certified by the department. Courses to be considered for transfer credit must be taught at an accredited college/university that offers a 4-year degree, by a faculty member who has a PhD in sociology, and the syllabus for the course must be provided for inspection. In addition, no divisional credit is given for sociology courses taken abroad or at other institutions. The sociology courses of students who are transferring to Wake Forest from other institutions will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>A student who selects sociology to fulfill the Division IV requirement must take one of the following courses: No introductory-level course is required for students taking a sociology course as an elective unless specified in the course description.</p></div>

We aspire to create exceptional artist/scholars, exploring through classes and productions intersections of theatre and dance with other realms of study, and giving expression to humanity's foremost social and intellectual concerns. We promote inclusivity, intellectual curiosity, innovation, dialogue, and problem-solving skills. And we believe that artistic commitment, personal development, responsibility to one's community, and academic rigor can all coexist.</p><p>Each season, the department mounts four subscription series productions, two dance concerts, and numerous student-directed and designed pieces. Students learn through work on productions-whether in the rehearsal hall or shop-as well as through classwork in acting and directing, dance technique, choreography, design, playwriting, voice and movement, history, dramatic literature, performance art, theatre education, and technical theatre.</p><p>Students with both academic and artistic ability will find a comfortable home at Wake Forest University.

Accordingly, the mission and values of the School's accountancy program are as follows:</p><p>The mission of the Wake Forest accountancy program is to enhance business, society, and the accountancy profession through our teaching and scholarship. We value: an environment that promotes thoughtful reflection and a high level of face-to-face interaction; intellectual curiosity, including a passion for the study of business; teaching excellence; challenging academic standards consistent with high-quality students; the creation and dissemination of knowledge; honor, integrity, and respect for the ethical and legal foundations of the accountancy profession; and strong relationships with alumni, recruiters, and other members of the accountancy profession.</p><p>The accountancy program includes both the baccalaureate and master's programs. Students who major in either accountancy or finance (FIN-M) at the baccalaureate level may apply for admission to the MSA program during their junior year (see MSA Program Admissions). During the third and fourth years, students admitted to the program take the business and enterprise management, accounting, and finance courses required for a major in accountancy or finance. The curriculum also provides students with the opportunity to do a professional internship during the fourth year. The coursework, combined with the professional internship, provides students with a solid foundation in the concepts, principles, and practices of accountancy and business. Students need this foundation for success in the MSA program and the early years of their careers.</p><p>The curriculum for the fifth year of study adds both depth and breadth to students' undergraduate foundation in accountancy or finance and prepares them for a wide variety of careers in accountancy and financial services (for example, assurance, taxation, business advisory services, transaction services, forensic accounting, investment and commercial banking). The MSA program qualifies students to take the CPA examination in North Carolina and many other jurisdictions.

(2 h)for Environmental Science Minor</head><label></label><figDesc>Interdisciplinary MinorThe Wake Forest environmental program offers an environmental science or an environmental studies minor. The environmental program provides an interdisciplinary approach to the study of human-environment interaction. The program seeks to identify and apply perspectives from biology, chemistry, physics, geography, government, economics, history, humanities, law, ethics, and anthropology to the human impact on the natural environment. The environmental science or the environmental studies minor, coupled with a liberal arts major, is designed to prepare students for careers in the environmental sciences, law, public health, public policy, and public administration, and to develop attitudes and values consistent with a sustainable environmental future. Sustainability Ambassadors are student peer educators for sustainability. The mission of the Sustainability Ambassadors program is to support the development of sustainable behaviors among the student population at Wake Forest University. Through outreach activities, campaign development, event planning, sustainability assessments, and presentations, Sustainability Ambassadors are able to reach Wake students in a variety of settings. They help fulfill the Office's mission of empowering others to assume leadership roles in sustainability. Oceans, weather, climate, earthquakes, volcanoes, soil, and space all play important roles in our dynamic planet. Students will explore the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, and gain a deeper understanding of how the Earth operates as a whole.
