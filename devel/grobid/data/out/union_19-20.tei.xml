<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>local population. Union's founders were determined to avoid the narrow sectarianism characteristic of earlier American colleges; today, Union is one of the oldest nondenominational colleges in the country. The admissions committee attempts to broaden geographic and socioeconomic distribution of the student body by giving preference to students who live or attend schools in regions not well represented in the College and to students who will broaden the range of backgrounds and lifestyles within the College community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further Information</head><p>The candidate's potential contribution to the Union community is also taken into consideration. Union is a close-knit community and, as such, depends heavily upon the constructive participation of each individual in the life of the College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application and Admission Procedures</head><p>Applications should be filed by January 15 of the final year in secondary school, with the exception of applications to the Leadership in Medicine program which are due by November 15. The Admissions Committee generally announces its decisions at the end of March and no later than April 15. There is a $60 application fee.</p><p>Admitted candidates must reserve places by paying the $500 admissions deposit on or before May 1. The admitted applicant then becomes a degree candidate entitled to a place in the class with all the rights and privileges of a Union student. Reservations submitted without the deposit are considered incomplete. If the degree candidate withdraws for any reason or is removed from candidacy for the degree before successfully completing three terms at Union, the admissions deposit is retained by the College in consideration of the degree candidate's placement in the class. After the student successfully completes three terms, if all obligations of the student to the College, financial and otherwise, are satisfied, the deposit may be refunded upon withdrawal (within the specified guidelines), removal, or graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Admissions:</head><p>The Admissions Committee will carefully consider applications from candidates whose preparation is unusual and who, for good reason, do not meet the norms as stated below. Normally, a minimum of 16 units (courses) of secondary school preparation are required for admission. These should include certain fundamentals such as English, mathematics, science, social studies, and a world language. The following units are recommended:</p><p>For Liberal Arts: Students should have four years of English, at least two years of a world language, and a minimum of two and one-half years of college preparatory mathematics. Students planning to major in chemistry, physics, and mathematics should have at least three and one-half years of mathematics.</p><p>For Engineering: Students planning to complete the engineering curriculum should have elementary and intermediate algebra, geometry, trigonometry, chemistry, physics, and four years of English. Although more advanced mathematics work is not required, it will prove helpful.</p><p>Early Decision: A significant number of Union's applicants request early decision. The College recommends this program to all candidates who have decided that Union is their first choice college. A candidate who wishes to be considered for early decision must check the appropriate space on the application for admission. Early decision candidates are favored in evaluation. An early decision application carries with it the commitment that the candidate will enroll if admitted. Regular applications to other colleges may be filed, with the understanding that these will be withdrawn if the candidate is accepted to Union.</p><p>Applications and requests for early decision must be received by the College by November 15 for Option I or January 15 for Option II. All other forms and credentials, including the Early Decision Agreement, must also be received by November 15 or January 15, respectively. Early Decision candidates will be notified of the decision by December 15 for Option I and by February 7 for Option II. Candidates not offered admission under the Early Decision Program may either be deferred to the regular applicant group and reconsidered or may be denied admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Admission:</head><p>In recent years, a number of high school students have expressed an interest in accelerated completion of high school requirements and early admission to the College. The admissions committee will consider candidates for early admission providing that, on the basis of high school achievement, they have demonstrated the potential to do college-level work. Interviews are required of candidates requesting early admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Students</head><p>In addition to the application requirements described above, applicants who are citizens of other countries must be proficient in reading, listening, writing, and speaking English as English is the language of instruction at Union. The Admissions Committee strongly recommends that all international students (for whom English is not their first language) submit the results of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or IELTS examination. The SAT or ACT is also strongly recommended for international applicants.</p><p>Limited financial aid is available to non-U.S. citizens. Union expects international applicants to be able to contribute a minimum of $7,500 (USD) each year toward the cost of attending. All aid is determined by the College's evaluation of a family's financial contribution. To apply for aid, non-U.S. citizens must include a complete copy of the International CSS Profile. Canadian citizens are required to file the CSS PROFILE form with the appropriate agency before February 1. Additional information is available at www.union.edu/financialaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>Union welcomes the applications of students wishing to transfer from other two-year and four-year colleges. In making its decisions, the admissions committee considers college work completed and the recommendations of appropriate officials at the college presently attended. Students should arrange for transcripts of all college work, a college report, a secondary school transcript and recommendations to be sent to the Admissions Office. An interview is recommended, but not required.</p><p>Financial aid for transfer students is limited and depends on the economic need of the student. Candidates applying for financial aid must submit the College Scholarship Service's PROFILE Form and the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) Form to their respective processing agencies.</p><p>The admissions process for transfer students follows a separate timetable. For admission to the fall term, transfer applicants must submit their completed applications by April 15. For entry into the winter term, the deadline is November 1; while into the spring term, the date is February 1. All applicants are notified of admissions decision on a rolling basis. Admission for spring and winter terms is on a space available basis only.</p><p>Union has articulation agreements with Berkshire County Community College in Pittsfield, MA; and Schenectady County Community College in Schenectady, NY (for children of homeowners in the College Park neighborhood).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visiting Students</head><p>Occasionally, non-matriculated students, who have begun their college education elsewhere, may wish to attend the College on a full-time basis. These students are considered visiting students. They may take courses full-time at the College for a maximum of two trimesters, at which time they must apply for transfer admission and be admitted to the College before continuing their studies. High school students who wish to take a course or courses at Union should inquire about that possibility at the Registrar's Office.</p><p>Credit left on the student's declining balance at the end of the fall or winter term will be credited to the following term. Because the meal plans are exempt from New York State sales tax, any credit remaining at the end of the spring term will be forfeited. Students have the option of adding to their declining balance in increments of $25. The declining balance credit can be used in any of the College's dining service facilities.</p><p>The students ID will also act as a declining balance card, which has the cardholder's picture for identification and a magnetic strip to track the student's cash and meal balance. Students wishing to purchase additional credit may do so in the Dining Service Office or online. The card is nontransferable and alterations or misuse can result in disciplinary action. Lost cards should be reported to the Campus Safety Office immediately. Replacement charges are $25.</p><p>Any board student requiring a special diet must comply with the following procedures: 1. A letter from the student's physician must be submitted detailing the specific diet, the reason for the diet, and the expected duration of the diet. 2. A copy of the diet must be sent to Health Services. 3. A follow-up letter from the student's physician must be sent at the end of each term stating the results of the diet and whatever changes, if necessary, must be made in that diet. Union College holds a club New York State liquor license. The laws governing the locations, sale, and consumption of alcohol on or off campus by student groups or organizations using the dining services will be strictly enforced. Temporary beer and wine permits are necessary for any group wishing to sell beer or wine or charge admission at a social function where beer and wine are being served. Such permits are available through the local A.B.C. Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from the College:</head><p>1. All students who intend to withdraw from Union must notify the Dean of Students Office in writing. 2. No withdrawal, or leave of absence, or cancellation of registration or reservations is official except by written notice to the Dean of Students. Neither failure to preregister or register, nonpayment of the term bill, nor a request for a transcript constitutes official notice. Requests for deadline extensions should be made in writing, before the deadline, to the Dean of Students. 3. Notification to the Dean of Students must occur by July 1 preceding an upcoming academic year of the intent to withdraw for a term during that year. Failure to inform the College of the intention to withdraw by July 1 will result in a $250 withdrawal fee. Exceptions may be made in cases of illness or emergency and for seniors requiring fewer than three courses for graduation and electing to withdraw during the winter term and return for the spring term. Notification of the intent to exercise the latter option must be made in writing to the Dean of Students before the due date of winter term bills. Tuition Refund/Deferment Policy in the Event of a Withdrawal Any student who withdraws or takes a leave of absence will be eligible for a refund of the comprehensive fee (less financial aid) based on the following schedule which is calculated as of the last day of attendance.</p><p>Withdrawal before the first day of classes 100%</p><p>Withdrawal during 1st and 2nd week 75%</p><p>Withdrawal during 3rd week 50%</p><p>Withdrawal during 4th week 25%</p><p>Withdrawal after end of 4th week No refund</p><p>Students are encouraged to request a voluntary medical withdrawal at any time that they believe that physical or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with the ability to be a successful student and/or that the demands of College life are interfering with recovery or safety. A medical withdrawal must be approved by the Dean of Students in consultation with campus health care professionals in accordance with College policy.</p><p>A student who starts the term and then withdraws for documented medical reasons from all courses for the term (marked on the academic record as course withdrawals),may choose a refund of the comprehensive fee based on the regular refund schedule (see above). Alternately, a student may request (1) a pro-rated credit for room and board based on the percentage of the term elapsed and (2) a tuition waiver equal to full tuition paid for the term to make up the missed courses later. A tuition waiver may be applied to the student's final term prior to graduation if that is an extra term (beyond the date on which the student's graduation would normally be expected.) A student may request instead that the tuition waiver apply to a fourth course charge in up to three terms in which the student is academically eligible to enroll in a fourth course. Questions about fulfillment of the 12-term residency requirement should be directed to the Dean of Studies.</p><p>If the withdrawn student does not return within six (6) months, they may be contacted to begin repayment on their student loans. Students should contact their loan servicer for any questions regarding their loan repayment options.</p><p>Should a student be unable to return following a medical leave, the student may be eligible for a tuition refund at the discretion of the Dean of Students. Refunds will be calculated as tuition less scholarships and grants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fees</head><p>Admission and Security Deposit -$500  $250 will be applied to the orientation program  $250 deposit is retained until after graduation or withdrawal. If the student does not attend Union, this $500 deposit is forfeited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application Fees (nonrefundable)</head><p> Accelerated Programs and Leadership in Medicine -$50  Collection Fee  A fee of $25 will be charged for each check returned for insufficient funds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Programs</head><p> Students participating in a faculty led term abroad are charged the comprehensive fee for the term plus a $650 International Program fee. Charges include tuition, room, board, insurance, and group excursions; but exclude round trip airfare to and from the host country program destination.</p><p> Students participating in an exchange program or term abroad without a Union faculty member are charged the comprehensive fee for the term. Charges include tuition, room, board, insurance, and group excursions; but exclude round trip airfare to and from the host country / program destination.</p><p> Exchange programs in Lille, France; Aachen, Germany; Antwerp, Belgium; and Istanbul, Turkey have special billing arrangements and students are encouraged to check with the International Programs Office.</p><p> Students who withdrawal from a Term Abroad program are subject to a $600 penalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Late Fees</head><p> $100 (assessed for past due student account balances, failure to check-in on schedule and/or late add/drop course transactions)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Activity Fee</head><p> Included in the Comprehensive Fee (allocated to student organizations/committees by the student government. Payment is required of all full-time matriculated undergraduate students) Laundry Fee  $25 per term for students in College housing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>Union College has a long-standing history of enrolling students who have an outstanding record of personal and academic achievement with a strong commitment to excellence. Since not all qualified students have the financial resources required to attend the College, we offer a very comprehensive financial aid program designed to make a Union education an affordable option for all undergraduate students.</p><p>Although the College offers some merit awards to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of applicants, the majority of aid resources are awarded based on demonstrated financial need as measured through both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS Profile. All candidates for admission are automatically considered for merit awards. There are no separate applications required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying for Financial Aid</head><p>Prospective students who would like to be considered for need-based financial aid must indicate on their admissions application their desire to apply for aid and submit both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS Profile by January 15. In addition, if the biological parents of the dependent student are separated or divorced, the noncustodial parent must also complete and submit the CSS Profile.</p><p>Continuing students must complete the current year FAFSA and Profile and submit all verification documents to the aid office by April 15. A listing of the required verification documents is provided on the financial aid web site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aid Awards</head><p>Generally awards consist of a combination of scholarships, grants, loans, and part-time employment. In determining the aid award, Union typically includes a part-time job ranging from $1,700 to $2,000 as well as some minimal amount of loan. The balance of the award consists of scholarship assistance. The College attempts to meet the full demonstrated need of all of our applicants. Since needs change from year to year, students must submit applications each year to determine their award eligibility.</p><p>Initial aid awards will be offered based on the information provided on both the FAFSA and Profile. All enrolling students will be required to either utilize the IRS data retrieval tool or submit copies of tax transcripts to verify the awards that have been offered. Awards may be adjusted when there are differences between FAFSA/Profile estimates and actual figures. If a student receives outside scholarship awards, he or she must notify the financial aid office. If federal need has not been fully met or a student is receiving only merit awards, he or she may be able to keep the outside award in addition to our financial aid offer. If federal need is fully met, the College will reduce the loan or work portion of the package first. For questions about how the award may affect an aid package, please contact the financial aid office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disbursement of Aid</head><p>Financial aid awards will be disbursed to a student's account provided that the award has been income verified and all required documents have been completed online or submitted directly to the aid or finance office. Typically the aid will be disbursed at the beginning of each term and subsequent disbursements will occur on a weekly basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Annual Renewals</head><p>Since family circumstances change from year to year, need is re-evaluated annually. Continuing students will receive a reminder via email from the Department of Education for the renewal of their FAFSA application. In addition, the Financial Aid office will provide detailed information on its web site regarding the renewal application process. Students and parents can view the status of their application through Financial Aid Self Service which is accessed from the Webadvising Student Menu. The deadline for continuing students is April 15. Once the completed aid application has been reviewed by the Financial Aid Office, the student will be notified via email to view their award online. In Self Service you are able to view financial aid award letters, keep track of application requirements and accept or reject student loans. Please note that all students are eligible to receive a maximum of 12 terms of financial assistance.</p><p>If a student is receiving only a merit award the scholarship will automatically be renewed in subsequent years provided the student is enrolled as a full-time undergraduate at Union College. Students who are enrolled in the Leadership in Medicine Program and/or the 3+3 Accelerated Law Program are not eligible to receive merit and/or need-based aid from Union College once they have officially enrolled at Albany Medical College or Albany Law School.</p><p> Students must complete their program at a pace of 67%. To illustrate: Typically, students register for/attempt a total of 9 credit-bearing courses per academic year. In order to meet Union's pace standard, 6 of those courses must be successfully completed (67%).</p><p> Students are expected to complete graduation requirements within the normal time specified in the program description for the program in which they are enrolled. Under certain circumstances, however, the student may require more than the normal completion time to fulfill graduation requirements. The maximum time frame in which a student must complete the program is 150% of the published length of program measured in credit-bearing classes attempted. When evaluating pace, please note the following:</p><p> Credits transferred in from another institution as well as Advanced Placement classes that are accepted towards the student's educational program are counted when measuring SAP as classes attempted and classes earned.  Grades of "W" (withdrawn), "WF" (withdrawn failing) and "I" (incomplete) will be included as classes attempted, but not as earned. Note:</p><p>Students who have received an "I" and, as a result, are not making SAP are responsible for informing the Financial Aid office when they have been assigned a traditional letter grade. They should request a review of their SAP status. This review is not considered an appeal and may not result in eligibility for federal student aid. For example, if a processing deadline has passed then federal aid cannot be disbursed regardless of their SAP status. It is the responsibility of the student in this situation to contact the financial aid office for all processing deadlines.</p><p> For repeated courses, the original and repeated course will both be included in the total number of classes attempted. However, the student will only receive credit for taking the class once. This includes students who have repeated a course because of a prior failure or who are repeating a course they have passed, but not met a minimum grade requirement.</p><p>For instance, if a required prerequisite must be completed with a "C-", but the student previously passed with a "D", both classes will count as attempted, but counted only once as earned. Students who are not meeting the SAP requirements will lose eligibility for their federal aid (Direct loans, PLUS loans, PELL, SEOG and federal work study) the following academic year. In order to regain eligibility, they must be meeting SAP requirements by the end of the following year.</p><p>Federal regulations permit students to appeal their loss of federal aid and, instead, be placed on one term of Academic Probation status. This status allows for reinstatement of federal funds for one payment period only, provided all appeal conditions are met and approved. The bases on which a student may file an appeal include the death of a relative, an injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstances beyond the student's control. The student must complete the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form and include documentation to support their basis of appeal, a letter that explains what has changed in the student's situation that will allow the student to demonstrate SAP at the next evaluation and a plan of action developed with the academic advisor that will ensure they continue to meet SAP. In certain cases, an academic advisor may develop a plan which will enable the student to meet Union's SAP standards by a specific point in time. In such situations, until the specified point in time is reached, the student's progress must be evaluated each term to determine whether or not the student is meeting the requirements of the plan. Any student who is not meeting the requirements of the plan will lose their Academic Probation status and, therefore, eligibility for federal funding. The Appeal Form along with supporting documentation will be reviewed by a committee that will include the Director of Financial Aid as well as an Academic Dean. The student will be informed of the committee's decision by letter and/or email.</p><p>In the event that a student is placed on Academic Probation for one term, Union will review the progress at the end of each subsequent term for the entire academic year to confirm he/she is making SAP or meeting the requirements specified in the academic plan.</p></div>

This is defined as completing, with either a passing or a failing grade, a certain percentage of a full-time course load in each term for which an award is received. The percentage is 50 percent of the minimum fulltime course load in each term of study during the first year in which an award is received; 75 percent of the full-time course load in each term of study in the second year for which an award is received; and 100 percent of the minimum full-time course load in each term thereafter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Rights and Responsibilities</head><p>A student has the right to know and understand all aspects of the financial aid process and programs that are administered through the Union College Financial Aid Office. Questions may be directed to the staff of the Office of Financial Aid. Some commonly asked questions are listed below:</p><p> What financial assistance is available, including information on all federal, state, and Union College aid programs?  What are the specific deadlines for submitting applications for each of the various aid programs?  What is Union's cost of attendance and what is our policy with regard to making refunds to students who leave the College?  What criterion is used to determine which students are eligible to receive aid?  How does the College determine financial need, including how costs for tuition, fees, room and board, travel, books and supplies are considered in the calculated budget?</p><p> What resources (such as parental contribution, other aid resources, assets, etc.) are considered in the calculation of need?  How much of financial need as determined by the College has been met?  What does each of the types of aid included in a package mean?  What portion of an aid award must be repaid and what portion represents gift aid? If any portion of a package includes a loan, the student has the right to know the interest rate, the total amount that must be repaid, the payback procedures, the total time to repay the loan, and when the repayment is to begin. Along with these rights, students also have responsibilities which include:</p><p> Review and consider all information about a school's financial aid program and specifically, the financial aid award, before enrollment.  Complete financial aid applications accurately and within the established deadlines. Errors may delay the processing of an application. Intentional misreporting of information on application forms for federal aid is a federal violation and is subject to penalties under the U.S. Criminal Code.</p><p> Return all additional documentation, verification, corrections, or other requests from the financial aid office or by agencies to which a student has submitted applications.</p><p> Read and understand and accept responsibility for all of the forms. Keep copies for records.  Notify a lender of any change in name, address, or school enrollment status.  Perform in an acceptable manner, the work that is agreed upon when accepting employment through the Federal Work-Study Program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid Programs Federal Aid</head><p>Students must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to be considered for any of the federal programs (grants, loans, and work study). Based on the FAFSA, the Financial Aid Office reviews eligibility and makes awards within program guidelines and formulas (as always, subject to available funds).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grants</head><p>Pell Grant: These grants, varying from $657 to <ref type="bibr">$6,195</ref>, are awarded to the neediest students (based on a federal calculation).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loans</head><p>Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Program: A need-based student loan that carries a fixed interest rate and allows for the deferment of both principal and interest while the student is enrolled at least half-time. Loan maximum amounts are $3,500 (first-year students), $4,500 (sophomores), $5,500 (juniors and seniors) with a maximum cumulative total of $23,000.</p><p>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Students who do not qualify for all or part of the need-based subsidized Direct Loan may qualify for an unsubsidized Direct loan. The interest rate is fixed and the interest begins at time of disbursement (or the student can choose to pay the interest while still in school). For dependent undergraduate students, the annual loan limits include amounts borrowed under a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan (i.e. first-year students $3,500; sophomores $4,500; juniors and seniors $5,500). Dependent undergraduates may borrow an additional $2,000. Undergraduates who are independent according to the federal guidelines or whose parents are ineligible for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan may borrow up to an additional $6,000 (for first-year students and sophomores) and $7,000 (for juniors and seniors). The current interest rate for Direct Loans is 4.53% with an origination fee of 1.062%. Eligibility for these loans is determined through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov. The Financial Aid Office notifies applicants the specific amounts for which they qualify from both the subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs. Repayment begins six months after completion of studies or leaving college and may extend up to ten years.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Program and Policies</head><p>The Academic Program Union College offers studies in the humanities, the social sciences, the sciences, and engineering. The curriculum, which has a wide range and balance across areas of study, offers breadth and depth as students explore particular disciplines and interdisciplinary subjects. Union's curriculum and student life are designed to educate students to live and work in a global, diverse, and technologically-complex society.</p><p>Union has a tradition of curricular innovation dating back to its founding in 1795. In the 19th century, Union pioneered the introduction of science, modern languages and engineering into the undergraduate curriculum. More recently, the College has made important advances in general education, interdisciplinary study, international programs, and undergraduate research. Our tradition of curricular innovation continues as Union pioneers ways to conceive of engineering as an integral component of the liberal arts and as we introduce students to computational methods, community-based learning, entrepreneurship, and ethical understanding in courses across the curriculum. At Union, we bring together faculty from diverse academic backgrounds so that students can gain mastery of a wide range of disciplines as well as an understanding of how different disciplines approach particular questions. Students thus prepared are ready to communicate, work, and think within and beyond their area of specialty. Many students study abroad as part of their Union education, often in programs led by Union faculty as well as programs of their own design.</p><p>A major may be centered in one of the College's academic departments or a student may choose an interdepartmental major involving work in two or more departments, a formal interdisciplinary major, or a personally-designed "organizing theme major" that defines a central, unifying topic cutting across disciplinary lines. Students may also elect to take up to two minors.</p><p>The College is committed to ensuring that all students become good writers. The College's program of Writing Across the Curriculum constitutes a systematic way of ensuring that students pay close attention to writing in courses located throughout the curriculum. The First-Year Preceptorial is the foundation of Union's writing requirements. The Sophomore Research Seminar provides a foundation of research skills for upper-class work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degree Requirements</head><p>Union offers the following undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Science degrees in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.</p><p>A Union education is a four-year integrated living and learning experience. Our curriculum is designed to enable a student to achieve the breadth and depth that mark the graduate of a liberal arts college. There is a structure in the movement of our curriculum from first to senior year, a structure that ensures the intellectual sophistication and maturity that we want our graduates to have. To qualify for a degree, a student must:</p><p>1. Satisfactorily complete 12 terms of study at Union, including 36 term courses plus any additional courses taken as electives or to satisfy program requirements. The engineering program requires 40 courses over 12 terms. Please see exceptions to the requirement of 12 terms of study in the section, "Academic Calendar and Enrollment Requirements." For two-degree programs refer to the section, "Combined Degree Programs." 2. Satisfactorily complete requirements in the Common Curriculum; 3. Satisfactorily complete requirements in the major field, degree program, or interdepartmental major, including senior capstone requirements such as a senior thesis, as applicable; 4. Attain minimum cumulative indices of 1.80 overall and 2.00 in the major (and 2.0 in the minor if a minor has been declared). To graduate, a student also must have paid all sums due to the Bursar's Office, must have made satisfactory provision for payment of any other financial obligations assumed while in college, and must have returned all books and materials borrowed from the library. The individual student is solely responsible for assuring that the program presented for graduation fulfills all requirements, both in general and in specialized study. The Office of the Registrar should be consulted when questions arise about the satisfaction of graduation requirements. Notice of intent to graduate must be provided to the Registrar as per the deadline specified by the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Calendar and Enrollment Requirements</head><p>Union divides the academic year into three terms of 10 weeks plus a week of exams. A full course unit may be equated to five quarter-credit hours, or three and one-third semester credit hours. The normal course load for a full-time student is three courses in each of the three terms, or nine courses a year. Taking laboratory and other extra class hours into account, the average time per week spent in class is approximately 4.5 hours and the expected average time spent outside of class on course work is approximately 10.5 hours per week. To complete the entire curriculum in four years, engineering students should expect, on occasion, to take more than three courses per term, once per academic year. For additional information on course registration policies, refer to "Academic Program and Policies."</p><p>It is expected that students will be enrolled full-time for 12 terms (at least 36 courses) through the spring term prior to graduation, with the two exceptions noted below. Additional courses, taken at Union or elsewhere, may be used to fulfill departmental or Common Curriculum requirements or to compensate for deficiencies in credits, but may not be used to graduate early or to take a term away from Union, with the following two exceptions:</p><p> Any student entering the College with three or more pre-matriculation credits may graduate one term early or be unenrolled from Union for a term during the junior or senior year, provided that these credits have not been used to compensate for deficiencies incurred during their time at the College.</p><p> Students in the Union Scholars and Seward Interdisciplinary Fellows programs may use any additional course credits they earn at Union to accelerate their graduation or to be unenrolled for a term. Any student seeking early graduation must obtain approval from the Office of the Dean of Studies by the end of the junior year. Students seeking to be unenrolled for a term must contact the Office of the Dean of Students. For guidelines regarding transfer credits, refer to Transfer Credit Policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Common Curriculum (General Education)</head><p>As a liberal arts college, Union is devoted to educating students to flourish in this rapidly changing world, a world with fluid geographic, intellectual and cultural boundaries. The Common Curriculum seeks to nurture in students a commitment to learning as central to one's development over the course of a lifetime. Union starts with the assumption that college represents a beginning and not an end of one's education. Union's approach, ensuring that students learn much of what the College deems important and at the same time develop and satisfy a taste for exploration, combines elements of choice within a structure of requirements.</p><p>Union's Common Curriculum ensures that students analyze and integrate knowledge from a wide variety of areas, communicate the results of their learning and, most important, continue to learn, an essential skill in today's world. To accomplish this, we start with a First-year Preceptorial that emphasizes critical reading and writing using the perspectives of multiple disciplines, and a Sophomore Research Seminar that focuses on learning research skills necessary to assess through informed reflection the enormous varieties of information to which we have access today. Union's Common Curriculum provides the foundational breadth that defines a liberal arts education through requirements in humanities, social sciences, linguistic and cultural competency, quantitative reasoning, and science and technology. The Common Curriculum is designed to enable students to become life-long learners by learning to analyze, synthesize, integrate, and communicate effectively, and obtain an appreciation of different disciplines and areas of knowledge, as well as interdisciplinary study.</p><p>A detailed description of the Common Curriculum is under "Common Curriculum."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Major</head><p>The major should be viewed as a coherent series of courses providing a solid background in the area of study as well as an introduction to advanced study. Depth of knowledge and understanding in a particular field of study is provided by the major. Courses in this area of special study may also count toward meeting some Common Curriculum requirements, but the prescribed program of study for a major is primarily intended to develop competence in the scholarship represented by an academic department or a group of departments. In addition to majors offered through academic departments, Union offers majors in interdisciplinary programs and individually designed "organizing theme" majors.</p><p>Students can pursue an interdepartmental major that combines study in two departments or interdisciplinary programs that offer an interdepartmental major (ID) by completing the ID requirements specified by each. Students must review particular department and interdisciplinary program terms and conditions for interdepartmental majors and then consult with the necessary Chairs and Directors in order to carry out an ID. Departments and interdisciplinary programs specify the terms and conditions for interdepartmental majors. Students should consult each department or program section in Majors, Minors, and Other Programs for descriptions of available options and requirements. Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering may not be used as a component of interdepartmental majors. Senior Writing Experience requirements vary among areas of study. Where appropriate, students can do one two-term thesis to satisfy both departments' writing requirements.</p><p>Students may pursue a "double major" by satisfying all requirements of two majors, neither of which can be an interdepartmental major. Except as indicated under "Combined Degree Programs," a student satisfactorily completing two majors earns one rather than two degrees. A student in such a program will be eligible for his or her degree whenever the requirements for both majors, along with those in the Common Curriculum program, are satisfied and a minimum of thirty-six course credits has been earned. Normally an overlap of at most three courses is allowed for the two majors.</p><p>The student who enters college with a fairly firm notion about a proposed field of concentration will find it advantageous to test his or her interest in the proposed major field during the first year. In many programs, a student need not begin a major during the first year in order to complete that major by the end of the fourth year. In engineering and science, however, it can be extremely difficult to complete a major in four years unless course sequences are begun in the first year. Students in pre-medicine also need to consider taking the requisite courses in their first year. At the end of the first year, the major may be declared or changed without penalty in the form of lost time and credit. Soon thereafter, and certainly by the end of the second year, the student should make a serious commitment to a focus of study. Every student is required to file with the Registrar a declaration of major no later than the end of the sophomore year ("Liberal Arts" and unspecified "Engineering" are not considered majors). Students majoring in an unspecified engineering program must declare their major by the end of their first year of study. This decision may be altered subsequently, although late change of major may require extra courses or terms. Requirements for majors appear at the head of each departmental listing. Some areas require additional courses from related disciplines.</p><p>Students may change their major program upon application to the Registrar. The change must have the consent of the Department Chair or Program Director. A request for a change of major submitted after the first week of the final term of study at the College may not be possible to accommodate without delaying the student's graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Minor</head><p>Students who wish to pursue a secondary field of concentration may select and declare up to two academic minors. A minor normally consists of six courses. Requirements for the minor may be found in the course listings by department and program. Students are normally expected to declare a minor in the sophomore or junior year. They must obtain the approval of the department chairperson or program director.</p><p>For students who wish to declare one minor, those courses used to satisfy the major field requirement plus those used to satisfy the minor field requirement may in no case total fewer than 18. For students who wish to declare two minors, the minimum is 23. A minimum cumulative index of 2.00 must be attained in courses used to satisfy the minor requirement. All students are responsible for verifying the accuracy of their declared minor at the time of their senior year audit review. Minors cannot be added once the degree has been conferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Degree Programs</head><p>Union College offers programs in which a student may earn two baccalaureate degrees in the following combinations: engineering and bachelor of science or bachelor of arts, or two engineering degrees.</p><p>Nine courses beyond the requirements for the professional degree are required, and normally five years are required to complete them. Certain combinations of curricula within five-year programs may involve carrying an occasional course overload. If a student cannot fulfill all requirements for the two degrees, modification of the program is permitted only with the concurrence of the department.</p><p>Also offered are two-degree programs in cooperation with other area colleges, many of which are affiliated with Union University, leading to a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree from Union and a law degree from Albany Law School; or to a bachelor of science degree from Union, an M.S. or M.B.A. degree from Clarkson University -Capital Region Center, and an M.D. from Albany Medical College; to a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science and a master of business administration in healthcare management; or to a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science and a master of teaching; or to a bachelor of science in a science or engineering field and a master of science in electrical or mechanical engineering, or energy studies. For more information on two-degree programs, please refer to the following sections under Majors, Minors and Other Programs: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Programs</head><p>The College considers its commitment to international programs to be a central part of its identity. In addition to broadening perspective and deepening knowledge, study abroad often energizes and challenges students so that they are motivated to a higher level of commitment to the enterprise of learning. Students studying away from Union do so through Union College terms abroad programs and exchanges. Students may apply for "non-Union" programs through Union's International Programs office to study abroad on programs run by other colleges and universities. Independent Study Abroad programs allow students the opportunity to design their own study abroad experience. Mini-term programs are offered over winter and summer breaks as well. Refer to "International Programs" under Majors, Minors and Other Programs for more information, including eligibility criteria, application procedures and withdrawal policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Policies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Registration for Courses</head><p>Registration Confirmation: Each term the Registrar conducts online prescheduling for continuing students who, with the help of their advisors, select three courses for the coming term. Prescheduling must be completed during the announced periods. Students who do not intend to preschedule should notify the Dean of Students of their intended withdrawal from the College. After prescheduling, a request for a change of course ordinarily must be filed with the Registrar no later than the fifth academic day of the term; such changes should be recommended by the advisor. Students who fail to finalize their course schedule after the end of the first week of the term will be assessed a late charge on their bill. With written permission from the instructor, a student may enter a course as late as the second week of the term. Students not enrolled in courses by the end of the second week of classes may be subject to withdrawal from the College for the term and will have to reapply for admission to the Dean of Students.</p><p>All full-time matriculated students are expected to be enrolled in no fewer than three courses at the start of each term, unless an exception is approved by the Dean of Studies. This does not include practicum courses. For withdrawals after the start of the term, please refer to the section "Withdrawal from Courses." All regular undergraduate students are charged each term's full tuition, which covers enrollment in three courses during that term. The tuition is not prorated for single courses unless the student has been in attendance for 12 full terms (or, for five-year programs, 15 terms).</p><p>Students must attend those sections of courses to which they have been scheduled by the Registrar. A change of section may be made at the Registrar's Office provided that seats are available or permission is obtained from the professor.</p><p>Fourth Courses: Students who enroll in a fourth course in order to make up for a deficiency in credits due to withdrawal or failure will be charged a fourth course fee. Students are allowed to enroll in one fourth course in each academic year at no charge, provided they have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.3 and are making satisfactory progress in their program of study. These courses can be used to fulfill program requirements; however, they will be considered additional credits beyond the 36 required for graduation and can only be used towards graduation should the student fall behind in credits at a later date or if the student is making up a deficiency in credits because of withdrawal or failure. If such credit is used towards graduation, a fourth course fee will be charged. This policy also applies to fourth courses taken on an international program. Such courses can only be used toward graduation should the student fall behind in credits, in which a fourth course fee will be charged. Refer to Costs and Financial Aid for the relevant fee. Engineering students are required to take 40 classes for their degree and are therefore allowed to register for four additional fourth courses at no charge, normally one fourth course per academic year. Should an engineering student subsequently leave their program and declare a non-engineering major, the additional fourth courses taken will not count toward the 36 credits required for graduation. Refer to "Special Curricular Opportunities" for information regarding extra courses for Union <ref type="bibr">Scholars and Seward Fellows.</ref> Registration in a fourth course is not available to students in their first term of study at Union. Students who have below a 2.5 GPA or wish to register for their second or third overload course of the academic year, require approval from the Dean of Studies to enroll in a fourth course.</p><p>With the exception of students in the Scholars and Leadership in Medicine programs, all students, including engineers, are required to complete and submit the "Petition to Enroll in a Fourth Course" form at the time of registration.</p><p>Practicum: An enrollment in a zero-credit practicum does not count as one of a student's three regular course registrations for the term (see above: Registration Confirmation). After successfully completing a practicum sequence, a student may request that one course equivalent be recorded. An aggregated practicum course credit of this sort typically requires registration in a zero-credit practicum in each of three separate terms; requirements specific to each practicum sequence should be confirmed in the Academic Catalog entry for the practicum. Accumulated practicum course credit may be counted toward no more than two of the thirty-six course credits required for graduation, though all practicum registrations will be recorded on a student's record, and may be used to satisfy program requirements if allowed by a student's major or minor.</p><p>Auditing Courses: A matriculated full-time student in good standing may audit a course if the instructor gives permission. An audit is not recorded on the student's permanent record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass-Fail Option</head><p>In order to encourage students to explore the curriculum, students may take up to four electives to be recorded as "pass" or "fail."</p><p>1. No course registered as "pass/fail" may be used in fulfilling a requirement for the major, for a minor, for the Common Curriculum <ref type="bibr">(General Education)</ref> or Writing Across the Curriculum, or for a term abroad. 2. The "pass/fail" option is not open to students in their first two terms. 3. A student may take no more than one "pass/fail" course per academic year (defined as the fall, winter, and spring) in the first three years. 4. A student may take up to two "pass/fail" courses in the senior year (defined as the fall, winter, and spring), but may register for no more than one "pass/fail" course per academic term. 5. A student may register for no more than one of the four "pass/fail" courses in any academic department and no more than two of the four "pass/fail" courses in any academic division (Refer to "Divisions" under Common Curriculum. 6. Independent study courses and those taken on a Term Abroad, may not be taken Pass/Fail. 7. A grade of "pass" will be equivalent to the lowest passing grade or better.</p><p>A grade of "pass" will not be calculated in the term or cumulative index; a grade of "fail," however, will count as any other failing grade. A course is registered as "pass/fail" by means of a form provided by the Registrar and the option must be exercised (or revoked) no later than the end of the third week of the term. The instructors (who will be informed of this choice by a particular student only by request) will submit regular letter grades, which will be appropriately converted to "pass" or "fail." Later reconversion to the letter grade will be done only if required by a student's official change of major or minor and only upon the specific request of the student.</p><p>During the first two weeks of the term, a student must add a class to replace the dropped class; exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Dean of Studies. After the end of the second week of classes and until the end of the eighth week, a grade of "W" will be assigned for dropped classes. Dropping a course after the end of the eighth week will result in a grade of "F" unless there are extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control that prevented him or her from completing the course. The Dean of Studies must approve the withdrawal. In such a case the grade shall be "WP" or "WF," depending on whether the student was passing or failing at the time the course was dropped. A "Failure" ("F") shall be posted to a student's record if proper notice of withdrawal from a course is not given to the Registrar. For information on how this would affect tuition, please see "Withdrawal Deadlines, Refunds and Obligations" in the "Costs" section. Students receiving financial aid who elect or are permitted to drop a course may be ineligible for such aid in subsequent terms. See the chapter on "Costs and Financial Aid" for details.</p><p>Three Final Exam Advisory: Students with three final exams scheduled for the same day should speak with their professors to make arrangements to reschedule one of the exams. If arrangements cannot be made with individual faculty members, the student should consult with the Dean of Studies.</p><p>Absence from Final Examinations: Students are required to appear for scheduled final examinations. Absence from a final examination produces an automatic grade of "Failure" on the exam. In cases of a student's absence caused by verified personal misfortune, the Dean of Studies may allow a grade of "Incomplete," and the student must arrange with the instructor to take a makeup examination not later than two weeks after the last day of the examination period of the term in which the "Incomplete" was given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Course Work:</head><p>Students must submit all course work no later than the closing hour of the last scheduled final examination period of each term, unless the instructor has set an earlier deadline. Graduating seniors cannot be issued a grade of "Incomplete." A grade of "Incomplete" may be assigned only for extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The instructor must complete the incomplete form provided by the Registrar's Office and obtain the student's signature. An incomplete grade form must be submitted to the Registrar's Office after submitting the final grades online. When an "Incomplete" is granted, the course work must be completed no later than two weeks after the last day of the examination period of the term in which the "Incomplete" was given. Course work not completed within the allotted period of time will be assigned a failing grade unless the Dean of Studies, in consultation with the instructor, grants an extension of the incomplete.</p><p>Repeating Courses: Students who repeat a course that they previously failed will have both grades listed on their transcripts. All credits attempted and total quality points earned will be used in calculating the cumulative grade point average. Students who repeat a course that they have previously passed (grade of "D" or better) will have both grades listed on their transcripts, but neither the quality points nor the credit associated with the second grade will be factored into their cumulative grade point average. The one exception to this policy is when the course is a required prerequisite that the department has stipulated must be completed with a minimum grade of either a "C" or "C-." If a student retakes a prerequisite course that they have previously passed but without satisfying the minimum grade requirement, both grades will be equally factored into their GPA but they will only receive credit for taking the course once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making up Credits:</head><p>There are many options for students to get caught up if they are behind in credits. Students behind in credits can take a fourth course at Union, a summer course at Union, a pre-approved summer course at another College (a maximum of three course credits can be earned at schools other than Union after matriculation), an internship or independent study over the summer for a full course credit, go on a mini-term, or earn a music, dance, ceramics or theater practicum credit by taking three terms of the same practicum with a passing grade. For more information, as well as the costs and procedures associated with each option, please refer to the "Missing One Credit?" link on the Advising website.</p><p>Withdrawal from College: Withdrawal from the College at any time is considered official only upon written notice to the Dean of Students. The withdrawal date is considered the date on which written notification is received. Notification to another office or person, failure to preschedule or confirm registration, nonpayment of the term bill, or a request for a transcript are not considered notice of withdrawal. A student who wishes to withdraw permanently or take a voluntary leave of absence should notify the Dean of Students as far in advance as possible to avoid or reduce financial penalties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Credit Policy</head><p>Matriculated Students (Transfer students see "Transfer Students Only" section below)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credits received prior to matriculation at Union College, including Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses</head><p>A matriculating first-year student can transfer in a maximum of four course credits to use towards graduation credit requirements through any combination of Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, the International Baccalaureate Program (IB), or college courses taken at other postsecondary institutions. Credit can be granted for similar high-level examinations from other countries, such as A-level examinations, in consultation with academic departments (references to AP and IB examinations below should be understood to apply to approved examinations from other countries as well.) Students must elect a more advanced course if they study in a department in which credit has been granted. Repetition of work for which credit has been granted will not be permitted. Please refer to department and program pages for specific guidelines. Please note: Online courses are not eligible for transfer credit.</p><p>Students with AP examination scores of three or higher in calculus and four or five in other subject areas may be eligible to receive college course credit. Credit for IB courses may be awarded for higher-level examination scores of six or better; economics will accept a score of five at the higher level. Aside from AP and IB courses, Union College will consider granting credit for a course taken while the student is enrolled in high school only if the course is taken on the campus of the college or university offering the course, the course is available for enrollment by the students of that college or university, and the final grade is a C or better.</p><p>Any number of AP, IB or college courses may be used to determine course placement with the approval of the appropriate department chair in each instance. Only one AP, IB or college course may be used to fulfill a HUM, HUL, SOCS, QMR, SCLB, or SET requirement in the Common Curriculum (General Education).</p><p>Students who enter Union College with a combination of three or more AP, IB, or college credits may petition the Dean of Studies to graduate one term early. Students seeking early graduation must obtain approval from the Office of the Dean of Studies by the end of spring term the year preceding their expected graduation. Otherwise students are expected to be in full-time residence for 12 terms through the spring term prior to graduation. This rule does not apply to students enrolled in the Scholars, NSF-STEM Scholars, Seward Fellows or Law Scholars programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credits received at other institutions after matriculation at Union College</head><p>Normally, permission is granted for courses taken at other colleges to count towards the total number of courses required for graduation only when a student has failed or withdrawn from courses started at Union and as a result is "behind" in credits. A student may transfer in a maximum of three such course credits for courses taken at other institutions. Students behind in credits who wish to receive credit for courses taken at other colleges must have those courses approved by the appropriate department chair(s) and by the Dean of Studies. A form for this purpose is available at the Office of the Registrar and should be returned to that office in advance of taking the relevant courses. Please note: Online courses are not eligible for transfer credit.</p><p>Students who are not behind in credits may wish to enhance their education by taking courses at other colleges, particularly during the summer. Although credit towards the courses required for graduation will not be granted in such circumstances, up to three such courses may be used with the permission of the appropriate department chair(s) and the Dean of Studies to fulfill particular course requirements and to satisfy course prerequisites. Such permission must be obtained in writing and filed with the Registrar's office in advance of taking such courses.</p><p>Normally, course work at other colleges will be recognized only if a minimum grade of "C" is achieved. The credit value of a course must be at least three semester-hour credits or five quarter-hour credits to earn one full course credit at Union. Students with 18 or more credits towards graduation may receive degree credit for courses taken at a two-year college only if approved by the Dean of Studies. The grades for course work accepted from other colleges will not be recorded on a student's Union College transcript nor will these grades be factored into a student's cumulative academic average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selected graduate courses at Clarkson University -Capital Region</head><p>Center are open to advanced undergraduates with the approval of the student's advisor. Students matriculated in a five year combined degree program may take up to three graduate level courses as an undergraduate. All other students will be limited to two graduate courses. The first two graduate courses (or three for matriculated combined degree students) that a student takes automatically count towards this limit. No substitutions may be made at a later date. For a list of eligible courses, please refer to the Clarkson University -Capital Region Center's Supplemental Listing, which is available on their website and on the Registrar's Office "Course and Exam Schedule" website during prescheduling. If the graduate course is cross-listed with an undergraduate course, Union students must enroll in the undergraduate course. For course descriptions, please consult the course catalog of Clarkson University -Capital Region Center.</p><p>For cross-registration at participating colleges of the Hudson-Mohawk consortium, please refer to the relevant heading in this catalog under the "Special Curricular Opportunities" section for rules and restrictions. Students with 18 or more credits toward graduation may not cross-register for courses at a two-year college unless specifically approved by the Dean of Studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students Only</head><p>Transfer students may bring in up to two full years of college course credit and must complete two years of study at Union to qualify for a Union degree. At most, four of these transfer course credits can come from any combination of Advanced Placement (AP) examinations or the International Baccalaureate Program (IB). Refer to the catalog entry on Transfer Credit Policy for Matriculated Students for required courses for AP and IB courses. Characteristics of courses for transfer credit must meet the requirements for transfer credit for all students at Union, including a minimum grade of C, credit for online courses is not given, and courses must have three semester credit hours or five quarter credit hours. Courses without Union equivalents can be transferred at the discretion of the Dean of Studies.</p><p>Students who are awarded 15 credits or fewer may, after matriculating at Union, transfer in three additional course credits for courses taken at other institutions to make up for deficiencies: courses for which the student received a grade lower than "C" before matriculation, course withdrawals or failed courses at Union, or pre-matriculation courses that did not transfer because they were not equivalent to a Union course. Students who are awarded 16 credits may transfer in up to two additional credits to make up for deficiencies; those with 17 credits may transfer in one additional credit from another institution to make up for a deficiency. Prior approval for all transfer credits must be obtained from the appropriate department chair and the Dean of Studies. Permission is normally granted only if the student is to make up for a deficiency (as described above or to fulfill Common Curriculum (General Education) or departmental requirements. If the student is not making up for a deficiency transfer credits cannot count toward the total number of credits required for graduation or towards accelerated graduation. Please note: Online courses are not eligible for transfer credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proficiency Examinations</head><p>With the approval of the relevant department and notification to the Registrar, proficiency examinations covering the substance of courses listed in this Academic Catalog, except independent study, may be taken by matriculated undergraduate students in good standing at a cost of $250 for each examination. Credit may be obtained from proficiency examinations to allow for placement out of certain courses, but cannot be used toward accelerated graduation.</p><p>Any proficiency examination may be taken only once. It will be graded "pass" or "fail," but failures will not be recorded. In the Department of Modern Languages, credit may normally be earned by proficiency examination only for courses in literature and civilization numbered 300 and above. Students may not take proficiency examinations in subjects in which they have already taken courses at a higher level for credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participation in Graduation</head><p>At Commencement, the College is pleased to recognize the accomplishments of students who have nearly completed their graduation requirements. Students who have completed all degree requirements except for one course by the end of spring term may participate fully in the Commencement ceremony, except that they will not receive their diplomas. They will process with the graduating class in alphabetical order and will cross the stage.</p><p>Students who are short more than one course but who are within six courses of completing degree requirements by the end of spring term have the option of marching in with their class if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. They have started their fourth year of College-2. They have earned 27 course credits by the end of winter term-3. They are signed up for a full course load spring term-4. They will be within six courses of completing their degree by the end of spring term.</p><p>This last group of students will march in following their classmates and be seated behind the last group of graduating seniors. Their names will be read by the Dean of the Faculty after the graduating class has finished crossing the stage. Please note that their names will not appear in the commencement program; however, they will be allowed to cross the stage.</p><p>All students in the Commencement procession are invited, along with their families, to attend the department and program receptions immediately following the ceremony.</p><p>Students that complete their studies by the following December 15th, will receive their diplomas by mail provided there are no financial holds on their record.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Honors and Recognition</head><p>Dean's List: A student achieves Dean's List standing for an academic year, which is defined as the fall, winter, and spring term, by meeting the following requirements:</p><p>1. An academic index of at least 3.50 for the year. 2. Students with first year, sophomore or junior status at the end of the academic year must have a total of nine completed courses, at least eight of which are graded. Students with senior status at the end of the academic year must have completed eight courses, at least seven of which are graded. For seniors graduating early this rule will be applied to their last three terms at Union College. 3. No grades of "D" or "WF" or "F." A student who spends part of an academic year at the College may be admitted to the Dean's List by the Dean of Studies if extraordinary circumstances prevent full-time attendance and the academic index for the courses taken is at least 3.50 with no grades of D or F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graduation with Distinction:</head><p>Union College recognizes academic distinction by awarding some degrees summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude. These Latin honors signify various levels of the graduates' cumulative grade point averages. The faculty has the responsibility and authority for setting the levels necessary to attain the various honors. Standards are summa cum laude (3.80 or better), magna cum laude (3.65 or better), and cum laude (3.50 or better). To be eligible, students must have taken at least eighteen courses toward their undergraduate degree while enrolled at Union.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Departmental Honors:</head><p>In general, students become eligible for departmental honors provided that they (1) have achieved a cumulative index of 3.3 or better; (2) have an index of 3.3 or better in courses taken in the major with grades of A-or better in at least three such courses, exclusive of the senior thesis; (3) completed their Senior Writing Experience on which a grade not lower than A-has been earned (4) satisfy any other requirements set by the major department, and (5) have taken the final six terms of their program at Union or elsewhere in a study program approved by Union. Students should consult their departments for complete information. In the case of interdepartmental majors, students must satisfy the above for each department, except that for (2), they need to have at least two (not three) grades of A-or better in each department. Interdepartmental majors also must complete independent work of substance and distinction, in the form of a thesis or some other written or documented work on which a grade not</p></div>

According to New York State law, students who have reached the age of 18 are considered to be adults and are accorded the full rights that such status entails. Because of this, it is the policy of Union College to communicate directly with students on all academic matters, such as grades, academic standing and issues of credit.</p><p>The 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) stipulates that in the case of students who are dependents of their parents in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service, the College is allowed to disclose information from the student's educational records without obtaining the student's consent. It is the policy of the College to notify both students and parents in writing of formal academic warnings, probationary status and dismissal. Additionally, the College will notify the parents of a student in connection with a health or safety emergency as expressly permitted under FERPA.</p><p>In other communications with parents, the College will normally respect the privacy of the student. Information from the student's educational records will not be disclosed without the student's formal written consent. Grades are considered to be part of the student's educational record and will not be disclosed to parents without the student's formal written consent. Upon obtaining such written consent, the College will provide information to parents (or guardians).</p><p>All students will be required to declare their tax status at the commencement of each academic year. Any student who claims not to be a legal dependent must provide appropriate evidence to the College in writing within the first month of each academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Right-to-Know Act</head><p>In compliance with the federal Student Right-to-Know Act requiring institutions of higher education to make available graduation rates, Union has calculated a six-year graduation rate of 87% based on the first-time, first-year student cohort entering in September 2012. This calculation does not include students who have transferred into the College from other institutions. The complete graduation rate report is available on line at https://www.union.edu/institutional-research/retention or by contacting the Office of Institutional Research, (518)388-6607. with students to help them identify the kinds of experiences on campus and in the community that will foster personal growth and the development of interpersonal skills necessary for a successful career in healthcare delivery.</p><p>Professional schools give no preference to any particular major when seeking candidates; therefore, Union College does not offer a "premedical" major. Although many major in the natural sciences, students are encouraged to choose a major in any field in which they are interested. Today more than ever, professional schools are searching for students who have not only mastered the sciences but who also have backgrounds that are wellrounded and diverse. Most professional schools require students to complete and do well in the following courses:</p><p> Two English courses (satisfied by First-Year Preceptorial and at least one English elective);  Calculus course (through MTH 102 or MTH 112 or MTH 113 );  Three biology courses <ref type="bibr">(BIO 103 (110) ,</ref><ref type="bibr">BIO 104 (112)</ref> , and BIO 205 );  Four chemistry courses (CHM 101 and CHM 102 or CHM 110H ; CHM 231 and CHM 232 );  Biochemistry course (BIO 335 or BCH 380 or CHM 382 );  Two physics courses <ref type="bibr">(PHY 110 ,</ref><ref type="bibr">PHY 111 )</ref>.</p><p>Note: Introductory Psychology or Sociology and statistics are also recommended. Some health professions programs (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing) also require additional courses such as Microbiology and Developmental Psychology as well as Human Anatomy and Physiology, the latter of which is not offered at Union but can be taken through the Hudson Mohawk Consortium at neighboring schools.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scholars Program</head><p>Director: scholarsdirector@union.edu</p><p>The Union Scholars Program offers selected students an enriched educational experience. The Admissions Office, in conjunction with the Director of the Scholars Program, selects the candidates for the Scholars Program. Specific features of the Scholars Program are a two-term sequence of honors courses beginning with a special Scholars Preceptorial (FPR 100H) followed by a Research Seminar (SCH 150), which is also taken in the first year; a two-term (one course credit) sophomore independent study project (295H-296H) with a professor of the student's choosing; and, in the senior year, an optional Scholars Colloquium (SCH 400). To graduate as a Union Scholar a minimum of 38 courses is required. AP, IB and transfer courses which are accepted by Union College (see "Transfer Credit Policy") may be used toward the total number of courses. Union Scholars may take one extra course each term at no extra cost, starting in the winter term of their first year, provided they maintain the minimum 3.40 GPA for the Scholars Program. These courses can be used to accelerate graduation. New opportunities for scholars, such as summer research fellowships and special classes, are available in selected years. Please note that Seward Interdisciplinary Fellows and NSF-STEM Scholars are also members of the Scholars Program and must adhere to these policies unless an explicit exception is made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seward Interdisciplinary Fellows</head><p>Director: scholarsdirector@union.edu The Seward Interdisciplinary Fellows Program gives students an opportunity to join the Union College Scholars Program in their sophomore year and develop their own program of study exploring connections among disciplines. The program is open to students from any discipline who have demonstrated excellence in their first year at Union College. Students apply for the Seward Fellows Program during the fall term of their sophomore year. Applicants must have at least a 3.5 grade point average at the time of application. Seward Fellows are required to design and implement a Seward Organizing Theme minor. Seward Fellows adhere to all requirements and policies of the Union College Scholars Program except that they do not have to take the first year courses associated with the Scholars Program (FPR 100H and SCH 150).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community-based learning</head><p>Community-based learning involves courses and study off campus that have a service learning or civic engagement component. Union College has developed many courses that offer students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they are learning in the classroom beyond Union's campus and in doing so both serve and learn from our community. Opportunities include experiences within the mini-term in New Orleans and the National Health Systems term abroad, along with courses in sociology, economics, modern languages, political science and engineering that have significant community service components. The Kenney Community Center offers many programs that provide students with community-based opportunities beyond the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study</head><p>With the approval of a professor, a student who has shown the requisite depth of interest and the necessary intellectual skills may register for an independent study course which will allow the student to research into a specific topic that is not offered through the Union course offering. The precise form of independent study projects varies with the student and the subject; the most common are research projects in the sciences and engineering, and substantial investigative papers of "thesis" caliber in the humanities and social sciences. Appropriate credit is granted for all independent study courses that are successfully completed. Independent study courses cannot be taken Pass/Fail. <ref type="bibr">Director: scholarsdirector@union.edu</ref> Students are eligible to receive academic credit for internship experiences that are substantial in nature (clerical and other types of routine work are not appropriate). Internships that take place within the context of a full-credit course can receive pay from the relevant employer. Internships undertaken outside the context of a full-credit course must be unpaid and should involve a minimum of 100 hours of work experience. Students requesting credit for an internship must apply for credit prior to beginning their internship. Students may receive credit for up to two internship experiences, but the second internship needs to be substantially different in nature from the first in order for credit to be granted. Students looking for help finding an internship should contact the Becker Career Center.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hudson-Mohawk Association Consortium (HMAC)</head><p>As a member of the Hudson-Mohawk Association of Colleges and Universities, Union participates in programs of cross-registration permitting students to take courses at other consortium colleges and universities.</p><p>Consortium cross-registrations are subject to several conditions. In general, students are advised to confer with the instructor of the course proposed to be taken, and they must fulfill the prerequisites set by the institution giving the course, including permission of the instructor if that is a normal condition for entering the course. Separate applications, obtainable from the registrar, must be completed for each course. When institutional calendars do not coincide, as will be the case in most instances, the individual student will be responsible for making the necessary accommodations, including food and lodging if the home institution is closed during the course. Cross-registering students will be expected to abide by all regulations, including attendance, parking, honor systems, and the like, at the host institution.</p><p>Cross-registrations will be approved only for courses not offered at the home institution; in general, they will be limited to a maximum of half the normal course load in any one term. Further, students must have their academic advisor's permission to cross-register for the course(s) in question. Cross-registration will be permitted only in courses that Union normally would consider for transfer credit. Please note: online courses are not eligible for cross-registration.</p><p>Through the consortium, Union students may enroll in Reserve Officer Training Corps programs of the Navy and Air Force at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, and in the Army ROTC program at Siena College, in Loudonville. The Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) are elective programs for students who desire commissions in the armed forces; ROTC courses do not carry credit toward Union College graduation, although the grades earned through these courses will be recorded on the Union transcript. The objective is to develop professional officers who have varied educational backgrounds in major fields of interest and have the professional knowledge and standard needed for future growth. Such ROTC students may be eligible for scholarships and other benefits available under two-and three-year programs of the several services. Interested students should contact the respective branches of ROTC. Students must work the scheduling of these courses around their course work at Union College.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing Across the Curriculum</head><p>The Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) program is designed to promote the development of students' writing and critical thinking skills. Every student will have opportunities to improve these skills by completing the following requirements:</p><p>1. First-Year Preceptorial 2. Sophomore Research Seminar 3. Five courses from at least two different academic divisions (refer to "Divisions" below) that have been certified as WAC courses 4. A Senior Writing Experience such as a senior thesis or a senior seminar paper. The First-Year Preceptorial and Sophomore Research Seminar, required of all students, focus on developing critical reading, analytic writing, and research skills. The WAC courses that fulfill the second requirement fall within the normal disciplinary offerings and provide students with feedback on their writing while incorporating writing as an important and clearly evaluated part of the coursework.</p><p>Courses currently certified by the College Writing Board as meeting WAC requirements are listed in the course schedule posted on-line each term. As courses and course syllabi frequently change, additional courses are certified each year by the College Writing Board and the roster of WAC courses changes over time.</p><p>The form of the senior writing experience that meets the third requirement is determined by the Writing Board and the student's major department(s). In most departments, this requirement is fulfilled by completing a thesis, another research project, or a senior seminar. Courses that satisfy this requirement are designated as WS courses. WAC: course certified by the Writing Board WS: fulfills senior writing requirement WAC/S: fulfills WAC or Senior Writing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Divisions</head><p>Departments of instruction are grouped into divisions as follows. For courses in interdisciplinary programs not listed below, students should consult with their advisor or with the Director of Interdisciplinary Studies. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Majors, Minors, and Other Programs</head><p>Departments and interdisciplinary programs are described below in alphabetical order. Please refer to the detailed sections on each area of study for more information. Requirements to fulfill a major or minor appear within each program or area of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Africana Studies</head><p>Director: Associate Professor D. Hill-Butler (Sociology) Faculty: Professor T. Meade (History); Associate Professors B. Peterson (History), K. Aslakson (History), C. Ndiaye (Modern Languages), T. Olsen (Music), Robert Hislope (Political Science), L. Cox (Visual Arts); K. Lynes (English); Senior Lecturers M. Lawson (History), J. Grigsby (Sociology)</p><p>Africana Studies offers a full major, an inter-departmental major and a minor involving the study of interdisciplinary connections of the history, culture, intellectual heritage, and social development of people of African descent. The program features a variety of approaches to intellectual, creative, and practical interests, and draws upon the arts, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences. Students align the current set of Africana Studies course offerings into three tracks: African, African-American and Latin American/Caribbean.</p><p>Each of the tracks can be utilized to pursue a 12-course full major, an 8-course ID major, or a 6-course minor. American Studies is an interdisciplinary field of concentration in the liberal arts relating to the United States as a geographical area and a cultural and political space. Drawing on courses from fourteen departments, students learn to move among and connect history, art, politics, religion, popular culture, literature and other features of American life. Students are encouraged to explore the diverse character of the American experience, shaped by gender, race, class, sexuality, geography and ethnicity, and to situate that experience in a context of global economic, cultural and political relationships. Students are asked, however, to develop a coherent approach to the study of American culture, politics and society, past and present. To accomplish these tasks, students in the American Studies program collaborate closely with an academic advisor to work out a thematic core around which to build a unique and innovative course of study that knits together the methods and perspectives of several disciplines. Themes may be centered on a specific era (e.g., antebellum America or the United States since the Cold War) or a topic (e.g., the emergence of mass culture or ethnicity and race in American life).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Africana Studies Approved Courses</head><p>The American Studies program offers an individualized program of study that allows each student to tailor his or her course work to personal interests and needs. There is no one way to complete the major or minor. A student is urged to meet with the Program Director as soon as he or she becomes interested in the program, preferably by the end of the sophomore year. Course planning forms can be found at the American Studies website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American Studies Approved Courses</head><p>The following courses, from fourteen different departments, have American Studies approval to count towards the major, ID major, and minor. Descriptions of the courses can be found in the Academic Register under the respective departments that offer them. Those marked with an asterisk (*) are American Studies approved courses that meet the race and ethnicity or gender requirement. Those marked with a pound sign (#) are American Studies approved courses that meet the pre-1900 requirement. Note that some American Studies approved courses require prerequisites, which can be found under the department course descriptions. New courses not listed may be granted American Studies approval as determined by the Program Director. All courses counted towards the major or minor must have American Studies course approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Selection Guidelines:</head><p>A student must meet with his or her American Studies academic advisor prior to registration. It should be noted that some courses, notably in English and Economics, require prerequisites, so a student needs to make plans early in his or her studies to complete these planning to take an upper-level course in these departments. A student must consult with the American Studies Program Director and the Registrar for approval of AP or IB credits for the major. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thematic Concentration</head><p>In consultation with his or her American Studies academic advisor, a student must complete five (5) courses of intensive study around a specific theme centered on either an era (such as antebellum America or the United States since the Cold War) or a topic (such as the emergence of mass culture or ethnicity and race in American life).</p><p>One of the five theme courses must come from Division I (Arts and Humanities) and one from Division II (Social Sciences). In addition, the thematic courses must come from at least three different departments. Every student must complete an American Studies course selection list with his or her American Studies advisor to determine which courses would best fit the chosen theme and to find out how often the courses are offered. All courses counted towards the major must have American Studies course approval.</p><p>The following are possible thematic concentrations for an American Studies major, interdepartmental major or minor (these are only suggestions; there are many more possibilities): </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements</head><p>During the junior year, a student must take an American Studies approved seminar or an upper level American Studies approved course that is a WAC. If possible, the course should be related to the student's thematic concentration. If not taken in the junior year, this course must be completed by the end of the student's first senior thesis term.</p><p>A student must take an additional two (2) American Studies approved courses, which can be at any level and may be outside the student's thematic concentration.</p><p>One of the thirteen (13) courses must cover issues of race and ethnicity or gender in America. One of the thirteen (13) courses must focus predominantly on the pre-1900 time period. At least four (4) of the 13 courses must be from Division I (Arts and Humanities), and at least four (4) from Division II (Social Sciences.) No course can double towards the student's minor if one is being pursued.</p><p>During the senior year, a student must complete a two-term written thesis or two-term senior project (AMS 498 &amp; AMS 499) related to his or her thematic concentration. If a student is completing a senior project in a non-text medium (such as audio, video, or multi-media), he or she must have a written component in the form of a journal that results in a final paper of at least fifteen pages, to fulfill the Writing Across the Curriculum (WS) requirement. A student will work with a primary, or first, thesis advisor and a second thesis advisor from a different department whom the student must consult early during the research portion of the project to better ensure the interdisciplinary focus of the thesis. Both thesis advisors will participate in the oral defense of the thesis at the completion of the project. A student must consult with the American Studies program director during the winter term of his or her junior year and submit a thesis proposal listing preferred first and second thesis advisors.</p></div>

First year engineering students also take three terms of calculus and two terms of physics (PHY 120 , PHY 121 ). There are different calculus sequences that can be taken based on the high school math background of the student; students take a placement exam in the summer before their first year to determine their calculus sequence. An Integrated Math/Physics sequence (IMP 120 , IMP 121 ) that roughly spans the content of MTH 115 , MTH 117 and PHY 120 , PHY 121 is an option for some first year students. Students are encouraged to choose an engineering major early in the first year since program curricula begin to diverge in the winter term; however, students do not need to declare their major until the spring term of the first year.</p><p>Engineering students complete the College's Common Curriculum requirements; details of these requirements can be found in the Common Curriculum section of the Academic Register. Students are strongly encouraged to satisfy the Common Curriculum linguistic and cultural competency requirement by going abroad; they may go on any of the terms abroad listed in the International Programs section of the Academic Register by notifying their academic advisor early of their interest in a particular program and working closely with their advisor on course selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineering Science Courses</head><p>Courses listed in this section are general engineering courses common to more than one program. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Selection Guidelines</head><p>Placement: Unless they have scored a 5 on the AP English Literature or AP English Language test (see below), incoming students should enroll in EGL 100 , EGL 101 , or EGL 102 ; alternatively, they may choose to take a non-writing-intensive EGL course numbered 0-99 (see below, "courses Suitable for Non-Majors").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scores of "5" on AP English Exams:</head><p>The English department recognizes an AP score of 5 as sufficient preparation for study at the intermediate (200-) level; therefore, any students with this test score may choose to enroll at the 200-level in English without the 100-level prerequisite. Note: English majors and minors cannot, however, use this AP credit to reduce the number of courses taken to fulfill major or minor requirements. English majors with an AP 5 still need 12 courses (7 for minors/ 8 for IDs). With AP credit specifically offsetting a 100-level prerequisite, the number of required 100-levels is reduced to one for majors, and zero for minors and IDs; therefore, de facto, majors and minors and IDs with an AP 5 get to take an extra elective.</p><p>Currently at Union College, a grade of 4 or 5 on an AP English Literature or AP English Language test earns an unspecified course credit that may be counted toward graduation. However, all students still must fulfill the requirements of the Common Curriculum. AP credit does not fulfill or substitute for HUL or WAC requirements; students with AP 5s may choose to fulfill these requirements in English with an intermediate (200-) level EGL course instead of a 100-level course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Courses Suitable for Non-Majors:</head><p>The English department occasionally offers Common Curriculum courses, intended for non-majors. These courses have numbers between 0 and 99, and are lecture-plus-exam courses rather than writing-intensive courses; however, they do carry HUL credit. Any student is welcome to enroll in a 100-level course after taking a course numbered 0-99, but there is no prerequisite for any 100-level course. Note: Common Curriculum courses do not count towards the English major, ID major or minor.</p><p>Non-majors and majors alike are welcome to enroll in EGL 100, EGL 101, or EGL 102, which are suitable for non-majors. Only majors should take more than one intro-level course. EGL 100 and 102 are petition courses due to high demand.</p><p>Any student who has completed EGL 100 , EGL 101 , or EGL 102 has the prerequisite and should then enroll in any 200-level EGL course (see also AP 5 information above). All 200-level courses are equal in difficulty. 300-and 400-level EGL seminars are by petition; they are intended mainly for majors, IDs and minors, who will be given priority in enrollment. Depending upon demand, some seats may be available for non-majors (at the discretion of the instructor).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisites:</head><p> EGL 100, EGL 101, or EGL 102 is a prerequisite for any 200-level course. (See AP5 information above)  To enroll in a 300-level EGL course, a student must have taken either EGL 100, EGL 101, or EGL 102 and two 200-level EGL courses for a total of at least three English courses.</p><p> To enroll in a 400-level EGL course, a student must have taken two introductory courses (selecting from EGL 100, EGL 101, and EGL 102) and four 200-level EGL courses for a total of at least six English courses.</p><p>Enrollment Limits: Enrollment limits for the categories of courses are as follows: Click through below for specific information about major, minor, ID and Honors requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English, B.A.</head><p>Requirements for the Major:</p><p>The English major requires twelve courses: two introductory, seven intermediate, and three advanced. The English major does not require a senior thesis, except for those applying for Honors (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two Introductory Courses chosen from the following:</head><p> EGL 100 -Introduction to the Study of Literature: Poetry  EGL 101 -Introduction to the Study of Literature: Fiction  EGL 102 -Introduction to the Study of Literature: Drama Note: These three courses emphasize close reading of primary texts and help students acquire the vocabulary to speak and write clearly and intelligently about literature. The texts are chosen by the instructor of each section.</p><p>Detailed descriptions of the various sections of EGL 100, EGL 101, and EGL 102 are available in print in the English department office the week before pre-enrollment each term and on the English Department website.</p><p>Majors must complete their second Introductory Course no later than the winter term of their junior year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seven Intermediate Courses:</head><p>At least one Introductory Course is a prerequisite to courses at the Intermediate level (see exception for students who received a 5 on their AP exam in either English language or literature). In this group, majors must complete the following required courses: The pre-1700 and the Shakespeare requirements must be fulfilled with two separate courses. A second Shakespeare course may count as an elective, but this practice does not substitute for a pre-1700 course.</p><p>One course on eighteenth to nineteenth-century literature (216-236): Advanced courses, or Junior and Senior Seminars, are writing intensive and research oriented. Majors must complete three advanced courses, including one Junior and one Senior Seminar, and a third seminar of choice. Students must take at least two Intermediate Courses before enrolling in a Junior Seminar. Students must take at least four Intermediate Courses and both Introductory Courses before enrolling in a Senior Seminar. Students are strongly advised to take Junior Seminar before enrolling in a Senior Seminar. Requirements for English Honors: Thesis (402-3):</p><p>Fourteen courses are required for honors, which includes the usual twelve plus a two-term honors thesis seminar, EGL 402 and EGL 403. The twoterm thesis does not replace the required senior seminar. Other qualifications to be eligible to apply to write an honors thesis include a 3.3 GPA both cumulatively and in the English major; the Literary Theory seminar; an accepted proposal (submitted during fourth week of Spring Term, students' junior year). See the English Department website for a more complete description.</p><p>In this seminar, students are expected to learn research methods, discuss their subjects and approaches to them, and share ideas and writing, as they work toward completing their individual theses under the direction of the seminar instructor. Prospective Honors thesis writers are required to take the Literary Theory Seminar EGL 302 in Winter of their Junior year, prior to applying to write a thesis, whether proposing a creative or an analytical thesis. Students proposing creative theses are strongly encouraged to have already participated in a creative writing workshop in the proposed genre. Interested students should discuss possible thesis subjects with their advisor and other departmental members in order to develop an appropriate thesis topic. Prospective Honors students are required to submit a two-to three-page thesis proposal and writing sample in Spring of their junior year, for review by the department's Honors selection committee.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entrepreneurship</head><p>Courses in a variety of departments at Union examine ways in which entrepreneurs think and act. As students identify how people, in many times and places, have succeeded in attaining their visions for change, they will develop an ability to do the same themselves. In addition to department-based courses, several interdisciplinary courses described below provide multidisciplinary approaches to skills including critical analysis and communication that will enable students to put their own ideas and inspiration into action in their chosen fields and areas of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entrepreneurial Courses</head><p>Visual Arts The Environmental Science, Policy and Engineering (ESPE) program is focused on students with an interest in the science and policy behind the myriad environmental problems that face our world, the political policy mechanisms that may provide solutions to these issues, and the interface between the environment and the human condition. Students in the ESPE program choose either a BS degree in Environmental Science or a BA degree in Environmental Policy. The BS degree emphasizes the biological, chemical, and geological sciences, as well as physics and engineering, while the BA degree emphasizes the social sciences and humanities. A common set of core courses links the two programs. All students take a common introductory course, a core of 8-11 required courses, and 4-6 courses that define an area of concentration. During the senior year, students typically complete two terms of independent research, and participate in a common ESPE senior seminar.</p></div>

Ethics Across the Curriculum, funded by alumnus Michael Rapaport ('59), is a college-wide initiative that provides support for faculty to incorporate teaching about everyday ethics into their course curricula. Everyday ethics is about integrity and cheating, honesty and dishonesty, justice and injustice. Courses incorporating an Ethics Across the Curriculum segment help students learn what everyday ethics is and how its principles are incorporated into many disciplines that deal with substantive issues other than ethics, such as anthropology, chemistry, engineering, and literature. The Film Studies Minor develops a conscious awareness of film as a basic and widespread medium of cultural communication. The Film Studies Minor provides students with the critical tools necessary for analyzing and evaluating film texts, and for beginning to understand film technologies. It prepares students to pursue academic and/or creative paths for advanced study and/or professional interests in film.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11"> REE 300T -Internship (Irkutsk, Russia)*  SOC 387T -Community Service Miniterm  TAB 321T -Buenos Aires Mini-Term *  TAB 333T -New Zealand Mini-Term  TAB 344T -Egypt Mini-</formula></div>

Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies (GSWS) is an interdisciplinary program that includes a wide variety of courses offered in arts and humanities and social sciences. Offering a critical perspective that places gender at the center of analysis, GSWS reexamines traditional beliefs, supports new research methods, explores feminist and queer theories, and enables students to better understand the societal positions and global processes affecting all genders throughout the world. GSWS courses probe the way cultures construct concepts of gender and sexuality, introducing students to differences of class, race, ethnicity, and life cycle in a range of societies. Students are encouraged to become aware of intersectionality and unexamined assumptions about sexual and gender differences. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary Studies</head><p>Interdisciplinarity creates educational opportunities through combining two or more academic disciplines. Indeed, often boundaries are pushed and new discoveries made at the margins of established field and research methods. Union College recognizes the rich possibilities of interdisciplinary studies by offering many opportunities for both faculty and students to engage with multiple disciplines -and each other -in collaborative classroom settings, innovative majors and unique research initiatives.</p><p>Vibrant interdisciplinary studies (IS) can be pursued through a variety of designated degree programs at Union College. Students are able to major and/or minor in our many Interdisciplinary Studies Programs (ISP) in wide ranging topics from Film Studies to Neuroscience.</p><p>In addition, we offer the following interdisciplinary courses, listed below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Full Terms</head><p>Except for those programs listed below, the base cost of a full term abroad is one-third of Union's comprehensive fee, which may differ from the fees of program providers. The College charges an additional fee of $650 for each faculty-led term abroad to cover several guided study excursions to enhance the cultural and academic experience, as well as mandated health insurance. Students are responsible for coordinating and paying for their own airfare and visa fees (if a visa is necessary). With the exception of work-study, all financial aid a student receives applies to the study abroad program.</p><p> The cost of the engineering exchange in the Czech Republic and the term abroad in Japan is one third of the annual comprehensive fee.</p><p>There are no group excursions in these programs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Union College International Programs (Study Away) Withdrawal Policy</head><p>The success of study away programs from the Union campus requires student commitment well in advance of the anticipated dates of the term of study. When a student withdraws after having made a commitment to such a program, it may be too late to offer the spot to another student who was willing and able to participate. Also, Union College incurs expenses well before a program begins that cannot be recovered when students withdraw. In the case of mini-terms, withdrawals can jeopardize the viability of the program. The International Programs Withdrawal Policy is designed to prompt students to consider their commitment to the program to which they have applied in light of the financial consequences of withdrawal. This policy applies to all Union-and non-Union study away programs, including mini-terms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal Fee</head><p>Unless one of the exceptions listed below applies, a student who withdraws from participation in a program or is no longer allowed to participate because of Union College disciplinary sanctions will be charged a withdrawal fee, which is based on the date of official withdrawal, as indicated in the table below. Official withdrawal occurs when a student informs the International Programs office of the withdrawal in writing or the International Programs office informs the student of his or her ineligibility to participate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When Official Withdrawal Occurs: Withdrawal Fee:</head><p>Up to 60 days before program start date $350 59-31 days before the start* $2500 30 days before the start* $3500 (mini-term), $4000 (all other programs)</p><p>During the program $3500 (mini-term), $5000 (all other programs) *If a student withdraws 1-59 days before the start of a program, Union College will make a good faith effort to replace the student with another qualified student or to obtain a refund from its overseas providers; the withdrawal fee will not apply if a replacement student is found or to the extent that the College obtains a refund.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exceptions to Withdrawal Fee:</head><p>Students will not be charged the withdrawal fee if any of the following occurs:</p><p> Student withdraws from Union College for medical reasons during the program in accordance with Union College's medical withdrawal policy.</p><p> A documented medical situation occurs before the start of the program that prevents the student from participating in the program.  Student becomes ineligible to participate because of insufficient overall GPA.  A student becomes ineligible to participate if, in spite of following the proper procedures in a timely manner, the student was denied a visa by the host country.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy on Travel Restrictions for International Programs</head><p>Union College does not operate or direct study abroad programs, including independent study abroad projects, for any student in a country for which a U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory of Level 3 or 4 is in force or U.S. economic sanctions are in effect. Union College students may apply through the International Programs office for a "non-Union" program in a Travel Advisory 3 or 4 country that is wholly operated and directed by a college or educational agency other than Union College.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Abroad Programs</head><p>The most extensive of the College's formal arrangements for foreign study are the term-length study abroad programs. Most programs involve credit in Common Curriculum (General Education) and language study, as well as regular course credit for additional study performed abroad. Currently, terms abroad are offered through a variety of programs designed by Union College faculty. The College is also part of the New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium and the Partnership for Global Education. The New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium broadens off campus study opportunities to Union students through pre-approved programs offered by New York Six member schools (i.e. Colgate University, Hamilton College, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, St. Lawrence University, Skidmore College, and Union College). The Partnership for Global Education is, a consortium with Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges, whereby students can study abroad in Australia, Brazil, Ireland and Vietnam.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, students take three courses while on a term abroad; normally, these are the official program courses, unless the Director of International Programs grants permission to substitute one non-program course. Please consult the Common Curriculum (General Education) section on how international programs relate to various requirements.</p><p>The following study abroad programs are offered at Union College and include three courses, unless otherwise indicated: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exchanges</head><p>The College has five formal exchange programs: Please note that our office stays in constant communication with the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, and will cancel any program with a travel advisory or level 3 or 4 issued by our government.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Union Study Abroad</head><p>Non-Union Study Abroad programs allow students who are primarily juniors the opportunity to participate in study abroad programs through other colleges and universities, provided that the program addresses a curricular need that cannot be met by a Union program. Normally these programs take place in countries where Union does not have an existing term abroad or exchange program.</p><p>Detailed proposals for non-Union programs must be submitted no later than the third week of spring term the year prior to the time when the study abroad would take place. Students should refer to the International Programs website for deadlines. The Liaison Committee on Study Abroad approves non-Union proposals. The student must demonstrate readiness and preparation to undertake the proposed course of study and provide details of a feasible plan of study that is well-integrated with the student's academic work at Union. There are two options for non-Union study abroad programs: winter/spring non-union study abroad and the full year William Cady Stone Fellowship.</p><p>The more common non-Union study abroad option, this opportunity takes place during winter and spring terms with the student enrolling in Spring semester course offerings from other colleges and universities.</p><p>Non-Union programs are generally semester programs that give credit for four or five courses. Students who fall behind in credits as a direct result of participating in a non-Union program during Winter and Spring terms will have to complete the additional credits (to total six) through any of the following methods:</p><p> If the host institution for the program will allow a fifth course for an additional fee, Union will pay that fee.</p><p> If a student is ahead in credits, then he/she may count one or two of these credits toward graduation at no cost.  The student may take one or two fourth courses without charge upon returning to Union.  Students may take one or two summer school courses, whether at Union or another institution. Union will pay tuition for the course, but not room and board. Courses cannot be taken at a community college unless approved by the Dean of Studies.</p><p> Students who meet the eligibility requirements may apply to a Union mini-term, and if accepted, the mini-term fee is waived.</p><p>Additional options to obtain the required number of credits may be discussed with the Dean of Studies. If progress toward a degree is not affected by participation in a non-Union program during Winter and Spring terms and the student does not fall behind in credits toward the degree, then the above options are not available.</p></div>

Projects Abroad is Union's partner organization and arranges the internships and host families for Union. Additional information can be obtained from the International Programs office and on its website.</p><p>All program costs are covered by the Klemm Fellow International Internship Program, except for incidentals and informal weekend excursions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Study Abroad</head><p>The Independent Study Abroad Program allows one Union College student per academic year to study abroad at an international college, university, or institute during his/her junior or senior year. The proposed program of study must meet a curricular need that cannot be met by a Union or Non-Union term abroad; it must also take place in a location that cannot be covered by a Union or Non-Union term abroad.. A student applying for an ISA must directly enroll in an international college, university or institute. The ISA student must enroll in one or two courses at a university, college or institute in the host country (the equivalent of three courses per term). A student may also arrange with a Union College faculty member to do a course or courses (depending on total number of courses taken) as an approved independent study, research project, service-learning project or internship. The student must identify a Union College faculty member who has agreed to supervise and grade the academic work and to serve as a resource for the student while on the ISA.</p><p>An ISA must take place during the winter and/or spring term.

Mini-terms have been offered in Argentina, Bali, China, Egypt, England, Ethiopia, France, India, New Zealand, Senegal, South Africa, Spain, and domestic locations such as New Hampshire, New Orleans (Community Engagement), on the Mexican-American border and a Civil Rights Public History program in the South. Mini-terms carry an additional tuition charge. They cannot be combined with two courses in another term as one term's tuition. The course credit earned can be used to get caught up if the student is behind in credits; otherwise, the course credit earned will be above and beyond those used for graduation. It cannot be combined with other credits to graduate early.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Law and Humanities Minor</head><p>The Law and Humanities minor is designed for students considering law school. Satisfying the requirements for the minor would ensure that students have a deep understanding of the foundations of legal systems in general. Moreover, the minor provides students with the unusual opportunity to learn about law from multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives which highlight the rich and varied ways in which the law interacts with the liberal arts and humanistic disciplines. Many of the courses that count for the minor are courses that highlight the connections between law and other disciplines, such as classics, philosophy, political science, and religious studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Minor:</head><p>Six of the following courses, at least three of which are in the Humanities. The Union College-Albany Law School combined program allows students to complete a full Union B.S. or B.A. degree in three years and subsequently progress to Albany Law School. The program provides opportunities to earn undergraduate credit through law-related internships and participate as undergraduates in Albany Law School activities designed for combined degree program students. Students in this program, who will be known as Law Scholars, will be admitted to Albany Law School early (upon admission to Union) with entry to law school contingent on their undergraduate GPA, but not their LSAT score. Students are still required to take the LSAT prior to matriculation at Albany Law School, with high scores providing access to scholarship opportunities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3+3 Accelerated Law Program</head><p>Notes:</p><p>• Applications accepted for first-year fall term enrollment at Union College with a cap of 20 students at any one time at Union.</p><p>• SAT or ACT scores will be required as part of the application.</p><p>• Students accepted to the program will be offered a spot in the Law Scholars Program, which like the Union Scholars program, includes the ability to take a fourth course free of charge each term and to take Scholars FYP and SRS courses. Unlike the Union Scholars, the Law Scholars will graduate from Union with 36 credits rather than 38.</p><p>• Students will be encouraged to earn their Union B.A. or B.S. in 3 years, through a combination of their coursework over this time, any advanced credit from their high school experience, the use of the aforementioned fourth courses, and summer courses (up to three pre-approved courses can be taken at colleges other than Union.) Students will stay in the program by maintaining a 3.4 GPA. Students have the option of spending four years at Union, should they choose to do so.</p><p>• Students will be encouraged to contact Albany Law School to be assisted with obtaining at least one summer internship after their first, second or third year. Academic credit will be an option for the internship(s) with an additional fee.</p><p>• Students will begin their law degree coursework as soon as they have completed their Union College degree requirements.</p><p>• Students will take their LSAT during their third year at Union. Continuing to Albany Law School will not be contingent on the score, though a student's merit scholarship to Albany Law School will be contingent on academic criteria, which includes the LSAT score. The curriculum at Union stresses thorough preparation in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. When combined with coursework in health care management at Clarkson University, students are provided with a breadth of knowledge and understanding not typically found in premedical programs. Each year, about 15 highly-qualified secondary school seniors are enrolled in the program.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership in Medicine/Healthcare Management, B.S.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Program Requirements:</head><p>Over four full 3-term academic years and one summer (two for students who opt for the M.B.A.), students take 31-32 courses that count towards a B.S. degree at Union College (roughly half in the sciences and half in the social sciences and humanities) and another 10 graduate courses at Clarkson University -Capital Region Campus to earn an M.S. degree in Healthcare Management or 14 graduate courses to earn the M.B.A. degree in Healthcare Management (Note: 10 of the courses count toward either graduate degree.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Important curricular requirements include:</head><p> An interdepartmental major, one part of which is in the natural sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Math, Physics) and the other part of which is in the social sciences (including Psychology) or humanities;</p><p> An international experience  The program in healthcare management through the School of Business at Clarkson University (either the M.S. or the M.B.A.).  Independent Study, Independent Research, Special Projects (usually numbered 400+) cannot be substituted for LIM Math/Science coursework. However, students may complete a thesis in their non-Math/Science ID major.</p><p>All students enrolled in the program will take a minimum of 16 Union College Math/Science courses. Without AP credits, students usually take the following:  In addition, students must take 15 Social Science and Humanities courses including:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16"></formula><p>LRS 150, Statistics*, HC 630, HC 633, three non-science electives, plus 8 additional courses to fulfill an ID major in Social Sciences or Humanities. LIM students are not required to complete the full Common Curriculum (General Education), the sophomore research seminar, or Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) requirements unless they leave the program. Students must complete a minimum of 15 social science and humanities courses.</p><p>*The LIM statistics requirement usually is met with AP statistics credit, in which case students replace the statistics course with a humanities or social science elective. Some social science departments have a designated statistics course that is required for majors. If the second major requires a statistics course, students should take that course. Otherwise, students may choose from the following courses: STA 501, ECO 243 , SOC 300 , PSC 220 , PSY 200 , or STA 104 . PLEASE NOTE: STA 104 counts as a social science course, not as a math course. MBA in Healthcare Management students will take the following additional 4 courses: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Placement</head><p>Students who enter the program with advanced placement credit have greater flexibility of course selection, but AP credits do not reduce the number of required courses or allow a student to take a term off. Students must compete a minimum of 16 math/science and 15 humanities/social science courses. When advanced placement credit is given for a course specifically designated in the curriculum, students can take elective courses. Union will grant advanced placement and course credit in accordance with its normal procedures. Student with scores of 4 or 5 on the AP examinations in biology, chemistry or physics or on either of the AP Calculus exams are encouraged to take more advanced courses at the College. Other AP courses will be considered such as Statistics or a course in the second major.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements</head><p>Students must maintain minimum cumulative grade point averages of 3.50 both in overall course work (including graduate courses) and in their mathematics and science courses. Students falling below the required overall and mathematics/science grade point averages at the end of any term may be put on formal probation or asked to leave the program by the Policy and Promotions Committee, which oversees the program and reviews student records regularly. A grade of "D" or "F" in any course will most likely lead to dismissal from the program.</p><p>Required course work may not be taken on a pass/fail basis and must normally be taken at the home institution. Students may take a science course pass/fail after all science and math program requirements are completed. Students may take one social science or humanities elective pass/fail, however, it cannot be a course required for the ID major. Grades of "I" (Incomplete) or "W" (withdrawal) will not be acceptable without justification involving illness or extenuating circumstances.</p><p>As long as a student is enrolled in the Leadership in Medicine program, the Health Professions Advisory Committee at Union College will not support his or her application to other medical schools. Students may transfer into the regular four-year undergraduate program at any time during the premedical portion of the combined degree programs. Once withdrawn from the eight-year combined degree program, students may request the support of the Health Professions Advisory Committee if they choose to apply to medical school in the traditional manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Honors:</head><p>Leadership in Medicine students are not subject to the restrictions for ID majors and may receive departmental honors in one department if they satisfy the requirements of that major. The thesis does not need to integrate both majors as it must for non-program students. </p></div>

There is no fee for participation in the ensembles; music lessons are paid for separately on an individual basis. To gain transcript recognition for participation in these activities, students must register with the registrar early in the term and achieve a passing grade from the teacher, director, or conductor. Requests to register for practicum transcript recognition after the drop-add period will not be honored. Each full music credit is accumulated from three previous passing grades in the same practicum (AMU 010, AMU 012, AMU 014, AMU 015, AMU 017, or AMU 018). There are no limits on how many practicum courses can appear on the student's transcript. However, at most two of these credits can be used towards graduation. Full music majors and ID majors must accumulate at least two years of practicum credit (in one (or more) faculty-led ensemble(s); music majors and minors must accumulate at least one year of practicum credit in a faculty-led ensemble.</p></div>

Neuroscience focuses on the relationships among brain function, information processing, and behavior. Researchers in this field come from widely disparate backgrounds, including cognitive psychology, clinical neuropsychology, neuroimaging, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, neuroethology, biopsychology, physiology, neurology, psychiatry, philosophy, and computer science. Thus, research questions are considered from many different levels, and many different converging methodologies are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuroscience, B.S.</head><p>The neuroscience major consists of three tracks: The Bioscience track, the Cognitive track, and the Computational track.</p><p> The Bioscience track focuses on the biological basis of neural development, function, and plasticity. Students will develop an understanding of the nervous system and its role in cognition, perception, and action at the molecular, cellular, and systems level.</p><p> The Cognitive track provides students with an understanding of how neural networks and brain mechanisms give rise to specific mental processes and behavior. Students begin with the processes that have been traditionally studied in the area of cognitive psychology, but can tailor the program to include phenomena that are traditionally studied in developmental or clinical psychology as well.</p><p> The Computational track focuses on issues related to developing computational models of neuronal and mental processes. Students will develop an understanding of artificial intelligence that uses biologically plausible methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for the Major:</head><p>The neuroscience major consists of four parts: (1) a core of required courses that all majors must take; (2) required courses in one of three tracksbioscience, cognitive, or computational; (3) a general elective; (4) a senior writing requirement. Unless noted below, course descriptions are listed under their home departments. It is not possible to be an interdepartmental major in Neuroscience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Honors:</head><p>In addition to meeting college-wide requirements, honors in Neuroscience requires: (1) a minimum grade point average of 3.30 in the major (including thesis grades, but not including the CHM or MTH cognate courses listed in #2 above); (2) a minimum of three grades of A or A-in the required courses for all majors (see #1 above); (3) satisfactory completion of a senior thesis with a minimum grade of A-; (4) presentation of the student's work, usually at the Steinmetz Symposium. Any non-adjunct professor or lecturer in the Psychology, Biology, or Computer Science departments may advise a senior thesis; faculty members not in those departments must be affiliated with the Neuroscience program in order to advise senior theses. Adjunct faculty members may only advise theses with explicit approval of the Neuroscience program director(s). However, to do a thesis advised by a faculty member not affiliated with the Neuroscience program, students must receive permission from the program director(s) in advance. Students are advised to start the process of finding a thesis topic and advisor as early in the junior year as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Selection Guidelines for the Neuroscience Major:</head><p>It is recommended that students in this major start with BIO 103, BIO 104, and PSY 210 as these courses are prerequisites for Neuroscience students to take the neuroscience-related courses in the Psychology department without taking PSY 100 (Introduction to Psychology), which does not count toward the Neuroscience major. After completing PSY 210, Neuroscience students may take other Psychology courses without first completing PSY 100. Students are strongly encouraged to take <ref type="bibr">PSY 200,</ref><ref type="bibr">PSY 210,</ref><ref type="bibr">BIO 205 ,</ref><ref type="bibr">BIO 242 and CSC 106 (or CSC 103)</ref> as early as possible, preferably in the sophomore year. CSC 106 is preferred over CSC 103, but both satisfy the same requirement. Students are also advised to take CHM 101 prior to taking BIO 205 . Although not required, it is typical that Cognitive Track majors take senior seminars in the Psychology department, and Bioscience Track majors take senior seminars in the Biology department. Normally, courses taken outside of Union College will not be counted toward the major. However, exceptions can be made under extenuating circumstances on an ad-hoc basis. To receive Neuroscience credit for courses taken elsewhere, students must contact the program director(s) to request permission, and the courses must match a Union course or have similar neuroscience content to Union courses that do receive credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuroscience Minor</head><p>Due to significant curricular overlap, Biology or Psychology majors are not allowed to minor in Neuroscience. Similarly, Neuroscience majors are not allowed to minor in Biology. They may be allowed to minor in Psychology but only under these conditions:</p><p>A. Psychology chair approval B. All requirements must be fulfilled (including PSY100, which is otherwise not required of NS majors) C. No credits used to satisfy NS requirements may be used to satisfy Psychology requirements (i.e., no double-counting).</p><p>For all other majors interested in minoring in Neuroscience: BIO 242-Neurobiology is required in addition to four courses selected from the list below. These courses must be from three different departments. For Computer Science majors, only one of these courses can be double counted. The Organizing Theme Major is best suited for the self-motivated student who has a well-defined intellectual curiosity for a topic involving multiple disciplines and which cannot be accommodated by the already existing majors, double majors, or interdepartmental majors at Union College. The Organizing Theme Major encourages the exploration of thematically related connections across disciplines, and therefore must incorporate courses from at least three different departments, with no more than four courses from any one department to count toward the major. The student must choose and work with an advisor (or advisors) who is supportive of the student's proposed Organizing Theme Major and has a clear understanding of what the project entails.</p></div>

Rehearsal and Production will be held winter term and entails participation in the Winter Dance Concert series. To gain transcript recognition for dance technique classes, students must register no later than the two-week add/drop period, and achieve a passing grade from the faculty instructor. Requests to register for practicum transcript recognition after the add-drop period will not be honored. If a student registers for more than one dance practicum class during a single term in a given academic year, only one will count towards the three course sequence, which is required to earn one course credit. During the senior year, students may request up to two full dance practicum credits towards graduation. Such requests are made to the registrar during the senior year transcript audit (or its equivalent for those who plan to graduate early). Each full dance practicum credit is accumulated from three previous passing grades (any combination of theater and dance practicum). No more than two such graduation credits are available, whatever the discipline (music, theater, or dance).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Requirements</head><p>Most majors will do either a two-term senior honors project (AVA 498 -AVA 499) leading to a solo exhibition in the spring term, or a one-term independent senior studio project (with an optional exhibition). These comprise in-depth study in a studio discipline in the senior year. A senior honors project takes the form of a two-term independent study focusing on the student's particular area of interest in the visual arts during consecutive terms (first term, 498, pass/fail; second term, 499, with an overall grade for both terms). Visual arts majors who do not pursue a senior honors project may satisfy the WS requirement either through an art history senior seminar designated WS (for studio concentrators who have the necessary prerequisites in art history) or by obtaining a faculty sponsor for a one-term independent senior studio project with the required WS component.</p></div>

This course will seek to answer this question by exploring the relationships between race, public institutions, economic change and inequality within American society. In doing so, the course will examine the theoretical and practical dimensions of anthropology's engagement with poverty. We will begin by examining theoretical approaches for understanding the persistence of poverty in the United States, as well as the major policy frameworks that seek to reduce poverty. In addition, the course will cover anthropological critiques of these approaches and anthropological accounts of the everyday realities and struggles of poor people. Students will do internships in local organizations dealing with poverty and will use this experience to reflect on larger debates. CC: LCC</p></div>

Lectures and readings will use case materials drawn from North America, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Europe to explore theories about how language is shaped by, and in turn shapes, culture and social relations. We will start by looking at the influence of linguistic categories on the way we view the world around us. We will look at color terminology, racial and ethnic categories, pronoun use, and differences in vocabulary used to talk about men and women. Next, we will turn to cultural differences in communicative behavior. We will examine theories that suggest that males and females, and members of various ethnic groups, use language differently in everyday social interaction. These differences in communicative strategies lead to systematic miscommunication and perpetuate stereotypes. We will then turn to the ways changes in communicative technologies such as the internet and cellphones change social relations. Finally, we will explore the ways that language reflects and supports social class, and the patterning of language use in multilingual nations. CC: LCC</p></div>

How do diverse social, cultural and historical contexts shape the workings of law? This course introduces students to a series of critical perspectives about what law is and how it contours the fabric of everyday life.. Students will learn how key legal issues such as dispute management, decision-making, and reconciliation are actualized in different settings. The ultimate goal of the class is to equip students with the tools to critically evaluate legal processes in multicultural and plural societies. The course begins with a consideration of customary practices and conflict resolution in non-Western societies and then looks at how anthropology helps us to understand law in contemporary societies CC: LCC</p></div>

Lectures and readings will use case materials drawn from North America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, and Asia to explore ways in which culture affects how parents deal with children. We will also examine the acquisition of culture by young children. We will look closely at ways in which different cultural practices shape the experience of childhood from infancy to adolescence. Topics addressed will include: beliefs about infants, language acquisition, cultural differences in theories about learning, the nature of schools in various cultures, the role of play and mass media in shaping children, the cultural shaping of gender identity, and adolescent initiation rites. CC: LCC ANT 223 -Multiculturalism: Race, Religion, and the Nation-State Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Cultural diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, and religion is the focus of a great deal of controversy in many nations. This class examines the politics surrounding cultural difference in nation-states and the paradoxes of "multiculturalism," a popular strategy that on the one hand, validates cultural difference, and on the other hand, can be seen as reinforcing divisions and barriers. Does multiculturalism benefit racial, ethnic and religious minorities or does it construct barriers to equal opportunity? How can we get beyond multiculturalism to appreciate the benefits of cultural diversity? CC: LCC</p></div>

The course will consider such as issues as: 1) the relationship between schools and ethnic and national identity; how do educational systems attempt to construct national identities? Do they succeed? How are ethnic divisions reinforced or mediated by educational systems? 2) the relationship between imported international educational models and local cultures: how do the assumptions embedded in imported educational models conflict with local understandings about authority, knowledge, and society? 3) the ways that cultural assumptions are implicit in classroom routines; how can we analyze classroom routines to reveal the "hidden curriculum" of assumptions about knowledge, authority, and the qualities needed to be a good and successful person. Students will conduct participant observation in a local school, will read and discuss works on education and society and will analyze local schools in papers. CC: LCC</p></div>

What kinds of responses are emerging to problems of law, order, and public security in the Americas? How are these responses reshaping our societies? To what extent is the current situation the legacy of failed security policies? What is the role of the police and policing in all of this? This class adopts an anthropological perspective on the practice of policing. It looks at policing as the production of law and order-not just by local cops on the beat but also by actors involved in national and international security. The focus is on the Western Hemisphere and the influence of the United States on the ideals, institutions, and practices of policing. Key topics include: immigration, incarceration, deportation, frontiers, the movement of licit and illicit goods, democratic rights, and the regional impact of U.S. security initiatives including the Cold War, the War on Drugs, and the War on Terrorism. These topics will be grounded in studies of policing and police reform in the United States, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico. By the end of the semester, students will have a working knowledge of critical issues in contemporary policing as well as the legal, socio-cultural, and economic factors behind the emerging models of police in the Americas..

When is it an imperative and when is it an option? What considerations arise when the subject of assistance is in another country, a member of a different religion, or another culture? This course draws upon global case studies of humanitarian intervention in order to encourage students to engage critically with the complexity of what seems like an unequivocal good: humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid plays a significant role in today's society, from the United States' recent and very complex engagement with the Ebola outbreak to aid that is dispensed as part of disaster relief. This course explores the ethics and politics of humanitarianism in global perspective. It addresses the cultural specificity of global humanitarian aid and the ways that humanitarianism has been theorized historically. This course examines the growing debate over the philosophical, moral, political, cultural and operational practices of such interventions. CC: LCC</p></div>

We will firmly situate perspectives and approaches to health and illness within a broad sociocultural and historical context, also helping to challenge stereotypes associated with the continent. By cultivating a deeper knowledge of how African communities perceive and treat afflictions as well as international responses to health crises (e.g. Ebola), we will develop a cross-cultural perspective that expands our understanding of global, as well as local, health and healing.

The 18th St. Gang (M-18). Latin Kings. The names have become synonymous with senseless violence. Both feared and fetishized, the street gang became a focal point of urban politics in the United Staves and Latin America during the late twentieth century. Beginning with the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s, young, poor, minorities have found themselves at the center of a socio-economic crisis that has ben accompanied by the rise of zero-tolerance policing. For the purposes of this class, the youth gang phenomenon will serve as a window in to the experience of racial, ethnic and economic marginalization under late capitalism. We will explore the context that gives rise to gang violence through a combination of anthropological, sociological, and historical approaches. By the end of the quarter, students will be familiar with the macro-social factors that shape both gangs and the politics of urban violence in the Americans. CC: LCC</p></div>

It asks questions such as: How does culture shape our perception of nature? What can conflicts over environmental protection, natural resources and human manipulations of natural materials tell us about contemporary societies? What does it mean to call an issue "political" or "cultural," versus "scientific" or "technical"? Students will develop the critical analysis skills to examine the natural world as a site of cultural politics, using anthropological concepts to examine environmentalism in diverse geographical and historical settings, including the Amazon, the Niger Delta, the suburban mall, and the Union campus.

Do all people everywhere seek to accumulate property, and to maximize profits? Is "rationality" the same in every culture? Do all think the same way about debt, bribery, gambling or marriage payments? Do human economies evolve inexorably-for example, from public to private property, from cowrie shells to electronic money, or from gifts and barter to sale and credit? Or is the picture more complex and the direction inconstant? Is there really any such thing as a "free" gift? What does The Godfather have to do with the exchange of necklaces and armbands in the South Pacific? Who wins and loses from "globalization"? Why do people value things? CC: LCC</p></div>

What is development? What is the third world? How was it made? What problems does it face and how is it changing? What are the causes of failure in development / aid programs? Drawing on a variety of ethnographic materials and case studies, this course discusses the nature of economic and social changes in post colonial societies and underdeveloped areas in the West / North, offers a critical analysis of sustainable development, and introduces the students to the practices, anthropological and otherwise, of planning policy interventions. The course shows how anthropological knowledge and understanding can illuminate "development issues" such as rural poverty, environmental degradation and the globalization of trade. CC: LCC</p></div>

Marginalized peoples who are the traditional subjects of anthropological research are increasingly using human rights rhetoric to advance their own causes or draw attention to their plight. This course will examine philosophical and anthropological discussions of human rights and contemporary debates and controversies surrounding human rights. In particular, we will examine the deployment of truth commissions in the aftermath of political violence, the role of human rights NGOs, contested claims of suffering, and human rights interventions.</p></div>

In this course we will explore globalization from the perspective of anthropology, tracing its consequences both for the world's economic and political systems, and for the everyday lives of people around the globe. Topics will include: cultural dimensions of changing labor practices and systems of production, the role of globalization in cultural homogenization and differentiation, the ways the migrants, refugees, tourists and others forge new supra-national forms of sociality and identity, and the role of media flows and commodity consumption in the production of global identities.

While many people associate contemporary Christianity with Euro-Americans, scholars point to Christian churches dating from the 5th century in North Africa and in India. Scholars argue that the demographic center of Christianity has already shifted to the Global south. This course investigates the ways Christianity has been shaped by contact with different world cultures and the social processes and religious changes implicit in the acculturation of Christianity in diverse geographical regions and cultural contexts. Questions addresses will include: i) how has Christianity been localized in various areas of the world?; ii) what is the appeal to Pentecostalism in the global south? Is it a conservative force directing attention away from social inequalities or does it challenge social inequalities? iii) what kinds of transnational networks are formed by contemporary Christians and how do these shape new kinds of identities?; iv) what is the appeal of apparently patriarchal and conservative forms of Christianity to women, who form the majority of Christians in most areas?

There are well over a billion Muslims in the world who speak countless languages and reside in dozens of nation-states. The immense diversity of Islamic practice and Muslim life is bewildering and defies any simple generalization. However, this diversity need not blind us to the themes that connect Islam and cut across Muslim life around the world. While not an exhaustive survey of Islamic practice and ways of life, this class focuses on the themes that connect Islam across diverse regions and peoples. These themes include: Islamic authority, conceptions of gender, the importance of Islamic law, and the value of Islamic community. In this class, we look beyond local variation to understand Islam as a living tradition. CC: LCC</p></div>

This course examines the influence of media on contemporary society. It focuses on identity formation and the different ways that scholars have approached the relationship between media and our taken-for-granted norms, practices, and beliefs. Readings draw from a wide range of disciplines and intellectual traditions, including cultural studies, critical media theory, critical race studies, feminist studies and communication. However, the fundamental approach is anthropological. Our aim is to understand how everyday media practices relate to larger issues of personal, social and cultural identity. To this end, the class moves back and forth between theory and ethnography so that students develop both a sense of key questions in the field and an idea about how to answer them. CC: LCC</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECO 387 -Seminar in Labor</head><p>Course <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">Units: 1 (Fall; Song)</ref> The objective of this course is to learn how to do empirical research in labor economics using data drawn from the Current Populations Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey of about 50,000 households conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is the primary source of information on the labor force characteristics of the U.S. population. Using the CPS data many economists have written papers on topics such as gender/racial wage discrimination, economic performance of immigrants, labor union, job training, involuntary job loss, computer use, poverty, health insurance, and welfare. Students will write and present an empirical paper using data drawn from the CPS. In order to process the CPS data for their research, students will learn how to write programs in statistical software Stata. This would be an excellent prep course for students interested in writing a senior thesis on any topics in labor economics or applied microeconomics and analyzing large data sets. The main labor economics topics to be covered in this course include compensating wage differentials, human capital, labor mobility, immigration, and labor market discrimination.

(Not Offered this Academic Year) Tragedy is an ancient Greek dramatic art that in its first forms and their later permutations has profoundly shaped the thinking of the western world. Tragedy meditates on the power of the gods, justice and injustice, order and chaos, fate and freedom, and the whole spectrum of human existence. The first great tragic playwright, Aeschylus, affirms the painful, yet hopeful notion that wisdom comes through suffering; but less than two generations later the plays of Euripides offer much more pain than hope, and the wisdom gained from the tragedies of Elizabethan and Jacobean England (e.g., Shakespeare) tends to be extremely bitter. Tragedy in the 19 th and 20 th century gets bleaker still, as writers lose faith in both the existence of traditional heroes and any sort of cosmic justice--the very possibility of reconciling oneself with the world as it is. But, despite this dark vision, modern as well as ancient tragedy can also generate a powerful kind of pleasure in audiences and readers -just one of the many paradoxes built into the genre. This course will attempt to make sense of it all. CC: HUL, HUM Note: This course is open to all students but does not count toward an English major/minor/ID.</p></div>

Actually, the Bible is not a single book, but a complex anthology of many different genres, including history, legend, myth, law, poetry, prophecy, philosophy, and an astonishing variety of religious texts, from passionate prayers to bitter complaints against God, composed over the course of something like a thousand years. In addition to reading the most essential parts of the Old and New Testaments, we will also examine some of the countless ways that the Bible has left an imprint on modern western and American life.

Not only do plays acted on the stage abound in examples of characters switching places or mistaken for each other, they also provide a forum for individual characters to question their relationship with the people and culture that surround them. Even as plays stage the most private of feelings in a public setting, they also suggest that human interactions frequently involve playing a role. Throughout our examination of mix-ups, imposters, and identity crises in plays that range from ancient times to the present day, we will pay attention to both the literary and theatrical conventions of drama and the changing social place of the theater. The syllabus will include works by authors such as Euripides, Christopher Marlowe, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Miller, August Wilson, Yasmina Reza, and David Ives. One of the most important aspects of the course will be the development of your ability to express your insights about the plays we read in your own written work. There will be frequent informal written assignments designed to help you build up to the longer papers. CC: HUL, WAC, HUM Note:</p><p>Introductory courses are open to all students.</p></div>

We will study a generous selection of the major Tales, exploring Chaucer's literary sources, his style, his perspective on his own contemporary culture, and his ideas about the purpose of storytelling. Along the way, we will learn to read some Middle English and grapple with some of the questions Chaucer raises: Who defines the term "great literature," anyway? What does it mean when an author writes in someone else's voice? How do a storyteller's social class and choice of genre determine the story's impact? Should literature challenge political and cultural norms? What are the uses of irony? How should texts treat women? What role does an audience have in defining the meaning of a story?

It was a culture in which role-playing was a necessary and dangerous art, one that led to both paranoia and creativity. In this course we'll explore a wide variety of Renaissance poses and impersonations: portraits and speeches of Queen Elizabeth (as well as recent film treatments of her); sophisticated and scandalous love poetry; the advice given to young ladies and courtiers on how to protect themselves from vicious gossip and dazzle their onlookers; and audacious works of theater.

In this course we will examine how and why the novel of education (otherwise known as the Bildungsroman) evolved in British and Irish fiction over the course of the Victorian period. Why did they begin to appear when they did, and what cultural issues were the writers and their audiences interested in thinking through? How were novels of female education different from those of young men? What contradictions did they lay bare about the structure of British society? We will see that this dynamic literary form allowed the novelist to articulate new social roles and forms of identity in a changing, though highly rule-bound, society.

CC: HUL, HUM EGL 230 -Desire, Incest, Cross-dressing, and Homo-erotica: Identity Politics in the Early American Sentimental Novel Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) (Offered twice every four years) In her seminal study, Revolution and the Word: The Rise of the Novel in America, Cathy N. Davidson states "literature is not simply words upon a page but a complex social, political, and material process of cultural production" (viii). Thus, the eighteenth century sentimental novel serves to highlight a moment in history lodged among judgments, anxieties and controversies about the direction the newly formed American Republic would take at the end of the Revolution. Embedded within these narratives are questions about both men's and women's power and authority in the public and private spheres, the negation of the female self, the social function of romance and courtship, and the nature of women as moral, social, and biologic commodities. This course seeks to explore disjunctions between the sentimental structure of the early American novel and its contradictory attitudes toward liberty and self-expression. Questions that will guide our discussion include: How and why does the seduction plot of earlier novels reinforce American values and ideals distinct from European standards of morality? In what ways does the cult of "true womanhood" prominent during the first few decades of the nineteenth century suppress the plea for women's equality? How are these texts concerned with defining the new nation, its citizens, and boundaries? In what ways do these texts consolidate nationhood through the formation of a national literature and the narrative construction of a national history, culture, and consciousness? Do these novels construct, conserve, or subvert American cultural institutions? Prerequisite(s): EGL 100 or EGL 101 or EGL 102 or a grade of 5 on the AP English Literature or Language test.

This class will focus on the work of two major twentieth century poets, Elizabeth Bishop and Thom Gunn, both of whom combine intelligence, empathy, and technical skill with the exploration of a wide range of experiences, ranging from travel to sexuality to loss. In doing so, they provide the reader with a great deal of pleasure and also raise serious, often challenging questions about the nature of the self. Along with poems and prose by Bishop and Gunn, we will read Irish novelist Colm Toibin's book on the two poets.

In this course we will be studying Irish literary texts from the beginning of the 19th century to the late 20th century, examined alongside a selection of contemporary films. This course will ask you to consider the ways in which cultural concerns of the Irish past continue to haunt the landscape of the present day, paying attention to issues of gender, class, race and sexuality. </p></div>

This is a complex, challenging and experimental novel (900 pages), which uses stream of consciousness as its primary literary mode. Set on just one day, June 16th 1904, it tells the story of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom as we learn of their pasts, presents and hopes for the future. Joyce's novel is a meditation on the lives of these characters, and the modern colonial Dublin they inhabit, however it is also a self-reflective piece of literature which foregrounds issues relating to language, style, and storytelling. In the course, we will successively read all of the chapters of Ulysses, analyzing it through a variety of critical paradigms, including post-colonialism, modernism, and feminism. We will also watch a number of films relating to Joyce and his work, such as Nora, Bloom, and Ulysses, and at the end of the course we will consider the commodification of Joyce as the 'Great Irish Writer' through the yearly Bloomsday celebrations of June 16th in Dublin. Students are encouraged to read Joyce's Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man before the class begins.

The moderns experimented with new, different, and exciting ways of writing that perplexed many readers, yet such changes have come to be seen as important innovations in literary style. In addition to engaging with questions of form and style, the moderns were also interested in subjects that were previously viewed as taboo, questionable, and, as such, often unspeakable. These topics included trauma, the lasting effects of war, sexual experimentation, adultery, insanity, and newly carved out gender and familial roles. Throughout our term together, we will critically consider, discuss, and write about the dynamic between the content of modernist writing and its innovative style and form.

We begin in the 18th century and move quickly to the 20th and 21st. We will examine the ways in which black womanhood is characterized through intersecting categories of race, gender, class, sexuality, and empire. We will explore how selected authors wrestle with stereotypical images of African American women, examine the connections between black womanhood, community, and empire, and discuss the benefits and limitations of the concept of "black women's writing." Possible writers include Frances Harper, Maria Stewart, Anne Spencer, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn Brooks, Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Gloria Naylor, Octavia Butler, and others.

It is one of Sigmund Freud's most significant contributions to literary and cultural theory. By interrogating literary, cultural, and psychoanalytical texts, this course examines the relationship between literature and psychoanalysis; the two have been in close conversation since the early theoretical developments that began to define psychoanalysis. Because literature and psychoanalysis have been intimate bedfellows, throughout our term, we will examine theoretical writings by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and others in conjunction with trans-historical literary and cultural texts, examining specific psychoanalytical concepts including, but not limited to, the uncanny, the unconscious, desire, the primal horde, infantile sexuality, and mourning and melancholia.

We will study both traditional oral epic poetry and literary epic poems and read most of the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey as well as Virgil's Aeneid, Milton's Paradise Lost, Beowulf, and The Song of Roland. The course will emphasize close reading as the basis for getting to know these works and becoming familiar with the language, epithets, similes, and other stylistic conventions that characterize epic. Students will be expected to develop critical skills in several short and longer papers and learn how to write about epic poetry in a clear and articulate way.

This course is a study in the development of autobiography as literary genre from St. Augustine's Confessions to Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. We will focus on autobiography as a space for exploring, expressing, and constructing the self as well as an inquiry into the developing relationship between mind and world. We will also examine the various motives behind writing one's life-story from the existential and religious to the political and historical. Related issues to be discussed include the role of imagination, memory, and language in narrating the self, and the particular impact of minority, marginalized, and forbidden voices. We will also talk about the recent scandals involving fabricated autobiographies. Does an autobiography have to be true? </p></div>

Among other questions, we will ask ourselves: How do class, gender, and race enter into the nexus of social interactions that shape our environment? What is the place of literature in community, literacy, and environmental activism? What are the connections between the ways we speak and write about the environment and our actions toward the environment? How does the wilderness concept affect the ways citizens have access to public spaces? We will consider the concept of "nature" as we move through the course, culminating (if you like) with some nature writing of your own. Attendance for community conversation is required, as are the completion of short papers, reading-aloud performances, quizzes. Engaged interaction with the poetry and with others in the class will be expected and appreciated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EGL 281 -Environmental Psychology and Place Attachment in the American Literary Landscape</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Environmental research psychologist Maria Vittoria Giuliani emphasizes that human-to-place attachments "not only permeate our daily life but very often appear also in the representations, idealizations and expressions of life and affect represented [in] literature." Indeed, many literary works emphasize humanity's basic attachment needs and the importance person-to-place bonds have in the development of the human psyche. American fiction writers frequently employ descriptions of American landscapes as inspiration for character and plot development, and American nature writers often emphasize the way in which wilderness environments may influence one's mental and physical health and emotional well-being. In fact, recent studies in the field of cognitive neuroscience provide empirical evidence to substantiate the theory that exposure to a natural environment may actually generate structural changes in the brain by increasing oxygenation and blood flow that occur in response to neural activity. Hence, this course will employ contemporary studies in place attachment, environmental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to examine the way in which various literary works illustrate the important role environment plays in aiding or obstructing one's ability to think, reason, remember, problem-solve, process information, use language, or be creative.

Things drive economies, incite wars, save lives; things help us communicate, work, play, move, talk, not talk, and so much more. The theory of things derives from humanity's interest in material culture studies and the connections that can be made between people and physical objects. But there is so much more to consider when discussing 'things,' such as those things that are not physical objects-love, hate, desire, thoughts, feelings, moods, pain, concepts, ideas, and words, just to name a few. In this course, students will discuss both material and immaterial 'things' and in particular how 'things' affect people, predominantly marginalized individuals and groups. *Course developed with support from the Byron A.

Unprecedented levels of migration and technological development in the past century, however, have made it impossible to ignore the fact that we are now living in a thoroughly transnational world-a new world order whose contours we yet barely grasp. How do social identity formations shift when nation-state boundaries are challenged? What sorts of new ethical dilemmas and self-other relations are engendered? Is anti-colonialism, staged as it was in the theater of national liberation, de-fanged or enabled by transnationalism? What new aesthetic forms and modes are generated by transnationalism; and how do cosmopolitans, exiles, diasporics, hybrids, and long-distance nationalists affect the field of culture? These are among the questions we will examine over the course of the term through the complementary lenses of film, literature, and theory.

As we analyze films by such directors as Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk, Julie Dash, Trinh T.

Today more than ever, however, the film industry is enmeshed in systems of TV and cable networks, digital technologies, and capital flows, which exceed national boundaries. Over the course of the term, we will investigate the heuristic, political, and affective force of the concept of "national cinema," while at the same time, analyzing the complex formations of identity, citizenship, and ethics, portrayed on screen and constructed through transnational networks of production, exhibition, and distribution. We will play close attention to methods, terminology, and tools needed for the critical analysis of film and will link the analysis of such formal features as editing, mise-en-scene, and sound design to specific historical and cultural distinctions and changes, ranging from the coming of synchronized speech to the digital convergences that shape screen studies today.

Documentary images pervade intimate spheres of our lives through cellphones, youtube, and a variety of other screen interfaces, engendering powerful affective forces driving everything from humanitarian aid to global political agendas. Why this increased interest in the documentary form? Traditionally, the documentary has tended to emerge during crisis situations, often reflecting and commenting on past and present social and political unrest.

Prerequisite Course Units: 1 (Spring; Mitchell) The word "queer" is a complicated term with a long, often fraught history.

This seminar will interrogate queer theory and queer studies as fields of interdisciplinarity. We will pay particular attention to questions of desire, identity, citizenship, bodies, pleasure, and the construction of gender and sex. We will also examine the relationships between queerness and race, class, material conditions, age, able-bodiedness, and community formation.

From Arthur Miller and Lorraine Hansberry to Lin-Manuel Miranda and Matthew Lopez, playwrights have questioned the promises of our (relatively) young nation: the idea that through positivity and hard work, we can all achieve a life of liberty and happiness. Some of the topics explored in these plays include ideals of American exceptionalism, pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps, individualism, and personal identity. Furthermore, we will work to understand how works from diverse writers address crucial interactions between literature, theatrical performance, race, culture, gender, sexuality, and American society today. Plays will be read in pairs, emphasizing differing perspectives on similar themes.

This course will examine the environmental issues related to producing food; it will include food derived through agriculture and from domesticated or wild animals (dairy, beef, chicken, pork, or fish). We will compare production methods in the technologically advanced West with those in more traditional systems, both past and present. We will look at how and why food production was transformed from an energy-harvesting endeavor into an enormous user of fossil fuel. We will look at how and why food production causes environmental problems, such as: loss of soil fertility, reductions in fresh water supplies, and the pollution of groundwater, rivers, and oceans. We will explore whether current methods of food production are sustainable and adequate for a growing population; we will discuss new ideas that could help ensure food production, while also reducing pollution and use of fossil fuel.

The well-being and prosperity of human civilization requires the sound stewardship and sustainable use of our groundwater supplies. In addition to serving as an essential resource for humanity, groundwater plays a central role in many environmental and geologic processes, including the maintenance of river flows between rainfall events, the occurrence of earthquakes, and the genesis of certain types of ore deposits and landforms. Groundwater is also a key consideration in many engineering operations such as the construction of dams and tunnels and the assessment of landslide and land subsidence risk. Groundwater hydrology is a highly interdisciplinary field that brings together the geologic and environmental sciences with engineering. This course will begin by exploring the physical properties of groundwater and the geologic media through which it flows, the physical laws that govern groundwater flow and transport, and techniques for modeling groundwater flow patterns. The mid-part of the course will focus on the engineering aspects of groundwater, covering topics such as the hydraulics of pumping wells, the transport of contaminants within aquifers, the remediation of contaminated aquifers, and well-drilling technology. Later we will cover the role groundwater plays in geologic processes and the role of geology in determining groundwater chemistry and quality. We will also discuss the connections between groundwater and human health and the importance of groundwater in the global food supply.

These characteristics make water one of the most intriguing materials. It is a necessity for life. A paradox involves features or qualities of contradictory nature. Water is notorious with such qualities. Water is one of the cheapest materials yet it is the most precious commodity known to humanity. Water could be the source of peace and development yet it could be a reason for war and conflict. Water could be a force for good to generate hydropower yet unchecked or unregulated this force could be in the form of destructive floods. Water could be a weapon to combat desertification yet too much thereof could cause erosion and failures. Floods come with loads of mud and silt that charge river deltas and keep them fertile yet weaker floods result in lesser deposits that could threaten river deltas with sea attacks. Water has always been a main reason for people to settle the land yet a shortage thereof could force people to migrate and leave their homeland. This course shows the role water played in the past, is presently playing, and will play in the future in defining communities and societies.</p></div>

You now find the word just about everywhere. For more than a few people it has become the defining mission of their generation, an existential challenge that must be met for the survival of humanity. This is a course in thematic global history that explores the concept of sustainability from an historical perspective. Sustainability is not a new thing in human history or just a consequence of our environmentally-challenged present. Sustainability is part of our cultural inheritance with deep roots in the histories of Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Also, sustainability is not simply synonymous with environmentalism or climate change. It has always encompassed social realities like power, trade and commerce, cultural identities, human relationships to science and technology, and much more. Sustainability is a history of the societies we create and the values that define them, for good or ill. Ultimately, the history of sustainability is an opportunity to reflect on the nature of our humanity and the ideals that empower a just future. We will explore sustainability's history through primary texts, analyses of the concept across time and space, the study of sustainability challenges -successes and failures -in past societies, and contemporary realties faced by peoples across the globe, whether in the megacities of China and Latin America or the urban gardens of Detroit and the green housing cooperatives of Berlin.

This thematic course in comparative global history uses an essential foodstuff in human history to weave together societies and peoples across time, space, and geography: grapes, in this case the empire of viticulture (wine-making). There are great stories of human history to be told using wine. Its history is a global environmental history: the spread, retreat, and reintroduction of wine across climate zones and distinctive terroir worldwide. Vineyards also record the natural history of grapes and their evolution, the battles with disease and infestation, the chemical processes of wine-making, the impact of technology, and the biochemical and sensory effects of color, texture, taste, and intoxication. The history of wine is also a history of empire, trade, and power. The Spanish conquest of the Americas brought with it Christianity, expropriation, and viticulture. Today migrant laborers from Mexico and Latin America harvest the grapes that find their way from Washington, Oregon, and California as wine. The commercial history of wine is thus a history of labor and social justice as old as time. Wine also records spiritual and aesthetic journeys through human history. And it is a window into today's existential challenges of sustainability and climate change. This course teaches foundational concepts in global history and introductory research skills through which students have the opportunity to complete a guided research project. CC: LCC</p></div>

Christianity vs Islam? Or is this too simple-minded a way to think about human history? Indeed it is. Simple-minded ideas like the clash of civilizations are not only bad history they betray the need for human understanding in our complex world. This course explores something fundamental to the human experience: the encounters, interactions, and exchanges (for good or bad) of diverse peoples and societies across time and space. We will explore four historic meeting places: Marseille and the south of France in the Classical Greco-Roman Mediterranean; the crossroads of faiths and empires that was earlymodern Jerusalem; the Native American and European middle ground of the Great Lakes and the world of the Voyageurs; the hip, historic, and dynamic scene that is modern multicultural Berlin. This is a thematic course in comparative global history; it also teaches research skills and includes the opportunity for you to develop your own guided research on modern Berlin. CC: LCC HST 209 -Race, Gender, and Nationalism in American Sports Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course examines the development and the history of US sports from the 19th through the 21st centuries with special focus on sports' bond with nationalism, race, and gender. Modern sports cannot escape its association with US emergence in international affairs at the end of the 19th century. Intertwined with the process of establishing national identity were muscular Christian notions about masculine prowess and belief in women's natural physical limitations accompanied by a persistent belief in the fundamental superiority of the white race and its obligation to dominate over "inferior" races and cultures. As surely as sport became associated with American identity, nationalism, gender, and race became integral defining characteristics of sport. This course will be driven primarily by reading and discussion. Lectures will be used to supplement and place the readings in historical perspective, but the focus will be on reading, comprehension, and analysis. Students are encouraged to bring a variety of pre-occupations, pre-conceived ideas, and personal viewpoints to the course; they will be expected to give oral and written expression to their analysis and perspectives.</p></div>

Since 1795, there have been wars, economic expansions and depressions, internal and external political conflicts, and social revolutions; through it all. Union has not just survived but endured, while remaining committed to the progressive ideals of its founding. This course will investigate the history of the modem, living institution that is Union today, that is. the physical realities of the college (grounds, buildings, and landscape) as well as the academic, athletic, and social environments that provide life and meaning for all who have entered its gates. Understanding the history of Union gives students an opportunity to shape the future -as Union and its alumni have shaped the past.</p></div>

In the decades after the famous Norman conquest of 1066, Britain became part of a vast French-speaking Empire. Which peoples and nations would survive, thrive, and achieve supremacy on the island of Britain? This question is examined by analyzing the Scottish wars of independence, the Hundred Years War with France, the great dynastic struggles of the English Wars of the Roses, the notorious reputation of Richard III and the rise of the Tudors, and the triumph of the Stewart kings in Scotland.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HST 262 -The Age of Henry VIII</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Remarkable women and men made history in Britain during the Age of Henry VIII: six wives (Catherine, Anne, Jane, Anne, Catherine and Katherine), faithful and far from saintly servants like Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More, and Thomas Cromwell, and an evangelical boy destined to become Edward VI. This was an age of personal monarchy, patriarchy, and the rule of wealthy elites, but these figures travelled paths and pursued policies that changed the way every person lived. They nurtured and unleashed religious passions that divided generations and whole peoples from one another, and hundreds -eventually thousands -died at the hands of those who believed they had a monopoly on spiritual truth. This course analyzes the imperial ambitions of Henry VIII and Edward VI in Britain and Ireland, the brutal dynastic and religious politics of the period, and the all-out assault on the traditional faith in the Tudor dominions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HST 263 -The Tudor and Stewart Queens</head><p>Course <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">Units: 1 (Winter; Cramsie)</ref> The radical Protestant John Knox published a tract in 1558 denouncing what he called the 'monstrous regiment of women'. He had in mind three women who dominated the political scene: Queen Mary I of England (Henry VIII's Catholic daughter) Marie of Guise (widow and queen regent of the deceased James V of Scotland); and young Mary Queen of Scots, betrothed to the future king of Catholic France. Knox had the spectacularly bad luck to publish his attack on queenship at the moment when Mary I died and her Protestant sister Elizabeth ascended the throne, a queen mighty in defense of her authority and with a temper to match her illustrious father Henry VIII. These women defined British History after 1550. Looking back on these years, Francis Bacon wrote of the 'strange perturbations' of England, having been ruled by a boy king (Edward VI) and two women before finally again seeing on the throne a proper adult male, James VI of Scotland -with nice irony, Mary Queen of Scots' son. This course explores the lives of these Tudor and Stewart queens and analyzes the intersections of gender, authority, and religious zeal that defined their age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HST 264 -The Stuart Wars 1603-1660</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) In 1603, James VI of Scotland became the first king to rule all of Britain and Ireland, when he added Elizabeth I's crown to his own. This was the first in a series of remarkable revolutions examined in this course. James successfully consolidated this new Stuart imperium in England, Wales, and Scotland. The Protestant plantations in Ulster created the origins of the modern-day troubles in Northern Ireland. Settlements in the Americas inaugurated a British Atlantic Empire built on sugar and tobacco, slavery and a British diaspora. James passed to his successor Charles I a dangerous ideology of imperial kingship that asserted the crown's unchallenged authority over all matters spiritual and temporal. When Charles attempted to make good on that ideology in his religiously and ethnically diverse kingdoms, the result was war, wars that eventually cost the king his head. For the first and only time, a British king was tried and executed for committing tyranny, the monarchy abolished, and a republic created. Inspired by the message of radical social justice in the Bible, English men and women demanded freedom and equality in these years. CC: LCC</p></div>

Just 47 years old when he died, Orwell lived through the decades that defined both his England and the 20th century. Too young to fight in the Great War, Orwell became a colonial administrator in Burma before answering the call to write. Orwell's pen interrogated English society, championed social justice, and denounced totalitarian ideologies of the Right and Left. He chronicled the epic history through which his generation lived: British imperialism, the Great Depression, Stalinism and the rise of Fascism, Britain's 'finest hour' in World War II, and the challenges of building a just, peaceful order in a world dominated by two rival superpowers. This course examines the history of England and the first half of the twentieth century through a selection of Orwell's novels, non-fiction books, essays, and reportage combined with standard historical accounts, film, and critical analyses of Orwell's literary record. By the time you complete this course you will have studied the works of an important literary figure and used your critical literary and historical analysis of them to broaden and deepen your understanding of England and the Twentieth Century.

Our "texts" for this course are novels, political cartoons, movies, TV shows and music, along with traditional history books. The course seeks to examine the way that Latin American societies have depicted themselves in the popular media, the way that the United States has viewed and absorbed Latin American culture, and the ways that historians have sought to explain the transformations in various countries by examining popular culture. Since Latin American and Caribbean cultures are so closely linked to the United States, and because an increasing number of U.S. citizens are of Latino descent, this course offers valuable insights into the transformations occurring in US culture.

While social movements have at times erupted into full fledged revolutionary upheavals, more often Latin American struggles have been ongoing, such as factory occupations, land seizures, and demonstrations for gender equality, workers' rights, indigenous autonomy, protection of the environment, and students' rights.

The most powerful foreign influence (political and otherwise) in Latin America has consistently been the US, often with quite negative consequences. In the 21st century relations between the US and Latin America have changed dramatically. China has replaced the US as the most important trading partner for several countries, particularly Brazil, the largest economy of Latin America. In addition, the US is experiencing a demographic transformation with an increasing number of immigrants from Latin America making up the populations of just about every state. The history of the US and Latin American is increasingly a "shared" history. In this course we will look at interconnections, comparisons, and the common links between Latin America and the US in what is now a history of both foreign and domestic relations. CC: LCC </p></div>

It has been the crucible of social and cultural politics in India. It is the epitome of modern Indian imagination. The course will examine this state of modernity by doing a focused study on the city of Bombay as a city, society and as the capital of popular culture in India. Some questions the course will examine are: what happens in India when cities-within-cities coincide or collide? How are the categories of caste, class, and ethnicity mapped onto urban bodies and landscapes? What are the political implications of the production of popular culture? How does violence transform the geography of a city and its urban experience? CC: LCC</p></div>

This course will examine that struggle as it has taken place in the United States around the issue of race. How have Americans as a nation chosen to remember events that involved race? How and by whom were these collective memories constructed? In what ways were they contested? How have they changed over time? We will explore these issues focusing on such phenomena as Indian removal, slavery, the Civil War, Jim Crow, Japanese internment and World War II, and the Civil Rights movement, examining depictions in public history and popular cultural forms, including memorials, museums, battlefields, literature, and film.

Collective memories of wars in particular work to inform ongoing debates about national identity. This course examines the ways that Americans have remembered their nation's wars. How were these collective memories constructed and in what ways were they contested? What do they reveal about social. political, and economic tensions? To what ends were these collective memories mobilized? How have they changed over time, and how do we as historians understand those changes? In this class we will explore traditional expressions of war memories such as monuments, memorials, and battlefields as well as cultural expressions of these memories in art, literature, and film. </p></div>

When we think of discovery in the early modern period, what comes to mind are often images of intrepid explorers pushing the boundaries of geography and scientific knowledge, merchants eager to tap the exotic wealth of 'the East', or religious fanatics bent on the conquest of bodies and souls in the Americas. Yet for the peoples of Britain and Ireland, their own islands were an undiscovered country in 1500. Only a tiny number of people could claim to have seen some or all of the country outside their own valley or village. By contrast, travel and tourism were commonplace in Britain and Ireland by 1800. What was the experience like for those British and Irish men and women who explored the undiscovered country at home in the three hundred years between? What did they have to say about the people and places they encountered? How did their works "construct" their fellow inhabitants? In this seminar you will learn methods of inquiry that can be applied to answer such questions, conduct original research using early-printed books and manuscript travel narratives, and complete a research paper of your findings.</p></div>

We will ask controversial questions such as: What is justice? Can we achieve democracy without eliminating poverty? What are the qualities of a good leader? Should we even have leaders? Can women be philosopher-kings? How does class struggle affect the participation of citizens? What are the qualities of a "good" citizen? These questions have been debated for over 2500 years. The debate continues in this course as we learn what the major thinkers said about these issues. CC: SOCS in Africa; inter and intra-state wars on the continent and their impact; the challenges of economic development and securing prosperity for Africa; and gender and politics, religion and politics, and the politics of terrorism in Africa.</p></div>

Issues pertaining to the rise of nations; theories of ethnic mobilization; the attempt to build general, cross-national explanations; and current efforts to solve ethnic conflict. CC: LCC</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 243 -Latin American Politics</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Spring; Seri) This course offers a working knowledge of Latin America's current politics, trends, and challenges. Years after democratization, regular elections are in place, and support for democracy in the region seems widespread. Still, as local traditions infuse the principles of liberal democracy, politics in Latin America reveal unique traits. Exploring the political as an interpretive endeavor, the course's readings, assignments, and class discussions will help to identify key political institutions, traditions, and cleavages, as well as forms of agency and leadership, both in specific countries and at the regional level. CC: LCC</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 245 -Populisms in Latin America &amp; Beyond</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Leadership and politics in Latin America are often characterized as populist, but there is widespread disagreement as to what populism is. Claimed by no one, most of the time populism is blamed, disapprovingly, upon leaders and movements connoting demagoguery, manipulative appeals to people's emotions and disregard for formal institutions and rules. Interestingly, a similar characterization of populism has recently entered politics in countries such as France or the U.S. With a main focus on Latin America, extending the discussion outside the region, this course scrutinizes three different "populist moments," from the first half of the 20th century to the present. Major figures such as Peron or Vargas; neoliberal reformers from the 1990s, from Fujimori to Menem, and recent Latin American leaders, from Chávez, to Fernandez de Kirchner, plus a few salient cases from outside the region (e.g. Trump, Le Pen) will be examined in the class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 246 -Asian Development: Industrialization Beyond the West</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Spring; Dallas) How did some Asian countries become the first non-Western countries to achieve high-income status, near elimination of poverty, a highly educated and healthy population, leading edge technology and in some cases robust democracies and even admirably equal distributions of wealth? And how did they come to compete with the West, often on terms set by Western countries, despite the West's much earlier industrialization, and the vast geographic and cultural distances? Are answers to be found in politics and institutions? Culture? Resources and demography? Historical effects of imperialism? Regionalism? After a brief comparison of pre-modern China and Europe, the course focuses on the 'miracle' of Japanese industrialization from the late 19th to early 20th century, as well as Japan's combination of industrialization and militarization on the road to World War Two. This is followed by post-World War Two Japan and the four Asian Tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore), before focusing on the return of China since the 1980s, and Southeast Asia within the Asian region. This is a reading intensive course, though no background in Asia, political science or economics is required</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 247 -Human (In)Security in a Comparative Perspective</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) With a focus on "the daily lives of ordinary people", the recent tradition of Human Security redefines safety as "freedom from fear and freedom from want." At the interface of security, development, and Human Rights grounding democratization, Human Security adopts the perspective of the common citizen, calling for collaboration between states and international and grassroots organizations to prevent and eliminate obstacles undermining people's autonomy, rights, and development. This course aims, first, to provide students with a solid conceptual and applied knowledge of Human Security. Second, by learning about the deep-seated conditions that hinder people's safety from fear and from want, students will gain a thicker perspective on the structural challenges for peace and democracy around the world through the eyes of the people on the ground.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 341 -Genocide</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Fall; Lobe) Genocide is humanity's greatest and most enduring scourge. After the horrific Holocaust, the world's leaders cried out, "Never Again." Sadly, genocide has occurred, again and again, wherein mass murders, ethnic cleansing, mass rape and pillaging, has taken place in countless places and times since World War II. This course examines examples, causes and motives, position of the perpetrators, victims and bystanders. We shall also look at proposals for avoiding or preventing genocide, perhaps through some form of international humanitarian intervention, or "responsibility to protect."</p></div>

With the format of a research seminar, this course will explore five thematic clusters. Social indicators on rights and inequality, political identities and citizenship, political and legal institutions, life and economic growth after Neoliberalism, and public safety, crime, and state violence. A preoccupation with some of the most urgent challenges faced by democratization in the region will also lead us to assess actual and potential alternatives. CC: LCC</p></div>

Empirically, we will investigate the varied paths women's rights have taken in different national settings while examining similarities and differences in the degree to which women wield social, economic, and political power in their respective countries. We will seek theoretical explanation for women's status in the region, which varies significantly from country to country. Sample topics for discussion include the Koran and women, debates about the veil, honor killings, the impacts of oil, war, and foreign intervention on women's status, and Muslim female prime ministers and presidents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 346 -Technologies in Society: Power, Politics and Economy across Industrial Revolutions</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Winter; Dallas) With the advent of the internet, robotics, Big Data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, we are already well into a Third (some say 'Fourth') Industrial Revolution. If history is any guide, this industrial revolution is transforming society, politics and culture in ways both overt and subtle. Further, as it diffuses, it will not be replicated identically across time and space. This course compares the first, second and third industrial revolutions -selectively focusing on the advent of factories/machines, mass production and information technologies, respectively. For each revolution, the course asks three questions 1) how value is created, 2) who controls and benefits from the new modes of production and consumption, and 3) how it transforms and is transformed by its social and political contexts. Second, it explores variation across different national political economies, most prominently in the advanced countries of England, the US, Europe and Japan, with selective comparisons to other developing countries, including China today.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 251 -American Foreign Policy</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Winter; Lobe) This course will provide an overview of the history of US Foreign Policy from the Cold War to the post-Cold War era. The course focuses on major policy options, issues in the Middle East, reset to Asia, and the choices between multilateralism and hegemonic dominance. The course emphasizes policy-making, especially the role of the President and Executive, in struggles with Congress, and the role of various NGO's, think tanks, and other lobbyists in the formation of foreign policy outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 252 -Global Value Chains</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course examines the intertwining of power, politics and markets that undergird the production and consumption of everyday consumer goods, from coffee to cars to iPhones. It examines the primary countries where these goods are produced, their differing labor regimes, the international agreements regulating them, the transnational corporations which coordinate the chain of production and consumption, how goods are globally traded and the relative winners and losers these linkages create, usually between developing and developed countries. Each product also corresponds with an underlying theoretical topic, such as natural resources and the global commons or heavy industrialization and industrial policy. The course will introduce some basic conceptual building blocks which will help us organize the extraordinary variety of places, production processes, policies and populations engaged in global value chains. But, we will spend most of the course examining one commodity or product at a time, using what we learn along the way to build an increasingly sophisticated understanding of global production and exchange. Finally, for a final project, students will conduct research on their own product of choice and explore a theoretically important concept associated with it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 253 -International Relations of East Asia</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course surveys the main currents of international politics in East Asia since World War Two, with an emphasis on events since the end of the cold war. It considers the sequential rise of the economies of Japan, the four East Asian tigers, and finally Southeast Asia and China, and how regional integration across East Asian countries differs from other regions in the world. Furthermore, it examines the foreign policies of the main players in this area, including the important role of the United States, and it explores the evolution of international institutions and norms pertinent to East Asia.

At the simulation, students and faculty from five continents work to propose resolutions addressing regional conflicts, peacekeeping,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 353 -Terrorism and Torture</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course considers the definition(s) and history of terrorism, as well as its causes and manifestations in the contemporary era. Next, strategies for combating terrorism will be explored -with a major focus on the so-called "war on terror" the U.S. has been engaged in since 2001. A particularly controversial aspect of U.S. actions in the past decade has been the use of torture against detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and other locations. The course will therefore consider a broad-ranging literature on torture -from its history, to the conditions under which it is used in the contemporary era, to questions regarding whether or not torture is effective (and for what purpose).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 354 -Human Rights and Immigration</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course explores the tense relation between immigration, nation-states, and human rights. What are the rights of documented/undocumented immigrants? What kind of human rights abuses are these people subjected to? What renders non-citizens so vulnerable to various forms of violence, discrimination, and mistreatment? To what extent can these problems be addressed and remedied by appeals to human rights? In what ways does the contemporary condition of non-citizens reveal the limits, paradoxes, and promises of human rights? In this upper level political science course, we will address these challenging, intriguing, and somewhat disconcerting questions through an interdisciplinary inquiry. CC: SOCS</p></div>

Examines the historical roots of US defense policy with a focus on the impact of isolationism, exceptionalism, and the Cold War on those policies. The policy-making process itself will be examined highlighting the influence of the realist paradigm, as well as the various organizational inputs, which help to shape the policy outcomes. A look at the post-Cold War period with emphasis on the impact of 9/11 and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on changes in US policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 358 -Wealth and Power Among Nations</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Fall; Dallas) An examination of the tensions between developed and developing countries in the global political economy. First, the course traces the genealogy of thinkers on the issues of development, such as Smith, Marx, Keynes, modernization theory and development economics, as a way to understand the enduring debates within the field. Second, it examines historical transformations in the international economy, such as in trade, global finance and economic crises, in order to understand how the structures and opportunities for developing countries have transformed over time. Finally, although there is no focus on any single region of the world, the course touches upon the oil boom in the Middle East in the 1970s, the debt crises in Latin America and Africa in the 1980s, the rise of Japan and the East Asia tigers, the fall of the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries in the 1990s, the new giants of China and India, new forms of post-Fordist production, and the relationship between production and identity.</p></div>

Potential themes include the tension between philosophy and politics, the nature of democracy, the relationship between war and political life, debates concerning how to live a "good life," the political significance of poetry and art, and the body/mind duality. Thinkers and texts that may be covered include Homer, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek poets, Saint Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and the Bible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 231 -Theories of Peace and War</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Fall; Seri) Do aggression and violence arise from individuals or groups, from nations, global forces, or from entire civilizations? Is warfare an eliminable pathology or just part of the human condition? Any answer to these questions ultimately involves ontological claims on how things are, key in shaping the ways in which we imagine and inhabit our world. This course revisits arguments on peace, war, and violence central in the tradition of Western political thought. By exploring works of classical, modern, and contemporary political thinkers, contextualized in reference to key cases, we will identify and critically assess contentious explanations and philosophical justifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 232 -Violence and Politics</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) What is the relationship between violence and politics? Is politics a continuation of violent struggle through other means? Or is there a fundamental difference between the two? What is the relationship between legal order and violence? What is the role of violence in resisting different forms oppression? Can the use of violence ever be morally justifiable? If so, when and why? This political theory course aims to inquire into these challenging questions by studying the theoretical debates on the relationship between violence and politics with a special emphasis on questions related to the relationship between legal order, constitution of the state, and the use of violence both in support of, and in opposition to, the existing order. During the course of the term, we will focus on debates surrounding difference forms of violence in embedded in our legal systems, look at examples of resistance movements, assess different arguments made in defense of nonviolent and violent methods of resistance, analyze different conceptions of civil disobedience, and grapple with the question of how representations of violence affect our judgments about its legitimacy and/or justification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 233 -Intellectuals and Politics</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Following the aftermath of World War II, we have seen the emergence of innumerable international and nongovernmental organizations that are specifically devoted to the protection of human rights. And yet, despite all these developments, human rights abuses, in different guises, rage on all over the world, including the developed countries of the West. During the course of the term, rather than covering the usual terrain by focusing on the outrageous and blatant human rights abuses undertaken by dictatorial regimes, we will turn our gaze to our own world and critically engage with the human rights issues that plague Western democracies, especially since the beginning of the "global war on terror" following the 9/ 11 terror attacks. Given how central human rights are to the identity of the democratic West, it is particularly disconcerting to observe increasing number of human rights abuses in countries such as the United States, UK, and various members of the European Union. What can account for this unsettling fact? Are the ongoing human rights abuses a result of an implementation problem bringing to light the inadequacies of the current international human rights regime(s) or are they symptomatic of a deeper problem that goes to the heart of the notion of human rights itself? Do the unprecedented developments in human rights law announce the coming of a new and better world where all people, regardless of their race, gender, and citizenship status will benefit from legal protection or is the idea of expanding human rights to whole humanity a utopian dream that runs the risk of becoming an ideological tool used by the Western powers? In this political theory course, we will address these challenging, intriguing, and somewhat distressing questions through an interdisciplinary inquiry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSC 234 -Women Political Theorists</head><p>Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Where are all the women in the history of political thought? Some thinkers we explore throughout history include Mary Astell, Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Taylor Mill, and Emma Goldman. Their work will prepare us to discuss the political and social thought of three prominent women thinkers of the 20th century: Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Murdoch, and Hannah Arendt. We investigate questions concerning freedom and contingency, responsibility, the nature of self in relation to others, and the limits and scope of ethical action in the work of these theorists. Women political theorists often write novels, short stories, and autobiography/biography (rather than philosophical texts) to explore political and philosophical themes. Consequently, we will be reading novels and autobiography along with political philosophy to think about the relationship between philosophy, politics, and literature. We will also be interested in considering how living their lives as women might have influenced the way these philosophers viewed major political and intellectual issues of the day.</p></div>

The course seeks as well to grasp in an interdisciplinary way immigration's racial, gender, sexual, religious, and other identity locations, as the Spanish nation and its people negotiate--often in paradoxical ways--national and social proximity with demographic realities. The course will analyze miscellaneous printed (newspapers, magazines, literary and economic-political texts) and visual media (digital and not) dealing with the topic of migration in the context of re-settlement, human rights and institutional, cultural, and national beliefs. CC: LCCS SPN 314 -Spain is Different: Current Debates Shaping Spain's Future Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) The slogan "Spain is different" was coined by Francisco Franco's dictatorial regime in the 1960s as part of its campaign to advertise Spain to its northern neighbors as an exotic tourist destination characterized by sunny beaches, siestas, flamenco, and bullfights. Today, many Spaniards use the phrase colloquially, not to celebrate their country's uniqueness, but rather to comment on its perceived backwardness in comparison to other industrialized countries. The evolving meaning of this slogan epitomizes Spain's sometimes contradictory efforts to maintain local traditions and values while aligning with broader European and global identities. These opposing forces of change and tradition are at the root of many of the economic, social, and cultural issues dividing public opinion in Spain today. In this course we will examine a few of the current debates around workers', women's, and animal rights through discussion of literature, cinema, and the media.

Can we really know the Truth about anything? For that matter, how important is it for us to know the Truth? Skeptical thinkers have appeared in all times and cultures. We will engage with three venerable texts: the Zhuangzi from ancient China, Nagarjuna's writings on the Middle Way from ancient India, and the Outlines of Skepticism by Sextus Empiricus from ancient Greece. Our goal is to put these authors into dialogue and then join in that dialogue. CCPreparation for biweekly talks by visiting philosophers and development of writing skills. This course extends over two terms. Only one course credit is given. Required of philosophy and interdepartmental majors. During the first term, students sign up for 408; during the second, for 418. Both 408 and 418 may be taken during any year. Because 408 carries no credit, students should register for it in conjunction with three other full-credit courses.

CC: LCCS, HUL SPN 350 -Visions and Voices: Chicana Icons from Myth to Matter Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) La Virgen de Guadalupe, La Malinche, and Frida Kahlo surround us on a daily basis. We see them in our dreams and in ourselves; they are repeatedly embodied in contemporary life and art. In this course we will discuss the historical significance of these three figures in dialogue with feminist reappropriations of their iconic value in contemporary literature, art, and culture. We will examine how musicians, visual artists, poets, narrators, and playwrights reclaim the iconic significance of these women and give them new voice and body in order to reposition and redefine the sexual and social identities of contemporary women. Prerequisite(s): SPN 203 or permission of the instructor. CC: LCCS, HUL SPN 351 -Border Identities Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course explores Chicano culture through essays, literature, and films that represent current and historical issues of the Mexican-American border. Readings will provide research and data, while literary texts and films will offer varying interpretations and representation of the border culture that will allow you to consider critically the complexities of 20th and 21st century issues that include immigration, working conditions, socio-economic status, the role of women, and identity. The course should also help you improve your proficiency in Spanish at all levels: building vocabulary, speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Prerequisite(s): SPN 203 or any other 300-level Spanish course. CC: LCCS, HUL SPN 352 -Imagining Latino &amp; Latina Identities Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course is an introduction to contemporary US Latino/a literature with a focus on Cuban-Americans, Dominican-Americans, Mexican-Americans/Chicanos, and Puerto Ricans. We will study representative works of various genres (narrative, drama, poetry, and film) within their cultural context. Our exploration of US Latino/a production seeks to reflect on the plurality and diversity of (self-) representation and the various ways in which Latin@ authors and artists imagine and construct their identities and communities in the United States. In addition to acquainting students with significant works of US Latino/a literature, the course seeks to strengthen reading ability and sharpening writing and critical skills. Class discussions and writing assignments are in Spanish. Prerequisite(s): SPN 203 or permission of the instructor. CC: LCCS, HUL SPN 360 -Spanish Communication: Speaking and Writing in Contemporary Settings Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) The goal of this course is to build oral proficiency in Spanish at advanced levels. Oral communication will be supported by readings and intensive writing in the target language. Acquisition of linguistically and culturally appropriate oral skills will allow students to communicate successfully in academic and professional settings as well as daily life. CC: LCCS, HUM SPN 375 -Dreams, Mirages and Delusions in Peninsular and Latin American Fiction Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) This course examines the complex relationships between author, character, and audience and explores representations of reality through the subconscious, the magical real and the unreal.

		<title level="m">Course Units: 1 (Spring; Henseler) The Spanish Movida was an explosive artistic youth cultural movement that emerged during the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970&apos;s and &apos;80s. Although short-lived, it left a lasting mark on Spanish cultural history because Spanish youth used music, art, photography, fashion, film, fanzines, comics, sculpture, architecture, and design to challenge social norms, question assumptions, open new spaces, and give expression to their vision of a new democratic Spain. How and why did the vibrant Movida come about? Who were the major contributors to this cultural explosion? And what was their lasting legacy? Through the step-by-step development of a research project and studentcentered conversations and workshops, this course engages with the prolific multi-disciplinary expressions of individual artists an d visionaries of the Movida.

It bridges various genres and artistic media (narrative, poetry, drama, film, music) in order to provide a general sense -aesthetic, material and cultural, theoretical and cross-temporal -of different manners in which black diasporic expressions have intervened in the re-creation, transformation, and interrogation of Afro identities in Latin America. As such, this course examines these expressions as locutions that enrich our perceptions of social, cultural, economic, religious, gender, and sexual social orders and identities related to the black experience in the hemisphere. and Ana Lydia Vega Prerequisite(s): SPN 203 or permission of the instructor.

		<title level="a" type="main">Prerequisite(s): Two 300-level courses. CC: LCCS, HUL SPN 405 -Lost and Found in Translation Course Units: 1 (Fall; Osuna) This course was created to provide advanced students of Spanish with foundational knowledge of the emergent field of Translation and Interpretation Studies. The course complements the curriculum in Spanish Language and Literatures by (1) building upon the Studies in Contemporary Communications cluster at the 300-level and (2) by honing advanced language skills, broadening cultural knowledge, and sharpening critical thinking skills. The course also makes connections with other fields in the Humanities--mainly Japanese, Classics, Theater, and Philosophy--by forging understandings on how notions of interpretation are enacted in these specific disciplines. Class will be taught in Spanish. CC: WAC, HUM, LCC SPN 406 -Film of the Mexican American Border Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) Through the study of 9 films, students will gain an understanding of cinematic techniques and the ways in which the directors of these films use them to convey differing perspectives of the Mexican-American border, with emphasis on the Mexican side. The films will be presented thematically in reference to the border as the perceived locus of perversion and violence, emigration/immigration, and identity. Readings for the course will come from texts on film, and from book chapters and articles. By the end of the term students will have a better understanding of the history and social dynamics of the Mexican-American border. They will also better understand how to &quot;read&quot; film through different theoretical approaches. They will also be able to discuss and write analytically about what a director does and why. CC: LCCS, HUM SPN 407 -Cultures in Contact (and Conflict) in Contemporary Spain Course Units: 1 (Not Offered this Academic Year) What does it mean to be a national of a country? And who is included in that definition? By analyzing the specific case of Spain, in this course we will discover that the answers to these questions are complex and multiple. We will study literature, film, music, and television shows from three culturally and linguistically distinct regions of Spain: Galicia, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. In our analyses of these works we will discuss the key components of national identity, including language, traditions, geography, historical memory, political repression and violence, and gender. In the final unit we will explore how immigration and Spain&apos;s relationship to the European Union are challenging traditional definitions of the nation</title>
