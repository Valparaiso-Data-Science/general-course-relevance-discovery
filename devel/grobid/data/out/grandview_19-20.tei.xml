<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lutheran Higher Education</head><p>Grand View University is one of the 26 institutions of higher education that are sponsored by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</p><p>Because Grand View is rooted in a robust theological tradition, we intentionally pursue conversation about big questions from the full array of religious and secular academic traditions. In so doing, we invite vocational discernment and encourage religious literacy. We press our graduates to push beyond careerism toward meaningful work and active participation in community. Students with a secular selfunderstanding will grow in their commitment to ethical perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facilities</head><p>The modern 60-acre Grand View campus resides northeast of downtown Des Moines. The campus consists of nine state-of-the-art academic, athletic and administrative buildings along with six residence halls comprised of traditional dorms, suite-style units and apartments. The campus is split by East 14th Street and is connected by an enclosed pedestrian bridge.</p><p>Grand View's location in Des Moines, the capital city of Iowa, offers many advantages to students, especially internship opportunities with premier businesses and state, municipal and social service agencies. Des Moines has the world-class amenities, career options, shopping and entertainment of a large city without the hassles, congestion, pollution and logistical challenges. Des Moines continually receives top rankings for livability, including being ranked #3 Most Affordable Place to Live in the U.S. (U.S. <ref type="bibr">News &amp; World Report, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community Partnerships</head><p>In addition to academic opportunities, Grand View's location in Des Moines offers students a plethora of experiences outside the classroom. Grand View's core education model is constructed so all students have civic engagement projects during their time on campus. Co-curricular and extracurricular partnerships play an especially significant role in preparing students to be dynamic, culturally responsive leaders.</p><p>In September 2017, Grand View launched the Views Forward Project, an innovative partnership with stakeholders from the four neighborhoods surrounding campus. The mission of the Views Forward Project is to provide hope to Grand View's neighbors through genuine, manageable, and sustainable partnerships involving our staff, faculty and students. The Views Forward Project was created through a thorough stakeholder engagement process and is informed by a twentyfive person Neighborhood Advisory Committee.</p><p>Since its formation, the Views Forward Project has:  Launched the Viking Ticket Program, which provides free tickets to regular season sporting events, theater and music shows, and cultural events for all of our neighbors.  Built a home in the Grand View neighborhood through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity  Launched a food rescue program that donates unused food from dining and catering services to local churches to feed at-risk children.  Established the Grand View Community Garden, which is providing garden plots to fifteen community members so they can grow fresh fruit and vegetables.</p><p> Raised $15,000 to restore the playground at a local child care center.</p><p>Submit ACT or SAT scores. At the time of the test, students should request that a record of their scores be sent to Grand View University. Our ACT code is 1316; our SAT code is 6251.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Application Procedure</head><p>Transfer students are those who have attended a college or university after they have graduated high school. A student whose only post-high school college enrollment was in the summer following graduation will be considered a first year student.</p><p>Complete an application for admission. Applications can be completed on-line at www.grandview.edu/admissions/transfer/checkli st Request that official transcripts from all colleges or universities previously attended be sent to the Admissions Office. Transcripts must be sent regardless of whether credit was earned. Students who are applying for undergraduate education endorsements only who have received a baccalaureate degree from another accredited institution, need only submit the transcript for the institution where they received their teaching degree. Failure to submit all previous transcripts will be considered sufficient cause for denial or cancellation of admission. If you have served in the military, request your military transcripts.</p><p>Students who have completed fewer than 24 semester hours of college course work before applying to Grand View must provide official ACT or SAT test scores and an official high school transcript or official GED scores.</p><p>Transfer students who have earned 24 credits or more must certify on their application for admission or through a signed written statement that they have graduated from an accredited high school.</p><p>To receive credit for coursework completed outside of the United States of America (U.S.A.), the student must have the transcript evaluated by a transcript evaluation agency in the U.S.A., at the student's expense. The evaluation must be completed on a course-bycourse level. Evaluation by a transcript evaluation agency provides a guide for evaluating international course work; however, Grand View University retains the right to determine transferability of courses and degrees. Students may need to provide Grand View with additional information about coursework, if requested. To receive transfer credit for English composition, international students must take an equivalent course from an accredited institution in the United States or pass the Grand View Composition requirement. In some cases, transfer credit can be granted if the course work is transcripted by a college or university in the U.S.A. that sponsored the study abroad or semester at sea experience, but this situation will be evaluated on a case-bycase basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Application Procedure</head><p>In addition to either the freshman or transfer application procedures, international students must complete the following:</p><p>To receive credit for coursework completed outside the United States of America (U.S.A.), the student must have the transcript evaluated by a transcript evaluation agency in the U.S.A., at the student's expense. The evaluation must be completed on a course-by-course level. Evaluation by a transcript evaluation agency provides a guide for evaluating international course work; however, Grand View University retains the right to determine transferability of courses and degrees. Students may need to provide Grand View with additional information about coursework, if requested. In some cases, transfer credit can be granted if the course work is transcripted by a college or university in the U.S.A. that sponsored the study abroad or semester at sea experience, but this situation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Official SAT or ACT scores are not required for international students to be considered for admission to Grand View University. However, scores may be necessary to be considered for certain academic scholarships or in determining athletic eligibility. Please consult with the athletic coach or international admissions counselor with regard to these requirements. For SAT reporting purposes our code is 6251 and the website is www.sat.org. For ACT reporting purposes our code is 1316 and the website is www.act.org.</p><p>Official TOEFL, IELTS, or iTEP scores will be required if your native language is not English. Required minimum score ranges for overall and subtests for TEOFL paper exams are 500 -550 and internet-based exams are 60 -79. For IELTS, we accept minimum scores between 5.0 and 5.5, and for iTEP the minimum score range is 3.4 to a 3.9. For TOEFL reporting purposes our code is 6251.</p><p>Demonstrate on the Official Certification of Finances form that you have adequate financial resources to cover the estimated annual expense budget. This form will be given to the student by the international admissions counselor. Current bank statements must also be submitted along with the financial form.</p><p>Applicants transferring from a U.S. college or university must submit a copy of their current I-20 and a Transfer Release Form.</p><p>To receive transfer credit for English composition, international students must take an equivalent course from an accredited institution in the United States or pass the Grand View Composition requirement.</p><p>Grand View University must receive all of the documentation items before an international student is considered for admission. The deadline for receipt of documentation for Fall enrollment is June 1 and for Spring enrollment is November 1.</p><p>Once accepted and upon arrival on campus, new international students whose native language is not English will be required to take an English placement exam. Based on English placement exams, an English proficiency assessment may also be required to determine if additional English language support is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer from an Accredited Institution</head><p>Grand View University follows the Transfer Credit Practices published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO). The transfer of credit from one institution to another involves at least three considerations according to AACRAO. Grand View will take into consideration, when evaluating transfer credit, the following:</p><p>The educational quality of the learning experience,</p><p>The comparability of the nature, content, and level of the learning experience, and</p><p>The appropriateness and applicability of the learning experience to the programs offered at Grand View.</p><p>The department chair of the courses being evaluated has the ultimate approval of transferability of the courses. Official transcripts must be submitted from all institutions attended whether coursework was completed or not. Transcripts must be mailed directly from the originating institution to Grand View University.</p><p>Only credits and grade points earned at Grand View will be used to calculate a student's cumulative grade point averages. Credits with grades of D-(D minus) or above that transferred from an accredited institution can be used toward graduation and may be used to meet requirements and prerequisites for specific courses, but not necessarily toward students' majors. Students awarded Latin honors must receive at least 45 credit hours from Grand View from which the grade point average will be calculated. The maximum number of transfer credits accepted from junior/community colleges is 75 semester credits. All transfer coursework is accepted at the course level from the originating institution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer with an Associate in Arts Degree</head><p>The Associate in Arts degree (AA) satisfies the Grand View University General Education Core requirements for the baccalaureate degree except for the composition and quantitative reasoning courses (unless fulfilled by transfer coursework), Core Seminars II and III, and the required number of outcome iterations (number determined by class status on entry to the University; see General Education Core section of the catalog for further details). The student must have graduated from an accredited institution and earned a 2.00 cumulative grade point average on a 4.00 system based on work completed at all institutions attended, and have satisfied Grand View's Quantitative Reasoning and Composition course requirements. Students holding Associate in Arts degrees from accredited institutions based outside the United States are required to satisfy Grand View's Quantitative Reasoning and Composition course requirements.</p><p>The maximum number of transfer credits accepted from junior/community colleges is 75 semester hours. All junior/community college transfer credit is considered lower division credit <ref type="bibr">(100-200 level)</ref>. Developmental courses taken at a community college (below 100 level) will be accepted as prerequisite courses but will not count towards a student's credit total.</p><p>Students holding any other Associate's degree other than an Associate of Arts degree are not exempt from the general degree requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer with a Baccalaureate Degree</head><p>Students holding a baccalaureate degree or higher from an accredited institution based in the United States are considered to have fulfilled all Grand View University General Education Core requirements except for the completion of one iteration of each of the Core outcomes and Core Seminar III. To earn the additional degree, they must complete the following: 30-hour residency requirement, one iteration of each outcome, Core Seminar III, requisite courses for the major, and prerequisites for those courses.</p><p>Students holding baccalaureate degrees from accredited institutions based outside the United States are frequently considered to have fulfilled all General Education Core requirements except English Composition, though Grand View reserves the right to make a determination of comparability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer from Vocational-Technical Schools</head><p>Grand View University, with departmental approval, awards credit in some cases for courses successfully completed in technical and/or vocational programs at institutions of higher education which have the accreditation of their regional association or of a professional accrediting association recognized by the U.S. Office of Education. Grand View may refuse to recognize vocational/technical credit or may accept some or all of the credit. No grades are averaged into the cumulative GPA. A maximum number of 30 vocational/technical transfer credits are accepted. Core courses are accepted on a course-for-course basis only, at the discretion of the Registrar's Office. Other courses receive general elective credit. Students must meet all graduation requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer from a Non-Accredited College</head><p>Grand View University may refuse to recognize credit from an institution that is not accredited by a regional accrediting organization or may accept credit for approved Core and/or major courses successfully passed with a C-(C minus) or above. Credit may be given for courses equivalent to the core courses required of every Grand View graduate.</p><p>Associate of Arts or baccalaureate degrees from an institution which is not regionally accredited will not automatically satisfy the Grand View General Education Core requirements; however, credit may be given for courses equivalent to the core courses required of every Grand View graduate.</p><p>At the discretion of the Registrar's Office and the major department, courses may be counted toward the major. Additional coursework may be considered for elective or vocational-technical credit. These credits count toward hours required for graduation but do not meet any specific degree requirements. The transferability of coursework follows the principles outlined in Transfer from an Accredited Institution.</p><p>No grades from non-accredited institutions are averaged into the cumulative GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission</head><p>Students who have not attended Grand View for two or more consecutive semesters (not including summer) must reapply for admission through the Office of Admissions by completing the online Application for Admission.</p><p>Students who have attended another institution since leaving Grand View are required to submit current official transcripts from those institutions attended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission -Suspended Students</head><p>Students who are returning to Grand View University after an academic suspension must complete the following additional requirements to be considered for readmission:</p><p>Cease course work at Grand View for a minimum of one fall or spring semester.</p><p>Complete college courses from an accredited institution of higher education other than Grand View. Must be able to demonstrate ability to be successful in college level course work.</p><p>Apply for readmission to Grand View University. An Application for Readmission may be obtained at www.admissions.grandview.edu. Submit current official transcripts from all institutions attended since leaving Grand View regardless of whether credit was earned.</p><p>Students must petition the Standards and Progression Committee showing evidence of substantial improvement in their ability to perform college level work. Submit a Petition for Readmission for a Suspended Student form to the Admissions Office. Forms may be obtained from the Admissions Office or online.</p><p>Completion of these tasks is no guarantee for readmittance and each application will be judged on its own merits.</p><p>All requirements for readmission must be completed before the first day of the academic term in which the student wishes to enroll. Students who successfully petition the Standards and Progression Committee for readmission after this deadline will not be allowed to enroll at Grand View University until the following semester or academic session.</p><p>Students who have been suspended for disciplinary reasons may request readmission from the vice president for student affairs after the term of suspension has expired. Additionally, students with a history of disciplinary behaviors that are counter to the effective functioning of the University may be required to petition prior to readmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readmission -Deployed Veterans</head><p>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form.</p><p>If the student is called to active duty before the mid-point of a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses.</p><p>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I symbol (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled. In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur. Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course. Failure to do so will result in the I symbol becoming an F grade.</p><p>A student receiving Veteran's Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office in order to complete the required documents.</p><p>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View. Grand View considers the end date of deployment to be the date listed on the original deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date. After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department.</p><p>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status. Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty.</p><p>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran's education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View.</p><p>A student who wishes to re-enroll at Grand View after deployment should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office. The VA Certifying Official will serve as the main point of contact for the student during the re-enrollment process.</p><p>Grand View University reserves the right to deny admission to anyone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Degree Students</head><p>Students interested in taking courses for academic credit, but who are not seeking a degree are welcome to enroll as non-matriculating students. These students are not eligible for any financial aid through Grand View University, the State of Iowa, or federal entitlement programs. If students decide to become degree seeking, they must complete the admission process meeting all the standards. Students may apply up to 20 credit hours taken as non-degree students toward a degree. Students enrolled at another college and planning to transfer credit back to that institution should verify that the course is equivalent with their college prior to enrolling at Grand View. Nonmatriculating students (other than students in approved programs) will register one week prior to the start of the term for the course.</p><p>Registration will begin for non-degree-seeking students one week prior to the start of the class and will be completed only if there is an available seat in the class. Only 20 credits earned while a nondegree-seeking student may be applied toward a Grand View University degree. Completion of coursework as a non-degree-seeking student does not guarantee admission to a Grand View University degree program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Citizens</head><p>The policy for senior citizen students (persons aged 65 years or over on the first day of the class) is divided into two categories of students: degreeseeking students and students who are not degreeseeking.</p><p>Degree-seeking senior citizen students follow the same policies and processes as any other degreeseeking student including payment of all regular tuition and fees. They are required to meet admission requirements, apply for Federal and State financial aid, and meet with an advisor to register after they have been admitted.</p><p>Senior citizens who are not degree-seeking are eligible to register for undergraduate classes at a discounted rate, equal to the fee assessed for audited courses (see fee schedule published by the Business Office each year) if they plan to earn credit for the course. To audit the course (attend the course without earning credit for it), the student must declare at the time they register that they do not wish to take the course(s) for credit, and they may attend at no charge. This standing cannot be changed at a later time. To receive this benefit, students must submit proof of age and a completed request form at the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Information</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Senior Citizens</head><p>The policy for senior citizen students (persons aged 65 years or over on the first day of the class) is divided into two categories of students: degreeseeking students and students who are not degreeseeking.</p><p>Degree-seeking senior citizen students follow the same policies and processes as any other degreeseeking student including payment of all regular tuition and fees. They are required to meet admission requirements, apply for Federal and State financial aid, and meet with an advisor to register after they have been admitted.</p><p>Senior citizens who are not degree-seeking are eligible to register for undergraduate classes at a discounted rate, equal to the fee assessed for audited courses if they plan to earn credit for the course. Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees. To audit the course (attend the course without earning credit for it), the student must declare at the time they register that they do not wish to take the course(s) for credit, and they may attend at no charge. This standing cannot be changed at a later time. To receive this benefit, students must submit proof of age and a completed request form at the Registrar's Office.</p><p>Registration will begin for non-degree-seeking students one week prior to the start of the class and will be completed only if there is an available seat in the class.

Completion of coursework as a non-degree-seeking student does not guarantee admission to a Grand View University degree program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payments and Refunds</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payment of Student Accounts</head><p>Payment of charges for tuition, fees, room, and board are due by the Friday before the start of class for any term. All other charges (fines, etc.) are due within 10 days of the date assessed. Payments can be made online or at the Business Office and may be made by cash, check, MasterCard, Visa, Discover Card or American Express. A service fee will be applied to all credit card payments made towards student account balances.</p><p>The Employer Reimbursement Plan is available to students who are reimbursed by their employer for the cost of classes. While the students have the ultimate responsibility for payment of tuition, the amount reimbursed by the company can be deferred until 30 days after the end of the term. To defer payment students must:</p><p>Complete and submit the Grand View Tuition Reimbursement Form (available in the Business Office) no later than the tuition due date;</p><p>On or before the tuition due date pay the portion of tuition not covered by the employer reimbursement plan plus a processing fee of $25.00 per semester.</p><p>Additionally, the University offers a variety of payment plan options. For additional information on this payment option, please contact the Business Office.</p><p>Any amount not paid in full by the due date will be assessed a 1.5% per month late charge. The balance shall be due and payable at once, without any additional notice to the students, if the students terminate enrollment at Grand View University or the total due is not paid by the final payment deadline. The student is responsible for all interest, collection costs and attorney fees necessary for the collection of any amount not paid when due. Late fees will continue to be charged in the amount of 1.5% per month. Any past due balance may result in prevention of further enrollment and may also result in cancellation of registration for upcoming classes. Transcripts and diplomas will be held until all financial obligations to the University are satisfied.</p><p>Students who do not pay tuition, fees, room or board, or make arrangements for payment by the published deadline each semester may have their future schedules cancelled and future housing room and board plans terminated. Students will be notified using their Grand View e-mail account concerning outstanding delinquencies and given an opportunity to pay the past due balance or make arrangements for payment with the Business Office prior to cancellation. If the University takes such action, the student will still be responsible for any outstanding balance.</p><p>All returned checks will be charged a $25.00 fee which will be added to the student's account, and no further checks will be accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VA Benefits Penalties</head><p>In compliance with Section 103 of the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018, students using Chapter 31 and Chapter 33 benefits of the G.I. Bill® will not be assessed any penalty due to the delayed disbursement of tuition fund payment by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Students using these benefits will not be required to borrow additional funds to cover the student account balance expected to be paid by the VA or be assessed late fees due to delayed disbursement of tuition fund payment by the VA during the semesters they are using those benefits. Students using those benefits will not be denied access to classes, the library, or other institutional facilities due to delayed disbursement of tuition fund payment by the VA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuition Refunds</head><p>Financial Aid refunds are issued beginning Wednesday of the 2nd week of each term and thereafter are issued weekly within 7 days, but no later than 14 days, from the date the credit balance was created.</p><p>All refund checks will be mailed immediately upon issue to the student's local address, or deposited into a bank account specified by the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropping Classes</head><p>Students have the first five days of each semester (add/drop period) to add and drop classes without financial penalty. The Business Office and Financial Aid Office will establish each student's tuition charges and financial aid based on the student's enrollment after the add/drop period. Any classes dropped after the add/drop period will continue to count toward total billing credits and will not result in an adjustment to tuition charges or financial aid unless students completely withdraw (drop all classes) from the University. Classes added after this date may result in increased tuition charges as the total billing credits charged will include all courses not dropped before or during the add/drop period. Students enrolled in both accelerated sessions within a semester* will have their withdrawal calculations based upon complete attendance in the semester and not in the individual accelerated sessions. Please contact the Financial Aid Office or Business Office for more information regarding your withdrawal calculation. *Semester is equivalent to two terms. Fall semester (Term 1 and 2), Spring Semester (Term 3 and 4), Summer (Term 5 and 6). The add/drop period is adjusted for courses that do not last the full length of a semester or session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complete Withdrawal</head><p>Students who are considering withdrawing from Grand View University should first consider all academic options with their advisor. Students should then consult with the Financial Aid and Business Offices to understand the financial implications of a complete withdrawal. Students who then decide to officially withdraw from the University must contact the Registrar's Office if a full-or part-time day student, or the Division of Graduate and Professional Studies staff if an evening/weekend student or graduate student. These offices will assist in completing the official withdrawal/exit form. Students who wish to remain enrolled for a future term must indicate their intention in writing.</p><p>The official withdrawal date will be determined by the date that the student begins the official withdrawal process. This date will be used to determine any adjustments to tuition and financial aid awards. Students who withdraw on or after the first day of the term and before the 60% point in time in the semester will receive a prorated refund in tuition. The amount of the refund is based on the percentage of the semester that has not been completed (the number of calendar days remaining in the semester divided by the number of calendar days in the semester). Financial aid will be refunded to the respective sources (federal, state and institutional) using the same percentage. Stated simply, a student who completely withdraws after completing 20% of the semester will be charged 20% of tuition charges and will retain 20% of the financial aid. Examples of the application of the refund policy are available upon request at the Financial Aid Office. If funds have been released to the student because of a credit balance on the student's account at Grand View University, then the student may be required to repay some or all of the amount released to the student. This policy is subject to federal regulations. Contact the Financial Aid Office for details and to learn of any changes to this policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Room and Board Refunds</head><p>Written notification of a contract termination must be received by July 1 for the fall semester and by December 1 for the spring semester for new students. Written notification of a contract termination must be received by March 1 for the fall semester for returning students. Housing deposits will be forfeited for all contracts terminated beyond this deadline. Room charges are not refundable after classes begin the first day of the academic year. For students withdrawing from Grand View, board charges are refunded based on the number of full weeks remaining in the semester at the time of withdrawal. Board charges are not refundable beyond 60% of the semester. Please refer to your Housing and Meal contract for additional information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Activity Fee/Technology Fee/Online Course Fee/Parking Fee/Residence Hall Activity Fee Refunds</head><p>Fees are charged to student accounts on a per semester basis. Parking fees are assessed to all students. Technology fees and Student Activity fees are both assessed to full-time students. Resident Activity fees are assessed to students living in any campus housing. Online course fees are charged per credit hour for all online courses. Fees are not refundable after the start of the semester. Please go to www.grandview.edu for an up-to-date listing of tuition and fees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Active Military Service Withdrawal</head><p>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form.</p><p>If the student is called to active duty during a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses.</p><p>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I symbol (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled. In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur. Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course. Failure to do so will result in the I symbol becoming an F grade.</p><p>A student receiving Veteran's Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office in order to complete the required documents.</p><p>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View. Grand View considers the end date of deployment to be the date listed on the original deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date. After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department.</p><p>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status. Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty.</p><p>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran's education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View.</p><p>A student who wishes to re-enroll at Grand View after deployment should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office. The VA Certifying Official will serve as the main point of contact for the student during the re-enrollment process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Aid</head><p>Students who are making plans for enrollment and who believe they will need financial aid should apply for admission to the University. Once the student has been accepted, the financial aid application will be considered and acted upon according to acceptance date, funds available and the following principles and practices:</p><p> The financial aid program and Grand View University provides assistance to students who, without such aid, would be unable to attend Grand View and provides opportunity to reward, encourage, and recognize students' academic achievements.  The primary responsibility for financing a higher education rests upon the students and parents. Financial aid from Grand View and other sources will be viewed only as supplementary to the family contribution.  For financial aid purposes, undergraduate students enrolled in 12 credit hours or more per term in the standard Fall, Spring and/or Summer Semesters as well as the two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer semesters for students enrolled in the Division of Graduate and Professional Studies accelerated classes are considered full-time students. Those students enrolled in less than 12 but at least 6 credit hours per standard semester as well as the two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer semesters are considered half-time.</p><p>The following is a breakdown of enrollment statuses for undergraduate students enrolled in the Fall/Spring, Summer Semester/Trimester and/or two sessions that comprise fall, spring or summer for students enrolled in the Division of Graduate and Professional Studies accelerated classes:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credits per semester</head><p>Enrollment Status 12 or more Full-time 9-11 Three-quarter time 6-8 Half-time 5 and less Less than half-time</p><p>The assessment of financial assistance offered by Grand View University is based on financial need as reported by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and merit based on academic history of the student. Primary considerations for aid is given to students who meet the January 15 priority deadline (must have the FAFSA to processing center by that date).</p><p>Note: to insure that forms are received by the processor by the priority deadline date, complete an on-line FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov by December 30.</p><p>Should questions arise concerning the financial aid application process or the awards you receive, contact the Financial Aid Office at (515) 263-2820 or 1-800-444-6083, ext. 2820.</p><p>The Financial Aid Office is dedicated to providing excellent service.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grand View University Assistance</head><p>Full-time students who are charged the full-time day tuition rate and are degree seeking may be eligible for Grand View University awarded aid. Grand View awarded aid is available to students for a maximum of eight semesters. Transfer students' eligibility will be prorated based on hours transferred to Grand View. Students with greater than 27 transfer credits would be eligible for a maximum of six semesters. Students transferring between 15-27 credits would be eligible for a maximum of seven semesters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work-Study Program</head><p>Grand View University's work program allows eligible students to earn up to the amount shown on the financial aid award at a part-time job on-or offcampus. Awards are based on calculated need as determined by information provided on the FAFSA. Need-based employment is funded by Federal Work-Study. Student workers must complete paperwork in the Career Center prior to beginning work. Employment earnings are paid DIRECTLY to the student for hours worked and DO NOT show as a credit on the tuition bill. Students earning pay through work may choose to apply their paycheck toward their tuition balance. Checks are issued in the Business Office on the 10 th of each month, or students may elect to have their paycheck deposited directly into their bank account. Enrollment forms for Direct Deposit are available in the Business Office.</p><p>Work-Study awards are offered to students as part of their financial aid packages. Employment awards generally range between $500 and $1,500 per year. The typical work-study position pays minimum wage. The work-study award is not a guarantee of employment. Available work-study positions are posted through the Career Center. When you find a position of interest, you will need to contact the campus employer to arrange an interview. You are responsible for establishing a work schedule with your supervisor so that you can earn the total amount of your work award. It is not possible for Grand View University to make up any award that you do not earn. If you choose to decline your work-study award, Grand View will not make up this amount in scholarships or grants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfactory Academic Progress</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standards and Duration of Eligibility for Receiving Financial Aid for Undergraduates</head><p>The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires students to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree in order to receive financial aid. At Grand View University, these standards are established for students who are receiving or applying for financial aid from one or more of the various federal, state, or institutional scholarship, grant, work, or loan programs.</p><p>Grand View's Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for financial aid apply to all students who want to establish or maintain financial aid eligibility. These standards apply to a student's entire academic transcript, including terms for which financial aid was not applied or disbursed.</p><p>The Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards require that students successfully complete a certain percentage of attempted credit hours and maintain a minimum required grade point average as defined by the standards. These are minimum standards that must be attained. Specific aid programs or departments standards may require more than these minimum standards.</p><p>The academic progress of financial aid recipients is monitored a minimum of once each semester/payment period. Students should contact the Financial Aid Office with questions regarding the intent and/or interpretation of these standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completion Rate Requirements and Duration of Eligibility</head><p>Students must successfully complete 67% of their attempted credit hours. Credits for which students receive grades of W or F are counted as credits that are attempted, but not completed. Students who do not earn 67% of their attempted credit hours will be granted one warning period in which to increase their percentage of credit hours earned. Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period will result in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the student has earned 67% of the attempted credit hours.</p><p>Eligibility will terminate when the credit hours required for a specific degree/program are earned or the student has attempted greater than 150% of the credit hours required for a specific degree/program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirements</head><p>Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA. The minimum GPA requirements are as follows: Year 4 More than 89 hours 2.0 GPA Students who do not have the minimum cumulative minimum GPA are granted one warning period in which to raise their cumulative GPA to the minimum. Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period results in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the cumulative GPA meets the minimum standards.</p><p>Courses with a symbol of Incomplete must be completed in the following semester. The Incomplete is not factored into academic progress until the grade is assigned by the faculty member. Incomplete courses that remain after one semester will be assigned a grade of F and factored into academic progress at that time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Warning Periods</head><p>Please note that students will receive a total of one warning period whether they are in violation of one or more Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>Transfer credits that are accepted at Grand View University are counted toward the total attempted credits in determining Duration of Eligibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeated Coursework</head><p>When students repeat a course, the most recent grade received is used in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average. Each time the course is taken the credits for the course will be calculated as part of the attempted and completed credits in a student's completion rate and duration of eligibility.</p><p>In regards to financial aid in relation to the repeating of a course, the following applies:</p><p> A failed course may be repeated as many times as needed until passed  A course that has been successfully completed with a D minus (D-) or above can only be repeated once; financial aid will not pay for a student to repeat a passed course more than once.  This includes even those courses where a higher grade is required for the major (e.g., minimum of C for nursing major courses, etc.)  This does not include courses designated as repeatable (e.g., ensembles, music lessons, communications labs, etc.) as these are not restricted nor limited (unless designated otherwise) and, therefore, a student may repeat these courses as often as needed  If a student finally passes a failed course with a passing grade, he/she may repeat the course one more time to try and achieve a higher grade</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-credit Coursework</head><p>Non-credit coursework is not counted in the minimum credit requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Re-establishing Eligibility</head><p>Students who have lost financial assistance eligibility due to a deficiency in completed hours or a low GPA can regain eligibility by achieving the minimums established in this policy. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office when this has been accomplished in order to request the aid to be reinstated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal Process</head><p>Extenuating circumstances such as the death of a relative, an injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstance that results in a student failing to achieve the minimum completed credit hours and/or GPA requirements will be evaluated by the Financial Aid Academic Progress Committee.</p><p>A student's appeal must include the following:</p><p> A completed Financial Aid Appeal Form found on the Financial Aid website under forms for the current academic year or in the Financial Aid Office.  An Academic Plan must be developed with your advisor.

Students must be enrolled in coursework at Grand View during the term for which they request a consortium agreement. The classes must not be offered at Grand View in the time frame that the students need to graduate or would hinder their progress toward graduation. The approved classes must transfer back to Grand View, and they must meet the students' graduation requirements.

First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities ("Federal and State Authorities") may allow access to student records and PII without student consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal-or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is "principally engaged in the provision of education," such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to student education records and PII without student consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without student consent PII from your education records, and they may track student participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about students that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems.</p><p>Students have the right to challenge the contents of their education records, to have a hearing if the outcome of the challenge is unsatisfactory, and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in their files if they feel the decision of hearing officers is unacceptable.</p><p>Grand View University considers the following categories to be directory information, and, as such, may release it to any or all inquiries in such forms as news releases, directories, or computer address lists: the student's name, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, advisor, major field of study, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees and awards received, honors received (including Dean's and President's Lists), most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, photographic view or electronic images, class level, anticipated date of completion, participation in official recognized activities and sports, and for members of athletic teams, weight and height.</p><p>Students who do not wish this information to be released may prevent such a release by sending a written request to the Registrar's Office. If a student requests that directory information not be released, it will prohibit Grand View University from providing any of the above information except the student's name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program. If students do not want student's name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program released, they should contact the registrar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Permanent Grades</head><p>There are twelve permanent grades that indicate the quality of students' work in a course. Eleven of these indicate successful completion of the course: A (highest), A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, and D-(lowest). The twelfth, F, indicates failure to complete the course successfully.</p><p>Several other symbols may appear on students' transcripts. The symbol P indicates that students have passed a course taken under the pass/fail option. The symbols S and U indicate that students have taken a course under the credit/no credit option (S indicates satisfactory completion, resulting in credit, U indicates unsatisfactory completion, resulting in no credit). The symbol W is entered on the transcript when students withdraw. The symbol Z denotes that the course has been audited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Work</head><p>Students who have made satisfactory progress in a course (achieved passing grades) but are unable to complete course requirements due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control may ask their instructor for an "Incomplete." Students must discuss this option with their instructor, document the circumstances preventing them from completing the course to the instructor's satisfaction, and receive the instructor's approval before the University will recognize such requests. The faculty member, in consultation with the student, will decide the amount of time allowed to complete the course requirements. Students receiving an Incomplete during the Spring Semester or during one of the summer terms must finish all specified course work before the end of the following Fall Semester. Students receiving an incomplete during the Fall Semester must complete all specified course work before the end of the following Spring Semester. This completion period may be extended if special circumstances exist. Requests to extend the completion period beyond one additional semester must be made by the instructor and approved by the college dean. The temporary symbol I is noted on a student's transcript when an incomplete is granted. This symbol is removed from the student's transcript and replaced with the appropriate grade for the course if the requirements are completed within the designated time period. If the requirements are not completed during the designated time period, the I symbol is automatically replaced with a grade of F.</p><p>Students requesting an incomplete must fill out an incomplete request form in consultation with their instructor. When completed the faculty member must submit it to the Registrar's Office no later than the day grades are due for the semester in which the course is taken. The registrar must sign this form to acknowledge its receipt. Students and faculty are encouraged to keep copies of this form as well as copies of all the work required to complete the course until they receive written verification of their final course grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading Policies, Credits, Grade Points, and Grade Point Average</head><p>Academic credit is expressed in semester hours. Grade points are assigned to the students' grades and used to determine the academic standing of the students. The symbols I (incomplete), W (withdraw), Z (audited), S (credit earned), U (no credit earned), and P (pass) do not carry grade point values.</p><p>The grade point average is the total of all grade points divided by the total of all credit hours attempted, with the exception of credit hours passed with the symbols of P, S, and U.</p><p>Grade point averages are recorded on official transcripts to the nearest 0.01 of a point. All decisions affecting students' academic progress that make use of a grade point criterion (e.g. academic probation, academic suspension, and graduation) are made with reference to the nearest 0.01 of a point of the students' GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Good Academic Standing</head><p>Students must achieve the following minimum cumulative grade point averages to remain in Good Academic Standing: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Change</head><p>After an instructor reports a grade at the end of a semester or term, it may be changed only under one of the following circumstances:</p><p>1. An error has been made in computing or reporting the grade. If an error has been made, the student should contact the course instructor immediately. The instructor completes and signs a change of grade form and sends it to the registrar. Upon receipt of the completed form, the registrar will change the student's permanent record.</p><p>2. An unusual set of circumstances necessitates such an action. In these situations, the instructor must provide a written justification with appropriate documentation and receive the approval of the college dean. Upon receipt of the completed grade change form, the registrar will change the student's permanent record.</p><p>It is the student's responsibility to initiate the procedure for a grade change. Grade change forms are available at the Registrar's Office. Students should verify grade changes by going to GV Self Service in myView, or by requesting a copy of their official University transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credit/No Credit</head><p>The credit/no credit option stipulates that no grade will be given other than S (satisfactory completion, resulting in credit) or U (unsatisfactory completion, resulting in no credit). This option is open to encourage students to broaden their education by taking courses outside of their major or minor discipline without jeopardizing their GPA. Credit will be awarded only for work equivalent to a D-(D minus) grade or above; work equivalent to an F will not receive credit.</p><p>Only one course per semester may be so taken. The option must be designated by the student through the Registrar's Office, and cannot be changed after the first 60% of the academic term. A maximum of nine semester hours of credit/no credit work, excluding PACT credit, CLEP examination, test-out examination, Cooperative Education, Internships, Experiential Learning, vo-tech credit may be applied toward graduation.</p><p>The credit/no credit option does not apply to requirements taken at Grand View for a major or minor in a baccalaureate degree, except for internships. Internships that are required for a major or a minor may be taken credit/no credit or for a grade at the discretion of the instructor. The credit/no credit option may not be used for core seminars <ref type="bibr">(LIBA 110,</ref><ref type="bibr">LIBA 300,</ref><ref type="bibr">LIBA 300H,</ref><ref type="bibr">or LIBA 450)</ref> or for courses intending to satisfy the Composition or Quantitative Reasoning core requirements.</p><p>Hours for which an S is earned will not be counted toward eligibility for academic recognition. Hours for which a U is earned will not be computed in total credit hours for graduation. Hours taken credit/no credit will not be computed in the GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/Fail Option</head><p>The pass/fail option stipulates that no grade will be given other than P (passing) or F (failing). Credit will be awarded only for work equivalent to a C grade or above; work equivalent to a D or F grade will receive an F grade.</p><p>Only one course per semester may be so taken. The option must be designated by the student through the Registrar's Office, and cannot be changed after the first 60% of the academic term. A maximum of nine semester hours of pass/fail work, excluding PACT credit, CLEP examination, test-out examination, Cooperative Education, Internships, Experiential Learning, vo-tech credit may be applied toward graduation. Passed hours will not be counted toward eligibility for the Dean's List. Failed hours will be computed in the GPA.</p><p>The pass/fail option does not apply to requirements taken at Grand View for a major or minor in a baccalaureate degree, except for internships. Internships that are required for a major or a minor may be taken pass/fail or for a grade at the discretion of the instructor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mid-term Grade Notification</head><p>Grand View University publishes mid-term grades for semester long classes to alert students to their academic performance in time for them to take corrective measures. Students are encouraged to seek special help from instructors and academic advisors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Grade Reports</head><p>Following the end of each term, final grade reports are available on GV Self Service. Students who need an official copy may request it online or in the Registrar's Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Failed Courses</head><p>Students may repeat any credit course in which a failing grade (F) was received. A student is strongly advised to repeat a failed course as soon as possible. Students will find that this is the most effective way of raising their cumulative grade point average. The grade earned for the most recent enrollment will be used in calculating the cumulative GPA. While all previously earned grades remain on the academic record, they are not counted in GPA calculations. All course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript with an indication that the course was retaken. If the new course is taken at another institution, it is the student's responsibility to request that the registrar remove the earlier grade in calculating the cumulative GPA.</p><p>In regards to financial aid, a failed course may be repeated as many times as needed until passed. However, students should refer to the departmental rules listed with the major requirements, as some departments limit the number of times a course may be repeated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Passed Courses</head><p>If students decide that their mastery of a previously passed course will be improved by retaking the course, they may do so subject to the following conditions:</p><p>1. The grade received for each course retaken will appear on the transcript, and the new grade will be used for computing the cumulative grade point average. However, all course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript, along with a notation that a course was retaken.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>No additional credit toward graduation may be received for retaking a previously passed course.</p><p>3. Fees must be paid for all courses retaken.</p><p>4. Students must properly register to retake a course during registration or pre-registration.</p><p>5. If the earlier course or the retaken course is at another institution, it is the student's responsibility to request that the registrar replace the earlier grade with the new grade.</p><p>6. Students should refer to the departmental rules listed with the major requirements, as some departments limit the number of times a course may be repeated.</p><p>In regards to financial aid, a previously passed course may only be repeated once. This includes even those courses where a higher grade is required for the major (e.g., minimum of C for nursing major courses, etc.). This does not include courses designated as repeatable (e.g. ensembles, music lessons, communication labs, etc.) as these are not restricted nor limited (unless designated otherwise) and, therefore, a student may repeat these courses as often as needed.</p><p>Previously passed courses are those for which any of the following grades have been received: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, P, or S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeatable Courses</head><p>Courses may be repeated for credit if the catalog course description specifies that the course is repeatable. Each instance of a repeatable course will count in the student's cumulative GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Credit Courses</head><p>Courses with a variable credit designation may be taken for a different number of credit hours. Students should consult the course instructor or the department offering the course to determine the number of semester hours for which they may register. A variable credit course cannot be taken again unless it is clearly designated as repeatable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Audited Courses</head><p>Students who desire to enroll in courses but not receive grades for their participation have the opportunity to audit. Audited courses are denoted on student transcripts with the symbol Z. Audited courses are not included in the computation of grade point averages and do not satisfy requirements for a major, minor, the general education core, or any other graduation requirement. Audited courses do not count toward a student's academic course load. Students pay a fee specified in the Financial Information section of the University catalog for each course audited. This option must be chosen when registering for the course and may not be changed during the term in which the course is audited. Students may take the audited course for credit during a later academic term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Veterans Satisfactory Progress</head><p>Students receiving veteran's benefits who do not earn a 2.0 grade point average on all hours for which a grade is given during the probationary semester will be subject to termination of benefits at the end of that semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Eligibility</head><p>Athletes must meet the eligibility requirements of the NAIA and standards of satisfactory progress as outlined above for all students at Grand View.</p><p>Officers of the Viking Council must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.5 and must be doing satisfactory work in all courses at the time of appointment.</p><p>Unless otherwise indicated, current eligibility is determined at the beginning of each semester and remains valid throughout the semester.</p><p>The eligibility of potential representatives of the University, as specified above, will be checked with the provost and vice president for academic affairs prior to announcement of the appointment.</p><p>The standards mentioned under this section are minimum, all-University requirements. Directors of individual programs may set higher standards with the approval of the provost and vice president for academic affairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class Attendance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance Verification</head><p>In order to comply with federal regulations, attendance information for the first week of the term is submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students must be verified as attending class in person before financial aid funds are disbursed or any excess aid is refunded to the student.</p><p>For classes designated as blended or online, attendance is measured by either face-to-face attendance or participation in a course-related academic activity. An academic activity includes student submission of an assignment or exam, or a posting in an online discussion. All other policies for Changes in Registration, Individual Course Withdrawal, and Dropping Classes still follow University policy with the understanding that participating in an academic activity equals attendance.</p><p>After the first week of the term, non-attendance is monitored in the classroom as required by federal regulation <ref type="bibr">(34 CFR 668.22)</ref>.</p><p>Students are responsible for submitting the Change in Registration form to drop any class they are not attending.</p><p>Once a student has attended one class meeting for a semester, the student has committed to maintaining his/her entire registration for the semester, including the charges associated with those decisions. It is the personal responsibility of the student to know the University's registration policies, to follow those policies when adjusting registration, and to verify through their record in myView that requested schedule changes have been made. Registrants who do not attend a single class during the first week of the semester will be administratively dropped from all of their classes for the semester; however, it is the personal responsibility of the student to complete the appropriate admission deferment or withdrawal process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excused Absence Policy</head><p>Student engagement and active participation is critical to a quality learning experience. Students are expected to be in class on time every time unless specifically excused for a valid reason. All university-sponsored events are considered excused absences. Further, individual instructors may specify criteria for additional excused absences. Students will not be penalized for missing class for university-sponsored events when they are a key participant in the event, provided: (a) the student makes prior arrangements with the instructor(s) to make up class work before the absence or when the instructor specifies, and (b) the university-sponsored event is verified. Regardless of the reason for missing class, the essential point is not just being excused from class, but being personally responsible for the learning that was missed. Excused absences do not excuse a student from completing the missed work. Instructors will facilitate the learning process to the best of their ability and time, but students are expected to take primary responsibility for making up missed assignments or exams in a timely manner. The instructor may notify the student's academic advisor, athletic coach, and others when excessive absences occur that put student's success in the course at risk.</p><p>Examples of university-sponsored events include (but are not limited to) athlete participation in team games/matches, mandatory education field experiences, choir tour, attending a professional conference, and participation in the Grand View Undergraduate Research Symposium. Examples of events not addressed by this policy include (but are not limited to) family activities, being a spectator at a team game/match, and athletic practices.</p><p>Students should be aware that there are some courses, for example those with a laboratory or clinical component, where it may not be possible to complete missed work at another time. Students should talk to instructors prior to the start of the term if they expect to miss multiple such experiences, and either make arrangements for alternative work prior to the start of the term or delay taking the course(s) until a term when the student can attend classes regularly.</p></div>

Students will be notified by the University in writing of their probationary status.</p><p>Students on Academic Probation will be limited to a course load of 12 semester hours. It is the students' responsibility to contact their advisors so that their course loads can be adjusted to the 12 hour limit. Students on Academic Probation may lose financial aid and intercollegiate athletic eligibility.</p><p>If students do not earn a 2.00 grade point average for all hours attempted during a probationary semester, their continued enrollment at Grand View University will be subject to review by the Standards and Progression Committee. This review could lead to either Academic Suspension or admission to an additional probationary semester.</p><p>If students do earn a 2.00 grade point average for all hours attempted during a probationary semester, but do not sufficiently improve their cumulative grade point average to be considered in Good Academic Standing, they will be allowed to enroll for another probationary semester.</p><p>Students may be removed from Academic Probation once they attain a sufficient cumulative grade point average to be considered in Good Academic Standing by the Standards and Progression Committee.</p><p>Students placed on Academic Probation may appeal the decision before the Standards and Progression Committee. The appeal process must conclude prior to the end of the first week of the semester or summer term following notification of probationary status.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure for dealing with an incident of academic dishonesty</head><p>Any instance of academic dishonesty requires action involving both the student and the faculty member directly involved and the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report to the Office of the Academic Deans. If the instructor is unsure how to proceed, she/he may consult with the Standards and Progression Subcommittee of the Student Success Leadership Committee at any point in the process.</p><p>The faculty member must also provide the student with a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report. The report form should identify the following series of consequences.</p><p>If it is the student's first incident of academic dishonesty, the instructor can impose a range of sanctions from the following, depending on the nature and degree of seriousness of the incident:</p><p> A warning with opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the assignment with no opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the course.</p><p>The student will receive a letter from the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs about the incident, the University's expectations regarding academic honesty/integrity, and future possible consequences should the student commit another act of academic dishonesty during their enrollment at Grand View. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student's academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar.</p><p>Following a second incident of academic dishonesty, the student minimally will fail the course and be placed on academic dishonesty probation. Upon receiving notification from the instructor of a violation, and determining that it is a second violation, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs must notify the student about the incident. This letter will inform the student of her/his failing grade and placement on probation. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student's academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar.</p><p>When a student is reported for a third incident of academic dishonesty, the student will be suspended from the University and the suspension for academic dishonesty will be noted on the student's transcript. Upon receiving notification from the instructor of a violation, and determining that it is a third violation, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs must notify the student about the incident. This letter will inform the student of her/his suspension. Copies of the letter will be sent to the student's academic advisor, the instructor, and the registrar. Should the student appeal the decision, he/she will be allowed to complete the term during which the appeal is heard; if upheld, the suspension will occur during the regular term following the appeal.</p><p>Students suspended for Academic Dishonesty must follow the same procedures for readmission as those listed for students who have been academically suspended, with the exception that they will not be required to enroll elsewhere during their suspension.</p><p>When a student has returned to Grand View after being suspended for a third violation and is subsequently reported for a fourth incident of academic dishonesty, the student will fail the course and be suspended immediately from the University, and the suspension for academic dishonesty will be noted on the student's transcript. The suspension will remain in force during the appeal process; if the suspension is upheld, the student will be expelled from the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure for Initiating an Appeal</head><p>A student who wishes to appeal a decision regarding academic dishonesty must initiate that process within 14 calendar days of the postmark of the letter from the Provost regarding the incident. The first section of the Academic Appeal Form, which identifies the reason for the appeal must be completed and hand delivered to the Executive Administrative Assistant of the Provost in the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. This form and the complete appeal process can be located on myView &gt; Academics &gt; Registrar's Office &gt; Forms &gt; Academic Dishonesty Appeal Form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dismissal from the Nursing and Education Programs</head><p>Students who are dismissed from the Nursing or Education programs will be removed from their Nursing or Education courses immediately upon notification of the registrar. If this action takes place during the time period in the semester or term when students may withdraw from individual courses, they will receive a W for all Nursing or Education courses in which they are enrolled, unless they have been found guilty of academic dishonesty or other grievous offenses and a penalty of an F grade for a course or series of courses has been sanctioned. If students are dismissed after this time period, they will receive a W for the Nursing or Education courses in which they are earning a grade of D-(D minus) or above and an F for courses in which they are not making satisfactory progress or in which they have been found guilty of academic dishonesty or other grievous offense and such a penalty has been assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Support</head><p>At Grand View University, it is believed that all students benefit from learning support that extends beyond the classroom. Such support deepens and enriches students' understanding of the classes in which they are enrolled. This support is primarily provided in the Academic Learning and Teaching (ALT) Center and is described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematics Lab</head><p>The Math Lab is designed to accommodate the diversity of mathematics learning styles and backgrounds of Grand View students by supplementing the traditional classroom learning environment with individual tutoring. This tutoring is available on a drop-in basis. Math tutors help students make the transition to college mathematics as well as supporting students in advancing levels of math and statistics courses and courses with a quantitative reasoning component. Students may seek assistance on their own or be referred by faculty members or advisors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Writing Center</head><p>The Writing Center is a place to get one-on-one feedback on any type of writing, including research essays and personal statements, at any stage of the writing process <ref type="bibr">(brainstorming, outlining, developing, editing, etc.)</ref>. A Writing Center session is, at its core, a conversation between the tutor and writer to determine how best to represent one's ideas. The Writing Center is a place all writers benefit from, from any major and at any stage in their college career. For example, first year students might bring an assignment from English 100 to brainstorm ideas, whereas senior nursing majors might bring in a research project to discuss organizational strategies and citation format. The Writing Center also supports multilingual students for whom English is not their primary language; tutors can assist multilingual students in understanding the conventions of American essay writing (such as structure, citing, and so on) as well as practice conversation with multilingual students. The Writing Center encourages students to make appointments ahead of time, but walk-ins are also welcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disability Services</head><p>Recognizing and supporting diversity, Grand View University provides services for students with disabilities through the Director of Disability Services. The Director facilitates access to programs, services, and activities that are provided at Grand View while encouraging and empowering students with disabilities to develop self-advocacy. Students with documented disabilities can arrange accommodations through the Director of Disability Services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tutoring</head><p>The ALT Center utilizes peer tutors to provide learning support to students in selected courses. These tutoring services are FREE and available to all Grand View students on a drop-in basis when tutors are available. Coordinated by the Senior Director of Advising and Learning Support, tutors are recruited and selected based on their demonstrated knowledge of a subject area and faculty recommendations. Tutors are then trained to provide learning support to students.</p><p>Other support is available through the ALT Center in areas such as time management, study skills, and test-taking strategies. Assistance with navigating the learning management system (Blackboard) can also be arranged.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communication Communication Department Rules</head><p>Communication majors need a high level of language proficiency, both verbal and written. There is also a need to ensure that all students graduating from Grand View in this department have uniformly attained a certain level of competency in the major. Courses from other colleges may not always contain material equivalent to our courses. Therefore, transfer and cross-enrolled credits must be examined carefully.</p><p>To be certain all students in the major are ready to take departmental courses and to ensure all classes taken at other colleges meet our requirements, certain policies have been developed by the Grand View Communication Department: Students must be in or have passed English 101 before taking any courses in the major. If an English 101 equivalent is taken elsewhere, a competency test may be required of the students with a transfer grade of "C" or lower before they are allowed to take major courses at Grand View.</p><p>A course in the major taken at certain other institutions where courses are not equivalent may not be accepted until the students have passed a competency test of the Grand View courses.</p><p>All Communication majors must pass with at least a "C" 110 and 151 before taking any 300-400 level courses. These restrictions can only be waived by a majority vote of the Communication Department faculty.</p><p>Reporting should be taken by the students' third semester, preferably in the freshman year.</p><p>Students must earn a "C" or above in all classes in their major checklist. In some cases the students have the option of choosing one of two classes on the major checklist. Once that choice has been made, there is no longer an option. The students must receive a "C" or above in that specific class or retake it.</p><p>After the first failed attempt to pass a major course with at least the required "C," the student should immediately retake that course the next term it is available. When taking it a second time, the student is required to complete the entire semester. If the student withdraws from the course with a W symbol during the second attempt, it will count as the second failed attempt to pass the course unless overturned by departmental review.</p><p>After completing any one of the following: 110, 131, 151, 121 and 222, students' records may be reviewed by departmental faculty. Following that review, some students may be required to meet the departmental faculty for a review of their status in the major. After such a review, students may be counseled into another major if the evidence warrants. This generally will occur after the sophomore year, or if transfer students, upon the completion of the courses listed. 100-level classes are taken during the freshman year, 200-level classes are taken during the sophomore year, 300-level classes are taken during the junior year, and 400-level classes are taken during the senior year.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application for Admission to Teacher Education</head><p>After satisfying the pre-education requirements, students make formal application for admission to the Teacher Education Program. Admission is based on the following criteria:</p><p>Overall minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and minimum 3.0 GPA in the pre-education program with a) grades of B or above in <ref type="bibr">ENGL 101,</ref><ref type="bibr">220,</ref><ref type="bibr">or 252;</ref><ref type="bibr">SPCH 103 or 126;</ref><ref type="bibr">EDUC 111,</ref><ref type="bibr">146,</ref><ref type="bibr">243 or 244,</ref><ref type="bibr">280</ref>, plus for the 12 hours of endorsement coursework required for secondary education majors only; and b) a minimum grade of C in all other preeducation courses. The grade of B or above must be earned in designated education major pre-admission and major courses, and students must earn a grade of C or above in all other courses required for the major pre-admission courses, major, and each endorsement. Students who need to raise their grade in the pre-education courses are limited to one repeat attempt per course.</p><p>Satisfactory evaluation of potential as a teacher in the field experience component of EDUC 111 or its equivalent.</p><p>Successful personal interview at the discretion of the Teacher Education Admissions Committee.</p><p>Three prescribed recommendation forms.</p><p>All students must pass an entry exam and meet the requirements as specified by the Teacher Education Program Admissions Committee. These requirements are kept current on the "Teacher Education Community" Blackboard site. Currently, the test is the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators test, which includes mathematics, reading, and writing.</p><p>Students may take the required tests any time before applying to the program. Not passing the required test makes the student ineligible for admission and prevents the student from enrolling in methods and practicum courses.</p><p>Students formally admitted to the baccalaureate program in education are required to successfully complete the curriculum maintaining at least a 2.5 cumulative grade point average and a minimum 3.0 GPA in the major and each endorsement.</p><p>Upon successful completion of a minimum of 124 credits, all other Grand View graduation requirements, and all State of Iowa teacher licensure requirements, students are recommended to the State of Iowa Board of Educational Examiners for licensure in Elementary or Secondary Education or both (Art K-12, Music K-12, or Physical Education K-12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Teaching</head><p>A student teaching experience during the senior year is required for all Elementary, Secondary, Art, Music, and Physical Education majors. The time required is one full semester (16 weeks) of full-time teaching during the day-time hours when schools are in session.</p><p>Formal application for student teaching is made by each student to the Education Department ONE YEAR PRIOR to student teaching. The application and supporting materials (which include a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in major and each endorsement, practica evaluations, faculty evaluations, departmental recommendations, and an interview at the discretion of the department), are evaluated before the student is accepted for student teaching.</p><p>Elementary, Secondary, Art, Music, and Physical Education majors are assigned to student teaching placements appropriate to licensure and endorsement requirements. These placements are made by the field experience coordinator.</p><p>Student teachers follow out-of-school, holiday, and conference schedules of their assigned schools and keep the same hours as their cooperating teachers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Praxis II Requirement</head><p>As of January 1, 2013, the Iowa Board of Education requires that ALL education majors (Elementary, Secondary, and K-12 majors) achieve passing scores on two designated Praxis II testsone pedagogy and one on content of the specific major. Each student must successfully pass the required tests before they are considered to be a "program completer" which leads to a recommendation for a teaching license in most states including the State of Iowa Board of Educational Examiners. A student may be awarded a degree from Grand View upon completion of all graduation requirements, but a recommendation for teacher licensure cannot be made until verification of passing scores for each required Praxis II test has been received. An education graduate may not assume the duties of a teacher or substitute until a teaching license has been issued by the State of Iowa Board of Educational Examiners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer Students</head><p>For those students transferring to Grand View University from other accredited institutions, every effort is made to allow credit for equivalent course work at the other institution(s) toward the preeducation and education requirements. Transfer students normally spend at least one semester at Grand View University before they are eligible for formal admission to the education program. During that semester, they may be required to enroll in EDUC 111 to establish a basis for judging their potential as a teacher. Other requirements may also be specified. Each student is evaluated on an individual basis. Transfer credit is evaluated by the university transcript analyst in conjunction with the chair of the Education Department. Original credits more than 10 years old are not accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Baccalaureate Students Seeking Licensure</head><p>Students already possessing a baccalaureate degree are welcomed into the Education program. The baccalaureate degree normally satisfies university general education core requirements. It will be necessary, however, to take refresher work in specific courses in Education and Education support courses, if the original credits are more than 10 years old, or if no previous Education course work was taken. Normally this is assessed through the transfer evaluation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal Policy</head><p>To appeal decisions regarding admission, progression, or graduation in the education program the student must submit a written letter and schedule a meeting with the Education Department Chair within 14 calendar days after the incident.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfactory Academic Progress</head><p>The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires students to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree in order to receive financial aid. At Grand View University, these standards are established for students who are receiving or applying for financial aid from one or more of the various federal, state or institutional scholarship, grant, work or loan programs.</p><p>Grand View's Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for Financial Aid apply to all students who want to establish or maintain financial aid eligibility. These standards apply to a student's entire academic transcript, including terms for which financial aid was not applied nor disbursed.</p><p>The Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards require that students successfully complete a certain percentage of attempted credit hours and maintain a minimum required grade point average as defined by the standards. These are minimum academic standards that must be attained. Specific aid programs or academic departments may require more than these minimum standards.</p><p>The academic progress of financial aid recipients is monitored each term. Students should contact the Financial Aid Office with questions regarding the intent and/or interpretation of these standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completion Rate Requirements &amp; Duration of Eligibility</head><p>Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the credit hours they attempt. Credits for which students receive grades of W or F are counted as credits that are attempted, but not completed. Students who do not complete 67% of their attempted credit hours will be granted one warning period in which to increase their percentage of credit hours earned. Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period will result in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the student has earned 67% of his or her attempted credit hours. Eligibility will terminate when the credits required for a specific degree/program are earned.</p></div>

Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 minimum cumulative GPA. Students who do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirements will be granted a warning period in which to raise their cumulative GPA to the minimum standard. Failure to achieve this standard at any point following the warning period will result in the loss of financial aid eligibility until the cumulative GPA meets the minimum standard.</p><p>Courses with a symbol of Incomplete must be completed in the following semester. Incomplete courses that remain after one semester will be assigned a grade of F and factored into academic progress at that time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Warning Periods</head><p>Please note that students will receive a total of one warning period whether they are in violation of one or more Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeated Coursework</head><p>When a student repeats a course, the most recent grade received will be used in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average. Each time the course is taken, the credits for the course will be calculated as part of the attempted and completed credits in a student's completion rate and duration of eligibility. A course that has been successfully completed with a grade of C minus (C-) or above can only be repeated once; financial aid will not pay for a student to repeat a passed course more than once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Re-Establishing Eligibility</head><p>A student who has lost financial aid eligibility due to a deficiency in completed hours or GPA can regain eligibility by achieving the minimum standards established in this policy. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office and request that aid be reinstated when this has been accomplished.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appeal Process</head><p>Extenuating circumstances that result in a student failing to achieve the minimum completed credit hours and/or GPA requirements will be evaluated by a Financial Aid Academic Progress Committee.

Bill® will not be assessed any penalty due to the delayed disbursement of tuition fund payment by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Students using these benefits will not be required to borrow additional funds to cover the student account balance expected to be paid by the VA or be assessed late fees due to delayed disbursement of tuition fund payment by the VA during the semesters they are using those benefits. Students using those benefits will not be denied access to classes, the library, or other institutional facilities due to delayed disbursement of tuition fund payment by the VA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropping Classes</head><p>Students have the first 7% of each class to add and drop classes without financial penalty. The Business Office and Financial Aid Office will establish each student's tuition charges and financial aid based on the student's enrollment after the add/drop period. Any classes dropped after the add/drop period will continue to count toward billing credits and will not result in an adjustment to tuition charges or financial aid unless students completely withdraw (drop all classes) from the university. Classes added after this date may result in increased tuition charges as the total billing credits charged will include all courses not dropped before or during the add/drop period.</p><p>The add/drop period is adjusted for courses that do not last the full length of a semester or session.</p></div>

Students who then decide to officially withdraw from the University must contact the Graduate Studies Office. Students who wish to remain enrolled for a future term must indicate their intention in writing.</p><p>The official withdrawal date will be determined by the date that the student begins the official withdrawal process. This date will be used to determine any adjustments to tuition and financial aid awards. Students who withdraw on or after the first day of the term and before the 60% point in time in the semester will receive a prorated refund in tuition. The amount of the refund is based on the percentage of the semester that has not been completed (the number of calendar days remaining in the semester divided by the number of calendar days in the semester). Financial aid will be refunded to the respective sources (federal, state and institutional) using the same percentage. Stated simply, a student who completely withdraws after completing 20% of the semester will be charged 20% of tuition charges and will retain 20% of the financial aid. Examples of the application of the refund policy are available upon request at the Financial Aid Office.</p><p>If funds have been released to the student because of a credit balance on the student's account at Grand View University, then the student may be required to repay some or the entire amount released to the student.

This is not an automatic process; one must apply for graduation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International Students</head><p>The Director of Multicultural and Community Outreach serves as the designated school official (DSO) and as an advisor to non-immigrant students. Non-immigrant students must keep informed of special requirements concerning their residence while in the United States. Please note that you (the F-1 student) are solely responsible for following U.S. immigration laws. These special requirements relate primarily to immigration laws. International students must keep their passport and visa current. International students also are required to report to Grand View University's DSO any change of address within 10 days of the address change. The law provides for rather severe penalties for failing to properly notify the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>The Student Life staff is available to assist with housing, personal adjustment counseling, and other concerns. All international students are required to have health insurance prior to registering for classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Information Registration</head><p>New students may register in advance according to information that will be sent after the acceptance process is completed. In addition, registration is possible on days specified in the University calendar.</p><p>Returning students will pre-register for the following semester according to the schedule distributed by the Registrar's Office each semester.</p><p>The times of registration for Graduate Students are stated in connection with the announcement of course offerings prior to the opening of each session.</p><p>In every instance registration is complete when students have enrolled for a schedule of courses and have completed financial arrangements in the Business Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Load</head><p>Full time graduate load is 9 semester hours. Those enrolled for fewer than 9 hours are considered part-time students. Half time is considered 5 semester hours. Typically a semester is designed to have 7 credit hours. Full-time and part-time standing requirements for other organizations (such as VA educational benefits) may vary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes in Registration</head><p>When necessary, changes in registration may be made. However, students should plan their academic programs carefully so that subsequent changes are kept to a minimum. After the first 7% of each class has passed, a student may only add the class with instructor approval. Specific dates are listed on the course schedule for each term, which may be found by going to myView &gt; Academics &gt; Calendars and Course Schedules &gt; Term Calendars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal from Courses or from the University</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Individual Course Withdrawal</head><p>Students may officially withdraw from an individual course during the first 60% of a semester. If withdrawal occurs after the first 7% of the length of the course, and before the end of the first 60% of the length of the course, the registrar will place the symbol W on a student's transcript. Students who drop individual courses after the first 60% will receive an F (fail) grade for those courses. For academic courses of irregular length, the withdrawal date shall be 60% of the length of the course. If withdrawal occurs after the first 7% of the academic term and before the final withdrawal date, the registrar will place the symbol W on a student's transcript. An F (fail) grade will be recorded for any irregular length course that a student drops after the withdrawal deadline. The specific date for this deadline is listed on the Term Calendar for each term, which is distributed by the Registrar's Office. If students have been found guilty of academic dishonestly and a penalty of an F (fail) grade is assigned, a W cannot be granted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Withdrawal from the University</head><p>Students may withdraw from the University and receive a W for each course if withdrawal occurs before the end of the first 60% of the semester. A failing grade will be recorded for all courses if the University withdrawal is made after the first 60% of the term. Students who withdraw from Grand View's graduate program will need to apply for readmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Active Military Service Withdrawal</head><p>If called to active duty a student (or student who is a spouse/dependent child of a member of the military called to active duty, and who needs to withdraw due to the call-up), should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office to complete a Military Leave of Absence form. Verification of military deployment must be submitted with the completed Military Leave of Absence form.</p><p>If the student is called to active duty during a term, the student may request to withdraw from some or all courses and the University will fully refund their tuition and mandatory fees for the withdrawn courses.</p><p>If the student is called to active duty military service during the term, the student may make arrangements with their instructors to remain enrolled in some or all of their course and will be assigned an I symbol (Incomplete) for each course in which they remain enrolled. In such a case, no adjustment of tuition charges for enrolled courses will occur. Students have until the end of the next academic term following their release from military service to complete the course. Failure to do so will result in the I symbol becoming an F grade.</p><p>A student receiving Veteran's Benefits should notify the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office in order to complete the required documents.</p><p>A student will have one calendar year after the end of their deployment to re-enroll at Grand View. Grand View considers the end date of deployment to be the date listed on the original deployment papers, or more recent paperwork (such as a DD-214) that lists a deployment end date. After one calendar year beyond the deployment end date, the student will need to apply for readmission to Grand View through the Admissions Department.</p><p>A student will be re-enrolled in the same academic program (or the most similar one, if same program does not exist), will carry forward the same number of credits, and same academic status. Grand View University scholarship awards will be preserved for students holding such awards when called to active duty.</p><p>During the first academic year of return, the veteran will be assessed the same tuition and fee charges as were in effect during the academic year he/she left the program (Veterans or other service member education benefits may be taken into account) or up to the amount of tuition and fee charges that other students in the program are assessed for that academic year, if veteran's education benefits, as defined in section 480(c) of the HEA, or other service member education benefits, will pay the amount in excess of the tuition and fee charges assessed for the current academic year in which the student left for Grand View.</p><p>A student who wishes to re-enroll at Grand View after deployment should contact the VA Certifying Official in the Registrar's Office. The VA Certifying Official will serve as the main point of contact for the student during the re-enrollment process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Students are reminded that if withdrawal is</head><p>not official, they will be responsible for tuition charges relating to the course(s) in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer to Other Institutions</head><p>The fact that Grand View University is an accredited member of the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and is accredited at the baccalaureate and master's levels insures a maximum of convenience in the transfer of credits to other educational institutions.</p><p>Students planning to transfer, however, should realize that there is no such thing as automatic transfer. Each institution has its own requirements and standards and is free to apply these restrictions to all applicants. Moreover, many institutions reserve the right to refuse to accept credits in which the student received a low grade.</p><p>For these reasons, students who plan to transfer are strongly urged to plan their programs at Grand View with careful reference to the catalogs of the institutions in which they are interested, or better yet, with a letter or visit to the Registrar of such institutions. In addition, students are urged to maintain as high a grade point average as possible to minimize difficulties associated with low grades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Records Policy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notification to Students on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974</head><p>Grand View University, in full compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, shall make educational records available to students upon request. Likewise, in accordance with the law, individually identifiable educational records will not be released to other than authorized individuals without the written consent of the students. Students have the right to file complaints with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA) in Washington, D.C., concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the Act.</p><p>Student educational records are open to inspection and review by the individual student with certain exceptions which are permitted under the act. Among those items excepted from this policy are confidential letters written prior to January 1, 1975, records held by counselors and other psychological records held on a student, private records in the sole possession of the maker, or financial records of the parents. Students' records are open to other school officials, including teachers within the educational institution or local educational agency who have been determined to have legitimate educational interest, and those others specified in the act.</p><p>As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which student education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such recordsincluding Social Security Number, grades, or other private informationmay be accessed without student consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities ("Federal and State Authorities") may allow access to student records and PII without student consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal-or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is "principally engaged in the provision of education," such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to student education records and PII without student consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without student consent PII from your education records, and they may track student participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about students that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems.</p><p>Students have the right to challenge the contents of their education records, to have a hearing if the outcome of the challenge is unsatisfactory, and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in their files if they feel the decision of hearing officers is unacceptable.</p><p>Grand View University considers the following categories to be directory information, and, as such, may release it to any or all inquiries in such forms as news releases, directories, or computer address lists: the student's name, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, advisor, major field of study, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees and awards received, honors received (including Dean's and President's Lists), most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, photographic view or electronic images, class level, anticipated date of completion, participation in official recognized activities and sports, and for members of athletic teams, weight and height.</p><p>Students who do not wish this information to be released may prevent such a release by sending a written request to the Registrar's Office. If a student requests that directory information not be released, it will prohibit Grand View University from providing any of the above information except the student's name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program. If students do not want student's name, Grand View University e-mail address, information related to participation in sports, and information published in the commencement program released, they should contact the registrar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading and Academic Progress Permanent Grades</head><p>There are nine permanent grades that indicate the quality of students' work in a course. Eight of these indicate successful completion of the course: A (highest), A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, and C-(lowest). The ninth, F, indicates failure to complete the course successfully.</p><p>The symbol W is entered on the transcript when students withdraw. No course in the core or track may be taken pass/fail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incomplete Work</head><p>Students who have made satisfactory progress in a course (achieved passing grades) but are unable to complete course requirements due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control may ask their instructor for an "Incomplete." Students must discuss this option with their instructor, document the circumstances preventing them from completing the course to the instructor's satisfaction, and receive the instructor's approval before the University will recognize such requests. The faculty member, in consultation with the student, will decide the amount of time allowed to complete the course requirements. Students receiving an Incomplete during the Spring Semester or during one of the summer terms must finish all specified course work before the end of the following Fall Semester. Students receiving an incomplete during the Fall Semester must complete all specified course work before the end of the following Spring Semester. This completion period may be extended if special circumstances exist. Requests to extend the completion period beyond one additional semester must be made by the instructor and approved by the academic dean. The temporary symbol I is noted on a student's transcript when an incomplete is granted. This symbol is removed from the student's transcript and replaced with the appropriate grade for the course if the requirements are completed within the designated time period. If the requirements are not completed during the designated time period, the I symbol is automatically replaced with a grade of F.</p><p>Students requesting an incomplete must fill out an incomplete request form in consultation with their instructor. When completed the faculty member must submit it to the Registrar's Office no later than the day grades are due for the semester in which the course is taken. The registrar must sign this form to acknowledge its receipt. Students and faculty are encouraged to keep copies of this form as well as copies of all the work required to complete the course until they receive written verification of their final course grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grading Policies, Credits, Grade Points, and Grade Point Average</head><p>Academic credit is expressed in semester hours. Grade points are assigned to the students' grades and used to determine the academic standing of the students. For graduate courses, the grade point average is the total of all grade points divided by the total of all graduate credit hours attempted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Each credit hour of A: 4 grade points</head><p>Grade point averages are recorded on official transcripts to the nearest 0.01 of a point. All decisions affecting students' academic progress that make use of a grade point criterion (e.g. academic probation, academic suspension, and graduation) are made with reference to the nearest 0.01 of a point of the student's GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Progression</head><p>Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA and may not accumulate more than 2 course grades of C+, C, or C-toward graduation. Students with a cumulative GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation and may be dismissed from the program by the Graduate Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade Change</head><p>After an instructor reports a grade at the end of a semester of term, it may be changed only under one of the following circumstances:</p><p>An error has been made in computing or reporting the grade. If an error has been made, the student should contact the course instructor immediately. The instructor completes and signs a change of grade form and sends it to the Registrar. Upon receipt of the completed form, the Registrar will change the student's permanent record.</p><p>An unusual set of circumstances necessitates such an action. In these situations, the instructor must provide a written justification with appropriate documentation and receive the approval of the Graduate Director. Upon receipt of the completed grade change form, the Registrar will change the student's permanent record.</p><p>It is the student's responsibility to initiate the procedure for a grade change. Grade change forms are available at the Registrar's Office. Students should verify grade changes by checking online, or requesting a copy of their official University transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pass/Fail Option</head><p>The pass/fail option stipulates that no grade will be given other than P (passing) or F (failing). Credit will be awarded only for work equivalent to a C grade or above; work equivalent to an F grade will receive an F grade. The pass/fail option is not available for required courses for degree-seeking graduate students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Grade Reports</head><p>Following the end of each term, final grade reports are available on the University computer system. Students who need an official copy may request it online or in the Office of the Registrar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisites</head><p>Many course descriptions provide a list of prerequisites that provide essential background for successful completion of a class. Prerequisites may include specific courses or may also refer to acceptable class standing, prior academic standing, permission of instructor, departmentally determined competencies or other departmental requirements. Prerequisites must be completed prior to the beginning of the term in which the course with prerequisites is scheduled. It is the responsibility of the student to comply with the prerequisites for a course that they plan to take. Failure to meet the prerequisites can result in cancellation of registration for a course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Failed Courses</head><p>Students may repeat any credit course in which a failing grade (F) was received. A student is strongly advised to repeat a failed course as soon as possible. Students will find that this is the most effective way of raising their cumulative grade point average. The grade earned for the most recent enrollment will be used in calculating the cumulative GPA. While all previously earned grades remain on the academic record, they are not counted in GPA calculations. All course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript with an indication that the course was retaken. If the new course is taken at another institution, it is the student's responsibility to request that the registrar remove the earlier grade in calculating the cumulative GPA.</p><p>In regards to financial aid, a failed course may be repeated as many times as needed until passed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeating Passed Courses</head><p>If students decide that their mastery of a previously passed course will be improved by retaking the course, they may do so subject to the following conditions:</p><p>1. The grade received for each course retaken will appear on the transcript, and the new grade will be used for computing the cumulative grade point average. However, all course titles, credits attempted, and grades earned will be listed on the transcript, along with a notation that a course was retaken.</p><p>2. No additional credit toward graduation may be received for retaking a previously passed course.</p><p>3. Fees must be paid for all courses retaken.</p><p>4. Students must properly register to retake a course during registration or pre-registration.</p><p>5. If the earlier course or the retaken course is at another institution, it is the student's responsibility to request that the registrar replace the earlier grade with the new grade.</p><p>In regards to financial aid, a previously passed course may only be repeated once. This includes even those courses where a higher grade is required for the major (e.g., minimum of C for nursing major courses, etc.). This does not include courses designated as repeatable (e.g. ensembles, music lessons, communication labs, etc.) as these are not restricted nor limited (unless designated otherwise) and, therefore, a student may repeat these courses as often as needed.</p><p>Previously passed courses are those for which any of the following grades have been received: A, B or C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeatable Courses</head><p>Courses may be repeated for credit if the catalog course description specifies that the course is repeatable. Each instance of a repeatable course will count in the student's cumulative GPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Credit Courses</head><p>Courses with a variable credit designation may be taken for a different number of credit hours. Students should consult the course instructor or the department offering the course to determine the number of semester hours for which they may register. A variable credit course cannot be taken again unless it is clearly designated as repeatable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attendance Verification</head><p>In order to comply with federal regulations, attendance information for the first week of the term is submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students must be verified as attending class in person before financial aid funds are disbursed or any excess aid is refunded to the student.</p><p>For classes designated as blended or online, attendance is measured by either face-to-face attendance or participation in a course-related academic activity. An academic activity includes student submission of an assignment or exam, or a posting in an online discussion. All other policies for Changes in Registration, Individual Course Withdrawal, and Dropping Classes still follow University policy with the understanding that participating in an academic activity equals attendance.</p><p>After the first week of the term, non-attendance is monitored in the classroom as required by federal regulation (34 CFR 668.22).</p><p>Students are responsible for submitting the Change in Registration form to drop any class they are not attending.</p><p>Once a student has attended one class meeting for a semester, the student has committed to maintaining his/her entire registration for the semester, including the charges associated with those decisions. It is the personal responsibility of the student to know the University's registration policies, to follow those policies when adjusting registration, and to verify through their record in myView that requested schedule changes have been made. Registrants who do not attend a single class during the first week of the semester will be administratively dropped from all of their classes for the semester; however, it is the personal responsibility of the student to complete the appropriate admission deferment or withdrawal process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Penalties for Grade Point Deficiencies Academic Probation</head><p>Graduate students will be placed on Academic Probation if they fail to attain a 3.0 cumulative grade point average necessary to be in Good Academic Standing. Students will be notified by the University in writing of their probationary status.</p><p>Students on Academic Probation may lose financial aid.</p><p>If students do not earn a 3.0 cumulative grade point average during a probationary semester, their continued enrollment at Grand View University will be subject to review by the Graduate Committee. This review could lead to either Academic Suspension or admission to additional probationary semester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Suspension</head><p>The Graduate Committee places graduate students on Academic Suspension when students do not meet the minimum cumulative grade point average in a probationary semester. If a student's GPA indicates inability to be successful in graduate school, the Graduate Committee may suspend a student after an initial semester of graduate study.</p><p>Graduate students suspended will need to reapply to the Graduate Committee and describe their ability to be successful in graduate school. They must speak to the reasons they were suspended and how they have rectified their situation at the time of re-admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Responsibility/Academic Honesty Policy</head><p>In accordance with the mission statement, Grand View University is dedicated to the development of the whole person and committed to truth, excellence, and ethical values. The University strives to promote an appreciation of the dignity and worth of each individual and open interaction among student, faculty and staff. Personal integrity and academic honesty are essential to building a campus of trust. Thus, honesty in all aspects of the college experience is the responsibility of each student, faculty, and staff member.</p><p>This expectation is reflected in the Grand View University Code of Integrity which states: As a member of the Grand View University community, and in accordance with the mission of the University and its Lutheran identity, I agree to appreciate and respect the dignity and worth of each individual. I will honor and promote a community of open interaction, personal integrity, active and intellectual engagement, and academic honesty with students, faculty and staff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Dishonesty Defined</head><p>Academic dishonesty is any deliberate misrepresentation by a student of the following:</p><p> academic record or status;  ability to perform in any course with regard to writing papers; taking examinations, and/or doing assignments; and  personal efforts and work accomplished toward the fulfillment of course requirements; and  the honest work of a fellow student. That is, any dishonest action performed or statement made with the intention of impeding or discrediting said honest work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Typical Violations</head><p>The following list describes various ways in which the principles of academic honesty/integrity can be violated. Neither the types of violations nor the list of examples are exhaustive.</p><p>Plagiarism: The use of another's ideas, words, or results and presenting them as one's own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to use proper methods of documentation and acknowledgement according to the accepted format for the particular discipline or as required by the faculty in a course. Some common examples are:  Copying word for word from an oral, printed, or electronic source without proper acknowledgement or citation.  Paraphrasing, or presenting in one's own words another person's written words or ideas as if they were one's own, without proper acknowledgement or citation.  Submitting a downloaded or purchased paper or other materials to satisfy a course requirement.  Incorporating into one's own work, graphs, drawings, photographs, diagrams, tables, spreadsheets, computer programs, or other non-text material from other sources without proper citation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cheating:</head><p>The use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids, or other devices in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes submitting papers, research results and analyses, etc. as one's own work when they were, in fact, prepared by others. Some common examples are:</p><p> Receiving research, programming, data collection, or analytical assistance from others or working with another student on an assignment where such help is not permitted.  Copying another student's work or answers on a quiz or examination.  Collaborating with another student(s) when completing any assignment or examination, unless the faculty explicitly states otherwise.  Using or possessing books, notes, calculators, cell phones, or other prohibited devices or materials during a quiz or examination.  Submitting the same work or major portions of a work to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the faculty involved.  Preprogramming a calculator or other electronic device to contain answers, formulas, or other unauthorized information for use during a quiz or examination.  Acquiring a copy of an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination.  Having a substitute take an examination for one.  Having someone else prepare a term paper or other assignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fabrication and Falsification:</head><p>The invention or falsification of sources, citations, data, or results, and recording or reporting them in any academic exercise. Some examples are:</p><p> Altering the record of data or experimental procedures or results.  False citation of the source of information or citing a source that does not exist.  Altering the record of or reporting false information about internship or practicum experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facilitation of Dishonesty:</head><p>Facilitation of dishonesty is knowingly or negligently allowing one's work to be used by another student without prior approval of the instructor or otherwise aiding another in committing violations of academic integrity. A student who facilitates a violation of academic honesty/integrity can be considered as responsible as the student who receives the impermissible assistance, even if the facilitator does not benefit personally from the violations. Some examples are:  Knowingly allowing another student to copy answers on a quiz or examination or assisting others to do so.  Distributing an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination.  Distributing or selling a paper to another student.  Taking an examination for another student.</p><p>Academic Interference: Academic interference is deliberately impeding the academic progress of another student. Some examples are:</p><p> Intentionally destroying or obstructing another student's work.  Altering computer files that contain data, reports, or assignments belonging to another student.  Removing posted or reserve material or otherwise preventing another student's access to it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure for dealing with an incident of academic dishonesty</head><p>Any instance of academic dishonesty requires action involving both the student and the faculty member directly involved and the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report to the Office of the Academic Deans. If the instructor is unsure how to proceed, she/he may consult with the Student Academic Life Committee at any point in the process.</p><p>The faculty member must also provide the student with a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report. The report form should identify the following series of consequences.</p><p>If it is the student's first incident of academic dishonesty, the instructor can impose a range of sanctions from the following, depending on the nature and degree of seriousness of the incident:</p><p> A warning with opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the assignment with no opportunity to rectify the infraction.  A failing grade for the course.</p><p>The student will receive a letter from the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs about the incident, the University's expectations regarding academic honesty/integrity, and future possible consequences should the student commit another act of academic dishonesty during their enrollment at Grand View.

Games are "affective" in the sense that they move us towards actions in how they ask us to interact with them. They offer us information and data in procedural or ludic representations and open up the possibility of choice in relationship to that information. This class explores these relationships by building theoretical models of interaction that can serve as simulations or representations of experiences. In short, we will be making games. This class will not be about making digital games, though. Instead we will focus on refining our foundational knowledge of interactive mechanics and representational systems to make non-digital ludics. If you can't make a game in a non-digital environment, you are not ready to make a digital one. Offered Spring (even).</p></div>
